       Yo.  Kevin here.  Somebody once said that, when doing anything, "start at the beginning.  When you get to the end, stop." That's precisely what I'll do here in my brief bio.  I'l skip over the less important stuff and tell you only what's vital for you to know.  I was born in Connecticut on January 5, in the year 1987.  I take after my father in many ways - he and I both love sci-fi and fantasy stuff and reading.  Classic rock, too.  My mother loves reading as well, and introduced me to Stephen King's works.  Let's see... I've never published anything; I have written quite a bit, though: a couple of short stories, several poems, a dozen or so movie reviews, and a few scenes that ought to be in movies.  I'm also working on writing a movie, a western.  No, you can't be in it.  Been single all my life, been on one date.  The girl was on some sort of drug, I think.  Nobody's that friggin' hyper unless they've downed a whole pot of espresso.  I like cats more than dogs, but I do love dogs quite a bit.  And since I'm starting to talk about my pet preferences, I think it's time I reached the end of my little rant here.  See ya.

       My name is Venny.   That is all you really need to know about me at the present moment. You will most probably learn more about me through the subjects on which I post about; maybe some things in there will give an indication of my integrity - who knows?   I've only ever written one story and that was unfinished. It was a fanfic piece that became a prequel to the Monkey Island games. It's up on  urlLink www.worldofmi.com  if you wish to view it. Just look for the handle "Hi-Jinx" and that would be me.  I plunge myself into the thick of debates whenever I please, it has to hold some interest to me first though of course, I might be tempted to venture into territories unknown when I begin to feel a little more confident with how my writing is developing... I tend to evolve better that way.  I enjoy cooking, walking, going to the gym, swimming, movies, music, drawing and your usual lesser whatevers, but I mostly enjoy reading my own writing.  I am not an egotist at all.  I'm sometimes mistaken for being insane, but we all know that I'm the only truely sane person in this world...  Surely.

       Good morning/afternoon/evening.  My name is David O'Shea.  As the French say, je me presente.  I am, as you will have already noticed, David O'Shea, pianist, accompanist, hopeless choral director, singer, chemist, occasional writer.  I live in a small little country called Ireland, renowned for such dubious things as Guinness, the IRA and Colin Farrell.  That, I shall tell you, is all that one can expect from a country populated by small little men known as leprechans, or to a small amount of Yanks, (Americans, sorry!) "luh-pree-shins".  As for my "writing experience", it consists of a few failed attempts at novels, mediocre short stories, and a musical which will probably never see the light of day.  I can't write about myself.  Thus the reason why I'll be paying someone to be my ghost writer for my autobiography (ha!).    More may come later, if you are (un)lucky.

       So you want to know a bit more about me then?   I suppose I'd better start in the most sensible place - the beginning.  I suppose you can blame it on a power cut in around January of 1979, my parents were bored and...too much information?  Well alright then, I'll chat about my writing "experiences".  I wrote my first poem at the age of 4 and have been writing them ever since.  I'm pleased that not one of my poems have contained the words and phrases "blood", "death" or "Linkin Park is cool".  At the age of 12 I co-founded the school's computer magazine, we named it "Megabyte", as we were incredibly witty people.  "Megabyte" folded after issue 1, possibly due to the fact that the reviews were of games that had been out for five years and that we though placing Monkey-Island based "puns" would pull in the punters.  It didn't.  However, it was a bloody shame, my "Super Tails" cheat went completely undiscovered by the world at large until the Internet came along.   The entire family moved to the north coast of North Wales when I was 16 years old, as well as my online escapades, my sister and I joined the local Youth Club.  Things seemed to go along brilliantly, but soon we tired of our flaming-torch-escort home and decided to start something that would really knock their socks off.  "Buzzin" was born in 1999, and eventually it gobbled up the all the youth clubs in the area like Pacman on a power pill spree, it was wildly successful, achieving a circulation of 3,000, about 1% of the total readership of FHM, and not a naked breast in sight...well...apart from my own, on one drunken night on the computer...but we'll not chat about that, eh?  To cut a very long and boring story short, after "Buzzin" folded (paper was too expensive apparently), I began writing Final Fantasy fanfiction, this eventually lead to me meeting up with our trusty Ed and he offered me a job here, so blame him.  Honestly.   I have other interests, some of which you'll find out about later on, some of which you don't WANT to know about, believe me.  I am currently single, unsurprisingly, but my impressive collection of sock puppets keep me company (see? I told you, you didn't want to know!).   Take care everyone, and  Hwyl Fawr  for now!

       Writing a biography sounds like an incredibly easy thing to do until you sit down and start to write it. What normally follows in my experience is a period of furious typing interspersed with the occasional chuckle as gags are conceived and then finally, satisfied sighs. The next stage is to read through it, followed by a series of winces, gasps and groans which culminate in some feverish tapping of delete and a fresh attempt.  My name is Matt as you may have already gathered. I was born in 1983 and this meant I got to live in, experience and ultimately remember the 80s. This is a truly enviable thing, I assure you.  I grew up in the county of South Yorkshire in Britain, a county associated with Mining, Miners strikes, mine closures and unemployment. There’s also steel production in there somewhere along with interesting accents and a collection of mediocre football teams.  I grew up as was to be expected and went to school followed by college. After that I took a scintillating year off before starting University to study English and History and this brings us more or less to the present.  I could go on about my writing experience but I can't think of a particularly clever way to disguise "I wrote this and that but nothing very good".   As for my interests, I separate them into two areas. One is the 'fad' and the other is the slightly longer-term pursuit. A current fad is exercise and keeping fit along with various other things I won't bother mentioning. Interests that have stood the test of time include playing video games (a habit I continually fail to shake), reading as well as numerous others but I've forgotten them.  Anyway, I feel it's the perfect time to bring this to an abrupt end and I hope you find whatever I end up writing here to be at least reasonably entertaining.

       Hello, and welcome to the launch issue of  The Expert , a new online magazine (e-zine).  I shall spare you my usual buzz words, and get straight to the point.  So, without further ado, let me introduce my team of fellow staff writers (in order of appearance, so to speak):  Firstly, we have Niamh Kelly, alias Bubbles, who, amongst other things, is taking up the posts of reviewer of books, music and films ("movies", to you Americans).  She is from Dublin.  Then we have Jin Kazama316, or "he who must not be named" (he won't go by his real name).  Jin is our videogame reviewer, amongst other things, from Brighton.  Ellis Meredith-Owen, also known as Elmo, is another reviewer of music, games, films, etc., as well as being a bit of a funny man (in more ways than one, it may seem); well, what do you expect from the Welsh?  Don't worry, he knows I'm joking (I hope).  Venny Sheehan is our Mancunian columnist who boldly goes where no-one has gone before (excuse me), and writes on the sort of subjects other people would not touch.  Watch out...I think her column may be rather interesting!  Then we have Matt Barker from Leeds, also known as Seb.  He will be writing on anything, he tells me, as long as it's not sport or music.  Our final staff writer is film (sorry, movie) fanatic, Kevin Murphy from Conneticut, who is all on his own in a magazine full of English and Irish.  Kevin will be writing on films old and new for us.  And being who I am, I forgot to introduce myself.  My name is David O'Shea, I am from Dublin, and I am your editor here at  The Expert .  I generally write on a number of subjects, ranging from what you may call "opinion pieces", to matters of chemistry.  And, of course, you will be able to read my boring blather each issue here in the editorial.  In this issue, we have contributions from Jin, Ellis, Venny, Matt, Kevin, and myself.  If you are a budding writer, then we want you!  If you wish to comment on any article, please do so via the contributions box, which you can find at the end of each article.  Thank you for reading, and I hope that you enjoy  The Expert .

       Yes, it does indeed. I said that for two reasons, firstly, this is the first thing I've written for  The Expert  so it seems logical to call this where it begins. If I instead wrote "It finishes", well that would mean this would be the end and that I wouldn't write anymore, and personally I think that if I stopped after one line I'd be a lazy quitter, and the last thing I am is a quitter. After Optimus Prime was killed by Megatron, did he just quit? No, he came back... FROM THE SUN! That's right, the sun. So if you want to call me a quitter, take it up with Optimus Prime.  Secondly, you may or may not know that the strange kid in Final Fantasy X says that line at the start of the game. The relevance? Well I met the bunch of miscreants known as  The Expert 's writers at a Final Fantasy messageboard. We obviously share a common interest in the series, however, it is far from perfect. The series never appealed to everyone, casual gamers in particular have a difficult time enduring hours of "..." from characters. I would like to take this oppurtunity to tell you how the series could be greatly improved, as I am quite frankly the only person on the Internet... no, the WORLD, qualified to undertake such a life-threatening task.  1. Final Fantasy X-2 was published by EA. You can't really tell unless you look at the box, as there is no EAness (as I like to call it) about the game whatsoever. So I say to you EA, oh publishing giants who threaten the very industry that pays my rent, make your mark on the series. Next time I hop onto the back of a colossal yellow bird, I no longer want to hear "Cinco De Chocobo", I want to hear something EA, something like Usher possibly. Look what it did for Tiger Woods. Let's be honest, everyone knows golf is crap. Somehow EA throw in some hip-hop and the sport becomes cooler than MC Hammer dancing in his underpants in the middle of Siberia.  2. Introduce this year's biggest craze, rag-doll physics. When I attack an ominous green mole brandishing a kitchen knife, he should know about it. As my oversized sword connects with his head he should reel back as though the immortal Rocky Balboa himself has just delivered his thunderous left hook to the wretched beast.  3. Introduce last year's biggest craze, bullet time. To put it into simpler terms for those of you not as adept in gaming as myself, I want to be able to press a button to make me run slower. Everyone loved the Matrix, right?  4. Make the plot more relevant to Westerners, particualrly the English as we are superior to every other race. The petty battles for world domination set in a world of dragons and magic mean nothing to me. Kids would much rather fight the battles of beer, drugs, teenage pregnancy and Nike hats. This is what the British youth can relate to.  5. More ninjas. I haven't seen a single bloody ninja since FF6, and with their ever-rising popularity I find this unacceptable.  Square-Enix, heed my advice. You want to make money, well I put the "sell" in "selling-out".

       There is an interesting lesson to be learned from everything. Some are often minute, often tongue-in-cheek, but nonetheless are an example to be followed.  Firstly, let me go to the story of a certain Doctor Foster, as well as I can recall it:   Doctor Foster went to Gloucester, In a shower of rain; He stepped in a puddle Right up to his middle, And never went there again.   This unfortunate man, I admit, was rather naïve to travel so far in such conditions (granted, we do not know his place of residence, but it can be assumed that it was outside Gloucester, therefore a considerable distance). However, we can learn from his mistake; most of us would have the sense not to travel far in bad weather conditions, but those who think "It's just a shower" should think of poor unfortunate Doctor Foster.  Now, let us move to a rather more serious work of literature.  I recently read a book by British travel writer, Bill Bryson, entitled  A Short History of Nearly Everything . What appears to be a titanic subject is cleverly summarised by the wonderfully witty Bryson. Basically, his moral is that we are all very lucky, beyond all our perceptions, to be alive. And, if one interprets that in a rather more thoughtful way, it may be seen that one should be more grateful that one is alive, and "live life to the full", so to speak.  There are also wonderfully ambiguous morals, like that of the Shakespeare play  The Merchant of Venice . To a modern audience, the moral may be to show respect to everyone, regardless of their religion or race - a Christian interpretation may be "love thy neighbour". Unfortunately, the moral that a seventeenth century audience may have extracted was that Jews shall always get their come-uppance, they are all evil, and Christians should do their best to rid the world of them. The interpretated moral that Shakespeare intended, of course, shall not be known, but I believe that many outside factors would influence a person's interpretation of that moral, and it is ultimately up to the person themself to interpret and practise it.

       With this being my first piece for  The Expert , I was keen to make it something quite memorable. I had plenty of ideas for articles (how mainstream beers are actually bottled urine, the hell of exams, etc., etc.), but various things got in the way. Then I decided  "why not start with a book review? You'll probably do that most of the time anyway."    So here we are.     Aberystwyth Mon Amour  by Malcolm Pryce  is most likely something you've never heard of and maybe it seems like a strange choice. It's not a particularly recent release but rather a book I bought 2 years ago to read on holiday and never did until now.   Local schoolboys from Aberystwyth are going missing, one is believed to have fallen in a vat of lactic acid at the cheese factory and the infamous 'Evans the boot' has been missing for days. What is the connection? Well that’s the job of Louie Knight of Knight Errant Investigations, Aberystwyth's only Private Investigator, to find out.   Some might want to call this a satire on that clichéed niche of the crime thriller genre; others may want to call it a black comedy or (as I prefer to describe it) a funny book. Whichever way you like, this is definitely a book which will at least have you chuckling to yourself from time to time. Pryce creates a wonderfully surreal backdrop for his ludicrous storyline which itself is filled with bizarre and amusing characters. There is Aberystwyth’s criminal underworld which is run not by a mafia but by the Druids. I could mention the Moulin, Aberystwyth's Cabaret bar (with its fishing theme) or Sospan's Ice cream parlour where a moody P.I. can go to brood as he swigs back a vanilla (not to mention the 24 hour whelk stand). But I should stop before I start giving it all away.  This is a book which could have gone so wrong. Undoubtedly, I imagine there must have been an urge for Pryce to simply make gag after gag for the entire story and only pay lip service to the plot itself. However like being told 10 George Bush jokes in a row, all put together, some will be  bound to be about as amusing as concrete regardless of how amusing they are on their own. It's a great relief therefore when Pryce is able to pull back and settle into telling his bizarre story. Don’t misunderstand, it doesn't stop being funny and the gags are still there but you actually find yourself becoming increasingly engrossed in the ludicrous storyline itself, a storyline that covers rare tea cosies, shamed Corset museum curators and an ill fated Welsh version of the Vietnam war.  I am however struggling when it comes to make some kind of score for it. The dark humour of this book is not something that will appeal to everyone and I imagine some people (from Aberystwyth most likely) may even be offended by it.   6.5 out of 10    Malcolm Pryce's novel is brilliantly funny and will hopefully appeal to some.  The fact that this was his debut is bound to make a few people like myself incredibly envious but nonetheless, impressed. It can be found on  urlLink Amazon . There is also a follow up novel by Pryce called Last Tango in Aberystwyth.

         Menstruation...    There is nothing more utterly foreboding than that word, is there?   Every month, opposite sexes and even mutual sexes collide through tension filled emotions just because our friendly foe; the female; is having her period.  Admittingly, it's usually the guy who gets the brunt of the blows because he either:   1.   Doesn't understand what's going on with her biological bits and makes matters worse by not knowing what to say or do.    2.   Is completly repulsed by the idea and defends himself with a cooking pot for a helmet and a small, edible pet for a decoy.    3.   Knows exactly what is going on but decides to torment and make jokes out of the situation.    4.   Understands completly, empathises - but gets his head bitten off anyway.   A woman can respond in numerous ways to these actions. One way is crying, another is self-depreciation, a few others include irritability, reclusiveness and hostility. But there is only one ultimate meaning behind them all...  "I hate you."  Behind all that feral and ferocious spontaneity, your friend/relative/partner is still hiding under there somewhere. Just don't approach them at this time for the life of you! You are more than likely to lose a leg.  Although! There are reports of some women who take their monthly cycles with an artistic approach, I'm taking about...   urlLink Menstrual Paintings.   Yes, instead of wasting all that smelly, clotted womb-lining on tampons and towels. Let your artistic side show through and create paintings for people to enjoy. I'm not sure how far this is catching on, but it makes a great gimmick.  There are even women who take menstruation with a new age spiritual outlook...   urlLink An Invitation to become an Urban Priestess.    Evidently, Menstruation is not that much of a matter to be embaressed about, neither is it a subject you can't ignore. It's a subject you can certainly giggle at or cry over while you're holding your aching ovaries and seething temper. But personally, I think females take the matter way too far; especially on their male counterparts. It seems that when females converse with other females about this subject, it's treated with a knowing sympathy that doesn't include any hostility towards one another. Males that show signs of sympathy are greated with looks that could kill, because they feel men are ignorant of how they are really feeling inside.   Men on the other hand, can be frivolous to the matter. The clashes that happen; mostly  result from the subject turning into a continuous circle of accusations and misunderstandings. Worse for wear, it can leave both parties feeling exasperated by the end of all the fuss.  Most of us don't treat the opposite sex this way during those times, but a good handful do. Ignorance isn't always one-sided, showing hostility to someone who doesn't understand a certain subject is ignorance in itself. It's always best to know whats going on with each others bodies to understand more about how we work as human beings.  In conclusion, instead of losing control at someone who does not understand how much pain you're going through, why not let them into your world and share the load instead?

       Yo.  I'm back, and this time I've got something worth reading.  Okay.  I just watched  Unforgiven , one of Clint Eastwood's later westerns.  He directed it, produced it, and starred in it, with other big names like Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman co-starring.  William Munny (Eastwood) is a pig farmer, humble old fella with two kids.  Wife died three years back, in 1878.  She changed him quite a bit from his outlaw ways.  He used to kill people just for lookin' at him funny, but his wife made him stop that, and made him stop drinkin' whiskey.  He doesn't regret the descision, until he's offered $500 to go and help kill two cowboys who cut up a whore's face.  So, long story short, he accepts the offer, and gets his friend in on the deal, Ned (Freeman).  So now the money's to be split three ways, between Will, Ned, and the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett).  However, the sherrif of the town, Little Bill (Hackman), don't take too kindly to people who he thinks are trash- namely, Will and company.  I won't spoil the ending for you, but I will tell you that the climax of the film is a tense scene that had me gripping the edge of my seat- even though I was pretty sure of what would happen.  Although it was mildly unrealistic (think James Bond shoot-out unrealistic), it was one of the better shootouts I've seen.  The acting was excellent.  Although Clint isn't exactly on par with the rest of the cast, he makes up for it with excellent directing.  The scenery is beautiful and convincing- I'd love to go and see it for myself, but that probably isn't happening too soon.  The music is also quite fitting of the mood of the film, in every scene in which you hear music.  I'm not sure that I'd go out and buy the soundtrack, but it is perfect for the film.  Overall, I'd give it a  9 out of 10 .  This is mainly because I just watched one of Eastwood's earlier films- one he starred in, not one he directed- which is one of my favorites.  I watched  Unforgiven  with extermely high expectations, and I was not disappointed- rather, I enjoyed it thoroughly, I just liked  The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly  a bit more.  The folks at the Academy Awards seemed to like it quite a bit, though- it won 4 Awards, including Best Picture for 1992.   Unforgiven  is  rated R  for violence, language, and one sexual scene.  For additional information, see the entry for this film at  urlLink The Internet Movie Database  (link goes straight to film's page).

       Dear Reader,  I hope you realise what you're getting yourself in for by clicking this link, as I am no normal reviewer. You see, whilst most reviewers are paid big fat cheques from the distribution companies to offer nice little soundbites that go on the posters, here at  The Expert  we do things a little differently. Me for instance, I am going to be looking at "cheese". Not of the edible variety, but the sort that has blighted pop culture for so many years, like a sort of cultural short-hand if you will. Although you are not aware of it you all secretly like cheese, as is evidenced by your secret shame of owning a "Spice Girls" single, or, even worse a "Mr Blobby" album. You bought it because it appealed to something primal, the same way that dogs chase postmen, and that loveless social miscreants are drawn to daytime TV chat shows.  The problem when looking at reviews of cheese is that it's usually dismissed in two words "It's...cheesy", which tells you sod all about wether it has any worth, and believe me, much like the way that the edible variety can transform humble toast into the perfect post-pub snack, cheese can be a force for good, rather than evil.   At this point you've either clicked the back button and started to read Venny's interesting article on menstruation. If you're still here. Well done. You're probably perplexed on how cheese can be a GOOD thing... well I'm going to give you an exmple, and I'm probably going to lose all credibility with what I am about to utter, but believe me stick with me and it'll all come together in the end... The queens of cheese, GOOD cheese... are the Cheeky Girls. Now I notice you're looking at me with a horrified expression, your mouse pointer may even now be perched perilously over a link to take you away from this insanity, but bear with me.   I think that music lovers, well, most music lovers would have to agree that Pop/American Idol is a bad thing when it comes to original music. The artists these shows create are packacked nicely and spat out, much like processed cheese slices in fact, but the music they create is anodyne, bland and has no soul. We were crying out for a hero to save us from this drudgery, and it finally appeared in the form of two sultry, skinny Transylvanian sirens, and they wanted us to touch their bum.   They were laughed off the show, rightly so as they couldn't sing a note, their song was rubbish and looked a bit too vampiric for what the judges were looking for. They had the last laugh. Two of the show's biggest failures sold millions of records, and no one knew why, their songs were nonsensical (they wrote a whole song about taking their shoes off for god's sake!). They have sold more records than this year's winner of Pop Idol - Michelle McManus, and so the entire credibility of the show has come crashing down, the entire ethos of this money-making machine has ground to a halt, and we owe it all to the public wanting to go on a "Cheeky Holiday".  So... is all cheese bad, you have to ask yourself? Will I be fired after this first laughable attempt at journalism? *shrugs*  Touch my Bum.  THIS is life. :)
