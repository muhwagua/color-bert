      OK, one more random fact... Survivor's Kentucky Joe is going to have cameo and four lines in a soon-to-open "Gilligan's Island" movie. Now, that's what being a celebrity is about.

      I got an invitation to a wedding shower yesterday. It's a Sunday brunch and we are suppose to bring our favorite recipe and an item that would be in it. Gosh, that's way too grown up for me.   Remember the youngest boy on Home Improvement? Well, he's 17 years old now and has a 33-year-old wife. They live in Kansas and he doesn't have access to his trust fund because he's not 18 yet. Anyway, that made me laugh. Oh, and he looks pretty feminine in a picture I saw of him today. Strange.

      OK, an update...  Last night I was visiting my grandma in the hospital. It's nothing serious, just a bunch of tests because she's not in the best of health. She weighs about 75 pounds and barely eats. But, anyway, I was thinking last night about how my grandparents have been married 55 years. That's amazing, and beautiful. While all kinds of things have changed around them, they have loved each other enough through it to make it to where they are today. OK, I know, I'm being such a girl, but I seem to be surrounded by a lot of young, seeming-fragile love lately and it's nice to see that it really does work if people's hearts are in it.  I'm going to Murray this weekend, well, Sunday and Monday, with Greg. No, I don't miss the middle-of-nowhere town yet. (Yes, I said yet.) I'm going with Greg to do family stuff with him. And I'm going to get to see Jaclyn and hopefully Lisa, too.   Happy, Ryan? You know, some of us actually worked today... And while I'm targeting you, where's my CD? :)

      It's Sunday and lucky me has another day off. Yep, that's right, I have Monday off and it isn't even Labor Day yet. That's what I get because I have to work Friday and Saturday nights this weekend. But I've had a good weekend so far...  Greg came up from Lexington on Saturday afternoon and then we went to a wedding shower for Shelley and Dustin. Yeah, that's grown up. Almost all the people there were couples - I know, I was there with Greg. But most of the couples were married. And two of the couples had kids, one who is 3 years old and his parents are my age. A bunch of random people from high school made my past and future worlds collide for me. A the talk of a 5-year high school reunion made me momentarily wonder what kind of time warp I was in. Then I realized that my life is a bunch of realizations, the most current being how much I have changed - since high school, during college, since yesterday. Then this guy who I had known for all of 30 minutes asked me, with Greg sitting on the couch next to me, when Greg and I were getting married. Greg and I looked at each other before I bluntly said, "What kind of question is that?" He said, "A personal one." Yep, he's right. And it was awkward, but Greg and I got a good laugh at it.   Today I went to church with Greg. Shelley and Dustin were there, too. The sermon was on suffering and how pain makes us stronger, if we let it. God isn't the God of evil, but the God who allows us to endure the struggles in life. It's a hopeful thought. The preacher said the only thing worse than being disappointed with God is being disappointed without God. It's true. God provides the only hope that is going to transcend our lives. Then while Greg and I were waiting for Kelly, her mom and her sister at Logan's Roadhouse, I read an article about the very same theology topic in the LEO. That's a place I sure wouldn't expect to read about what I had just heard in church, but I liked the theme. But it gets better. When we sat down to eat lunch, Kelly's mom was talking about church and told us about their service. Yep, you guessed it, it was about struggles and how that develops character. Amazing. You think God was trying to tell me something? I'm sure there is some message in it all for me.   I'm reading a suspence novel, A Certain Justice by John T. Lescroart, that my mom recommended. But mixed in with the crime and characters was a piece of wisdom: "People should try for excellence, he said, not perfection, because perfection, after all, was impossible, whereas excellence was occasionally attainable. Something to shoot for."

      Ryan put me up to this. But I think he knew I would like it when I started playing around with it. He knows I can fall into computer-geekish tendencies. Cara thinks I'm a computer geek, but really I'm just fascinated with all the capabilities. But sometimes high-tech channels do interfere with traditional forms of communication. Right, Ryan? Right. Anyway, Laura has an online journal, too. It's fun to read  urlLink Laura's  and  urlLink Ryan's  thoughts, so now I guess I can contribute my own.

      I actually had a "normal" weekend, meaning I didn't have to work. Greg spent the whole weekend with me. We went to the rehearsal dinner for Shelley and Dustin's wedding on Friday. Then their wedding was on Saturday afternoon. It was nice, but it does make me a little sad Shelley is moving to Indianapolis. It has been fun to have her around the last couple months since I have been back in Louisville. They are my closest friends who have gotten married, which is slightly strange and much to grown-up. I didn't get to see a few people from high school that I enjoyed seeing. A guy I have known since first grade who moved from Oldham County my junior year was there. He works as an architect for the city in Cincinnati. That means he's working on the expanded riverfront park, and I'm sure other cool things. What a great job! I love those parks. Too bad there are riots in the city.  In the next year I am in two more weddings of close friends -- Katie Peter and Jaclyn. Katie's is in April and Jaclyn's in is June. My cousin Allison is getting married Memorial Day weekend in Atlanta. Gosh, all these weddings aren't necessarily good for someone like me, who tends to let her mind wander.   Anyway, I slept in both days and just enjoyed the weekend. Today Greg and I watched football, hung out with my family for my grandma's birthday and went to Waterfront Park. Compared to the last school year and the summer, Greg and I are spoiled with all the time we get to spent together. But as long as we appreciate it, it's OK. I'm sure not going to complain.  I got the new  urlLink Caedmon's Call  CD today. The music is beautiful. And because I ordered it from the Internet, I got a bonus CD that is pretty good itself. And Greg brought me a not-so-legal copy of  urlLink Andrew Peterson's  new CD. All this great new music and my CD player in my car doesn't really want to work. I might need to take care of that.   ...We were really crushed and overwhelmed, and feared we would never live through it. We felt we were doomed to die and saw how powerless we were to help ourselves; but that was good, for then we put everything into the hands of God, who alone could save us, for he can even raise the dead.  -2 Corinthians 1:8-9   Dependence is not defeat, but constant contact. It is realizing that our source of truth and power is God and then keeping in touch with him.  -from the notes in my Bible with the above verse.

       In something as little as running an errand or doing a project around the house, we can worship through that. We can also worship in our struggles and our confusion. It ultimately comes down to understanding who God is, praising Him for being who He is and giving Him the glory.   -Todd Bragg, Caedmon's Call drummer

      Whew, busy day at work. Lots of odds and ends that seem to surface at the beginning of the week. But I got the high school football poll out and that's about all that matters to a bunch of people in Kentucky. St. X moved on up, pleasing Ryan, I'm sure. And even though Oldham County didn't get enough votes to make it in the top 10, the Colonels beat Danville (last week's AAA No. 1) in double overtime on Friday night. And now Danville isn't up top anymore.   On the subject of high school sports, I'm leaving now to go to my sister's soccer game.  Oh, and Ryan, no need to mock me, really. Doesn't everyone make mistakes? And I corrected mine.

      Today is only Wednesday and I am already looking forward to this weekend. What's that about? I should enjoy my time now, not get so caught up in the future. Anyway, Jaclyn is coming into town this weekend. Our Thursday night dinners and watching CSI are some other things I miss most about Murray. Then Ryan is coming into town too, which means I should get to meet his girlfriend for the first time. While they go to the St. X-Trinity football game, I'll be taking football scores at work. And what happens in that game will probably determine which team is the No. 1 AAAA team in the poll I am responsible for at work. Then Greg is coming into town so we can hang out on Sunday. Gosh, all kinds of visitors. I'm not going to know what to do with all these friends!

        I am loving the weather. Sometimes people resort to talking about weather when there isn't anything else to say. I'm talking about the weather because I love it. I am so ready to wear sweaters. This morning it was actually chilly when I got in my car to go to work. And I don't have to have my air conditioner on -- in my apartment or my car. But the sun has still been shining and I sweated a little when I played tennis yesterday. Really, this is a happy medium I'm content with.  I read lots of articles today about how people flocked to churches yesterday to pray for our nation. It's too bad it took a tragedy to bring people back to God. But that's just one of the many ways God is showing his goodness in the midst of evil. He's good at doing that. It all goes back to the verse that broke my heart one night when I was a junior in high school:    And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. -Romas 8:28   And the song that God used to speak to me one weekend in January of 1996, the weekend he changed my life:   Oh God, You are my God  And I will ever praise You  Oh God, You are my God  And I will ever praise You   I will seek You in the morning  And I will learn to walk in Your ways  And step by step You'll lead me  And I will follow You all of my days  -Rich Mullins   OK, I want to share some of the things from church yesterday. I went to St. John United Methodist Church, where Kelly McClendon preaches. He said some wise things when I'm sure many people needed to hear them:  "These attacks are  not  the will of God. In a world of free choices, his will is rarely done. God weeps with us. Don't blame God. Blame the people who didn't listen to God. They didn't love their neighbor."  "When people choose to do evil, sometimes innocent people get hurt. That's part of our freedom to choose. If he (God) took that away, we wouldn't be his children anymore; we'd be his puppets. He could move us like a pawn in a chess game. But he doesn't want a pawn, he wants children."  "Jesus said love your enemy. People who choose evil think the darkness is their friend. The evil isn't the person, but the darkness they cling to."  "For our souls are God's, but we'll lay down our bodies for our friends. Whether we live of die, we belong to God."  And, on a side note, the verse on my calendar today was rather appropriate:   If you really keep the royal law found in scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing right. -James 2:8

We're involved in a new kind of warfare and we need the help of the spirit of God." -Rev. Billy Graham  "I've been asked hundreds of times in my life why God allows tragedy and suffering. I'm convinced that I really do not know the answer even to my own satisfaction. I have to accept by faith that God is sovereign and he is a God of love and mercy and compassion in the midst of suffering." -Rev. Billy Graham

      "On this national day of prayer and remembrance, we ask almighty God to watch over our nation and grant us patience and resolve in all that is to come. We pray that He will comfort and console those who now walk in sorrow. We thank Him for each life we now must mourn, and the promise of a life to come. As we've been assured, neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities, nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth can separate us from God's love. May He bless the souls of the departed. May He comfort our own. And may He always guide our country. God bless America." -George W. Bush at the Washington National Cathedral today

      Props to Bush for initiating prayer today. Tuesday was Sept. 11, or 9-11. Anyway, someone suggested I read Psalm 91:1. It's so amazing how God speaks. So, I'm passing along the suggestion: Read Psalm 91:1.  This whole national crisis has given me a personal attitude adjustment. Every time I even start to complain, I am immediately reminded by constant images on TV and in my mind that I have plenty to be thankful for, most importantly my life, period. It makes not getting my paycheck yesterday really insignificant. And you know, my sore throat and stuffed up nose will be better in a few days.

      Working at the Associated Press when national news happens is crazy. Even in Kentucky, we have access to story after story, update after update as news unfolds before our eyes. To be honest, it's an adrenaline rush and heart-breaking at the same time. It's a learning experience and a reminder that I am blessed.  I went to mass at the Cathedral of the Assumption as one of my contributions to our local stories yesterday. I had never been in there. It was magnificent. That seems like such a silly word, but it was truly glorious. I understand why God gets excited to make His presence known in man-made buildings like that. The priest's words were few, but powerful. It's good to know there are leaders like that in every community reaching out to people, opening buildings to be a refuge from evil.

      I have been in a thinking funk lately. Not about bad stuff, just about stuff. I realized the people who know the most about my life right now -- both the daily stuff and the deeper stuff -- aren't in Louisville. As someone who appreciates communciation, that's not the ideal situation. E-mails and phone calls are fine, but sometimes I miss the way I could walk or drive in less than one song to someone's dorm room or apartment in Murray when I wanted to be in the company of those who know me. I have friends here, and they are wonderful people, but I spend more timing missing the people who aren't here than hanging out with the people who are.   But with these thoughts, I'm thankful my family is here. My mom and I talk almost every day and I see her, and usually the rest of my family, a few times a week. That's nice after four years of only seeing them on weekends and breaks from school. Plus the years before that I didn't really appreciate what a family was about. It's kind of ironic now that I think about that: It used to be I filled my free time with my friends, a whole group of them. Now I fill my free time with my family and select few friends. I know, I know, nobody has to tell me. That's part of growing up. Gosh, everything is about growing up these days. Well, duh, I suppose. It just amazes how quick attitudes and perceptions can change. And all it takes is continuing realizations that we are ever-changing beings and that our purpose goes beyond working so we can make money and be successful. But, then again, I suppose success is a relative concept. Everyone has their own ideas about what it is and how to achieve it. For me, I am realizing why it goes beyond giving myself wholly to my work. There are multiple other things that deserve pieces of me, and probably bigger pieces at that.   I guess the phrase I opened this with -- "thinking funk" -- cast a negative shadow on the proceeding thoughts. But I'm not disappointed or angry. Actually, I'm content. I think there's a difference in being content and being comfortable. I'm not comfortable. As well as everything is going in my life right now in Louisville, I have fleeting the-grass-is-greener-on-the-other-side thoughts about my life. Being comfortable is also dangerous, I think. I know when I get too comfortable I get a lazy state of mind and lose sight of what's important. So being content is good for me. Because I it's this attitude that keeps me on my toes -- apprecating the people and places in my life.   This is probably a little too deep for this. But it's a little more interesting than writing that I went to my grandparents with my mom this afternoon before I came to work. And that I probably could have slept all day because my bedroom is so dark with the shades instead of blinds. See, I was comfortable in my bed with T-shirt sheets this morning. And that was good for the time being. But I had to get out of bed, even if it was to eat waffles and watch 90210 re-runs. I was content. OK, so being content and comfortable complement each other. I guess it's about knowing there is a time and place for both of them and too much of each good thing is a bad thing.  Alright, I'm starting to drive myself crazy. And I know other people have less tolerance for me than I have. So, I'll take a break.

      I've been thinking a lot about careers and how they affect lives. I know, that's grown up. Regardless, here are some quotes along those lines for me:  "Money is not a substitute for tenderness, and power is not a substitute for tenderness."  -Morrie Schwartz, sociology teacher  "Sure. They (newspapers) have changed names. Changed owners. Changed technology. (You can now get a newspaper 'delivered' in cyberspace, a concept that still throws me.) But essentially, the product remains the same. Something happens. Someone writes it down. Someone prints it. Not tricky. Not complex."  -Mitch Albom, journalist  "...have perspective on what you're doing and be wise about how you spend your time..."  -Mitch Albom, journalist

      Ryan says he worries about me. But I don't know why. I think it bugs him when I am abstract and vague. He likes specifics. Funny, though, because usually I'm a very detailed-oriented person.   Anyway, so this update is especially for Ryan. But you know, I really don't think anyone else reads this, so it doesn't matter if I direct it to Ryan or not. Well, Laura reads it, too, I think. Maybe people could  urlLink email  me if they read this and I don't know about it.  Work has been going well. I still am trying to learn the AP system. Like a co-worker said, "Learning the system is here is like learning Greek." The program itself is much like Word, so that doesn't complicate my life. But the codes and organization of how stories are stored is sort of confusing. Plus there are multiple wires a story could move on -- sports, state, national, political, south. I'm getting it down, and I have figured out who are my best co-workers to ask questions.   I've consumed myself with a book lately, which is something I haven't done in awhile. Most of the four-hour drive from Lexington to Murray this weekend, I read while Greg drove. Of course, I talked to him, too. Anyway, it's one of those courtroom dramas that has twists in it -- both related to the case and to those involved personal lives. I like situations like that. They make me think, I guess. That's why I like "CSI," too. That show is great. My tastes are diverse -- from "CSI" to "Dawson's Creek." Oh, well.   See, I'm just babbling. This will probably make Ryan happy.   But, anyway, I got the second book by the same author -- who is actually a trial lawyer, too -- yesterday at the Louisville Free Public Library. I went to the downtown branch because it is only a few blocks from my work. The building is really neat, inside and out. And I think it is funny the word "free" is in the name. The idea of libraries being free is pretty much what makes them what they are in my mind.

      I can't believe it's already September. I watched a football game today. September and football: sure makes me think of fall, a time I am so ready for. I love the summer, but it's time for cooler weather. Can you tell there isn't a lot going on in my life? I have resorted to talking about weather. I guess I could go back to that football game I mentioned. Gosh, UK didn't look so great. And U of L obviously did something right. 36-10. Those Cardinals at least kept the ball and, more importantly, got it in to the end zone. Football is OK, but I would have rather been there than watching is on my rather small TV screen. My dad and Greg were there (not together), but I had to come to work at 4:30, so I settled for TV. You know, come to think about it, listening to those sometimes annoying commentators probably actually helped me follow the game better. OK, I am totally babbling, but I suppose that's alright because this is a blog, which is a word that reminds me of babbling anyway.

      I just don't know about this time change... it's basically dark when I leave work at 6 p.m.  I hung out with my childhood friend Elizabeth last night. We played rummy with the new deck of cards she brought me from Portland, complete with four Oregon scenes on the different suites. She lived behind me in my neighborhood from second grade to freshman year. One winter we walked between our house so much (sometimes in the snow) that the next spring a path of grass through another neighbor's yard was dead. She and I lead very different lives, but have a bond that transcends distance and time. And we still laugh, a lot, at almost anything. Riding bikes through the neighborhood and the nearby woods and games of flashlight tag have evolved into political conversations about our conflicting persuasions. And waiting for the school bus and going to church together have been replaced with sporadic cross-country visits.

      My friend Melissa Stoneberger wrote a commentary I identified with in "The Murray State News."   ...Even though my world may be a little more tilted now, that doesn't mean I have to give up playing in the sprinkler or chasing down the ice cream man on hot summer days. And I'm not throwing out my juice boxes in favor of a coffee pot. It just means that things are changing, and I'd better be prepared. After all, it doesn't get easier.

      Here's a neat thought from Sandra McCracken, a singer/songwriter:   It's funny how it is.  The things we take for absolutes.  The paycheck that comes every two weeks, the paper that lands on the front lawn every morning, the new car that promises not to leave you stranded.  Truth is, security is an illusive pursuit.  We have so little control over our own circumstances.  Not to say there are not laws of nature that govern our statistics, but somehow I'm finding more comfort in the mystery than in my ability to control what comes next.  This history has come from somewhere, and it is going somewhere.  So, to put it simply, that means I'm both a  small, and a significant part of something bigger than this moment.  So we press on, do what we were made for, love our families, give to our community, and try to push back the effects of evil by coming alive in the next breath we're given.  Life from death is still the greatest storyline ever written.  May we all learn to embrace this chance for new life from ashes.

      I hung out with my friend Alison last night for the first time in a long time. We had seen each other in passing at church, but hadn't gotten to sit down and talk for probably a couple of years. We drank coffee (Well, I drank hot chocolate because I don't like coffee.) and talked for almost two hours last night. And I hope now that I am living in Louisville again she and I will get to do that more often.  Today I wrote a story at work. You know that makes me happy.  Tomorrow I am going to Lexington when I get off work for a concert. It's Derek Webb of Caedmon's Call and his wife, Sandra McCracken. I'm really looking forward to it because there have been a couple of other concerts (Bebo Norman and Andrew Peterson) the last few weeks that I couldn't go to because I worked on the weekends. And I'm going to hang out with Greg and Katie.

      Here's a neat story from an anonymous author:  You say you will never forget where you were when you heard the news on September 11, 2001. Neither will I.  I was on the 110th floor in a smoke filled room with a man who called his wife to say "good bye." I held his fingers steady as he dialed. I gave him the peace to say, "Honey, I am not going to make it, but it is OK...I am ready to go."  I was with his wife when he called as she fed breakfast to their children. I held her up as she tried to understand his words and as she realized he wasn't coming home that night.  I was in the stairwell of the 23rd floor when a woman cried out to Me for help. "I have been knocking on the door of your heart for 50 years!" I said.  "Of course I will show you the way home - only believe on Me now."   I was at the base of the building with the Priest ministering to the injured and devastated souls. I took him home to tend to his flock in Heaven. He heard my voice and answered.  I was on all four of those planes, in every seat, with every prayer. I was with the crew as they were overtaken. I was in the very hearts of the believers there, comforting and assuring them that their faith has saved them.  I was in Texas, Kansas, London. I was standing next to you when you heard the terrible news. Did you sense Me?  I want you to know that I saw every face. I knew every name - though not all know Me. Some met Me for the first time on the 86th floor. Some sought Me with their last breath. Some couldn't hear Me calling to them through the smoke and flames; "Come to Me... this way... take my hand." Some chose, for the final time, to ignore Me. But, I was there.  I did not place you in the Tower that day. You may not know why, but I do. However, if you were there in that explosive moment in time, would you have reached for Me? September 11, 2001 was not the end of the journey for you.  But someday your journey will end. And I will be there for you as well. Seek Me now while I may be found. Then, at any moment, you know you are "ready to go."  I will be in the stairwell of your final moments.  -God

      A productive Saturday: I ate lunch with Shelley and Dustin -- my  married  friends. Then my mom and I made two blue sheets into curtains and a valace. The curtains are up, and the valace is ready. I just need one more curtain rod.  Speaking of being domestic, I got a new green cover and green and blue pillows for my couch. It looks better and is more comfortable. But for those of you who liked the worn-out flowers, have no fear, the cover isn't quite big enough and doesn't cover the arms very well. So, the flowers aren't completely buried.  Anyway, back to today. Tonight I haven't done much at work. No, I am a hard worker. Saturdays are just slow. Don't ask how the news slows down on the weekends. That's a concept I haven't grasped yet. Well, it does make sense if you think about all the people not working, but doing other things with their live. Anyway, Lori and I went to eat at Los Aztecas. Great Mexican food! And it was good to hang out with Lori.  Lori is my friend at work who also went to Murray. This past week we haven't worked together -- different days and shifts. That means no trips outside for her smoke breaks, which also serve as much-appreciated time from useless stress in the office. We worked together at the newspaper at school, but didn't know each other that well. Now we talk about our lives, TV shows and work.  Now I'm playing scrabble online with Ryan. And Greg is coming into town when I get off work. It's been a good day.

      I get restless when I don't have enough to do at work.  I am restless.  Most people would probably like to get paid to play online games, answer the phone ocassionally and read, but I get restless.  Even though I get more sleep than most people I know, I have lacked energy the last couple of days. Maybe I get too much sleep. And I suppose this computer screen doesn't help my eyes want to stay opened.  I better finish up my online game of Scrabble before football scores start coming in.

      Last night Cara and I continued our tradition of watching "Felicity." It's expanding though. She's getting hooked on "Dawson's Creek." I wish Laura were here to watched "Dawon's" with me. One, she would call it "Dawson's," and I would probably tease her about shortening the title. Two, she's deny even liking the show, but be disappointed if we missed it. She's great.

      My family asked me to choose some verses to read at my grandma's mass tomorrow. The priest is going to read the gospel verses and I'm going to read the other ones:   "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going."  Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?"  Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him."  -John 14:1-7   Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.  -Romans 5:1-5   Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded? He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in. He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.   "To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?" says the Holy One.   Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. Why do you say, O Jacob, and complain, O Israel, "My way is hidden from the Lord; my cause is disregarded by my God"?  Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.  -Isaiah 40:21-31

      My grandma died yesterday afternoon. Now she's in a better place, rejoicing in eternal life without the suffering she had here. My grandpa misses her already, as we all do. Fifty-five years is a lifetime with someone. And I know Poppy is going to feel lost for awhile without Nanny. He's devoted his life to her, and particularly to taking care of her lately. I know it'll just take some time to regain focus, but he's strong enough to do it. My aunt said that she was worried about him, but she didn't know why, after all, he served in World War II. But Poppy admitted that there is no comparison and this tugs at his emotions in completely different ways.  Ryan, the baseball playoffs aren't going as well as they could... The Cardinals lost in a stinkin' close game last night. What kind of mascot is the Diamondbacks anyway?

      Pray for my grandma.   Anyone who has seen her knows she's so little and weak, but her health is declining. Right now she's in intensive care at the hospital and my aunt and uncle are coming into town. My aunt Kim lives in Ottawa and is flying into Louisville tonight. My uncle Rick and his wife are cutting their vacation in California short (They live in Yellowstone National Park.) and flying into Louisville tomorrow. Conversations about whether to recessiate Nanny if necessary have already surfaced.  God is the great physician, so I know he'll take care of her.

      I saw Muhammad Ali today.   Needless to say, I am not a boxing fan. But he impressed me. I was covering this presentation for work today at Western High School and The Muhammad Ali Center was receiving some money, among other organizations. He didn't say a word at the podium. He joked with a student who spoke and made his way out through a crowd of students, who he hugged and kissed on the cheek. Without words, he held the attention of everyone in that gym.

      I feel refreshed.  Both my heart and my head are clear, thanks to some conversations, singing really loud in my car to great music and a beautiful day. I woke up early this morning, something I usually don't get too excited about doing. But I was motivated when I remembered my alarm going off at 7:30 a.m. meant I got to see Greg and go to my favorite church afterI drove down I-64.   Mike Breaux is amazing. Or rather God is amazingly evident through Mike Breaux. This morning he "celebrated" why God is who he says he is and what he is doing at Southland Christian. You'd think a sermon like that would be geared some of the many hundreds of people who make Southland their home. But it wasn't really. It was geared toward people who love God. Period. That's all Mike wants people to come away from his sermons and church in general doing -- loving God and people. He said it himself today:  Life is pretty basic: Love God. Love people.   Like I said not too long ago in an entry, God meets me at Southland every time I am there -- through Mike (Sure, we're on a first name basis!), the music and the atmosphere. It refreshes me, reminds me what is important and challenges me to seek God more. That's why I am so unsettled about churches here. When I go to different ones, I can't seem to find one that initially meets my wants and needs. I don't sense it's where I am suppose to be, where I am suppose to make an effort to belong.   Oh, and not only did Mike Breaux preach today, but he went from the last word of his sermon into a song that emphasized his point. And it summed up the condition of my heart. It was about being and growing in who God challenges me to be, who he created me to be in his image. It was beautiful. And Jaclyn would have had to muffle her scream of joy of Mike leading the people. Who preaches on why and how the church is in its new sanctuary (that cleverly converts into basketball courts) and makes me focus on more everlasting truths? Thanks to God, Mike Breaux did this morning.   You have never locked eyes on another person in this world who doesn't matter to God.   -Mike Breaux   Truth conveyed without grace is legalism, which leads to condemnation. Grace conveyed without truth leads to a life unchanged.  -Tim Spalding in his testimony to who God is to him   The Spirit and the bride say, "come!" And let him who hears say, "come!" Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.  -Revelation 22:17

       Vision is the ability to see God's presence, plan and power over obstacles.  -Mike Breaux   The beginning is scary; the end is usually sad, but it's what's in the middle that should count.  -from "Hope Floats"   According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that seem right? That means to the average person if you have to go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.  -Jerry Seinfeld

      While waiting for people to call in football scores, I was instant messaging Alexa.   She's one of the first people I met in Murray my freshman year. She lived on my floor for three years and spent as much time as I did in Wilson Hall, where the journalism department was located. She worked for the yearbook and I worked for the newspaper. When I was having issues with the newspaper, she recruited me upstairs to the yearbook. Then I got things worked out at the paper and my senior year I worked at both. With 12 hours of classes, six of which were 100-level electives, who was going to pass up two paychecks earned doing what I love? My heart was in the newspapers, but Alexa was one of the best things about working at the yearbook. She has this joy for life that encourages me. And she was a constant in my four years at Murray. Even though Alexa and I didn't always hang out or make lots of plans, I loved running into her on campus and spontaneously eating lunch or talking about "Felicity" or other entertainment news, which Alexa is always up on.   That's Alexa. She reminds me a lot of Murray and right now I am missing lots of things about it.  (Yes, I know, that's hard to believe. I even surprise myself.)  You know, I spent most of my senior year being so ready for graduation -- so ready to get out of Murray and away from classes. I didn't even think about what life would be like elsewhere.   Then I spent the summer in Lexington, where I was surprisingly very comfortable. I loved going to church to hear Mike Breaux preach. God met me there every Sunday. But didn't get involved more because I knew I would only be there for 10 weeks. I had friends there who I hung out with while I was in high school, so I didn't have to worry about making new ones.   Now I miss Lexington, too. And not even because Greg is there now. (Although I would love to be in the same city as him, too.)   I am fine in Louisville. I am just missing some of the comforts of the other places -- mainly my favorite people to be with. The emails and long-distant calls remind of me of that. I think about where I can make some friends here and my mind is blank. I enjoy working with Lori, who conveniently went to Murray State, too. That's an instant conversation starter right there. And Cara is here, but living on a pretty different schedule. And I miss her too often for her only living 30 minutes away. I also wish I had a church here that I loved.   But among the wishes and misses, I am blessed here. My family is close and I enjoy hanging out with them. My mom and I talk almost every day. I also get to see most of Cassie's soccer games. And because my brother lacks a license and a car but fortunately has a job, I take him to work sometimes. And I am definitely not complaining about Greg being a little more than an hour down I-64 and getting to see him about once a week.   I'm not unhappy, actually quite far from it, just continuing to deal with growing-up changes. You know, Peter Pan had a point.  And my only complaint about work tonight is my co-worker watching a war movie really loud. The constant gunshots give me a headache and make me tense. Other than that, I played a few games online and chatted with Alexa. And for the record, I don't like the word chatted, although it is better than "surfin' the web."

      I have been driving around in silence. Not really by choice, but because the Circuit City car stereo man took my CD player. He had it sent off and it better come back fixed in the 7-10 days I'm driving around in silence. It's supposedly getting cleaned and re-aligned. He said that tends to happen when CD players are used a lot. I can't help radio stations aren't very good.   Gosh, the excitement in my life this week just doesn't end: I rearranged my living room furniture. I discovered the library in Crescent Hill that is right down the road from my house. I watched West Wing while I talked to Jaclyn on the phone. I ate great homemade lasagna for my dad's birthday last night at my aunt and uncle's house. Oh, and my sister cut her fingers on a water nozzle thing at soccer practice and had to get some stitches.   It's CSI night!

      lots of times i feel like distance weakens friendships, but there are few rare ones that i know God maintains in my life for reasons - sometimes reasons i am not even aware of yet. this is from an email i got from jaclyn, one of those rare friends:   in the words of the golden girls theme song,   thank you for being a friend,  traveling down the road and back again. your heart is true, you're a pal and a confidant. and if you threw a party...   well, that's all the words i know.

      ok, tonight is totally a lower-case kind of night. mellow. content.  but not overly excited, and definitely not too dramatic.  well, here it is, the end of the much-anticipated saturday off work. did it live up to its expectations, considering it is a rare occasion in my life? no. but it did have its redeeming moments: eating and laughing with robinson, watching "drive me crazy" on a rainy afternoon while sitting in my comfy recliner, laughing with ryan and his brothers, beating ryan in scrabble by one point, receiving a true long-distant phone call from greg (usually we talk on my cell phone after 8 p.m. and on weekends so it doesn't use my minutes) and talking to cara on the phone three times.   i love my friends.  i wish the friends i hung out with this week lived closer. dinner with matt was fun, and normal, which was much-appreciated. ryan always makes me laugh. i'm sure living in colorado is good for kelly, but i sure miss her here. playing games with her family is hilarious. taboo wednesday made me laugh a lot. (i once had a professor that said "a lot" is a field, not a large amount of something. guess i just misused that. and i'm anal enough to recognize that, but not so anal i'm going to back to change it.) katie peter and matt are going to be back in louisville in december, though, so hopefully i'll get to hang out with them more often.   i love laughing.  my last entry i commented on my anticipation of two hours of CSI. well, it wasn't a two-hour episode. it was two one-hour episodes, which would have been good, but the second one was a rerun. how disappointing. my other disappointment: i didn't get to go bowling today. maybe greg will go with me tomorrow. but you know, if those are the two biggest disappointments in my week, my life is good. and i am thankful for it. nope, not just because it's the holiday season. just because God is good.

Katie Peter and I watched "Shrek" last night. Funny movie. And it was great to catch up with Katie. And my week only gets better. Good Thanksgiving food and family time tomorrow and a two-hour episode of CSI at night. Plus, I get to re-match Ryan in Scrabble and then attempt to beat him bowling. And I'm eat dinner with Matt on Friday. AND I get Saturday off of work.

      I'm surprised Ryan hasn't mentioned my lacking of posting.  I've actually had a good week of work so far. That's probably some prep for my night work that starts after Thanksgiving. Yep, five nights a week. Oh, and I have Wednesdays and Sundays off. Lovely.  Last night I went to an anniversary party for my friends Laura and Dave. We ate the top layer from their wedding cake from last November. It actually tasted pretty good. Strange tradition. Pretty grown up, too. But Greg came up, so I have already seen him twice this week, which is definitely not something to complain about. I hanging out with the same group of friends - college friends, gosh, that phrase in itself is grown up, too. But tonight I'll remember to tape "Survivor" and "CSI," unlike I did last night for "Dawson's Creek" and "Felicity."

       It was an eternal instant when the Creator smiles and said, 'It is good.' ... Such moments are necessary because they remind us that everythign is okay. The King is still on the throne and life is still worth living. Eternal instants remind us that love is still the greatest possession and the future is nothing to fear.  -Max Lucado  And this is the kind of person I want to be:  I have seen what is best for people here on earth. They should eat and drink and enjoy their work because the life God has given them on earth is short. God gives some people the ability to enjoy the wealth and property he gives them, as well as the ability to accept theit state in life and enjoy their work. They do not worry about how short life is, because God keeps them busy with what they love to do.   -Ecclesiastes 5:18-20 (NCV)

      I just got back from a whirlwind trip to Murray. But I had a great time hanging out with a few friends I really miss. Plus I bought gas twice for 98 cents -- the benefits of western Kentucky. I don't think I have  ever  paid less than $1 for gas. I also talked to my favorite (most challenging and encouraging) professor for about a hour yesterday. I need some encouragement about my journalism future, and she was definitely the right person to go to for a pep talk. And Jaclyn and I went to the lake for a little while yesterday. I love that place. But sitting at the lake sure didn't help my dreams of a house and boat on the lake down there. Oh well, that's what dreams are for.

      What a baseball game tonight. OK, Greg got his wish. I think I'm a sports fan. It's been a process, but I think this World Series has been the icing on the cake. And the fact Arkansas and Mississippi played the longest college football game ever added to it.  Well, I have to go to bed because I wore myself out cheering for the victorious Diamondbacks with my friends Laura and Dave.

      I broke 100 in the two games I bowled today. Been bowling with me? Then you know that's impressive. And the scores were consistent: 115 and 113. I came in second both times. No, more than two people were bowling. Five the be exact.

      What's up with the Yankees? I just don't know about hitting all those clutch, game-winning homeruns just when the Diamondbacks think they might actually win a game in New York. Those lucky Yankees. Or maybe luck is the stuff legends are made of. Yes, I'm still cheering for the Diamondbacks. Even though I think the mascot is stupid and they beat the Cardinals. Better for St. Louis to lose to the eventual champion, right? Right. So, maybe the Yankees luck won't make the trip to Phoenix with the pinstripes.  And to think I didn't get home from Lexington until 2 a.m. because I was watching (and enjoying) a baseball game.

      I'm bored. Saturdays are just so slow and it's frustrating to just sit here and wait for athletic directors and sports editors to call. Oh, and I keep hitting refresh on the KHSAA web page. Now at least I have this great chef salad from Wick's to eat. And if I'm still bored after I finish, I'll probably start reading my book.   Usually this crazy sports editor calls me about 15 times a night to give me scores or ask me to resend him some sports story he can't find on the wire. But he got to sit in Rupp Arena to watch UK win today, so it's a bit - well, a lot - quieter for me at work. It kind of makes me miss the pestering.

      Multiple conversations about last night's "Survivor" have prompted a posting about the game that becomes quite an addiction.  Lex gets on my nerves. I was surprised Big Tom and the annoying Kim (who should have stuck with the girl alliance) voted for Kim P. I got so excited when Lex didn't win immunity because I thought he was going. But then they show started making it seem like Lex was going, and that always means someone else is. I guess it's some production element that fools some people, but not me!  I was also sort of surprised Lex invited Big Tom on his reward. I don't know who I expected him to take, but I was disappointed because I think otherwise Big Tom might have voted for Lex. And what was Brandon wearing when the jury walked in? He's so weird. I'd be happy with Big Tom and Ethan as the final two. Then I think the jury would pick Ethan. Disregarding the fact that Mr. Soccer Player is hot, he's has good relationships with everyone, and they all seem to respect him.

      I read lots of newspapers at work. More specifically, there are 23 newspapers that I read and file - like we want back issues of some of these oh-so lovely Kentucky newspapers. (Although some are surprisingly well done.) Plus there are a few others that just go in a random pile because they aren't worth individually categorizing, according to somebody. I don't know who that somebody is, who decided what newspapers were worthy of their own piles. I would like to replace some of the so-called deserving ones with some from the random trash-like pile. So why am I talking about this? Because I'm procrastinating. The pile of newspapers on my desk would really like to make it the piles in the back, but that requires me to read them.

      Today was a country music on the radio day when I was driving to work. First I heard a song I like, but I don't know how sings it or what it's called. But there's a great line in it:  It's a great day to be alive. I know the sun still shines when I close my eyes.  Then I heard the Dixie Chicks "I Can Love You Better." Then I heard one of the best songs I have heard in a long time - "Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)" by Alan Jackson. It's about Sept. 11. And I was pleasantly surprised it didn't get cheesy. I know that sounds terrible, but the lyrics were consistently great through the whole thing. Now I just need to figure out how to get a hold of that song. I'll probably recruit Greg to download it for me. Here are the lyrics:   Where were you when the world stop turning on that September day Were you in the yard with your wife and children Or working on some stage in L.A. Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke  Rising against that blue sky Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor Or did you just sit down and cry  Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones And pray for the ones who don't know Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue And the heroes who died just doin' what they do Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer And look at yourself and what really matters  I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I could Tell you the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us And the greatest is love  Where were you when the world stop turning on that September day Teaching a class full of innocent children Or driving down some cold interstate Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor In a crowded room did you feel alone Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her Did you dust off that Bible at home  Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened And you close your eyes and not go to sleep Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages Or speak to some stranger on the street Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow Go out and buy you a gun Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin' And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns  Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers Stand in line and give your own blood Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family Thank God you had somebody to love  I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I could Tell you the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us And the greatest is love   I like the way the details illustrate the tension between griefing and hoping. The lyrics are just how I feel about so much of this stuff. And I have always loved the idea that faith, hope and love are good things from God, but love is the greatest. I once heard someone say that's because when we get to heaven we don't need faith and hope anymore. Seeing God won't require faith because we'll be living at the throne of God. And eternal life won't just be our hope, it will be our existence in the presence of God. But love is the greatest because God is love.   You can listen to  urlLink the song  too.  New subject: Kelly came over for lunch today. Yum, grilled cheeses. Then we played canasta (yes, the old people card game) and just talked about our dreamy way in the future plans, our more immediate future clear-as-mud plans, silly stuff and serious stuff. It was just good girl time, laughing and talking about everything and nothing. I miss that about college - the proximity that graded on my nerves and held me up.

      " urlLink A Beautiful Mind " is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It made me want to cry and laugh at the same time, and I wish I would have had a notebook with me because I can't remember all the great quotes I told myself as I heard them that I wanted to remember them. In the movie, John Nash's wife talks about how God must be a painter because of all the colors in the world. Later John Nash gives her an incredible prism that reflects all the possible colors. Being the mathematician he is, John Nash says he doesn't believe in luck, but rather believes in assigning value to things. He wants proof for everything but realizes that some things have to be felt with the heart and not reasoned in the mind.   Here's the song that I was repeating in my car this afternoon and now is repeating itself in my head:   each time you'd pull down the driveway i wasn't sure when i would see you again yours was a twisted blind sided highway no matter which road you took then oh you set up your place in my thoughts moved in and made my thinking crowded now we're out in the back with the barking dogs my heart the red sun your heart the moon clouded i could go crazy on a night like tonight when summer's beginning to give up her fight and every thought's a possibility and the voices are heard but nothing is seen why do you spend this time with me maybe an equal mystery  so what is love then is it dictated or chosen (handed down and made by hand) does it sing like the hymns of 1000 years or is it just pop emotion (handed down and made by hand) and if it ever was there and it left does it mean it was never true and to exist it must elude is that why i think these things of you i could go crazy on a night like tonight when summer's beginning to give up her fight and every thought's a possibility and the voices are heard but nothing is seen why do you spend this time with me may be an equal mystery  but you like the taste of danger it shines like sugar on your lips and you like to stand in the line of fire just to show you can shoot straight from you hip there must be a 1000 things you would die for i can hardly think of two but not everything is better spoken aloud not when i'm talking to you  oh the pirate gets the ship and the girl tonight breaks a bottle to christen her basking in the exploits of her thief she's a very good listener maybe that's all that we need is to meet in the middle of impossibility we're standing at opposite poles equal partners in a mystery (handed down and made by hand)  we're standing at opposite poles equal partners in a mystery  -Indigo Girls "Mystery"  I'm wearing this great shirt that Cara made me for Christmas. It has a collage that illustrates our friendship. (Well, she made the collage on a computer scanner and this iron-on material, not the actual shirt!) And for the about 13 years of friendship, she did pretty well simplifying it. There's also this great quote on it from "My So-Called Life," which unfortunately didn't stay on the air too long.   ...there's the people you've known forever. Who like...know you...in this way. That other people can't. Because they've seen you change. They've let you change.

      I'm eating an apple - a green apple - this morning 'cause I need to go grocery shopping desperately. Only a few slices of bread left, no milk, no orange juice, no waffles. That limits the breakfast options. Good think I had exactly one cup of sugar left to make Kool-Aid.   I've had some requests to update this, and normally my excuse would be that I don't have anything to say, which is actually never true, but I've had a great last few days, so I can come up with plenty to say right now.  Last night at work I re-read most of my past entries. A new friend (well, familiar stranger might be a better desciption) prompted me to want to read the randomness of the last several months of my life. It gives perspective on how much my attitude has changed, just in the last few weeks.  It snowed here today. A co-worker actually said the roads and sidewalks were slippery, more so walking across the street from the parking lot than anything else. But they weren't that bad when Lori and walked out of work at 12:30 a.m. Lori's car had lots of ice on it, but mine had almost none. So, using out matching ice scrapers - hers is blue, mine is red - I helped her while my car warmed up.   I'm a typcial Kentucky driver - I get tense when snow and ice are on the road. The only time I remember being really tense when I was driving that didn't involve snow or ice was the time in college when some friends and I were coming back from a Dave Matthews concert in Nashville. It was about 1 a.m. and I was driving through Land Between the Lakes and there were so many deer. I know the damage a deer can do to a car, and vice versa.   Christmas was good. My dad, Cassie and I went to see "The Majestic" on Christmas Eve while Kevin and my mom were at work. Then I just hung out home during the evening before my mom, Cassie and I went to midnight Mass. It's a little disappointing that, like most everything else my family does, our Christmas activities were segregated. But at least we were all together with some other relatives on Christmas day. My grandpa seemed to be doing OK, too. I just can't even begin to imagine how he's felt during the holidays without his wife of 55 years. Outwardly, he's holding up. Plus, my aunt and uncle from Wyoming have been in town for a week or so, and are staying another week or so. And my aunt and uncle from Canada will be here this weekend.  I got some practical gifts - a waffle maker, money, a neat floor lamp, a stereo, some clothes (including the garment that usually dictates when I do laundry, so now I can prolong it) - that will make my life and apartment even better. I say even better because, probably like much of America, I did my share of thinking about how blessed I really am - presents or not.  Speaking of this weekend, Jaclyn and Greg are coming into town and we're having a party at my apartment for New Year's. It'll be good to have our group of college friends (many who live in Louisville now) plus some other random friends from here together. It's the third year we've had a party - all conveniently at my parents' house or now my apartment - so it's a fun tradition we've got going. Louisville seems to service as a somewhat central location, so we're all hoping we can do something like this for a long time. But I won't get into the whole growing up, changing thing right now. I've about worn that topic out.  Funny story: (well, at least I think it's funny.) On Christmas Cassie and I went to get some beer and wine for my family. My aunt and uncle wanted wine and my uncle, grandpa and brother wanted beer. (SIDE COMMENT: Kevin doesn't need beer. He recently got his license back after the DUI he got in July. Now, to his defense, he was barely intoxicated, according to the breath test. BUT he's 19, there's no tolerance for drinking and driving - a measure I totally support. Anyway, I can't believe my mom said it was OK for him to drink a couple of beers, based on previous circumstances. OK, better at home than somewhere else, but still...) So, Cassie and I drive to Walgreens on Westport Road. (For those of you unfamiliar with Louisville, that's in wet Jefferson County about 20 minutes from our house in dry Oldham County.) Turns out they don't sell liquor. We both thought they did, but apparently we were wrong. So we drove about a block to a Rite-Aid, which advertised its liquor sales on the sign outside the door. We picked out two bottles of wine, beer, a Coke and some electrical tape (Cassie was leaving for a soccer tournament in Florida a few hours later and electrical tape serves as tap to wrap her foot. Yeah, I know, who knew?) and took them on the counter. Then the cashier said asked for both of our IDs. Well, Cassie's 18, you know, so her ID was pointless at this point. I gave her mine and she said she needed both of them because we were both in the store. The manager came over and more harshly said he couldn't sell the wine and beer to us because we both had to be 21. Whatever. That's retarded. He went into all of this crap about losing his license...blah, blah, blah. So, we abruptly left all of the stuff on the counter and just walked away. I was sort of being rude, but nothing compared to Cassie, who shouted "Rite-Aid is bullshit" on our way out the door. The manager said, "And you all have a nice day too." We waited until we got back to the car and laughed for a long time, basically all the way down the Gene Snyder and to U.S. 42 in Prospect, where we found two open liquor stores. Now, my family is not made up of alcoholics, but I was feeling like the wine and beer were totally not necessary, probably because I don't like either. Regardless, Cassie stayed in the car at the liquor store and I was super nice the nice old man in there. Not that Rite-Aid knew, but it seemed to balance out the situation or something. So, then I called my mom on the way home to make sure we weren't missing Christmas dinner. We had been gone longer than anybody probably expected us to be. Thankfully, the turkey was still cooking. But I told her the story, not knowing Kevin was on the phone, too. As soon as I finished he said, "Kristin, it's always like that in liquor stores." Well, I count on one hand the number of alcoholic drinks I've had, so I'm not exactly familiar with the liquor store practices. I'm still convinced Rite-Aid would have sold my mom the wine and beer had she walked in there, even with Cassie next to her. The manager and cashier said otherwise. I don't believe them. But it made for a good story and Cassie and I laughed - many times.  OK, Kelly and I are going to see "A Beautiful Mind" before I go to work this afternoon, so I need to go get ready. Even more so, I need to wake up. It's almost noon and I would really rather be back in my bed, underneath the two blankets - one of which is my comfy T-shirt quilt - and my T-shirt sheets. But it's good for me to be social before I return to high school basketball scores.

       Kentucky 66, Indiana 52   I wish I had bet with Adam. Why did I only bet the year the stinkin' Hoosiers won? Oh well, 9 wins in 11 meetings is a decent series record. And I wish Adam wasn't skiing so I could call him and remind him 14 points is a solid win. But I want to only because I'm competitive and I know it drives him crazy because he's more competitive than me.  My blog has suddenly showcased my increasing interest in sports. I'm not quit sure what's up with that.

The Cardinals beat the Vols 73-72 tonight with a crazy but amazing three-point shot that put them up by one with 1.3 seconds left. And that was after they hit two other last three-point shots to tie the game.   I like close basketball games, if you haven't gathered that.

      Sometimes I get hooked on a song - not necessarily a new song, just a song that fits my mood - and I play it repeatedly in my car. Lately that song has been "New Horizons" by David Gray.   Weight on my shoulders but Im walking so tall out into the new horizon wonder in everything no matter how great or small howlin' like the midnight howlin' like the midnight sun and this ain't no pale reflection this is the real thing new horizon new horizon within  And your heart ain't yours to control no matter how tight the reins love will find it's own direction a time to reap, a time to sow and many a time to cry in vain but now the time to celebrate  the glory of this imperfection same thing that's scrawled across the stars is written under our skin new horizon  new horizon within  Things come too easy, I get suspicious things come too slow, I get bored if it don't work out I get superstitious but if it does, oh my word  So Im gathering all the remnants of beauty from this wilderness in spin and now Im gonna light my own flame 'cause Im charged with the radiance of the dawn that's been so long breaking now there ain't nowhere there ain't nowhere I won't write your name there's a time to search for understanding sometime you just gotta sing new horizon new horizon within  Baby there's no need to get precious when you know that everything must change complacency, it can be so vicious turn this love into a cage  Same thing that's scrawled across the stars is written under our skin new horizon  new horizon within

      Well, my demanding readers want more insights into my soul. Who knew, right? That's what you're thinking, I know.  I wish I had something exciting to tell you about. But maybe it's better I don't. Like my momma always said, life's like a box of chocolates. OK, that's not what she always said. It went more like this: No news is good news. So, there you have it, my life.  But I'll fill you in on the mundane, since you asked.  In the last few days, I went shopping with my sister, ate lunch with Lori, ran some errands, mailed some Christmas cards, watched "Bounce," and took my sister to lunch and then home after her doctor "manipulated" her continuously injured toe so she can play soccer better. Exciting stuff, huh? Actually I don't mind. I like to be productive and too much drama is definitely not necessary.   Tomorrow is my day off. That makes me happy. And I scheduled a hair cut appointment for 8:45 a.m. What the heck was I thinking? Goodness, I do work nights, afterall. Oh well. My other plans include doing laundry at my grandpa's and watching "Dawson's Creek" and "Felicity" with Matt.   OK, I have to go watch the last three minutes of the UK-Duke game with sound now, which involves stepping away from my work computer.

      Well, my dear friend Laura who was kind enough to mail me one of my great presents today is dissatisfied with my last entry. So, this is the addition:   urlLink Laura Hancock  sent me a "go-go bag" from Bath and Body Works. (It's for me, the traveling journalist, according to her note.) Plus there were bottles of smell-good stuff in there. I'm looking most forward to the foot lotion.   Yes, Laura works at Bath and Body Works in Dyersburg, Tenn., so she got a discount. Where's Dyersburg, Tenn., you ask. I don't really know. Closer to Murray than Louisville is.  Anyway, I totally appreciate her gift, as well as my ornament from Jaclyn. Jaclyn knew my tree needed more than those colored ball ornaments from Big Lots.

      OK, it's Monday, so avid readers of my blog (alright, so maybe there is no such thing...) are predicting that if I went to Lexington, I'm going to talk about going to church at Southland and how much I love Mike Breaux.  And, guess what, you non-existent avid readers are right. (I guess if they don't really exist, they can't be right, but that's not the point.) Yes, I went to see Greg for part of the day, postponing his studying for finals by several hours. And Southland was  so  great. Right now the church is starting this three-year fund-raising campaign. To visiting people who are familiar with the church but don't belong, such a subject could get really old really fast. Well, not with Mike Breaux preaching.  He's amazing. He can preach on sacrificing financially in such a way that you want to listen, then he leads you into this deeper message that I totally believe is from God about sacrificing yourself for God and for others. But preach isn't the right verb. Mike Breaux celebrates who Jesus is to him. And challenges everyone who is listening to do the same. Being a Christian isn't about obeying rules and sitting in the pew for him. It's about loving Jesus with all your heart, all your mind and all your soul. And because that relationship runs deep and anchors his heart, he wants to obey the commands of God in order to see the promises of God.  Yes, I know all of this in the Bible. And Jesus has said all of this for a couple thousand years - to Peter and Paul and to me. But it's so refreshing for me to walk into that church and know that regardless of the prepared sermon, Jesus is going to do at least one thing in my heart. He's going to pull me closer to him, challenge to me to be His for that hour, which leads to that day and into the rest of the week and for lifetime. And you know, I think I'm fortunate enough to get that, to have that constant, unchanging figure in my life. God knows everything else around me is going to change. But what's in my heart is someone who is more steadfast than person will ever been and more forgiving and loving than I could ever ask anyone else to be.  Anyway, so Mike Breaux led this celebration at church Sunday. And while lots of members of that church donated who knows how much money, people like me who were lucky enough to be there just got to be in the presence of God and rest in knowing it only gets better from here. But not only did Mike Breaux preach, but he also led the songs. I love worship there. While it's trendy and production-like with lights, an orchestra pit and screens that remind me of a basketball arena, it seems real to me.   OK, so I just wrote more than anybody wants to read about my church experience yesterday - no, my God experience yesterday. Can you imagine if I'm this excited more than 24 hours after worshipping in a man-made building that actually resembles a gym more than a sanctuary how truly satisfied I'm going to be spending an eternity in heaven at the throne of God, singing and celebrating in a peace that has no time constraints? One time somebody said to imagine the most beautiful place you have ever seen on earth. Now, think, Jesus said He was going to prepare a place for us, and that was almost 2000 years ago. What an amazing place he must be preparing because He hasn't come back to get us yet.

      I wrote a story today. I drove to Franklin, Ky., which is closer to Nashville, Tenn., than Louisville to cover the memorial mass for Robert Tools. He's the guy who received the world's first self-contained artificial heart. He lived for 151 days with it, which is much longer than doctors said he had to live before he got the heart, and even longer than they originally thought he'd live with the heart. He died last week and today was the second memorial service for him. Yesterday there was one at the hospital in Louisville where the surgery was performed.  So, not only did I write a story, but I get almost $100 for mileage (280 miles round trip) and 5 1/2 hours overtime (lucky me, I still got to take scores when I finished writing). Good thing, 'cause I'm thinking my family probably wants Christmas presents  If you didn't catch on, it was a good day at work, even though my story is obviously sad.

      And "CSI" was so good last night. The case involved one of the agent's daughters - well, actually the captain's daughter. A little hint of someone's professional life mixing with his personal life is realistic and a good twist for "CSI."   OK, I'm starting to sound like a TV critic. And I even watched these shows when I got home from work at 1 a.m.

      For you "Survivor" fans:  I'm disappointed Lex assumed Kelly voted for him last tribal counsel and rallied her former alliance against her. And what was Brandon thinking going along with Lex? With her trust-worthy reputation, Teresa got lucky and kept her vote against Lex quiet.   I don't know if I can handle all this deception. I know it's a game with a bunch of people I don't know. But my competitive nature comes out.   Now I'm definitely rooting against Lex. And to think, hot soccer player Ethan took Lex on his reward trip with him. Lex didn't deserve it.

      In many ways, yesterday was as close to perfect as days come, especially in December. Yes, Ryan, I'm going to talk about the weather.   It was 73 degrees in Louisville. Thanks to my friend Lori at The Associated Press, I know that was a record-breaking temperature for Dec. 5 in Louisville. Greg came up here around lunch time and after we ate tuna sandwiches, we went to Seneca Park and threw the Frisbee. I actually got sweaty, which is something I really don't enjoy unless it is December and it makes me forget it could theoretically snow tomorrow. Then we went exploring near this creek in Seneca, well, maybe Cherokee Park. (They run together back there and I honestly don't know which is which. But that's not the point.) It was really peaceful and just a great day to be outside. Later, I cooked dinner - chicken fingers, green beans, corn and rolls. That's pretty much a real meal in my eyes.   After dinner we went to Sarah's for her ornament making party, which was actually fun although it sounds totally way too grown up. We all just unloaded our craft supplies and got creative. Too bad a few of the people there were actually artistic. Lori and I made snowmen out of Styrofoam balls. Except for burning myself with the hot glue gun, I had a great time being with my friends. We never really have time to get together like that, so it's always fun when we do. Although, sort of contrary to that never getting together remark, we are having a graduation party for Cara next Wednesday at my apartment. I'm glad my friends are open to having get togethers on Wednesdays. They definitely don't have to cater to my schedule, but I like it that they consider it.   I'm being spoiled, though. I went to Lexington for the whole day on Sunday. Greg came up here yesterday and stayed until about noon today. I'm going to Lexington this Sunday for church and lunch before Greg returns to studying for his finals. Then he's coming back on Wednesday for Cara's party. Do you know how great that is to me?

      true story i got in my e-mail today:   In a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was busily working when a new voice came over the loud speaker asking for a carry out at  check register 4. Kurtis was almost finished, and wanted to get some fresh air, and decided to answer the call. As he approached the check-out stand a distance smile caught his eye, the new check out girl was  beautiful. She was an older woman (maybe 26, and he was only 22) and he fell in love.  Later that day, after his shift was over, he waited by the punch clock to find out her name. She came into the break room smiled  softly at him and took her card punched out, then left. He looked at her card, BRENDA. He walked out only to see her start walking up the road. The next day, he waited outside as she left the supermarket, and offered her a ride home.  He looked harmless enough, and she accepted. When he dropped her off, he asked if maybe he could see her again, outside of work. She simply said it wasn't possible. He pressed and she explained she had two children and she couldn't afford a baby-sitter, so he offered to pay for the baby-sitter. Reluctantly she accepted his offer for a date for the following Saturday.  That Saturday night he arrived at her door only to have her tell him that she was unable to go with him. The baby-sitter had called and canceled.To which Kurtis simply said, "Well, let's take the kids with us."   She tried to explain that taking the children was not an option, but again not taking no for an answer, he pressed. Finally Brenda,  brought him inside to meet her children. She had an older daughter who was just as cute as a bug, Kurtis thought, then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair, he was born a paraplegic with Down's syndrome.   Kurtis asked Brenda, "I still don't understand why the kids can't come with us?"   Brenda was amazed. Most men would run away from a woman with two kids, especially if one had disabilities. Just like her first husband and father of her children did.   That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the kids, went to dinner and the movies. When her son needed anything Kurtis would take  care of him. When he needed to us the rest room, he picked him up out of his chair, took him, brought him back.The kids loved Kurtis.   At the end of the evening, Brenda knew this was the man she was going to marry and spend the rest of her life with. A year later, they were married and Kurtis adopted both of her children and since they have added two more kids.   So what happened to the stock boy and check out girl? Well, Mr. and Mrs. Kurt Warner, now live in St. Louis, where he is employed by the St. Louis Rams and plays quarterback.   GO RAMS.

      i went dress shopping today. i'm sure glad lori and cara went with me. it's pretty funny, though. lori is all about weddings. she's been in about six, i think. and cara totally doesn't want to admit the remote possibility of liking this stuff. but we all had such a good time. i've had such good girl time lately, thanks to lori and i having some wednesdays off. anyway, back to wedding dresses...cara and i were in the dressing room (yes, it totally takes another person to help put on a wedding dress) and i turned to her and said, "what am i doing? i'm totally trying on wedding dresses." yeah, you're like, duh, kristin, you were in david's bridal and bridal warehouse trying on dreses, what do you mean you were asking yourself that? i mean....I'M GETTING MARRIED. ahh! ok, i've only been engaged a week. a week today. well, it says thursday at the top of this entry, but only because it's 1 a.m., well a little after. yes, i have this beautiful ring on my finger, have talked to greg's mom (ah...my future mother-in-law twice this week), booked the chapel, bought a bridal magazine (yes, only one so far)...but it took trying on like 10 dresses in a cramped dressing room with my best friend since i was 9 for me to realize that I'M GETTING MARRIED. and it's totally such a wonderful, wonderful thing. it's terrible i just typed "like." i should say "like," well using it like (haha) that, i mean, much less type it. ok, that statement before that last tangent isn't totally true. (hard to keep up, isn't it?) i have turned to greg multiple times since he surprised me last week and just said, "we're getting married." and then of course i smiled, inside and out. but, still, today was the first time for the big girly part of it, you know?  well, after two big bridal stores, we ate lunch. we were worn out. eating and trying on dresses, which, by the way, run completely small compared to other clothes, are two activities that don't go together. ok, back to the size thing. now, i don't really care what size i wear. i mean, when i think of sizes i totally see the sign on the back of the restroom stalls at college that the women's center put up to try and create awareness of eating disorders and offer its help. one of the facts was that marilyn monroe wore a 14...basically, don't get stressed if you can't fit into a 6 like our culture promotes. ANYWAY...wedding dresses are the one thing in fashion that should run big, i should normally wear a 12 and walk into a bridal store and be able to fit into an 8, not the other way around. i'm totally not into impressing people with what i wear, but it the dress i'm going to wear on my wedding day...the day i'm going to walk down an aisle and stand in front of lots of people (how many you ask...i have no idea!). i hate to be the center of attention, which is something i really need to get over before aug. 3. gosh, the tangents. anyway, mentally bridal stores are backward, that's all.  ok, back to my day with lori and cara. later we went to see "i am sam." it's that movie with sean penn as the retarded father who wants to keep custody of his daughter who is more intelligent - academically speaking - than him. it's intense in some parts, but such a great movie. then we just hung out at my apartment until our wednesday night shows came on. actually, lori and i played some super mario brothers - yes, the first one on the old, classic nintendo. then we watched "dawson's creek" and "glory days." despite its nielsen (i have more trouble spelling that word...) rating, "glory days" gets better each week. and joey kissed the professor today. but she's a good girl, so she freaked out, but preview hint that it isn't over. ah, crazy. but then lori and i were hungry. so we went to applebee's, me thinking it was half-price appetizer time. but the one we went to didn't have the great late happy hour like the other ones i've been to. she and i go to restaurants and stay in there a really long time, like over an hour. ok, that's totally wrong, that should read "such as more than a hour." ah, i'm copy editing my own speech.   so, lori and i spent a bit more than 12 hours together today and cara was there for about 10 of them. like i said before, great girl bonding time.   um, i've just typed a lot, what's gotten into me? when i use lowercase letters i type more, and faster, so at least i chose the right method of typing tonight. i mean, not right, because this is totally not grammatically correct, but right for my mood and mind. and the music choice is helping, too: train. i really love "meet virginia" and "drops of jupiter," but most train songs, at least the ones i'm listening to, are so much more mellow. that's not a complaint, just an observation.  ok, i really should go to bed, mainly because i'm starting to drive myself crazy. what must you few and far between readers think? well, if you have made it this far in this much-too-long entry, you're at least as crazy as me. gosh, i'm sure making you feel good if you haven't typed in a different web address already. seriously, i'm glad you made it this far, but, still, i don't know what that says about us. night.

      Good thing I can still cheer for the Rams and don't have to resort to just turning on the halftime show. Plus, Greg got someone to work his Sunday night shift at the library, so he'll be able to watch the game with me. Yay! He's going to be here this weekend, which makes me happy.  I got to listen to Mike Breaux preach yesterday. I love him. Well, I don't know him, but I sure do love what he has to say.   After church, Greg took me, Mark and Ginger (his married friends we play cards with in Lexington) to Rafferty's with a gift certificate he had. Then we played two games of spades, both which were very close. Yes, that's my way of making myself feel better for being on the losing side both times. But, really, it wasn't by much.   I got to see Katie Quigley yesterday, too, which is always fun. She brought me some purple flowers when she came over to Greg's yesterday, but I left them there. I doubt they will still be alive when Greg comes into town Friday night. So those boys better appreciate them, they are awfully pretty. Why do we use "awfully" as an adverb with some thing positive like "pretty"?

      this morning greg called and woke me up, we chatted... then he said something was suppose to be delivered to my apartment, and i should check to see if it was there. i did. lucky me, i had a box of flowers waiting for me. of course, i only discovered this after i decided, yeah, he sounded weird on the phone, but i'm sure it would be worth getting out of bed for. oh, and after i found my glasses. so i turned to go back inside my apartment, and greg walks around the corner. he had called me on a cell phone. oh, the cell phone he borrowed from his roommate. he is totally better than the beautiful tulips that are sitting in the blender on the kitchen table. blender? yeah, i didn't have a vase and the portion of the blender works fine.  so my heart was beating fast and i hugged greg for a long, long time. i didn't say much. it was the morning, and i don't talk too much in the morning. plus i was just enjoying hugging him.  then he gave me a letter. it was amazing, really. he said totally wonderful things about me, about our relationship and what God was going to do in our relationship. it was a reminder of why i love him. so, half way through reading the letter, i realize what's going on. i hurried through the last half, totally not even retaining what i'm reading, which is slightly ridiculous because it was such a beautiful letter. so, he's watching me. and when i look at him when i'm basically finished reading, he's kneeling on the floor, so cute between my couch and coffee table. i don't give him time to say anything, and i totally hug him. then he said, wait, i have something to ask.   yeah, he asked me to marry him when i finally gave him room to breathe.   i said yes.  well, actually i paused and just looked at him, fell more in love with him, and then said yes.  we had a perfect day together. it was a peaceful sign from God that this is right, that He's in this.   oh, so, august 3. yes, that is this coming august 3. that's six months from now. but that's about all we know so far. it was good for me, the anal, perfectionist planner, to just enjoy greg today and not clutter my head with plans, although, i'm sure that part will come soon, well, at least it probably has to.   i'm so glad greg woke me up this morning. and one of my favorite parts: it was wednesday, january 23. it wasn't christmas, or valentine's day, or even february 7, which is when we met four years ago. no, january 23, a better day than any in my life.

      When I used to have to be at work at 10 a.m., I got up in time most mornings to go on walks - brisk walks - before I took a shower and got ready to go. Well, now I don't have to be at work until 4:30 p.m., but have completely neglected the walks through my neighborhood. Yep, I'm a slacker. Well, this morning - well, 11:30 a.m. is barely morning - I went on a walk. It was great. I felt good getting out there and walking - walking briskly - and the weather was beautiful. So maybe it'll become a habit again.   I read "A Walk to Remember." Lori let me borrow it because Nicholas Sparks is her favorite author and because the movie version comes out soon. It has Mandy Moore and the guy from "Once and Again" in it. In the book his name is Landon. What a great name. Anyway, the book was good, so now I want to see the movie. See,  urlLink Alexa , you aren't alone.  I'm driving to Ashland tonight to write a feature story on  urlLink O.J. Mayo  who plays at Rose Hill Christian. I'll get to write a good story - even though it is far from a new story people are dying to hear about - and get a heck of a mileage check.

      I had a good weekend. Greg came to see me Friday night. We watched the Kentucky game and played an intense game of Uno at Dave's on Saturday. Then I worked. Greg came downtown that night so we could eat at my favorite Mexican restaurant. After church on Sunday we played games (euchre, hearts and password) with Katie and Aaron at my apartment. Four competitive people playing games makes for a fun time. Greg and I won password. Greg won hearts. Katie and Aaron won euchre. Oh, then Aaron got Tetris out. That becomes quite an obsession, especially when Aaron kept initiating all these challenges. The best: who could get the most lines on level 19. Do you know how fast those pieces fall on level 19? Stinkin' fast. Anyway, guess who won. Yep, me. I got 14 lines on level 19. We also watched football yesterday. I love it that lots of those promotions for the Super Bowl have "Desire" by U2 on them. I can't wait for halftime. Not being a NFL fan, I haven't really followed any teams all year. I have some opinions, but they are that deep and don't really go that far. Here they are: I like that the Browns beat the Ravens twice this season. I like that the Bengals got off to a better start than the Titans. Kurt Warner is a good guy. OK, that's about it. Conclusion: I'm cheering for the Rams. Yes, that was decided before they beat the Packers yesterday.

      Sometimes people have way too much time on their hands. Sometimes their boredom makes me laugh. Sometimes I want to give them some work to do.   Regardless, here's some jokes from George Carlin, thanks to a bored friend.   People who ask, "Can I ask you a question?" Didn't really give me a choice there, did ya buddy?  When something is "New & Improved".  Which is it?  If it's new, there has never been anything before it.  If it's an improvement then there must have been something before it!  Can you believe how many award shows they have now? They have awards for commercials. The Cleo Awards. A whole show full of commercials. I taped it and then I fast-forwarded through the whole thing.  My wife's from the Mid-west. Very nice people there. Very wholesome. They use words like 'Cripes.' For Cripe's sake. Who would that be, Jesus Cripes? The son of 'Gosh?' of the Church of 'Holy Moly'. I'm not making fun of it. You think I wanna burn in 'Heck'?

       Wallowing in shame, remorse, self-hatred, and guilt over real or imagined failings in our past lives betrays a distruct in the love of God. It shows that we have not accepted the acceptance of Jesus Christ and thus have rejected the total sufficiency of his redeeming working. Preoccupation with our past sins, present weaknesses, and character defects gets our emotions churning in self-destructive ways, closes us within the mighty citadel of self, and preempts the presence of a compassionate God.  -Brennann Manning in "Ruthless Trust"   What's the price of two or three pet canaries? Some loose change, right? But God never overlooks a single one. And he pays even greater attention to you, down to the last detail - even numbering the hairs on your head! So don't be intimidated by all this bully talk. You're worth more than a million canaries.  -Luke 12-6-7 (The Message)  In reference to those verses, Brennan Manning wrote, "God, by definition, is thinking of me."  He's thinking of you, too.

      Cara and I hung out today before I came to work. Apparently finding the time to get together is just short of a miracle - we hadn't seen each other since New Year's Eve at my apartment. She introduced me to maybe my new favorite store - Organized Living. Fits my personality, huh? Anyway, it's over in The Summit with several of my other favorite stores and sells lots of crazy things I would never really think of that just make a perfectionist happy. Cara went to buy a CD holder thing (which is one of the normal items they sell), and when we got to the check-out the cashier asked, "Did you all have fun?" I caught him looking at us once, and I think he noticed how silly we were being and how many things we commented about.  I can't wait to watch the new CSI that is sitting in my VCR just waiting for me to push play when I get home.

      Laura commented on heterological. I figured she would. (Remember the onomatopoeia entry?)  Today was my day off, spent pretty much entirely with Lori. No complaints, though. It was totally great girl time. We went to lunch at Ditto's, where I think I have never been. Then we watched "The Royal Tenenbaums." Hilarious. One of my favorite lines was when Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) said she met this guy when she was in the ocean and he just rowed up in a canoe. Yep, a movie filled with completely random stuff - of course I would like it. And it was actually intelligent, no just random humor. Then we drove around the neighborhood Rick Pitino supposedly lives in. Like we could pick out which oversized home is his. But seriously, these houses are amazing, although really nobody I know lives in such places. Some of them reminded me of bed and breakfast resort-type places where rich people would vacation. Of course, normal is relative, much like weird, and to some people those mega-homes are as normal as grilled cheese, tator tots and Dr. Pepper are to me. Anyway, then Lori and I ate dinner with her two roommates. Then it was "Dawson's Creek" time, followed by "Glory Days," the new Wednesday WB show until "Felicity" comes back in April. It's another Kevin Williamson product, probably why it totally reminded me of "Dawson's Creek" meets "Scream." The first week got my approval, but we'll have to give it another episode or two to prove itself. Right, like I'm such the qualified critic.  I feel like Lori and I have been friends for a long time, but really only since sometime in September. God's way of placing the perfect people in our paths is planned better than I could ever dream. I was going for the p alliteration there, but ran out of perfect p words toward the end. You know, paraphernalia and plethora are good p words, but they weren't going to fit in that phrase perfectly.

      Ryan taught me a new word tonight: heterological.  I looked up in the dictionary, and it had some definition relating to biology. So I thought Ryan was crazy. Why would he want to teach me a science word, especially when he told me it meant a word that does not define itself. (Remember palindromes?) But then he told me Ann learned it in her philosophy class, so I started thinking maybe he wasn't completely crazy. So I typed it in Yahoo, just to see what would come up. And what do you know, Ryan knows what he's talking about.   Here's the definition: A word is heterological if it does not apply to itself. Long is heterological.

      Today between eating lunch with Greg at Fazoli's. (Do you know how good those breadsticks are?) and interviewing some students and professor at Asbury, I relaxed at Joseph-Beth. What a great bookstore. Oh, that was after I went to the Fayette Mall and found the sweater I had been wanting for only $30, compared to the $68 at Abercrombie. Thanks to a sale at Express. Anyway, in the bookstore (See, I didn't forget my point.) I read some magazines, one of which was about journaling. Yes, a magazine devoted to journaling, and to think those writers and editors come up with new articles about journaling however often the magazine comes out. Writing about writing. Interesting, and come to think about it, that's what I'm doing now. Anyway, an article by David Allen (No, I have no idea who he is, I'm just trained to cite my source.) had some good quotes about journaling, or, rather, words about words.   Detach yourself from the details of life, and you'll be free to experience more rewarding experiences.  ...being busy is not the same things as tending to what's important.  Dump your worries and obligations onto paper. Clear your mind, and start living the life your envisioned.

      Some Steven Wright humor:  Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections?  Is it true that cannibals don't eat clowns because they taste funny?  Whose cruel idea was it for the word "lisp" to have an "s" in it?  How come abbreviated is such a long word?  What hair color do they put on the driver's licenses of bald men?  Do Lipton employees take coffee breaks?  Don't sweat petty things...or pet sweatythings.  42.7 percent of all statistics are made up on the spot.

      It was beautiful out today. Well, it was a little cloudy when I came to work, but before that it was a perfect January day. It's been awhile since I talked about the weather. Come to think of it, it's been awhile since I talked to Ryan.  When I went to the post office today 17 people were in line in front of me. And about 30 seconds later, six more were behind me. You would have thought it was Christmastime again or April 14. But no, it was about 1:30 p.m. on Jan. 14.  And I bought a calendar today for $3 - totally the advantage of waiting until mid-January to buy it. The Absolut bottle decorated as a Christmas tree on my 2001 calendar was getting old, so I decided it was time to buy a current one. Sure, the selection was limited, but the price was so right. I looked at two different stores, and who would have thought so many dog calendars even existed? Well, I did buy Mark a Saluki calendar for one of his secret Santa presents at work, but that was a totally personalized gift for the Southern Illinois grad. Plus he knows how ugly I think they are and I know how great he thinks they are. Anyway, way too many dog calendars are still for sale. The one I bought has these great pictures of people in love, well, all different kinds of love - an old couple in love at the laundromat, a young couple who just got married on the beach, family and friendship love.   urlLink Laura  posted some adorable pictures of her niece and nephew.

       Celebrated God all day, every day. I mean, revel in him! Make it as clear as your can to all you meet that you're on their side, working with them and not against them... . Don't fret or worry. Instead of worrying, pray. Let petitions and praises shape your worries into prayers, letting God know your concerns. Before you know it, a sense of God's wholeness, everything coming together for the good, will come and settle down. It's wonderful what happens when Christ displaces worry at the center of your life.  -from Philippians 4 in The Message   ...Take your everyday, ordinary life - your sleeping, eating, going-to-work, and walking-around life - and place it before God as an offering. Embracing what God does for you is the best thing you can do for him. Don't become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking. Instead, fix your attention on God. You'll be changed from the inside out. Readily recognize what he wants from you, and quickly respond to it.  -from Romans 12 in The Message

      Greg and I ate lunch today with Katie and her boyfriend Brad, who I think is so great for her. We laughed a whole lot and ate lots of chips and salsa. I can't really ask for much more.   The Wildcats need to want to win more. That's my opinion after watching today's game. Yeah, I'm sure there are technical things they could do better, but being passionate would help.

      Oh, I almost forgot. Survivor comments:  Way to go Ethan, the hot, soccer-playin' introvert. A 5-2 vote.  Good move, Kim, voting off Lex. Although I think she could have won against Lex. It through me for a loop when she won immunity because I didn't know which of the three guys would be the next to go. Oh, but it was unnecessary for Kim to insult Big Tom during the last tribal council. Although, I guess she knew Big Tom was voting for Ethan. That alliance had taken those three guys far. But Kim J. did play it smart with Kim P.'s question.   Speaking of the last tribal coucil, Kelly was mean. She was right when she said she the sorest loser there. Come on, it's a game.  The reunion: I forgot how annoying Lindsey is. Silas did have some bad luck with the switch because I think he would have become a better player. He just messed up early siding with annoying Lindsey and Brandon. Kim P. played smart and got lucky in the switch and overcame that.

      Thanks to my work season tickets, I got to sit in the 10th row at Rupp Arena last night. Despite the loss, Greg and I had a good time. The only other complaint would be the 13-year-old girl directly behind me that definitely wins my award for most annoying fan. She dressed like she thought she was three times her age and had this obnoxious, squeaky voice. I agreed with some of her statements - Why is Bogans back in the game? Why is Fitch on the bench? - but really, it wasn't necessary to yell - uh, squeak - from tip off until the last fragment of a second.  It's taking everything I have to not read the story on the wire about who won "Survivor." I must wait to watch the three hours of television myself when I leave work.   (OK, so I'm exaggerating. It's not taking "everything" I have. But Letterman is on and the top 10 list just involved all the survivors...and that makes me want to know.)  Speaking of work. I have been busy tonight. So busy it's a little after midnight and I still have a pile of newspapers on my desk. But those will have to wait until tomorrow.

      I'm eating a snickerdoodle. That's such a funny word.  Speaking of words, remember one of my favorites? Yep, palindrome. The Courier-Journal had a great feature package on palindromes and the year 2002 being one itself. The article was written with lots of palindromes and the headline was 'nuf fun? How hilarious is that? Pretty darn hilarious. There were some good examples of palindrome phrases. Here are some of my favorites:  Lonely Tylenol Top a potato tot atop a pot Go hang a salami! I'm a lasagna hog! Anna: Did Otto peep? Otto: Did Anna?  Also, the article had this quote from Stephen J. Chism, who actually wrote a book about palindromes. It totally fits me, and maybe it explains why I like palindromes.    I believe that human beings are fascinated with palindromes because, in an uncertain world, they provide a sense of order through their perfect balance and symmetry. At the same time, perhaps because they are such enigmatic and curious things, they put us in touch with mystery.   And just so you know, palindrome comes from a Greek word that means running back again. So, there you have it. Palindromes.  I am so wired. I have pretty much been like this for two days. You know, if you play with the letters "wired" they become "weird" very easily. Appropriate at this moment.

      Crazy but good day... First, I got up this morning and wondered just for a second why my alarm was going off at 8 a.m. Then I remembered I was going to the Titans game with Greg, some of his family and two of his friends. OK, good enough, I got out of bed. When I got in the shower, I looked out the window (Yes, my shower has a window in it, but it blurred at the bottom so nobody can see in. But the top is clear.) and saw snow on the ground. Then I asked myself again what I was doing: going to a football in the snow? Well, turns out the snow only went a little passed E-town.   The game... My first NFL game was fun, even though it rained through most of the first quarter.  Then everything was going fine, we ate at Cracker Barrel when we got back to E-town. But when Greg dropped me off at my car, it wouldn't start. To make a long story short (Yeah, can you believe Kristin is making a long story short?!), AAA came and jump started my car, even though I thought it was the starter and not the battery. Guess I was wrong. I ended up having to pay about $20 for the jump start because my mom hadn't paid the AAA bill for the new year yet. Oh well, everything worked out, now I'm warm and cozy in my apartment.

      I have been wanting to write a poem since my grandma died. That was Oct. 14. And I'm just now feeling like I have something to say, and laundry, of all things, prompted some creativity.  THE MCADAM HOUSE  It's a chore, really, carrying an overflowing pink laundry basket with a stuffed blue laundry bag on top into Poppy's house. Once inside I forget it's 37 degrees outside because the 74 degrees inside is a bit overwhelming. Heading straight from the back door through the family room, I plop the basket and bag on the floor, invariably losing a sock or wash cloth on the way.  Whites, darks, towels and maybe a pile of red/purple/brown -  as Poppy watches my routine every other week, he still stares, probably wondering how one person can dirty this many clothes, use this many towels.  Reruns of L.A. Law and M.A.S.H fill an otherwise quiet house and Poppy always offers me a leftover Krispy Kreme. He sits in his recliner  and I sit in the chair that reminds me of Nanny. A few weeks before she died in October, she rested in that chair while Poppy napped in his. While I drifted in and out of sleep on the nearby couch, I thought about their 55 years together - building a home raising a family loving.  Laundromats are sometimes too cluttered for a place that stands for cleanliness. There people come and go,  telling new stories, seeing new strangers. Here I wash my clothes in the cleanest place possible. Here I dry my towels in the comfort of home. Here I fold my T-shirts in the place of old stories: my favorite cheesey potatoes on the Christmas dinner table the perfect cinnamon toast for breakfast games of Bingo for dimes,  or quarters if the grandkids were lucky the worn pencils, crossword puzzles  and a dictionary on the kitchen table and the 5-inch TV showing the Wildcats in black and white.  Four loads later I always leave with more than my basket and bag, and the leftover food,  or the small kitchen appliance Poppy swears he'll never use, or the books or games that he says he doesn't need anymore. With Poppy's generosity  and strength to love life despite Nanny's absence, laundry becomes less a chore and more a reminder my family shares more than a name, and for that my heart and life are blessed.

      I made some minor changes.  AT SIXTH AND BROADWAY   While I sat in the warmth of my car,  singing along with Adam Duritz,  I thought about how blessed I am  because my laughs have always outnumbered my tears. I waited for the light to turn green as   people crossed the street,  leaving the same seven-story building  I was getting ready to enter. With the night shift, I traded my clunky black dress shoes and pants that required ironing for jeans and a pair of gray New Balance.   A minute later my glove-covered hands  were in my coat pockets with my eyes fixed  across Broadway waiting for WALK to appear in white.  As strands of hair criss-crossed my face,  I thought about my pseudo-grown-up life in this new year:  I rest comfortably in the arms of familiarity while  my mind is intrigued by 1 a.m. conversations.  Are all guys like Harry when he met Sally? Emotions run deeper, decisions reflect character  and hearts aren't playing fields.  Hearts are fragile in even the toughest men.  Peter Pan had such a good point,  but I'm learning that's truly a fairytale.  And I slipped into the revoling door  of the work that seems to have become my life.  After I've said "Associated Press, this is Kristin"  more times than I care to count  while my wrist warned me of carpel tunnel syndrome  and my contacts begged me to look away from the computer screen,  the chilly midnight air is somehow refreshing.  And instead of waiting at the crosswalk,  downtown is asleep enough for me to  look both ways and cross Broadway  somewhere between Sixth and Armory.  Why can't life be like that -  somewhere between black and white?

      Tonight the guy who calls in Louisville Butler basketball scores told me I remind him of the David Letterman's secretary who he calls on Mondays to talk about her weekend. I have seen her before, but can't really remember how she acts. He specifically commented on her laugh. I'm thinking it was a compliment. He's the same guy that always says, "Go, Colonels!" when we get off the phone, like I care about my alma mater's high school basketball team. You know, it's OK to cheer for your college's team after you are no longer in school, but high school seems a little obsessive to me.

      This morning - well, this afternoon - I stared at the butterfly picture Jaclyn gave me for Christmas that's hanging in my bathroom. The quote about change on it was rather appropriate for my state of mind:   Change is the essence of life. Be willing to surrender what you are, for what you could become.   I build walls around my heart when change comes. I don't accept change like I know I should. I say should because it's part of life, not because anybody expects me to deal with anything a certain way. I'm not the same person I was four years ago. Heck, I'm not the same person I was six months ago, or even a month ago. And in changing, relationships change too. And when they change, I can't sit back and treat every thing like I'm still 18. I also have to remember that I'm not the only one changing. The people I love and respect change too.  Butterflies are an important symbol in my life because they remind of the night I sat in the noise of a sanctuary and the silence of my heart almost exactly six years ago (Martin Luther King weekend of 1996) and promised God I would surrender my life and heart to Him. I've done my best to keep that promise. And when I let Him down, He forgives me without hesitation. When I let myself and others down, I completely lose sight of grace, even when others are standing with open arms, waiting for me to accept their forgiveness. If the Creator of the universe - every last drop of water in the ocean and every hair on my head - can forgive me, why can't I do the same?   Butterflies don't start as things of beauty. They start out virtually helpless, having to completely transform into beauty. The transformation isn't something they have control over, it's part of nature, part of their purpose on earth.   I'm going to change. My family is going to change. The people who know me the best are going to change. The people I know the best are going to change. Friendships are going to change. Relationships are going to change. But change doesn't have to be bad. If I let it, I bet it can be the most refreshing moments of my life. And I might as well let it because I'm going to be transformed over and over again and am only going to break my own heart trying to remain a caterpillar. Butterflies really are more beautiful.

      Laura brought another word that doesn't really fit its definition to my attention: onomatopoeia. I agree with her. Word, definition and concept don't really match up. Man, are we dorks or what?  And I also want to add my excitement that U2 is playing the half-time show of the Super Bowl. That's infinite times better than last year's smorgasbord of pop acts.

      This story ran on the wire Dec. 28. It's good to know some people in corporate America are thinking like this:  LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) _ Employees on the sixth floor of Brown-Forman Corp. are talking instead of typing.  Last summer, David Dearie declared that the 26 staffers working for him in the liquor giant's international wines division would observe what has come to be called e-mail-free Friday.  On the last day of each workweek, along with their jackets and ties, high heels and pantyhose, they shed their dependence on Internet communication. Violators face a $10 fine.  "It's been difficult at times, but it has worked," said Dearie, senior vice president and managing director for Brown-Forman Wines International. "If we receive an e-mail on a Friday, we pick up the phone and talk with whoever sent it."  Dearie, 40, insists he's not against technology, though he admits to missing the days when the daily post brought letters along with the junk mail. He just wants to make sure his workers mix some personal communication with their electronic interaction.  The Friday ban applies to messages sent outside the office, too.  "We've forgotten how personal a call can be and how much people enjoy receiving telephone calls and a real live voice," Dearie said.  Recent studies have shown American workers spend about 50 minutes a day reading and sending some 3.4 billion business e-mails. Dearie said it's not uncommon for him to return from an overseas trip to find 500 messages waiting in his electronic mailbox.  Cezary Wlodarczyk, who is a marketing manager in Dearie's division, spent six years in Mexico and worked in one of the company's smaller offices in Florida. When he came to Louisville two years ago, he said he was surprised at how much business is done by e-mail.  "I knew this person's name on the fifth floor from e-mails" but it was a year before they actually met, Wlodarczyk said. "Then it was, Oh, you're that person.'"  Dearie said his wife, Macarena, inspired the idea. He was musing about an e-mail for his staff to congratulate them for a good quarter. She suggested he phone them.  "I came into the office on Friday morning, picked up the phone and called every single one of the employees, said well done on the first-quarter results. The response was incredible. People were saying the managing director had never called before to thank them for their hard work and effort. It took me less than a half-hour to call around and say thanks."  Dearie doesn't anticipate expanding the concept. E-mail is "an incredibly efficient tool for sending information among large groups of people," he said.  "We're just saying, for that one day a week, we're trying to get back to old-fashioned verbal communication," he said.

      Oh, see, I knew I would think of something random I wanted to say. One of my favorite words is palindrome. I learned about it when I was in sixth grade, which was 1991. Yes, a palindrome itself, hence the lesson. Anyway, Monday night I had a conversation with someone about 2002 being a palindrome. Then today I was thinking about how we won't have another palindrome year until 2112. Also, why is the word "palindrome" not a palindrome itself? I mean, I understand why it's not, but shouldn't the word that identifies that concept also define the concept?

      I had a great three days off of work. Several friends who I went to college with came into town. Then we had a New Year's Eve party with other people who live in Louisville. About 20 people were at my apartment at one point, which is only a few less than the record number of people in my dorm room one of the years Cara and I lived together. It was good to have everyone (well, most everyone) together again, at least for awhile. Before our party, we went to eat at Bahama Breeze. I had paella with shrimp, fish and chicken. It was so good. But we had to wait an hour at 4:30 in the afternoon and still ended up sitting at three different booths next to each other. The restaurant really should have had its act together on New Year's Eve, but apparently they didn't have enough servers (oh, I mean "tour guides") to wait on the tables. We had Christmas with my relatives from Canada last night at my parent's house. They gave me a George Foreman grill, which will hopefully help me cook a bit more. He named all boys George, right? And his girl Georgette? That's stupid. But his grill is pretty great.   I do better updating this when I don't try to recap the last four days, so I'm just going to stop now until I have something better to say.

      what's with the weather? yes, i'm talking about the weather two days in a row. but that's what happens when it's gorgeous one day and it snows the next. and not only did it snow, but it dropped like 40 degrees. that's kentucky for you. cara emailed me today from mexico and told me how perfect the weather is. put that with the fact she saw thousands of monarch butterflies on top of some mountain over the weekend, i'm totally jealous.  i'm so ready for  urlLink survivor  to start on thursday. i was bored at work the other night, so i read all of the profiles on the people.  urlLink neleh  (that's helen spelled backwards) said her favorite book is "the five love languages" by gary chapman. that's neat because greg and i are reading that now. she also said max lucado was one of her favorite authors, which is great. oh, and she likes to play tetris. and  urlLink tammy  is a crime reporter. don't worry, i'll have more comments after i actually watch the first episode on thursday.

      today was a beautiful today.  for one, the weather was perfect. i drove with my windows down. lori and i listened to "dancing nancies" much of the time we were in her car, with the windows down, of course. dave matthews is perfect music for days like today. we want to go see him when he's on tour this summer.  but i was also productive, which makes me feel good. i reserved the reception place. yay! it's a woman's club, and fits what i had pictured in my mind - just a big open room. and we can bring our own caterer, which is what else i was looking for so cara's mom could cater. AND i sent out two resumes today. ok, so i need to send out more, but that's a start.

      lori and i went to the UK game today, thanks to some of the bureau's season tickets that "have been floating around," according to a co-worker. we had a great time, though. it makes it even better than it was spontaneous. i got the tickets during my shift last night and the game was before my shift today. worked out well, actually. during one of the second half media timeouts, the cheerleaders started this C-A-T-S cheer where each of the four sections (two ends and two sides) yelled one of the four letters, you know, sort of like the wave. anyway (wonder how many times a day i say "anyway"?), the cheerleaders stopped, and started a new cheer, but the student section kept the C-A-T-S cheer going. they were the "C," so the rest of rupp arena followed. it went on a for a long time, through the whole timeout, and didn't stop until something dramatic happened in the game and the students decided to pay attention to the game again. well, then they randomly got it started again. it was hilarious. and the best part was that it drowned out the cheerleaders. yes, they get credit for getting it started, but that's about it. it was good to be in rupp arena when the wildcats won. they led the whole way, actually. have i mentioned how great our work season tickets are? yeah, they're great. ten rows back is pretty perfect. five would be better. ok, front row would be better. but ten rows back is better than sitting on the floor, where marquis estill can fall on you, like he did a herald-leader photographer today. he's a big guy. that couldn't have felt good. yes, i'm a geek, i pay attention to press row.

      I BOUGHT MY WEDDING DRESS TODAY! ok, pardon the capital letters....i'm excited. and i guess technically i didn't buy my dress today. actually, my mom paid for part of it today. but it is chosen. and, for what it is worth, we got a good deal. but i can't talk about it on here because greg reads this and i'm all about him not hearing about it or seeing it until aug. 3 when the doors in the back of the church open. yes, that means we're taking some pictures after the ceremony. don't worry, though, we'll be fast.  moving on to other subjects... i'm glad  urlLink ryan  decided to update the virtual version of his life. makes me feel better about linking you people to him. and it really is too bad he and ann forgot to eat some rice krispy treats.   so i speak to you in riddles 'cause my words get in my way.  -staind "epiphany"  ok, you know those songs i repeat in my car and in my head? here's the latest:  Put on my blue suede shoes And I boarded the plane Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues In the middle of the pouring rain W.

      i wish today would have been a completely different kind of day. aside from the fact that i felt sick most of the day, i got in an argument with a friend. yes, my feelings were hurt, but i still responded in a completely selfish, jerkish way. then besides hurting my friend's feelings, i felt like such a bad person. i want to love people and be there for people, not treat them like their lives don't matter. it's like i talked about a few days ago about apperciating people wholeheartedly, like God wants me to. then i just sort of freaked out about life, well, all the uncertainties in life. where am i going to work? where are we going to have this wedding reception? am i going to be a good wife? blah, blah, blah... and you know, God doesn't want me beating myself up like that. sure, God breaks us at the moments he sees fit. and obviously today he wanted to get some work done on my heart. sometimes it feels awfully crappy when it happens, but then the brokenness turns into a sort of challenge to be a better person, to be more of who God wants me to be. so, while i wish today was a different kind of day, maybe crying multiple times today served some higher purpose. i'm not in control of my life or any of the circumstances in it. sure, i make decisions and must put forth effort, but ultimately someone sits on his throne, seeing the eternal picture, and asks me to surrender my ideals and expectations to him.  and it's good to know true friends forgive me when i make mistakes.

      i went to kroger this afternoon, and the electricity was out in this area. it's weird to be in the grocery store with only a few lights on. they must have a pretty good back-up system because the credit card thing still worked and it was light enough to see in there. i went to get some drinks and medicine because i don't feel very good. i don't want to get sick. well, i think i had a fever last night. i slept terrible and eventually got the best sleep from 7 a.m.-noon on my couch. what is it about sleeping on a couch when i'm sick that makes things a little better? who knows, i just wish my headache would go away. i need to look for jobs and start writing those dreaded cover letters. and i need to do laundry. but all i really want to do is curl up on my couch. at least i'm off work again today.  last night kevin and i went to tumbleweed and then the UofL basketball game. we had a good time. with my brother, i never know how things are going to be. we talked a lot about basketball, but some about what's going on his life. regardless, we had a good time. kevin hugged me before he left. it was really sweet because that's not usually how we are. i hoping he's starting to accept the fact that while we are really different people, we can meet in the middle and have a good time. that's a growing up thing, i guess.  oh, and it hailed here this afternoon. it was crazy stuff. but i really liked the sound of it bouncing off the window.

      i don't update all weekend and my readers go crazy.  ok, that's not true. but  urlLink laura  did mention my lack of posting. at least one person cares.  i had a good weekend. greg came into town. i like coming home from work and having him here. i guess that'll happen more often after aug. 3, huh? we ate lunch with my grandpa and mom then watched the oh-so lovely kentucky game on saturday. then my favorite player has to go get in some scuffle with some other player who never plays on the plane ride back from georgia. go figure. anyway, back to my weekend. (gosh, i babble.) saturday night was frustrating at work - the company was far from my favorite and my computer freaked out around midnight and i hadn't saved what i was working on so i had to finish that before i left.  i'm going to start a new paragraph for sunday because it's worth its own paragraph. jaclyn and bryan went to church with greg and i. i've decided to go back to the church i spent most of high school going to, but that requires getting up too early for my taste. why would they have the more contemporary service early? that's never made much sense to me. but i always feel good once i get out of the bed and make it there. God reminds me of the hugest (is that a word?) sacrifice he made for me (and you), and that makes getting out of bed before 9 a.m. seem irrelevant. so, i love when jaclyn gets to visit. this visit was definitely too short, but it was better than nothing. then  urlLink ryan  and his girlfriend ann came over for lunch - hamburgers on the george foreman grill. it was good to see them. it's funny, jaclyn and ryan often come into town the same weekend. then greg and i just hung out at my apartment. but i got in this super sensitive mood and started getting all worried about future career stuff. but i got over it.  i seriously need to remember the one verse that totally opened my eyes to God in the first place:  and we know that in all things God works for the good of those who live him, who have been called according to his purpose.  -romans 8:28  ok, so i also want to talk about church itself, not just my social life on sunday. the church is doing a series on the ten commandments. well, it was No. 6 this week - do not murder. the sermon was surprisingly appropriate. kelly (he's the minister) talked about how it's not just about maliciously killing someone, which is what the hebrew word means there, it's about valuing life. (side note: kelly said there are nine hebrew words that translate into "kill," and it's important to know the sixth commandment doesn't apply to the words that relate to capital punishment or self-defense, among other situations.) anyway, kelly talked about how our attitudes are shown in our actions. and God wants us to be kind and compassionate toward people. to be that way, it has to begin in our hearts. gosh, my heart sometimes isn't a compassionate place. sometimes people frustrate me so much that i think less than kind thoughts about them. and while that's far from "murdering" someone, it's definitely not valuing their life - which is a sacred gift from God. my greatest enemy was created in the image of God. just as i was. and you were. why would i insult the creator by insulting his work?  today i hung out with my mom before i came to work. well, first i slept late, which was so great. then she and i went to the Y and worked out for an hour. it wore me out and energized me at the same time. and it made me feel good about myself because i sure had been feeling like a bum.  tomorrow lori and i actually have plans to work out at the gym at her apartment at 9 a.m. yeah, you read that right. i'm not sure what we're thinking. we have this big plan tomorrow to work out, then go to lunch and a movie -  all before she has to be at work at 3:30. we're silly, but i think we're going through withdrawls because we haven't hung out in awhile. i'm off so i should have time in the afternoon to get some other things done, like maybe find a reception place or do some laundry. i took a personal day so i could take my brother to the UofL basketball game. that should be fun. then i'm off wednesday like normal. two days off in a row, it's a minor miracle. and thursday i suppose to go to lexington to get a how-to-write-a-game-story lesson from our sports writer there. that means three days in a row out of the office, two of which i'm getting paid for. lovely. goodness, my hopes are all up, so i sure hope everything works out.   i've been working a lot tonight because i wanted to get stuff done that i usually do later in the week because i'm not going to be here. now, that's responsible, and slightly overachieving. ok, back to scores.

      yep, i'm bored. hence the frequent posting. so here's the lyrics to one of the most beautiful songs i know. bebo norman is the best. and i just found out he's on tour with third day this spring. third day is really great in concert. well, they are really great, period, but especially in concert. good thing they are coming to louisville. yay! ok, that's april. but for now, i'm going to enjoy this song that bebo wrote for his sister's wedding (right? or brother's wedding...). regardless, it's one of those that has been played repeatedly in my car.   A page is turned by the wind to a boy in curly grin With a world to conquer at the age of ten But as history unfolds and the storybook is told He finds salvation but not at the hands of man  And the God of second chance Picked him up and He let him dance Through a world that is not kind And all this time, preparing him, the one To hold him up when he comes undone Beneath the storm, beneath the sun And now a man, here you stand Your day has come  A page is turned in this world to reveal a little girl With a heart that's bigger, as it is unfurled By the language in her soul, that's teaching her to grow With a careful cover of love that will not fail  And the God of second chance Picked her up and He let her dance Through a world that isn't kind And all this time, preparing her the one To hold her up when she comes undone Beneath the storm, beneath the sun And grown up tall, here you are Your day has come  Beneath the air of autumn, she took him by his hand And warm within the ardor, she took his heart instead And high upon the mountain, he asked her for her hand Just for her hand  A page is turned in this life, he's making her his wife And there is no secret to the source of this much life When the grace that falls like rain is washing them again Just a chance to somehow rise above this land  Where the God of second chance Will pick them up and he'll let them dance Through a world that is not kind And all this time, they're sharing with the one That holds them up when they come undone Beneath the storm, beneath the sun And once again, here you stand And once again, here you stand Your day has come  -Bebo Norman "A Page is Turned"

      i don't really like valentine's day. but i like knowing greg and i went out on our first day four years ago today. (we've decided to call if first-date day.) that seems like yesterday, but it also seems like forever ago. we went to get ice cream at baskin robbins. he's so cute. we met on feb. 7, 1998, through a mutual friend. he called a couple of days later and asked what i was doing after lunch on saturday. i said i didn't know what time i was even eating lunch because that all depended on when i got up. regardless, he asked me to go out for ice cream. so we did. then we went to the park and talked for awhile. then he dropped me back off at my dorm room. later that night his grandparents were having their 50th wedding anniversary party (yes, they got married on valentine's day...ah!) across the street from my dorm in the curris center. his family needed a CD player, so he called to ask to borrow mine. i walked it over there. later he called and ended up coming to my dorm room and we stayed up all night talking. i remember it all so clearly, even the part about being so tired the next day when my mom was in town to visit me. i told her a boy took me out for ice cream the day before. she didn't seem too excited. but i bet she didn't think four years later i would be engaged to the boy who took me out for ice cream. of course, i didn't either. but i like that i am.  so, back to valentine's day. while it's far, far from favorite holiday, i'm not bitter about it. tonight i'm working with two guys. i brought in some cupcakes with those great candy conversation hearts on top. josh told me he wanted to blow them up. the other guy, who really is the most bitter, cold person i know, didn't acknowledge them. goodness, just eat a cupcake. if lori were here, she'd appreciate them.  i went to lexington yesterday to celebrate first-date day with greg. (ok, so i would have gone yesterday whether it was the second week in february or not.) he took me to red lobster. it was SO good. those biscuits are the best, and the shrimp i had was awfully tasty. it was pretty great he took me there, considering he doesn't like seafood. but that's what chicken is for. then we watched the kentucky game and a not-so-good TV movie that started sunday night. (yes, i watched it sunday night and the continuation last night. no comments please.)  oh, again, back to valentine's day... (yes, i know the chronology is all messed up!) i got real mail from alexa and jaclyn today. i have some great friends.  "dawson's creek" last night was different. it was all about joey. lots of character development that went deeper than good 'ole kevin williamson usually takes us. ok, i'm totally addicted, i recognize that. i started "glory days" today, but then cara came, so we went out. i'll finish it later, then maybe watch "CSI," which had a totally intriguing preview. at least i don't tape TV shows EVERY night. just wednesdays and thursdays.  cara is leaving for mexico sunday. she'll be gone for a month, which is not long but long. yeah, makes sense, i know. i mean, we've hung out quite a bit lately, so i'll miss having her around, but at the same time, she's coming back in the middle of march. what a great trip, though. for her sake, i'm really glad she decided to go. i gave her some pepto-bismol, well, the generic comparison, to take with her, among some other random gifts.  speaking of random, i'm finished babbling for now.

      i'm starting to drive myself crazy trying to find the perfect reception place. the chapel idea fell in my lap and ended up being beautiful and easy to reserve. the reception idea isn't coming to me that easy. but cara's mom did tell me today that she'd cater it, which makes me very happy. plus, she's making my cake. she's great, and super cook. so, if you have any ideas, feel free to  throw  them my way. i'm thinking a park...but you know, the weather might suck. it's early august. it could be super hot or totally perfect. and there's always that chance of rain.

      i spent four and a half hours today talking to this friend of mine - jennifer partin. well, she's more like a mentor, you know. she gives great motherly advice that really encourages me to know God more. she's one of the people i turned to a lot when i first became a christian. anyway, i went to her sunday school class yesterday and it was exactly what i have been looking for. so i was planning on just going by her house today, playing catch-up because it had been awhile since we talked. but i ended up spending all the time before i came to work there. it was great. she asked me lots of questions about greg and i, the wedding and marriage. i really respect her marriage and her opinions, so it was good to share what i think about these things with her.   we were talking about the rules people unfortunately associate with being a christian, and how people get too caught up in legalism. but sometimes we are too quick to judge these people when "we are all just a thought away from being a pharisee." that's what she said. how true is that? and what a great way to put it.   i had a list of errands to run today. but it's really okay God had this other plan for my day because i think my heart needed it. you know, just a good conversation with someone who has known me since i was 17. she's one of the few people who has witnessed by spiritual growth from the beginning. and while i know i have a long way to go, she knows where i came from. one thing i really love about her is how when she talks about her relationship with God, she always uses active verbs because it's a process. that's one of the many things i have learned from her - knowing God doesn't happen over night. it's like any other relationship in the way it takes time to build.  today was a simple reminder that God is completely in control of my life, and while he lives decisions to me, i'm much better off to follow his lead.

      it's pitiful i had to set my alarm this morning to get up at 11:45. and even worse, when it went off (i hate alarms. they are so annoying.), i still didn't want to get up. i went to bed not much after 2 a.m., that's not ridiculously late for someone who didn't get home from work until 12:45 a.m. and i would really like to go to 9:30 a.m. church tomorrow.  i walked around waterfront park before work today. i had some time to kill (what a stupid saying) between visiting my mom and coming to work, so i went down by the river. i love that place, especially in weather like today. it was absolutely perfect today. exceptional february weather. ok, enough about the weather. i love waterfront park because it just puts me at peace in the middle of the hustle of the city. and the ohio river has its pretty moments, such as today.

      i left wednesday morning for a whirlwind trip to murray. but it was way worth it. first i ate lunch with jeff in madisonville. then i got to murray earlier than i expected, so i went by the newsroom. yickett was there, so i got to talk to him for a long time. that was a good surprise because he was one of the reasons i stayed around the newspaper my last year. i wanted to quit so bad, but he wouldn't let me. and i'm glad i didn't because my last year at " urlLink the murray state news " turned out to be my favorite. loree stark was slightly overwhelmed, but i walked across the street with her and talked with her while she ate. she's a fun girl, even when she's stressed. then i went to jaclyn's apartment. i love visiting jaclyn. we talked about our weddings a lot - surprise. and she made dinner, too, which was so great because i'm so tired of eating out. i just used "so" twice in the same sentence - that's how serious i am. then we went to MCF, but more on that later. i also got to see  urlLink laura , which is always fun. then this morning i visited with greg's mom (my future mother-in-law...how crazy is that?!) for a couple of hours. more wedding talk, and the beginnings of a reception she wants to have in murray a couple of weeks after greg and i get married. that's what happens when you marry a taylor and the wedding isn't in murray...you have to bring some of the festivities to them. the taylors are great - thus the reason they know basically everyone in the town of almost 15,000. maybe it was good for me to see greg's mom - and later dad and grandma - without greg. i think it helped put things into perspective...I'M GETTING MARRIED. so i got back in louisville just in time to drive to my apartment, pack a dinner, get the tape rolling for the two hours of " urlLink CSI " tonight and get to work at precisely 4:30 this afternoon.   (notice the long paragraph, that's how my mind is today...babbly.)  ok, i know i keep saying things like that... but you're going to have to deal with it if you want to be part of my life right now because i'm obviously excited. and i constantly have moments like that, you know, that make me stop and remember where God has brought us and where he's taking us. well, i don't know for sure where he's taking us, but he promises it will be better than i can imagine. and it's a big deal, so face it, until aug. 3, and most likely thereafter, you are going to hear more than you want about the fact that i'm getting married. greg sure is great.  back to what i wanted to say about MCF last night... in the few years i was involved there, i never heard a sermon about hell. last night brian talked about hell. but he didn't just talk about hell like one of those give-all-you-have-to-God-or-you-are-going-hell sermons, but it was about love and grace. what a refreshing contrast to the other, which i can't really bear to hear. that's the thing, that's what God is about: loving people so much he can't stand the thought of someone going to hell, so much so, he sent his son to die on a cross so i could be forgiven. so you could be forgiven. so our worst enemies could be forgiven. but he made it a choice. i choose God.   last night my attention span was tested, and it took me a while to focus on the message at hand, and not the 18 other things in my mind. but i did catch something worth remembering. referring to something he read by C.S. Lewis, brian said:  The most beautiful thing and the most terrible thing about God is that in the end, he'll always give people the desires of their hearts. If I want love and life and God, I will choose him. If I want darkness and death, I will choose that.   hell is a really difficult concept for me to grasp... and i'm going to stop talking about it right now because this is much too heavy for me while i'm waiting on high school basketball scores to come my way.   on a lighter note, my picture page went away because angelfire.com is silly. but i'll get it all fixed up again, one of these days when i don't have to get up before 9 a.m. ok, so that's not early to most of you, but it is to me, the one who likes to stay up after i get home from work at 1 a.m. the same girl who loves to sleep. gosh, what's going to happen when i go back on days at the end of march?  so, in addition to fixin' up my resume this weekend and getting my haircut and eating dinner with greg on sunday night (yay!), i'm going to watch lots of TV. laura taped "dawson's creek" and "glory days" for me last night. nice, huh? and i'll have those two hours of CSI, which are hopefully new. i know one hour is new, 'cause i saw the preview. oh, but i'm probably not watching them tonight because katie and brad are going to stay at my apartment. that's great, except i don't know what kind of host i'll be. i'm tired and i don't even know if i have milk for cereal in the morning. good thing i know i have frozen waffles. but i get to hang out with katie and brad before i go to work tomorrow, but that's after my mom and i go look at the reception possibilty at the science museum...  did i mention i'm wearing myself out?

      last night i was sort of out of it when i was trying my ramblings about the super bowl. and while i said what i wanted to say about that, i wanted to say more about my weekend...  greg came up friday night when i got off work. we watched the wildcats win before i went to work. whoa, a bit of "w" alliteration going on there. you know i like alliteration. anyway, we also ate at rafferty's with my mom, which was good because i hadn't seen her since jan. 23. i only know the date because that's the day greg proposed. work was boring saturday night and the TV was really loud. but that's another whole story in itself. instead of talking, lori and i messaged on our computer - we can do that with our company's software, AP Workbench. then we'd go talk in the break room while she smoked. but the TV was so loud we couldn't really talk, plus we didn't think the third co-worker wanted to hear us talk. ke kind of dampens the atmosphere. regardless, i'm glad i've been working nights lately with lori. ok, enough about that. on to the rest of the weekend. sunday i didn't leave my apartment at all. i didn't even step out of the apartment into the hallway until about midnight when greg was leaving and i walked him to the car. it was such a great day, though. we were lazy - it was 2 p.m. by the time we finished eating lunch, which really served as breakfast. i had set my alarm for 10 a.m. so we could go to 11 a.m. church. i was so excited when i woke up at 9:57 a.m. because i was awake on time, but didn't have to listen to my alarm. i hate alarms. so, i decided to rest my head and eyes a few more minutes, until my clock said 10, but so much for that...i fell back asleep until 11. it was good sleeping, though. anyway, after lunch (so much for total chronology with this story) greg and i watched the end of the michigan state-illinois game. like i really care about either, but i have to root for the underdog in that case...so i was happy to see the spartans win. then we flipped the channel and we watched the end of the missouri-virginia game. same as the other, i cheered for missouri. well, that was when i wasn't taking my nap. yes, i slept in and took a nap. then greg and i fooled with the digital camera and he played his guitar for me. i love it when he does that. later laura, dave, kent and cara came over to watch the super bowl. we cheered for the rams, ate pizza, ate nacho cheese (i love my nacho cheese in the crock pot!) and commented on all the commericals. it was fun, and i'm not going to talk about the super bowl anymore because my whole last entry was devoted to that.  i haven't enjoyed laziness like that in awhile, and i have a lot of things going on this week, so i figured i might as well enjoy it this weekend. today i did laundry at my grandpa's and called about reception sites. tomorrow i'm going dress shopping. wednesday and thursday i'll be in murray. friday my mom and i are going to look at a reception possibility (yes, i finally have a worthwhile idea!). sunday i'm meeting greg in elizabethtown on his way back from murray. (i wish we could have gone to murray together, but my work schedule gets in the way!) and sometime this weekend i want to get my resume fixed up all pretty so i can start the dreaded job search process. my temporary is finished in may and i'm looking around lexington. location is the driving force right now. but that's ok because not only will i get to be with greg (yay!), i have no real goals or career focus at this moment.   ok, back to taking scores. plus that is entirely enough babble about my life, at least for now.

      ok, so the patriots won. but only on a field goal. what kind of way is that to win a game? i guess better than sudden death overtime, but definitely not better than a touchdown. although, i guess there's no need to analyze it. a winner is a winner. the patriots deserved to win. it looked like they wanted it more than the rams. and that's probably the media's fault. all that talk about predicting how much the rams would win by - not IF they would win - pumped up the patriots. i guess there are advantages to being the underdog. it at least makes for a better story in the next morning's paper. i can only imagine what a media circus new orleans was the last few days. but at least all those reporters and photographers get to bring a good story home with them. and i still think kurt warner is a great guy. and he got lucky with that holding call against the patriots when he fumbled the ball trying to run it into the end zone. but the best thing about kurt warner is that he knows his worth isn't in this football game, any football game. sure, he probably went home sad, but he knows he is spending an eternity in a greater place - better than a celebration at the superdome. he's going to celebrate on the streets of gold with jesus.

      i was surprised gabriel was voted off last night. i thought john was going to go. i always fall into the CBS production trap, though. you know, the producers always make it look like someone is going to get voted off, but then that person never does. silly me. i was happy gina and her new teammates won, though. the raid was an odd challenge, but it sure put that tribe back in the game.    urlLink ryan , i think you got a head cold because you didn't email me back. and i thought you didn't like survivor? it's cute you miss ann.

      i just walked down the street to get some lunch. it's beautiful outside. a little cold, but beautiful. i think if our office had windows i'd feel better, at least mentally. but i guess i'd still have the yucky nose-throat thing i have now. after i watched "once and again," which i had taped, i dozed in and out of sleep from 7-9:45 last night on the couch. then i went to bed and slept 11 hours...and i totally could have slept more. i really don't want to get sick.

      whew, 15 high school basketball games. actually, i had fun. makes me sort of want to get a job that involves sports. i saw some good basketball games. it's just too bad sacred heart beat jackson county, who had a respectable comeback attempt after the valkyries went on a 30-0 run in the first half.   on the basketball note, how about those hoosiers knocking off duke?!  (yes, i know that's delayed, but i haven't been online since tuesday!)  i start working days tomorrow. even better than the hours are the weekends off. kelly moved home, and we're suppose to hang out tomorrow night. that sure makes me happy.  sometimes i live in a bubble. ok, i live in a bubble most of the time. what's the bubble like, you ask. pretty perfect, at least that's the idea. but i'm starting to drive myself crazy (and probably other people too) because perfection is something completely out of the realm of human possibility. worse than expecting perfection from myself, i expect perfection from other people. truth be told, no one will ever meet those expectations. duh, that's what you're thinking, right? i'm sure. but it's something i need to adjust in my attitude, in my approach to loving people like they are meant to be loved.

      there's something wrong with the fact that two bridesmaid dresses and one wedding dress are hanging in my closest waiting to be worn in the coming months. oh, and there's another bridesmaid dress waiting to have another purpose after shelley and dustin's wedding in september. i guess nothing is wrong...just a lot of weddings. and, yes, i'm realistic, i realize the bridesmaid dress will have to wait forever for another worthy purpose. that's the problem with bridesmaid dresses. they are like grown-up prom dresses. i'm trying to fix that with mine, but who is honestly going to wear a "banana" dress at another ocassion. i sure hope someone finds that ocassion. but at least mine are about half of the price of two of the three bridesmaid dresses i own.   yeah, that's right, my wedding dress is in my possession, as of today.   alright, that's totally enough about dresses.  so, "felicity" starts this week. the last 10 episodes. the big question: noel or ben? my vote goes to noel, but i honestly think she'll have one of those oh-so dramatic realizations - and she'll decide to move on without either of them. now, wouldn't that be anti-climatic?! i watched "once and again" last night. my mom and i used to watch that show when i would visit from college. too bad i don't need to be addicted to another TV show because it's worth watching. what's going to happen on the first 10 minutes of "survivor"? CBS is promo-ing it just like the did the tribe switch-o-roo last time. that would suck for the tribe playing (living) so well together. but i would be good for gina, who otherwise is going to lose, thanks to a bunch of slackers who voted hunter off last week.  ok, like the dress topic, that's enough TV talk. i need to go pack for bowling green anyway.  wait, one more thing, what's up with louisville blowing a 17-point early second-half lead and losing by three? greg would probably say that's what rick pitino gets for going to louisville. i say, wait until next year. on a funny but dangerous note, apparently the floor was slippery because the ice underneath was leaking through...that's weird, and made for lots of basketball players on the floor late in the game. good thing the game didn't go to overtime, like it looked like it might.

      i forgot how different days at work are. well, i didn't really forget, but i chose to not think about all the tension. makes me look forward to going to bowling green, even if i do have to cover 15 high school girls basketball games in four days. should be interesting, considering i've probably watched one, maybe two, high school girls games in my whole life. but at least i got in the basketball mood last week with steve at the boys tournament.

      the girl who spends the majority of her life near a computer has taken a technology vacation, and it's been pretty great. ok, so i was just in murray, well, actually puryear, tenn., visiting greg's family, but i only checked my email once in four days.   let's see, sunday greg and i drove to see his family. then on monday i worked at fort campbell. i wrote a story about a soldier's memorial...and it ran on the national wire. that's pretty exciting. i know it's one of those things that doesn't matter, really, but it's encouraging the first time, and i'm sure a few times after that. tuesday and wednesday greg and i hung out with his parents and some friends in murray. tuesday i got a tour of henry county, tenn., and let me tell you, it's like any other massive amount of farmland. and who knew there is a mexican restaurant in hazel, ky. (i know, you known western kentucky readers are asking yourself, where's hazel?) tuesday night we went to jaclyn's, where she and bryan cooked us dinner and introduced us to this great game called imagineiff (or maybe imaginiff). oh, and i learned how to play rook this week. fun game. wednesday i ate lunch with laura. wednesday night was survivor night, then time to drive back to lexington.   yesterday i worked at the state high school boys basketball tournament. i watched four high schools then, and will watch four more today and three tomorrow. not bad, really. and tons better than being in the office in louisville. steve - he's our sports writer in lexington - let me write two the games as practice for the girls tournament that i have to cover next week in bowling green. i'm a traveling woman these days. oh, and oldham county beat shelby valley yesterday, so that was fun to watch. and i got to see cassie.   ok, that's the events, however minor, of my last several days. but there's been more going on in my head - just mainly stuff about being married, and how i've sampled some of the in-law stuff this week. it's been surprisingly great, though. monday night i went to a bible study with greg's mom and then to dinner while greg was playing basketball with some male family members and listening to his dad speak at some meeting thing. it was good, though, and showed me how having the taylors as in-laws really is a great thing. trust me, it's a good revelation for me to have. and greg and i have spent a lot of time together this week, but we've also done our own things...and it's been a great balance. it's fun to be with him, and if we don't get to be together all day, it's fun to come "home" in the afternoon or evening and tell him about my day.  here's my abbreviated comments on the NCAA: too bad the hilltoppers lost. chris marcus was having an off night. and while patrick sparks scored 20 points, he missed some 3s that would have helped. those unpredictable kentucky wildcats came through yesterday. hopefully keith bogans will keep playing like that. i really was hoping holy cross would pull out the miracle and beat kansas. holy cross was up 2 at halftime and stayed with the jayhawks in the second half. tulsa won, which is fine. makes a nice story about tubby playing his old team.   oh, despite the fact i think the NIT is stupid, it's nice to see louisville winning.

      Supposedly these are true, at least according to my friend's email.  AT&T fired President John Walter after nine months, saying he lacked intellectual leadership. He received a $26 million severance package. Perhaps it's not Walter who's lacking intelligence.  Police in Oakland, California spent two hours attempting to subdue a gunman who had barricaded himself inside his home.  After firing ten tear gas canisters, officers discovered that the man was standing  beside them in the police line, shouting "Please come out and give yourself up."  A man walked into a Topeka, Kansas Kwik Stop, and asked for all the money in the cash drawer. Apparently, the take was too small, so he tied up the store clerk and worked the counter himself for three hours until police showed up and grabbed him.  Police in Los Angeles had good luck with a robbery suspect who just couldn't control himself during a lineup. When detectives  asked each man in the lineup to repeat the words, "Give me all your money or I'll shoot," the man shouted, "That's not what I said."  A man spoke frantically into the phone, "My wife is pregnant and her contractions are only two minutes apart!"	 "Is this her first child?" the doctor asked.  "No!" the man shouted, "This is her husband!"

      i'm repeating myself from yesterday: today was a beautiful day.  so beautiful i wore shorts when greg and i played tennis. just the fact we got to play tennis, even though i suck, is great. but wearing shorts in march and not freezing is an added bonus. tonight greg and i went to talk to the minister who is going to marry us for the first time, and it was great. i feel really good about this, all of this.  i'm addicted to basketball. that's bad news. well, greg would tell you it's good news. all depends on how you look at that sort of thing.

      today was a beautiful day, and i was productive. lori and i went to see "40 days" and had lunch at mcalister's. the movie was funny. then i washed my car - inside and out - and mailed my resume and some clips. (see yesterday's post for minimal venting on that subject.) and i bought plane tickets so jaclyn and i can visit lynn in naples, fla., in april. i'm so excited.

      i wrote another cover letter and printed out a resume. (i'd say i mailed another one, but i haven't actually mailed it because i had to go buy more resume paper and didn't have time to go to the post office before i came to work. but once the cover letter is written, it's as good as mailed in my mind.) anyway, once again, it's to a newspaper that doesn't actually have openings. maybe i should find an opening. too bad there aren't any!

      justin burdine, a murray state basketball player, almost landed in my lap today. i was covering the OVC final today with bruce. murray state won by one, but that was after leading by 12 twice. anyway, the players were obviously pumped up - they are going to the NCAA tournament. so burdine and some other players jumped on the media table, which was closest the the murray fans. and the table leaned toward me. bruce shielded the lap top, rick bailey from the herald-leader moved out of the way, and i jumped out of my chair, only to run into some fans that were crowding around the media table. then tevester anderson came over and cheered with the fans, totally squashing the media between some pretty excited people. then somewhere in the chaos greg gave me a hug.  it is pretty cool. murray was 9-11 in late january after back-to-back losses at morehead and eastern kentucky. then murray wins 10 of its last 11 games, including the OVC championship. oh, and they played today with seven guys, one who only played three minutes. it must suck to be tennessee tech, the regular-season conference champ. at the press conference, tech's coach said some good things about playing in a conference like the OVC where winning the tournament means a NCAA bid, unlike the SEC or Big 10, where lots of teams will get bids. then bruce and i were talking afterward, tournaments for less powerful conferences probably actually mean more because there is so much more riding on the win. i mean, tech isn't in the tournament because of one point.   days like today make me want to be a sports writer.  then i think about my future and i stop considering any option too heavily.

      my sister and i just watched "life or something like it." my expectations for the movie were exceeded. but that's probably because the timing was so ideal in my life. the movie reminded me of some things:  my life is not in my control.  matters of the heart are more important than anything, including careers and money.  authenticity brings joy to those around us.   also, cassie and i were talking in the theater before the movie started. she was talking about kevin and said, "you know, he and i aren't friends (pause) like you and i are." i really appreciated that comment.  God's been super good to my heart today, and much of that started with this song, which i listened to several times today:   I'm trading my sorrow I'm trading my shame I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord  I'm trading my sickness I'm trading my pain I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord   And we say yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord Amen  I'm pressed but not crushed persecuted not abandoned Struck down but not destroyed I'm blessed beyond the curse for his promise will endure  And his joy's gonna be my strength Though the sorrow may last for the night His joy comes with the morning  -darrell evans' "trading my sorrows"  two interviews down yesterday. now i just have to wait. that's the hard part. well, selling myself isn't completely comfortable either, but this waiting sure takes patience. well, duh.  pray for bekah's family. her dad died yesterday after he had a heart attack while he was working out at the YMCA. it was totally unexpected, especially because he had a heart attack before, but worked diligently to get himself in ideal health. i know bekah is trying to be strong for her mom. keep her whole family in your thoughts.

       "murder by numbers" : such an intense movie that i didn't watch the two episodes of CSI i have on tape. but it was a good movie. the thing that got me: the victim was random. that's scary, but then i remember it's just a movie.   "survivor" : i like it that zoe was voted off. neleh is my first choice, but paschal wouldn't be a bad winner, either. it was fun to watch paschal and sean together. they were adorable when they won the reward challenge, and totally bonded at the banquet they won.  now i have two CSIs for later.

      job search update: i have two interviews on saturday. one is at the newspaper in richmond. the other is for an advertising job at a TV station in lexington.   trip to murray update: i interviewed murray state president king alexander, which turned out great. i ended up interviewing him in the car to and from paducah, where he had to go to a meeting yesterday morning. he's such a people-person, and i really wish he was the president when i was there. then i got some good stuff from the student government president and king alexander's assistant, who is greg's great aunt. that's murray for you. yesterday i had a couple people ask me about our wedding, without me mentioning it first. one guy, who i met for the first time yesterday, said, "so, which of those taylor boys are you marrying?" when i was finished working, i met greg's parents at the ice cream place that used to be baskin robbins, but it now some 31 flavors wannabe establishment. they bought me ice cream and gave me an early birthday present. it was good to see them. then i stopped in madisonville and watched last week's "survivor" with jeff.  my neck hurts - not as bad as yesterday, but it still hurts. yesterday it felt like my head weighed three tons, and i couldn't turn to my right without turning my shoulders. today i can move it more, but it still has this uncomfortable pinching sensation.  TV show comments: it is sort of surprising i went almost a week without hearing that john got voted off "survivor" last week. but, then again, really only greg and jeff watch it regularly. neleh totally gave sean extra life in the game. she and paschal are in super shape - and i'm hoping on of the two wins the whole game. as long as neleh, kathy, paschal, sean and vecepia vote rob, zoe and tammy off, neleh and paschal are set to win. on to other shows i'm addicted to: felicity and her clan graduated! like i thought, she left new york without ben or noel. but then at the end, ben decided it was time to follow her, like she had done for four years. it was a great ending. the next episodes are going to be what-if scenerios. interesting way to end the show. "dawson's creek" was good, too. i love charlie. too bad he's going on tour (hence leaving the show, i suppose). they (the producers, that is) are setting it up for joey and dawson to get back together. i'm really thinking it would have been better to keep charlie around, but who am i to say? audrey used to annoy me, but i'm liking her and pacey together these days.  ok, that's entirely too much talk about fictional characters. but before i leave the subject, i have to admit: "felicity" made me think about how lucky i am most of my good friends live within a weekend's driving distance, if not in louisville or lexington. i also just thought a lot about growing up and communicating with people. (yes, those subjects often venture into my mind.)

      i want to spend every weekend in florida. even with the sunburn on my back, shoulders and neck and the dry skin flaking off my face (pleasant image, huh?), i had a super time. oh, and we were even rerouted through detroit to get there. our flight from nashville to orlando, where we were changing planes en route to fort myers, was canceled thursday, so we took a flight from nashville to detroit, then one on to fort myers. i'd never been to michigan before. and all i can really tell you now is this: the airport is huge, complete with a tram inside. the beaches in naples are goregous - white sand and super clear water. i love going that far south in florida. the sun is so intense though, and my excitement made me momentarily stupid (yes, just momentarily) and i didn't put on enough sunscreen. i also ate some delicious fresh grouper. yum, yum.   AND i have an interview saturday in lexington. an option! that's encouraging, after all, my last day at the associated press is may 10. temporary jobs definitely have advantages and disadvantages.

      greg and i went to see  urlLink third day  and  urlLink bebo norman  in concert tonight. i've seen third day lots of times, but never bebo. he's adorable - a seemingly down-to-earth guy from georgia who plays guitar (well) and loves God. i love his music (so much greg and i are going to have his song "a page is turned" in our wedding). i love live music. there were moments tonight God gave me glimpses of heaven - praising God at the foot of his throne. i know heaven is going to be so much more glorious and amazing than i can even imagine while soaking up the music and message, like tonight. bebo talked about how inconsistent we are and how consistent God is. totally something i needed to hear, mainly because my life is always going to change, which is going to change me in ways, i'm sure, but God is steadfast in who he promises to be. bebo also talked about how big God is, but how he manages to be small enough, in a sense, to fit in our human hearts. and mac powell (he's the lead singer for third day, but acts like a worship leader much of the time) reminded me how ever-present God is. simple thoughts, in a way, but it's leading my mind to deeper things to chew on. i needed this.

      katie and aaron got married this weekend. i introduced them, so that made it even more fun to be part of their wedding. everything went really well, excluding the 45 minutes one of the other bridesmaids, jill, spent sewing me into my dress. yes, literally. the zipper decided not to work, thanks to some terrible sewing on the dress lady's part. so jill just sewed me in, and i basically had to be cut out of it that night. i also had some unexpected bonding time with andrea, thanks again to the dress lady and her lack of responsibility. andrea and i sat at the dress lady's house for 1 1/2 hours after the rehearsal dinner. i got talk to adam some, which was good, despite his on-going bashing of UK. yeah, like he has a whole lot of room to talk, though. jared jeffries is leaving IU.   yesterday i slept late. yay! then greg and i ate at rafferty's, ran errands and hung out. oh, and we watched "finding forrester." i love that movie.   why is it the words we write for ourselves are so much better than those we write for others?  -sean connery as william forrester  last night lori and her roommate shelley and kelly and i went to see "the sweetest thing." it was not the greatest movie ever made. but it sure was better than "something about mary," to which critics keep comparing it. we laughed a lot - in the movie and out - and probably annoyed those sitting near us in applebee's.

      i'm a little disappointed in the weather. (yes, the weather again. it's a routine subject in my life.) it was suppose to be 72 degrees today. i mean, i know meterologists can be wrong, but still...i was hopeful. and now my hopes for warmth were shattered. ok, i'm being dramatic, but still. it's cloudy and disappointing outside. good thing there's more to life than the weather. otherwise i'd be a mess. besides, it's not freezy outside by any means. i am wearing open-toed shoes and sleeveless sweater and i was barely chilly when i walked across the street for lunch.  ryan and i used to hang out at the denny's on hurstborne lane. (why is it technically called "hurstborne parkway" but everyone - well, probably not EVERYONE, but you know what i mean - calls it "hurstborne lane"?) the seat cushions used to be mismatched shades of not-so-lovely colors, but then the restaurant got a minor face lift with matching pinkish cushions. ryan and i drank a lot of milkshakes and talked a lot there. ah, the memories.  but now it's a fazoli's. while fazoli's is tasty and i ate there last night... it's no denny's.  those breadsticks were pretty good, though. i'll guess i'll adapt. and maybe i should take as one of life's many changes. maybe it's a good lesson for me. or maybe denny's in louisville wasn't doing too well. apparently most of them closed. thankfully, there's still one by village 8 for memory's sake though.   yeah, i know, that's entirely enough about that.

      it's absolutely beautiful outside. it's warm and sunny. i love it. and i don't even go to florida for another week.   i've neglected my journal lately - tuesday night i ate so tasty fish at the irish rover with lori, kelly and cara. then lori and i ran some errands and i was quite productive. last night cassie and i had dinner at my apartment, then cara and kelly came over to watch the WB. good episodes of "felicity" and "dawson's creek." how's that for a quick synopsis of my oh-so exciting life?

      i forgot to mention that i got dave matthews tickets for lori and i. we're going to see him july 9 in nashville. yay! lori has never seen him, well, the whole band, in concert. just the acoustic tour, which is great. but the whole band is great, too. maybe emmylou harris will show up again to sing "long black veil" with dave. probably not. but it is nashville.

      good weekend. and i truly mean weekend, you know, my first such "normal" one since, well, since i started working at the AP. when i first started, it was football season, so i worked friday nights. then a couple of "normal" work weeks then basketball season in november. so, now it's april, and i have about a month to enjoy a 10-6 job (doesn't have the same ring as 9-5, but the hours are perfect!). actually a month or so to enjoy a job, period.  back to my weekend... played apples to apples with greg, kelly, cara, laura, dave and tim friday night. ate chumbo's pizza for the first time. pretty good. cleaned my apartment. went shopping with my mom and cassie saturday. watched "high crimes." good movie. then ironically "kiss the girls" was on tv. funny, two ashley judd-morgan freeman movies in one night. but we only watched part of the latter. went to church today. hung out with greg here. good lazy time. in fact, i took two brief naps. threw the frisbee. it was beautiful today. went on a walk. lovely weather. sat on the front porch with greg and read. organized some stuff at my apartment. worked on a puzzle.  ok, i'll admit, i watched part (yes, only part) of "weakest link" tonight. it was the playmate episode. and they were stupid girls. really. hardly banked anything the two rounds i watched. yes, only two rounds.

      great song:   Baby I've been searching like everybody else Can't say nothing different about myself Sometimes I'm an angel And sometimes I'm cruel And when it comes to love I'm just another fool Yes, I'll climb a mountain I'm gonna swim the sea There ain't no act of God girl Could keep you safe from me My arms are reaching out Out across this canyon I'm asking you to be my true companion True companion True companion  So don't you dare and try to walk away I've got my heart set on our wedding day I've got this vision of a girl in white Made my decision that it's you allright And when I take your hand I'll watch my heart set sail I'll take my trembling fingers And I'll lift up your veil Then I'll take you home And with wild abandon Make love to you just like a true companion You are my true companion I got a true companion True companion  When the years have done irreparable harm I can see us walking slowly arm in arm Just like the couple on the corner do 'Cause girl I will always be in love with you And when I look in your eyes I'll still see that spark Until the shadows fall Until the room grows dark Then when I leave this Earth I'll be with the angels standin' I'll be out there waiting for my true companion Just for my true companion True companion True companion   -Marc Cohen "True Companion"

      i was waiting on the corner of broadway and sixth to cross broadway to get to my car friday when i got off work. this guy rode his bike up next to me and said, "the sign says 'walk,' you can go on across now." i said, "yeah, i know, i was just caught up in my own world," as i started the cross the street. he crossed too, slowing down his bike beside me. "are there little green men in your world?" he asked. "um, no, i was just thinking about some stuff," i said, really having no idea what i was thinking about, just knowing i was a bit delayed in responsing to the "walk." but i knew for sure my thoughts did not involve little men, green or any other color. then he said, "you're attractive." pause. "does your boyfriend tell you that?" very quickly i said, "my fiance tells me that all the time." riding off, he said, "good, otherwise you'd have to break his kneecaps."

      that was a very anti-climactic NCAA championship. and not just because indiana didn't win. just because it was. good reason, huh? it was sloppy at moments and lacked an excitement that lots of the tournament games had. the players seemed jittery and never really gelled as a team.

      ok, despite my preference for the wildcats, i'm cheering for indiana tonight. come on, you have to like mike davis. (you'll learn adam, really.) plus, his son is absolutely adorable. adam told me all season that he didn't think indiana was that good. i seem to remember him saying they were overrated. um, it's the championship game, the hoosiers must not be that bad. plus, they've got the heart to win - reporters, coaches and the players themselves keep saying it over and over. and like mike davis said the other day, a team doesn't have to be the best team to win, it just has to be the best team that day. good philosophy, especially if indiana keeps wanting it just a bit more than their opponents. but maryland hasn't won a national championship and juan dixon wants one pretty bad. did you know juan dixon has a tatoo of his mom, juanita, on his stomach?  so, back to  urlLink antoine davis  being  urlLink adorable . Here's  urlLink one more .  i'm a journalist. the people and their stories are my favorite part of all of this basketball hoopla (hoopla...appropriate, huh?). so, i've read a lot of stuff in newspapers and on the internet. here's something from the denver post yesterday:  With 28 seconds remaining in Indiana's upset win over Oklahoma, senior guard Dane Fife glanced at the team bench. There, in the middle of the happy din, was Davis, hunched over in a chair, the coach's head looking down to his palms spread across his lap. Fife didn't know what was wrong. He trotted over to find out.   "Coach," Fife whispered in the ear of Davis, "get your head up, man. We're going to the national championship."  Davis raised his chin and smiled. What had he been doing? The American Civil Liberties Union might not like the answer, but every person of faith who has ever asked for a little guidance to make it through tough times will understand. Not caring how many people in the arena saw him, Davis was praying.  "I was just thanking God for this opportunity," Davis said. "It's a blessing to be here."   Davis does not pray for victory. That would be crass. He grew up in a single-parent, ramshackle 500-foot house in Fayette, Ala. (pop. 4,922) with a speech impediment that caused a wicked stutter. All Davis has ever dared pray for is strength.   On the eve of the biggest basketball game of his 41 years, Davis has the strength to announce: No practice today.  This Easter morning, hunting for eggs will take precedence over the Final Four. The Indiana coach has a 3-year-old son. When the boy awakens, the first words out of little Antoine's mouth will be: "I love you, Daddy."  Basketball pays the bills and gives the crowd thrills. But does it define what's most important to a thinking man? Never on Sunday.

      did anyone miss me?  i spent most of memorial day weekend in atlanta. my cousin allison got married, and greg and i stayed with my uncle tom and his family. (he's allison's uncle, too.) anyway, i got a few good ideas and made many mental notes during the rehearsal, ceremony and reception.  i live in lexington now. my apartment is starting to look more like home. i moved my stuff wednesday, but i spent most of thursday in louisville tying up loose ends. last night and most of today i've been unpacking and organizing. I HAVE AN INTERVIEW MONDAY. and it's for a journalism job! it's at the kentucky press association in frankfort. i would love it if this would work out.   i'm going to greg's now... and it will only take me 10 minutes. how exciting is that?!

      Greg booked our Lake Tahoe place. It's right on the lake! That makes me excited. And he's graciously agreed to spend a day in San Francisco, which is where we're flying into because I hear it's beautiful. It's only three hours from Tahoe, which is nothing once we've flown across the country. (Oh, this is our honeymoon plan for any who were unclear!) And his grandpa is kindly sharing some frequent flier miles with us, which is wonderful being that I'm still unemployed. (Yes, I'm still working on that.)  I went to see Woody Allen's "Hollywood Ending" today with Lori. We laughed a lot.  "Felicity" series finale: She ends up with Ben. After three episodes back in the future, which actually turn out to be a dream. Regardless, the four-year show came full circle. She followed him to New York and spent four years (well, actually five the way the show fast forwarded after graduation) creating this pathetic yet somehow intriguing drama with him that ended apparently just as it was meant to be. That's a statement about life, I suppose. Follow your heart. Don't ask "what if." Cherish simplicity. Learn from those your love. (OK, that's multiple statements about life.)  Organized. Overwhelmed. Excited. Nervous. Confident. Worried. Joyful. Dramatic. Reflective. Ready. Childish. Mature. Productive. Anxious. Sometimes these feelings criss-cross inside me and I become a jumble of contradictions.  I need to go to bed.

      I found an apartment in Lexington. I'm moving next week sometime. Then Greg's moving in after the wedding. For those of you familiar with Lexington, it's off Alumni Drive at New Circle. Now I just need to find a job. Oh, and we picked out tuxedos yesterday. One more thing of the wedding planning list!  I really thought Neleh was going to win "Survivor." But Vecepia won by one vote. Dang. It's a good thing it's May - only one of my shows hasn't had its finale. That's "Felicity" and there's a two-hour finale this week. I need a break of TV.

      Thanks, Alexa: I typed "Kristin Hill" + "Associated Press" into Google and I found some of my stories. Mainly two stories - dorm fire and heart patient - but they were in several papers, including San Diego, Seattle, Miami and Cincinnati. And some Kentucky - Louisville, Lexington, Ashland, Owensboro - ones came up too. That's pretty exciting.

      I've been productive during my first week of unemployment: had a job interviewed, chose a florist and flowers for the wedding, called about an apartment in Lexington, updated the wedding guest list, gathered pictures for a video Greg's mom is making, drove around to map out directions from hotel to chapel to reception, talked to Katie Mitchell (Name changes are so weird to me.), played a game of phone tag with the minister who is going to marry us (OK, so it would have been more productive to actually have set up some appointments!), watched Survivor and the CSI finale, hung out with Kelly, spent some time with Greg, did four loads of laundry...  I've been thinking today about how Greg and I have lived in different cities for the last two years - him in Murray, me in Louisville; me in Murray, him in Lexington; me in Lexington, him in Paducah; him in Lexington, me in Louisville. It's hard sometimes, but we've learned a lot. And I sure know I'm ready to live in the same place.    Our lives get in step with God and all others by letting him set the pace, not by proudly or anxiously trying to run the parade.  -from Romans 3 in The Message

      I went to see "Art," a comedy at Actors Theatre last night with Lori. It was hilarious, and Mitchell Anderson, one of the celebrities I met at Derby, was in it. It was about these three guys and their friendship, which was analyzed in response to a piece of artwork one of the guys recently bought.

      i was reading about names:  KRISTIN Variations: KIRSTEN, KIRSTEN, KERSTIN, KRISTEN, KIRSTIE, KRISTY, KRISTINE, KRISTINA, KRISTA, KRISTIANA, CHRISTINE KIRSTEN, KRISTIN. One problem with naming a daughter Kirsten is that no one will ever remember whether her name is the Norwegian/Danish form of Christine KIRSTEN, the Swedish KERSTIN or KRISTIN, or maybe even the hybrid KRISTEN. Not to mention, of course, the Scottish KIRSTIE, nickname KRISTY, or any of the scores of variations of KRISTINE and KRISTINA. Life will be, in other words, confusing. Pity, too, because Kirsten, Kristin, and cousins are some of the prettiest, most delicate, and crystalline-sounding names around: surely the source of their broad popularity. But there have been so many Kirstens of such variety for so many years now that yours would almost surely have trouble standing out from the crowd. And thats the other main problem: Parents choosing one of these names may be shocked to find how big the crowd is. Undercounted because of its myriad variations, Kirsten/Kristin is in fact among the Top 20 in some states. If you simply must go with this name, you might try to find a distinctive variation (no, that doesnt mean a weird spelling): KRISTA, maybe, or KRISTIANA.

      This weekend was good.  FRIDAY  I went to a laser show at the planetarium with Kelly and some others. It was pretty neat. The show we saw was set to Led Zepplin music, which was OK, but I want to go back to the other ones - pop  music and U2. Also, the skies of Louisville show sounds pretty neat.  SATURDAY  my sister went to prom so I got to see her all dressed up. She looked beautiful. I also took my mom her mother's day present because I was out of town on Sunday. I ran a bunch of errands and got things ready for Jaclyn's bridal shower. That night I went to my old boss' retirement dinner, which was at this club on UofL's campus. It was nice and a fun time to hang out with my now-former co-workers. Then I went my Sarah's apartment for a little get together she was having. Kent's leaving this week for the Air Force, so it was good to see him.  SUNDAY  Greg, Kelly and I drove to Murray for the day. We ate lunch at Greg's parents' house, then Kelly and I went to Jaclyn's for the shower we were throwing for her. It turned out well. It was great, as always, to see Jaclyn.   I wrote a story about King Alexander that moved on the wire for this weekend. I've already found it in four newspapers - not bad for someone who no longer has to go through that massive stack of newspapers at work. The Murray and Madisonville papers ran it on their front pages. Owensboro ran it inside Sunday. And  urlLink The Courier-Journal  used it today. That's an encouraging way to go out.  Today Kelly is going with me to two flower shops. And I'm trying to touch base with some people who have my resume.

      it's been a good birthday, considering i am at work. greg came in last night and we watched "survivor" and "CSI." this morning he took me to breakfast at denny's. i had a waffle with strawberries on it. yum, yum. and he brought me a new book to read and a super nintendo. i love tetris on super nintendo because it's a two-player game and i get awfully competitive. greg couldn't find the right game, but he's working on that part. then i'll have to arrange a time to take on adam, who was the best tetris player i knew at one point. today at work, cara came and took me to lunch at the cafe across the street. she gave me a fun present - some of my favorite mexican gum, a magnetic quote and a neat mug thing that has a cara-decorated thing inside. that doesn't make sense? it's this mug that has a place around the outside in between two layers of plastic, the outer one clear, to put a personalized-decorated paper thing. ok, that's enough of my attempt to explain that. mrs. quigley called and sang happy birthday on my voice mail. and jeff gave me a plant, a pretty plant. hopefully i won't kill it. tonight i'm going out with lori and kelly, and maybe some other people.   "there is no use trying," said alice; "one can't believe impossible things." "i dare say you haven't had much practice," said the queen. "when i was your age, i always did it for half an hour a day. why, sometimes i've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."  -lewis carroll  (that's the magnetic quote cara gave me.)

      i listened to  urlLink john mayer  last night at jillian's. he's great. and despite the hundreds of people crammed into an area that certainly was not large enough, i had a good time - both listening to the music and hanging out with kelly and cara.   i talked to the guy from the tv station in lexington with whom i interviewed saturday. i'm was his no. 2 choice. he complimented my personality and communication skills, then told me his no. 1 choice had worked at a tv station before, which pushed her just ahead of me. he rejected me nicely. that's an oxymoron. but, seriously, he was sincere when he said if i didn't have a job in a couple of weeks he'd help me out. i told him i'd pursue the couple of options i have, then get back in touch with him. meanwhile, he passed my resume on to other departments at the station.  i'm at work now. the oh-so exciting great steamboat race is tonight and yours truly gets to cover it. lucky me also gets to cover the parade tomorrow. derby sure does something to this city - probably more good things than bad.   it's may! i love that.

      this post is prompted by ryan.  friday night i went to see "mr. deeds" with greg. (yes, i have been watching entirely too many movies lately.) i like adam sandler movies. that fact slight surprises myself. saturday greg went out of town with some guy friends, so i went home. i hung out with my mom and sister yesterday evening. then i went to kelly's house, where we ate homemade fruit smoothies and watched "orange county." today i went to church with my mom in the morning. then cassie and my mom and i went shopping in the afternoon. my family (minus my brother who was out with his girlfriend) grilled out tonight before i came back to lexington. i've been home more in the last two months than during most of college. that seems like some sort of regression. or maybe i just need to make some friends in lexington.  too bad i'm going to be out of town this coming weekend. i was offered a dog sitting job i would have otherwise taken. priorities, i suppose. and i'm choosing to go to murray with greg to visit his family and hang out with jaclyn.

      it's been awhile. you'd think i'd gotten a job or something. :) no, but on the job note: i took the copy editing test at the herald-leader today. the newspaper has some part-time openings, so hopefully that will work out. if so, i'll get another job, too. of all the scenarios in my mind since i started this job hunt, this is my favorite. (and trust me, there have been quite a few!)  let's see, since last time... i made another trip to louisville. this time to take my wedding dress to the altering place. lori went with me there, which was much appreciated because that dress isn't the easiest thing in the world to get into. then we got to hang out for awhile and catch up. later that night, i went to see "minority report" with cara and kelly. of all the action movies i've seen lately, it might have been my favorite. but matt damon was in "the bourne identity." greg's friends (well, they are becoming my friends, too.) came over to play spades wednesday night. we also sort of watched the NBA draft. i say "sort of" and mean it was on in the other room and we listened. jared jeffries went 11th...much too high. tayshaun got drafted though. we were all glad he went before the lakers' pick because we didn't want to have any interest in the lakers.

      kings island was fun saturday with greg,  urlLink ryan  and two of ryan's friends. the new tomb raider ride is crazy. crazy good. and MUCH better than the movie. it was hot, but there wasn't much we could do about that. ryan also gave me a scanner. he's the best. i spent today with jaclyn in louisville. it was some much needed girl time for both of us.

      good weekend so far. friday night greg took me out on a date. after eating at applebee's, we went to this place in nicholasville called entertainment express. ryan, it was so much like the park, only bigger - go-carts, two mini golf courses, batting cages, video games. no bumper boats and less video games. greg beat me in mini golf, but only by six, which was only one over my goal of losing by five. not bad. we won lots of tickets on skeeball and greg beat me 7-4 in air hockey. but it was fun, even watching greg hit baseballs for a few minutes. today i spent about an hour doing a freelance assignment for the associated press. then greg and i added some items to our registry. we also went to see "the bourne identity" this afternoon. great movie. one of my favorite things about summer is all the appealing new releases. just like christmas. tonight we went to a free concert at a park downtown. over the rhine was playing. the herald-leader is sponsoring a free concert every saturday this summer. fun. just me sort of thing. greg and i got dinner, then went to the park and ate on the UK blanket and listened to good music.

      here's my latest accomplishments: got a comfy new queen-size mattress (it's in lexington thanks to cara and kelly.), put blinds up on the kitchen patio door (thanks to greg), addressed and stuff about 150 wedding invitations (with a little help from greg), interviewed with a saddlebred horse magazine (ok, so i probably won't get the job. one, i don't know anything about horses in general, much less saddlebred horses specifically. two, august is their busiest month, and i'm getting married then.), worked on a creative present for my bridesmaids, scheduled an appointment with the reception site lady on monday, registered for china at dillards, got a new license with my new lexington address (that policewoman better be happy), paid part of speeding ticket, continued to make my apartment feel like home. see, even without a job, i've managed to be productive and fill my time rather wisely. tomorrow i'm doing a stringer assignment for the AP. hey, it's $50. and all i have to do is go to mass tomorrow morning and get some catholic reaction to whatever abuse policy the bishops vote on tonight at their conference.   last night greg and i went to see "bad company." it was funny. chris rock and anthony hopkins were a great combination. i really love living in the same city as greg. we eat dinner together most nights and get to see each other on a regular basis for the first time in two years. well, i guess once a week was a "regular basis," but now it's frequent and regular. yay!

      jaclyn got married this weekend! i had a good time helping her decorate and run errands the two days before. the ceremony at kentucky lake was beautiful. i also saw a few friends i hadn't seen in awhile.  this morning the cable man came to install my cable, but now there are maintenance problems all over the city. that contradicts my new service.   last night driving home from greg's house i got pulled over. the second time ever. and the second ticket ever. that sucks. some people  know - kelly and greg - have gotten pulled over probably 10 times each and have only gotten one ticket each. how unlucky am i?! i was going 48 mph in a 35 zone, BUT i honestly thought it was a 45 mph zone. i told the woman cop that, but she obviously didn't care. i think she was mad i have my old address on my license and not my new lexington one. i told her i have lived here for LESS THAN two weeks. she didn't care. at first she acted like she did. but she gave me a ticket anyway. (OK, so i have my parents' address on my license, but i was going to get it changed AFTER i changed my name in august. oh well, i have to pay $6 now to change the address and another $6 later to change my name. dang.) i can go to traffic school, so at least the fine will be less (about $50 less) and my insurance won't be affected. still, traffic school is boring. (yes, i've been before, because i never get out of tickets, like some people i know.)

      i had fun at the cardinals-reds game last night. first, a random st. louis fan gave us four tickets for free, thanks to greg's shirt. and they weren't even the top six rows like we were going to buy for $5 each. they were $23 each. so we only had to buy one ticket among us. good deal. plus i got to hang out with ryan, which was fun because i don't get to see him much.  today i conquered more wedding stuff, mainly stuff on the computer. i also found some white shoes for jaclyn's wedding this weekend. oh, and i jogged/walked this morning. the street i live on makes a .4-mile circle. three laps for me this morning - walked, jogged, walked. not bad. now i just need to get in the routine.

      i can't believe it's june already!  greg and i ran lots of errands yesterday, including starting our wedding gift registry at target and jc penny. i'm in louisville today getting some wedding stuff done. later this afternoon i have my interview in frankfort. say a prayer for me. this unemployment thing makes me slightly nervous. tomorrow night greg and i are going with some friends to the cardinals-reds game in cincinnati. then thursday i'm going to murray for jaclyn and bryan's wedding. lots of driving in my life right now. but at least i'm getting things finished and organized.

       saturday  my shower was great. kelly, cara and jaclyn did a super job planning it. greg and i got some great wedding presents and i have a few things to surprise him with. (if you know what i mean.) after the shower, kelly, cara, jaclyn, sarah and i ate at bahama breeze and hung out for several hours. it was so great...just like college. it had been awhile since all of us had gotten together, and it seemed to be much-needed by all of us.  sunday  jaclyn, kelly and i went to kentucky kingdom. in line for the first roller coaster (a stand up one that was better than king cobra at kings island) we were sweating entirely too much, so after we rode it we went to the water park. we stayed there - lazy river, wave pool, slides - until we were ready to go. but we rode a suspended roller coaster before leaving. that night jaclyn and i drove back to lexington.  monday  and  tuesday  jaclyn and i were super productive. she helped me get lots of wedding and honeymoon errands finished. mainly they were little odds and ends that i had been compiling on a list. we played lots of cribbage and dr. mario, too. greg took us out of ice cream one night and we all went to see "k-19" another night. the movie was ok. "minority report" continues to be my favorite action movie of the summer.  tonight  scott (who happens to have a pick-up truck) is helping greg and i move some furniture from greg's apartment to ours. greg will finish moving in next week before the wedding when i'm in louisville. that's convenient because he'll have a place to stay once he gives away his bed.

      i checked out a book from the library the other day. it is due aug. 13. my first reaction: i'll be married then. whoa. that's what dates do to me now; i put everything in perspective by the wedding day.   speaking of the wedding, i have my dress back from the alterations lady. it fits perfectly. i also found tableclothes for the reception, which is a huge thing off my list. i was going to rent them, but that would be $8.50 for each one. and i needed about 30. i bought some pretty thick and seemingly nice plastic-lined paper tableclothes at liquor barn yesterday for $2.39 each. much more practical in my mind.   i've been in louisville since  wednesday . that day my mom and i went to pick up my dress and meet with the minister about the ceremony.  thursday  my mom and i and went shopping for her dress. we found it at dillards, at the first store we looked. it's beautiful on her. then we ran other errands, mainly things she needed to get finished. that night i went to dinner with lori and her mom. and later i got to hang out with kelly, which was great. we went on a long walk and just talked and caught up on our lives. i was wearing flip flops, though, and got a blister when i was walking on a little hill. that's silly because i wear flip flops all of the time during the summer and haven't gotten a blister in a few years. i even wore the same flip flops to kings island earlier this summer and was comfy all day.  yesterday  greg's mom and i ran all kinds of wedding and rehearsal dinner errands. last night greg and his mom came to my parents' house to eat dinner with my family (minus my dad, who is in chicago for a conference). after dinner, greg and i took our moms on in rook. we won two of the three games. but the last hand of the last game was luck - whichever team won the bid won the game. and greg got lucky because he bid first with the rook on top of the widow. (that's rook lingo, if you don't understand.) the rook cards were a wedding present from our friends' mark and ginger.   today kelly, cara and jaclyn are throwing me a bridal shower. that should be fun.

      dave matthews was great last night. it wasn't his best show i have ever seen, but i would always listen to him. plus, the band played "crush," my favorite, so i can't complain. i've never heard that song live. sometimes dave seemed like he wasn't sure what he was going to play next, but that probably wasn't the case. here's the set list:  The Stone  Grey Street  Crush  Granny  Satellite  You Never Know  One Sweet World  Bartender  I Did It  Two Step  Loving Wings  Where Are You Going  When The World Ends  Fool To Think  Ants Marching    Gravedigger  Pantala Naga Pampa  Rapunzel   lori and i also got to eat lunch with two guys from college - russ and michael - while we were in nashville. i bought the new counting crows CD while we were killing some time in the mall before the concert. right now my favorite song on that CD is "holiday in spain." i got home a little after 4 a.m. and slept until almost noon. i was one tired girl, but the concert was totally worth the sacrifice of some sleep.

      i had a super long weekend in murray.  wednesday - we got down there that evening and played rook with greg's parents. i love that game.   thursday - we went to the fourth of july parade with some of his extended family and jaclyn and bryan. then we all went to his aunt and uncle's house to swim and grill out. later that afternoon we went to the lake with a few other families (and jaclyn and bryan) to swim some more and have a picnic. we went back to murray when it was almost dark to watch fireworks at the football stadium. it was a pretty good show.   friday - greg's mom and i ran some errands in the morning. we went to talk to the lady who is making the cake for the murray reception and went to a jewelry store, where i found a super deal on the last bridesmaid present i wanted to get. then greg and i got our marriage license and ordered our wedding bands. after eating lunch with his parents, we went to the baseball game in st. louis with his family (minus one brother). too bad the dodgers beat the cardinals. it was fun, though. we got in at 2 a.m.  saturday - i got up at 8 a.m. (remember i got in at 2 a.m.) to go to yard sales with jaclyn. it wasn't that good of a yard sale day, though. i found two books for a total of 75 cents. then i just hung out with her until it was time to go to my friend carrie's wedding. greg met up with me to go there. it was a nice ceremony, we just didn't know anyone but lisa and her husband at the reception. well, greg ran into one person he knew, but basically we just stayed until i could say something to carrie. i love all these weddings, though. gets me excited for my own, you know? saturday night we went bowling with a group of random friends. i bowled much better than usual - 90, 120, 99. there were eight of us, so we bowled in two lanes and added our final scores to see which lane one. greg's lane won both times, barely, though. the last time we would have had it, but greg bowled a 171.  sunday - greg and i ate breakfast with lisa and jared and then went to church. later we ate lunch at his parents' house and then played some more rook before we came back to lexington.   today i'm going to louisville (yes, again) to get somethings i need to work on some wedding stuff. then tomorrow i'm going to nashville with lori to see dave matthews. yay! i'm looking forward to living in lexington without multiple trips to louisville each week. don't get me wrong, i'll go visit my family, but more than one trip to louisville each week is getting crazy. oh well, i only get married once! plus, after aug. 3, greg will live here, you know, and then it will feel more like home.

      not much to update. it seems like for months now i have had all kinds of updates in my life. but it's nice to be in a routine. it's just too bad that routine involves getting up about 6:30 a.m. whew, that's early. i keep thinking i'll get used to it, but my mom swears that will never happen. oh well, i like my job at the richmond register. i have been pretty busy too, which i like.

      quick update:   i'm officially Kristin Taylor.   i started my new job at the richmond register - although how the rain affected tobacco and a fire state groundbreaking don't fall into my beats of education and religion. ah, the beauty and beast of a small-town newspaper. i think i'll like it though.   greg and i went whitewater rafting with mark and ginger earlier this week. it was fun.  i finally got to read the eighth installment of the stephanie plus saga. "hard eight" was the next one in the series and i finally got my hands on it from the library. it was as funny as the others. now i'll just have to wait for janet evanovich to get busy and finish the ninth book.   oh, and we went to murray for our reception last weekend. it was fun and we got a lot more great gifts. ryan brooks also brought our wedding pictures. he did a fabulous job. some other people have also given me some fun pictures from our big day. anybody out there with any, feel free to pass the along. in murray we also got to hang out with jaclyn, bryan, kelly and brandon. good times with good friends.  alright, that's the brief and random update of my life recently. stay tuned for more.

      alright, obviously a lot has happened in my life since i last updated. i'll do my best to catch you all up:  the week before my wedding, the editor from the richmond newspaper emailed me, saying she had an education/features reporter position open. was i interested? of course. so i cram a trip back to lexington from louisville into my week, which wasn't really busy as much as there were just lots of things i wanted to do. anyway, i interviewed wednesday and she offered me the job pretty much the minute i walked in the door. it was super informal. i accepted on the spot, and drove back to louisville with a huge burden lifted. seriously, God is so good. i knew it was going to be ok, but you can't imagine how much more i enjoyed the wedding, reception and honeymoon knowing i was employed. and the editor even had no problem with me starting next week, after the reception in murray. not that there was much she could do about it. so i start wednesday. how perfect.  perfect is the theme. because the wedding was perfect. i was calm, which for a perfectionist is a bit unbelievable. the music was amazing. katie and aaron played "a page is turned" so beautifully. i didn't think i was going to get to hear it, but i could from where i was waiting. i loved that. and katie quigley sang "how beautiful" during the ceremony, and she did great. lou was great on the organ. everything just fit together. i can't wait to watch it on video. i got so many compliments on the music.  and the flowers...oh, they might have been my favorite part. it's a toss up with the music. the bridesmaids bouquets looked gorgeous with their yellow dresses. they each carried a different color daisy - red, orange, yellow, pink, coral. then the groomsmen they walked with had matching mini daisies on. it was great. and my bouquet was beautiful - same color daisies with white roses. they are going to look great in the pictures.   my dad walking me in, the vows, the rings, the kiss, all the prayers...everything was so smooth. the chapel lady actually told me it was the smoothest wedding she had ever seen. what a compliment!  my mom's family helped so much at the reception, serving drinks and helping set up and clean up. and cara's family catered it perfectly. i got so many compliments on that too. my friend elizabeth that came all the way from portland just for the weekend caught my bouquet in the toss, which i thought was appropriate.   ok, honeymoon... guess what? it was perfect. traveling was smooth, and we actually got free ticket vouchers because we let them reroute us to san francisco. but we only ended up getting out there 40 minutes later than originally planned, so it didn't matter to us. we got the better end of the deal in our minds.   lake tahoe was beautiful. we have tons of pictures for anyone to see, too. we went to carson city and reno, nevada, one day. they are just over the mountains. then we stopped in sacramento on our way to san francisco, where we spent the last two nights. ok, back to tahoe. we drove around the lake - all 70-something miles our first day there. that might have been my favorite thing. the california side has a bunch of little communities with quaint restaurants and shops. the nevada side is more protected parks and forests. that's until you get to the casinos on the south part of the lake. anyway, i liked the variety in scenes and weather.   i'm sure i'll share more later, especially with whoever i see soon. but my fingers are tired of typing.

      a girl driving a BMW hit greg in his cavalier yesterday on nicholasville road. he was turning left a green light and she ran a red light. apparently she never even considered the fact that the light might be red. she slammed into the front of his car, causing the air bag to come out. when the air bag came out, the part usually holding it in shattered the windshield. the whole front bumper is completely torn off, actually it's currently his greg's backseat. the right headlight is missing and some electrical stuff is hanging out. she knows it was totally her fault, as do all the law school students that witnessed the collision. right now we are just waiting to see if her insurance is going to pay to fix it or pay for a new car. regardless, i'm just happy the car is the only thing hurting.  cassie scored a goal sunday! yea! the coach moved her from her defensive position to midfield. hopefully that changes will help austin peay win a few games. the governors play murray state thursday. sorry murray, in this case i have to cheer for the OVC rival. go peay!

      yes, we sat out in the rain at the UK game yesterday. It was fun, though. Who would have thought the Wildcats would have 3-0. It's always fun to watch them beat the Hoosiers, in any sport. (Right, Adam?)   Tonight we went to Southland. (We slept in this morning, so went to the evening service!) Mike Breaux is an amazing teacher. Frequent readers have heard that before, I know. Anyway, tonight he challenged us to life our lives for God, the only way to make an eternal difference in the world. Like he said, "Life is unspeakably unpredictable." And for that reason, we should remember that everything we have is a gift from God. And while he doesn't promise life will be easy and comfortable, he promises us hisgrace to cover our mistakes, his guidance to get us through and his love eternally.    I've learned if I spend my life wishing I had someone else's gifts, I'm going to bury my own. ...At the end of my life, God isn't going to ask why I didn't lead someone else's life; he's going to ask what I did with what he gave me.  -Mike Breaux after teaching from Matthew 25, specifically the parable of the talents.

      it's been more than a week.  last week i had to work late a couple of nights. but that wasn't so bad.   this weekend was good. friday night greg and i hung out with our insurance agent and his wife. it's a good story actually: we signed up for car insurance through AAA not long ago. it was a thursday. then that following sunday we saw john and emily at church, even though it was a service we don't usually go to and we were sitting on the side of the sanctuary we don't usually sit on. anyway, john asked if we wanted to go to dinner that night after service. but we couldn't because greg was going to play basketball with some guys. we all said we should hang out sometime, though. so friday night we ate mexican food then watched "the rookie." it's fun to hang out with someone new, and they happen to be our age and live near us in lexington. we're paying enough for our car insurance that it is a nice added bonus that our policy came with friends.  saturday i took a 2 1/2-hour nap about 45 minutes after i got up. then greg and i were lazy and watched football in our pajamas until the evening. i took a shower during halftime of the UK game, then i had to work for a couple of hours after the wildcats were defeated. after working, greg and i played cards (spades and hearts) with mark and ginger. it was fun, and we stayed up late, knowing we were gaining an hour when our clocks fell back an hour at 2 a.m.  yesterday we went to louisville. greg played football and my mom and i went to see my grandpa. poppy gave greg and i an ugly orange chair. we lack furniture, so it's nice to have it anyway. although, i'm not sure where it will fit. we'll make room somewhere. i had a good time with my mom, who actually had a whole day off from both her jobs and my sister's soccer games.   i stayed up about 90 minutes past my self-imposed 10 p.m. bedtime, but it was worth it to see the angels beat the giants. and it's monday, so i'll stay up late again tonight to watch "csi: miami." it's not as good as the original, but worth staying up for.

      i broke 100 both games i bowled last night. but the highlight was definitely the THREE STRIKES IN A ROW in the ninth and tenth frames of the first game. a turkey flashed on the score screen. greg still beat me both games, but i came in second twice. (there were four of us bowling.)

      burr, it was cold when i was at eastern kentucky university's campus working on a story. i thought my fingers were going to freeze and i was never going to pick up a pen again. ok, so that's a bit dramatic, but it was cold.   so, i can't name you one angels player, but i sure hope they beat the giants.

       urlLink laura  says i don't update my blog as much since i'm married now. but really it's because my job doesn't involve as much free time as my last, so that's less time messing around on the computer. plus i have a swell new roommate, which does take up SOME of my time.   it was great to see laura this weekend. i miss our dorm room chats, but it's comforting to know God created a true friendship between us and we can always pick up where we left off. i also saw lynn and andrea, two of my college friends who live in florida. lynn lives in naples and organizes cool recreation program for kids with disabilities and andrea lives in west palm beach and works for a christian radio station. i got to hang out with jaclyn, too. God totally puts her right where i need her. it's fun that we're in the same stage of our life and can share stuff. (i know i've said that before, but those who know me well know i'm repetitive.) we hung out with greg's family too - went to the homecoming parade and ate a couiple of meals with them.  we hung out with laura and dave in their new house in la grange on sunday. i was super jealous of the house, but glad to spend some time with them. we grilled out and watched sports, perfect activities for a lazy sunday afternoon.   murray state won its homecoming game, so that made it more fun. greg and i are going to watch murray play eastern this weekend for EKU's homecoming. figure i can invest a bit into the town in which i work. too bad i'll be cheering for the visiting team.  ok, i'm going to watch the cardinals. dang giants. barry better not hit any homers.

      i reread "tuck everlasting," one of my favorite books from elementary school, so i'll appreciate the movie more. i had forgotten much of the book - it was fourth or fifth grade when i read it. here are some great quotes from that book, which you really should read, if you haven't. (it took all of two hours for me to read it.)   Life's got to be lived, no matter how long or short. You got to take what comes. We just go along, like everybody else, one day at a time. ... Still -- there's no use trying to figure why things fall the way they do. Things just are, and fussing don't bring changes.    She was able to believe this because she needed to; and believing was her own true, promising friend once more.

      the other day while i was listening to the radio driving home from work, i heard paula abdul's "forever your girl" then "when the stars go blue" by the corrs and bono. such combinations are what i love and hate about listening to the radio. those particular songs happen to please me.   cardinals 2-0 over the diamondbacks. i watched entirely too much TV last night: cardinals game, survivor, CSI.   greg's car is in the shop getting fixed. but he has a rental car, thanks to miss bmw's insurance.

      yesterday was a good day.  i heard brennan manning speak at a church in southern indiana. he's amazing. (for you who don't know, he wrote my favorite book, "the ragamuffin gospel.") he challenged me with the fundamentals of christianity, and God totally used him to refresh me. jaclyn was there too, which is a blessing in itself. (a few other girls i know from college were there too.)   i also was asked to work on the chrysalis weekend in january in louisville. this is so exciting because it was that weekend in 1996 that totally changed my life. we have meetings to prepare for it throughout november and december. those are fun times, too. i'll get to spend some time with some old friends who i don't get to see very often.   what happened with the UK football game? well, i know what happened, actually. that's just craziness.

      my car is now more than 100,000 miles old.   we watched the UK game at damon's yesterday. it took us well into the third quarter to get an actual table, but we got to watch the pay-per-view game free, so it was well worth it.   sometimes it's hard for me to cope with change. some change is good and i fully embrace it, such as marrying greg. other change confuses my heart, such as friends growing apart. sure, my friendships are going to change now that i'm married, but that doesn't mean they have to non-existant. i've made some new friends, mainly couple-friends or co-workers, since greg and i got married, but i miss some of my old friends. i know God always tries to teach me about depending on him, and not always people, but that doesn't mean friendships aren't important. sometimes it's hard living in lexington, away from my comfort zones. but i know God has good reasons in that as well. but, as a girl, it's hard not having one of my best girl friends in my life like she has been in the past. make sense?

      i had to make a new hole in my black belt this morning. (good thing greg and i got a new set of knifes with a jc penny gift certificate this weekend.) i've lost between 10 and 15 pounds the last few months, which is good but frustrating. it obviously makes me feel good, but none of my pants fit very well. and the thing is, i haven't changed my eating habits, but i've been drinking lots more water.   our christmas with my family was good. we got a new 32-inch TV, which is significantly bigger than the TV we were borrowing from my aunt and uncle. our parents each pitched in toward our new one.   i've seen several movies during the last week -- "two weeks notice," "catch me if you can" and "gangs in new york." i'd recommend the first two. i honestly can't believe i watched two leonardo dicaprio movies. i don't like him, bu t will admit he was good in both "catch me if you can" and "gangs in new york." i couldn't watch "gangs in new york" again, though. it made me tense, and i covered my eyes several times. "two weeks notice" made me laugh a lot. and "catch me if you can" was clever.   the wildcats weren't looking so hot saturday. i wanted to call adam and comment on temple's win over the hoosiers, but decided i really didn't have any room to talk about that as a UK fan.

      my first christmas at the taylors went well this past weekend. it's sort of fun to figure out different family's traditions. greg and i are going to my parents' house tonight and will be there all day tomorrow too. i'm at work right now, but should only be here about another hour or so.  we met jaclyn and bryan in frankfort last night for dinner. it was great to see them.   the randomness... brian won survivor. he's sneaky and gave me a bad feeling during the finale. but i didn't want clay to win either. mike davis got a bit too fired up. that's what the wildcats do to people, especially former alabama players. city on the hill christmas CD is great. i've listened to it over and over again the last week or so. i typed the majority of the 878 santa letters madison county student submitted to the newspaper. i couldn't believe some kids asked for grand theft auto vice city...i've heard that game is filled with filth.

      it's sort of been a lazy weekend, but isn't that what these days are for?  yesterday, i cleaned up around the apartment after i got up at 11:30 a.m. (greg got up at 5:30 a.m. to study for his 8 a.m. final. yes, law students have finals on saturday.) then my mom came down and took me out to eat. we watched the second half of the UK-michigan state game with greg. then greg and i hung out with katie and brad. we all went to the kentucky horse park to see the christmas lights. it was festive. the moving horse lights were the coolest.   greg is studying most of today for his last final tomorrow. i just finished working on my dad's resume and cover letter for a job he's applying for. aren't i a nice daughter? although, writing a cover letter for someone else is easier than writing my own. i think i'm going to finish christmas shopping and get some of relatives gifts ready for the mail, at least the ones who aren't coming to town.   it's unfortunate i really don't like any the remaining survivor players. rooting for someone makes the finale better. (the finale is thursday, in case you didn't know. that's the reunion and all.) i guess i'll cheer for brian, and definitely cheer against helen and jan. clay is so-so.

      Yes, I support Bush. But he does say some funny things:  "The vast majority of our imports come from outside the country."   "If we don't succeed, we run the risk of failure."    "One word sums up probably the responsibility of any governor, and that one word is 'to be prepared.'"   "I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future."   "The future will be better tomorrow."   "We're going to have the best educated American people in the world."   "I stand by all the misstatements that I've made."   "We have a firm commitment to NATO, we are a part of NATO. We have a firm commitment to Europe. We are a part of Europe."   "Public speaking is very easy."   "A low voter turnout is an indication of fewer people going to the polls."   "We are ready for any unforeseen event that may or may not occur."    "For NASA, space is still a high priority."   "Quite frankly, teachers are the only profession that teach our children."   "It isn't pollution that's harming the environment. It's the impurities in our air and water that are doing it."

      i freelanced the EKU men's basketball game for the associated press tonight. it was fun, plus some extra money, which never hurts. travis ford looks like he's 12. EKU won, but it was against some division II school called shepherd college. it's in west virginia somewhere. the AP only runs about 200 words of play-by-play sort of stuff for games like that, so it didn't take me long to pull that together. plus, greg was studying for his finals that start next week so it gave me something to do.  i wish i had been able to go to the trinity-male game. sounds like it was exciting. all kinds of offense that went down to a last-second interception. that's how championship games are suppose to be, regardless of the level - high school, college, professional.   we got together with some couples from our bible study to watch the UK game. it was fun to hang out with them and see the wildcats win.

      ok, i've totally neglected this blog, although not as much as ryan.   thanksgiving was good. wednesday and thursday greg and i hung out with my family. then we went to murray for the weekend. i had a great time both places. we also went to see murray state play in the division I-aa playoffs against western. the racers got their butts kicked 59-20. it was still fun, and warmer than i expected.   we played cranium with my family at carolyn and jerry's house and lots of rook and other card games with greg's family. you all know how i love games, and friendly competition. it was also great to see cassie and meet her friend kay, who is from colorado and plays soccer at austin peay.   yesterday before we came back from murray, we hung out with jaclyn and bryan. as always, it was fun, especially because i have been in jaclyn withdrawl. jaclyn and i are in mourning that we can't spend new years together as we have the last couple of years, but we realize that eventually we may live in the same town, which would make those occasions easier.   in a recent entry, i talked about working on a chrysalis weekend in louisville. now greg is working on it also. that will make driving to tonight's planning meeting much better. he's good company.   i'm so in the christmas spirit. i'm going to put up our tree as soon as a i get a chance. there are already wrapped presents to put under it! i also hope i get to finish christmas shopping this weekend and work on our christmas cards. ok, i'm a nerd, but it's fun. instead of spending much on each other, greg and i shopped for two angel tree kids this year -- a girl and a boy, both 12.

      Having a bad day? There was a case in one hospital's Intensive Care ward where patients always died in the same bed, on Sunday morning, at about 11 a.m., regardless of their medical condition. This puzzled the doctors and some even thought that it had something to do with the supernatural. No one could solve the mystery -- as to why the deaths occurred around 11 a.m. Sundays. So a World-Wide team of experts was assembled to investigate the cause of the incidents. The next Sunday mjorning, a few minutes before 11 a.m., all doctors and nurses nervously wait outside the ward to see for themselves what the terrible phenomenon was all about. Some were holding wooden crosses, prayer books and other holy objects to ward off the evil  spirits. Just when the clock struck 11, Pookie Johnson, the part-time Sunday sweeper, entered the ward and unplugged the life support system so that he could use the vacuum cleaner.  Having a Bad Day?  The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska was $80,000. At a special ceremony, two of the most expensively saved animals were being released back into the wild amid cheers and applause from onlookers. A minute later, in full view, a killer whale ate them both.  Still think you are having a bad day?  A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen shaking frantically, almost in a dancing frenzy, with some kind of wire running from his waist toward the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current, she whacked him with a handy plank of wood, breaking his arm in two places. Up to that moment, he had been happily listening to his walkman.  STILL think you're having a bad day?  Two animal rights protesters were protesting at the cruelty of sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn, Germany.  Suddenly, all 2,000 pigs broke loose and escaped through a broken fence, stampeding madly. The two hopeless protesters were trampled to death.  What?!  STILL having a bad day?  Iraqi terrorist Khay Rahnajet didn't pay enough postage on a letter bomb. It came back with "return to sender" stamped on it. Forgetting it was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits.  Feeling better?

      "For attractive lips, speak words of kindness. For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people. For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry. For beautiful hair, let a child run his/her fingers through it once a day. For poise, walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone. People, even more than things, have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed, and redeemed; never throw out anyone. Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of each of your arms. As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands; one for helping yourself, and the other for helping others." -Audrey Hepburn

      yay, ryan, you updated your site.  chrysalis was great this weekend. it's always so encouraging to go back to the place where i met God for the first time and be with the people who had a major influence on my life. even if i don't see and communicate with those people on a regular basis, they are special because they were there in the beginning. anyway, while wandering down memory lane this weekend i also had the chance to influence the lives of some high school girls. they were great to be around and really had a lot of wisdom, which i admit surprised me. it really is a blessing to serve. it was also neat to have greg be part of an experience so special to me. it was like my worlds were colliding.  we're going to the UK-auburn game tonight with greg's parents. i haven't been to a UK game this basketball season yet, so it'll be fun to be in the rupp arena atmosphere.

      ok, it's been two weeks. but that's not as long as it has taken ryan to update his blog. um, more than two months, ryan? come on, it's a whole new year now. readers are on edge, waiting to hear what's going on.  i had a flat tire on the way to work yesterday. it sucked. but a nice man who works at EKU changed my tire. but i had to buy a new tire later in the day. i pretty much got screwed over by the tire people, i think. i hate feeling like i'm at the mercy of those mechanics.  greg and i are working on chrysalis this weekend. it should be refreshing and a nice break from the "real world."  go titans.  i've been pretty busy at work, hence the lack of blog updates. i've written lots of education stories since the schools have been back from break. and i've covered kmart closing. 326 kmart stores are closing nationwide and one of the four in kentucky is in richmond.

      happy new year.   greg and i had a good time with some of our bible study friends new year's eve. we played cranium and catchphrase. and we ate a lot. yesterday we hung out at my grandpa's house most of the day and watched football. my aunt kim from new jersey (she used to live in canada.) was in town, too. i love visiting with her. actually, greg and i are planning a trip to new jersey (near newark) during his spring break. it's only a bit more than an hour by train to new york city, so it will be fun to see some sites there. we have airplane vouchers from delta, so that'll help greatly with the price of the trip.

      greg and i -- not to mention thousands of others in lexington -- haven't head electricity in our apartment since early, early sunday morning, thanks to an ice storm. we went to bed saturday night with power and woke up sunday without it. our apartment has remained dark and cold since. the tree branches are covered with so much ice they are falling on power lines. it's actually a very crazy situation. we've been staying with another couple from our bible, as has even another couple without power. and while i appreciate their hospitality, i can't wait to get back in my own bed.   of course, once we return to our apartment, i'll have to clean out the refrigerator and all the oh-so lovely rotten foods and milk.

      greg and i went on our first date five years ago today. we went out for ice cream at baskin robbins. then we actually ended up staying up all night talking. the ice cream date was planned, but the all-night talking was a pleasant surprise.   tired of all the kristin and greg landmark dates? well, i think this is the last of them for awhile.  this was a busy but great week for me.  tuesday night i went to see the indigo girls at UK. it was just them and their acoustic guitars, and occasionally a bango or mandolin. it was wonderful. laura and sarah come down from louisville to go, so it was also fun to see them. i sat with katie and brad. definitely good times. indigo girls played old and new song, really the perfect combination of both. and our seats were in the center of the third row.   wednesday i covered the education rally in frankfort. it was a neat experience to be with more than 20,000 educators trying to get legislators' attention to not cut education funding because of state budge shortfalls. while it was fun, i had to work late writing my story about that and another event i covered that day.   thursday was another long day at work because i had a school board meeting to cover that night.   but it's friday, and i've been off all day. quite the pleasant ending to a long week. i ate lunch with bethaney, a friend from our bible study. it was fun to talk with her because i don't know her all that well yet. i enjoy hanging out with new people. then i went to jc penny because i had some gift cards there.  tonight greg and i are going to baskin robbins, just like we did five years ago and most every year since. (there were even coupons in last sunday's paper, so we'll get a good deal on our ice cream!)

      greg said butler is his new favorite basketball team. a slight exaggeration. but, still, it was nice to see butler pull the upset on louisville.   we went to see "view from the top" yesterday. pretty good. a little disappointing with the number of big stars in it. but still entertaining.   yes, i've watched more basketball than war coverage. does that surprise you, coming from the journalist? really, i think the coverage is overwhelming and overkill. yes, i want to know what's going on with our troops and bush's strategy to dethrone saddam. BUT i don't need to see live action as the war unfolds. i can't imagine how i'd feel if i knew someone serving over there. greg's brother has been called up with his national guard unit out of paducah, but as of now he's only going to fort campbell. anyway, it's obviously been on my mind, and even more so after church today. southland is doing a sermon series on the names of God used in the bible. this week's message was about "el elyon," which means "the God who is in control." how timely. and mike breaux said the sermon series was planned last summer. to me that totally demonstrates the power of God and how he knows our hearts and minds before we even can imagine what will happen. one point really struck me: no one has any authority apart from the most high God. that includes me, you, saddam, bush...everyone. and how blessed we are to have a president who prays and studies the bible because he believes it gives him greater guidance for our nation. anyway, mike breaux used tons of scripture about how almighty God is and how control he truly is. yes, he's in control, even in conflicting times such as now. "it's not God who is out of control; mankind is out of control and will be until Jesus comes back."  a few other thoughts from mike breaux: "the most high God is one our side. ... through all of our lives, he gives us the strength to cope with all we encounter."  "these are anxious times. ... we need someone to run to where we'll be safe. how do we find that? we just have to believe he is the most high God."  the babylonian king nebuchadnezzar acknowledged God as his Lord. today in church, mike breaux said he prayed today's leaders did the same. "... I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity returned, and I praised and worshiped the Most High God and honored him who lives forever, whose rule is everlasting, his kingdom evermore. All the people of the earth are nothing when compared to him; he does whatever he thinks best among the angels of heaven, as well as here on earth. No one can stop him or challenge him, saying, 'What do you mean by doing these things?' When my mind returned to me, so did my honor and glory and kingdom. My counselors and officers came back to me and I was reestablished as head of my kingdom, with even greater honor than before. Now, I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and glorify and honor the King of Heaven, the Judge of all, whose every act is right and good; for he is able to take those who walk proudly and push them into the dust!" --Daniel 4:34-37

      new york is an amazing city, really. all the different neighborhoods have distinct personalities, which really gives it character. ok, so it's not the cleanest place in the world, although i'd rank it above san francisco in that area. i really enjoyed seeing all the buildings and places i've seen in movies. central park is totally neat - just the way it sits surrounded by skyscrapers. we saw the UN, which was impressive with the war in iraq getting ready to start, all kinds of TV trucks were lined up outside, waiting. my favorite part, though, was seeing "man of la mancha" on broadway then eating at this incredible brazilian restaurant. i love the don quixote story. the restaurant was a new experience - you have a card with a red and green side. to start eating, you turn the green side up. first, there's a huge salad bar with all kinds of interesting foods on it. (shrimp!) then the servers bring around all kinds of different meat - lamb, pork tenderloin, white fish, salmon, sausage, all kinds of different beef, chicken - and you take a piece or two of what you want, and they just keep coming around. when you're finished, you turn the red side of the card up. so, it's pay a flat price and eat as much as you want. and the food was delicious. i also had fried bananas there for the first time. totally a new favorite. with the meats, your table also gets whatever side dishes you want. we had mashed potatoes, rice and fried bananas.   (by the way, greg and i were visiting my aunt kim, uncle bill and cousins jennifer and jeff, who live in randolph, new jersey. it's outside newark, n.j., and not far from new york city. they moved there last summer, so this was a chance to see them and see nyc. it was greg's spring break, so i decided to take five vacation days for my own spring break. it was nice to be away from our routines for awhile.)  last night we went to see some sweet sixteen high school basketball games. that's always fun. we saw lexington henry clay beat warren central and louisville ballard beat rose hill. we spent the earlier part of the day watching ncaa, which is great, too. kentucky looked pretty good. the ncaa tournament fun to watch, even if my bracket is totally messed up. yes, i picked western kentucky and austin peay to pull upsets on illinois and louisville, respectively, but i was wishing too hard. (hey, adam, i chose indiana over alabama, though. at least the hoosiers pulled through this first time.)  shelley and dustin are expecting their baby in august. and it's a boy!

      it's been awhile. not as long as ryan. but awhile.  last you all knew we just got our power back on. that night we were so excited about our own light and heat that we woke up in the middle of the night sweating because the heat was up too high. we had a good laugh about that.  how about those wildcats? undefeated in the SEC. some friends of ours gave us some tickets to tonight's game about an hour ago. it'll be fun.

      "...abandon youself to God. And once you do get to the point of total surrender to him, you will be the most surprised and delighted person on earth. God will have you absolutely, without any limitations, and he will have given you your life. If you are not there, it is either because of disobedience in your life or your refusal to be simple enough." -- Oswald Chambers in "My Utmost for His Highest"  wow. that's so my problem sometimes. i complicate matters with drama and emotion. emotion isn't necessarily bad, but not everything is as important as i think it is. i value people and feelings a lot, maybe too much at times. and too often i get caught up in tasks and forget what is ultimately important. i need to start asking myself: how will this affect eternity? what will this investment look like the day i die? really, that puts matters into perspective.

      "People knew God perfectly well, but when they didn't treat him like God, refusing to worship him, they trivialized themselves into silliness and confusion so that there was neither sense nor direction left in their lives. They pretended to know it all, but were illiterate regarding life. They traded the glory of God who holds the whole world in his hands for cheap figurines you can buy at any roadside stand. ... It wasn't long before they were living in a pigpen, smeared with filth, filthy inside and out. And all this because they traded the true God for a fake god, and worshipped the god they made instead of the God who made them -- the God we bless, the God who blesses us. Oh yes!." - from Romans 1 in The Message  "If you remain true to God, God will lead you directly through every barrier and right into the inner chamber of the knowledge of himself. But you must always be willing to come to the point of giving up your own convictions and traditional beliefs. Don't ask God to test you. ... Abraham did not make any such statement -- he simply remained true to God, and God purified his faith." -Oswald Chambers  being the perfectionist i am, sometimes it's hard to remember God is bigger and better than any task in my life. as much as to-do lists motivate me, God should be the motivation for everything i do -- at home, at work, with greg, with my friends, with my family, anytime, anywhere, anything. sometimes i worship God based on my definition of who he is. sometimes i interpret God as it is convenient for me. but really i just need to seek him, knowing he's more of a perfectionist than i am.  i watched several episodes of "felicity" yesterday. alexa let me borrow more of the first season on DVD. i love that show. it reminds me how everything changes. even as people come and go in our lives, they all have an impact on who we are, even if just for a few moments. all of those encounters and experiences change us, and it is our responsibility to let that change be for the better. sometimes i miss people who used to be important in my life. but, really, i should just feel blessed to have experienced part of my life with them. that's a hard lesson for me to learn, but i'm trying.

      i watched the first two "felicity" episodes last night with alexa. it was such a great show and brought back fun memories of living in clark at murray. the show ran pretty much the same time i was in college, so i'll always associate with those times and the people with whom i watched it.

      we went to see "phone booth" last week. crazy movie. i think i liked it. the whole story takes place on one corner in new york. i was tense through the whole thing because i just wanted him to hang up the phone.   too bad kansas lost. i wasn't really passionate - afterall, i kept falling asleep. but i had to pick a team to route for. and kansas had the seniors and i think roy williams seems like he deserves a national championship after 15 years at kansas. we've moved on to baseball season anyway.  i hung out with jaclyn, my mom and cassie sunday. cassie was as hyper as usual. and it was fun to see jaclyn and catch up with our girly time. we ran errands while we talked.  oh, and i won my first individual writing award. it's from the kentucky education association for education reporting. i get to accept it friday morning in louisville at the executive west hotel. i'm pretty pumped about. plus, it'll look fabulous on my resume. i submitted a series of four articles about the KEA rally held in february in frankfort for teachers and other school personnel. the articles started in november with planning for the rally and concluded with the rally.   silly cold weather is back. that lovely sunshine was a tease last week.

      again, it's been awhile...  i got in my car this afternoon and noticed how hot the steering wheel and seats were. as unpleasant as that is to touch, it's nice the sun has been shining so much it turned my car into an oven-like state. i love this weather.

      sleeping in is so good. i long for a job that doesn't require my presence until 10 a.m.   i love the way my teeth feeling after getting them cleaned at the dentist. why do people fear the dentist so much? ok, the cleaning paste doesn't taste very good, but it is so effective. i learned a lot about teeth and gums when i was at a new dentist wednesday. really, i can make a whole list of worse things in life than the dentist.   sometimes i think i obsess too much about how i hate change. my friend kelly offered some wisdom: Things will never be the same, but there's a chance they could be better.

      "Many prayers of believers are hindered by Satan. Yet you do not need to fear when your unanswered prayers are piling up, for soon they will break through like a flood. When that happens, not only will your answers flow through but the will also be accompanied by new blessings. Hell works the hardest on God's saints. The most worthy souls will be tested with the most pressure and the highest heat, but heaven will not desert them." --William L. Watkinson.

      we saw "down with love" tonight. i really enjoyed it. the plot sort of reminded me of "how to lose a guy in 10 days," but this movie had an artsy feel to it. it's really quite clever.

      it was so nice sleeping in this morning.  we had fun at the reds-cardinals game last night, even if the reds won. at least there were no ninth-inning, game-winning homeruns like the previous two games. i enjoyed catching up with ryan, too.   funny story: last week greg recognized one of our neighbors as a guy he knew his freshman year of college. turns out he was right. we talked to them for while and realized we have a lot in common. lots of little things, such as we both had tickets for the baseball game last night. our neighbors -- katie and lucas -- rode to cincinnati with us. it was fun to talk to them and possibly have some friends here this summer.   greg's finished with law school. he graduates tomorrow afternoon. tonight we're having a party with our families and some friends at joe bolonga's. it'll be fun to have everyone together. i just finished putting icing on K-shaped cookies that i backed for the party. K is for kentucky, to clear up any confusion. and they have blue icing.   i guess he's not really finished because he has a bar prep class this summer and has to take the bar exam at the end of july.

      papaw (that's greg's grandpa) and john (that's greg's brother) were passing through richmond today from versailles to knoxville, tenn. i got to eat lunch with them at cracker barrel. it isn't often family (blood or in-laws) pass through richmond, especially when they live in murray, so it was a nice surprise. (yeah, surprise. papaw called me at 10 a.m. and left a message. that's about an hour before i met them there.) anyway, it was nice to see them. and actually that's the first time any family has "passed through" richmond since i've been working there.

      today was the first day i really got to enjoy the sunshine. and that was only for an hour at greg's softball game. his team got beat, as usual, but i enjoyed being the sun. it feels like summer now. maybe i'll get to go swimming soon.   i got to hang out with shelley and dustin and bekah and barrett this weekend. it was good to see all of them. shelley is pregnant. i am so excited for them, and can't wait to see the baby. (it could come in the next few weeks! her due date is actually aug. 1, though.) we had a wedding shower (well, cook out) for bekah and barrett at my parents' house. then sunday we're having a baby shower for shelley. those are good excuses to get together, though. it's fun to have friends like that -- the ones you don't have to talk to all of the time to really enjoy when you do get to see them.

      i think i'm addicted to rainbow sherbert. it's such a great summer food. i'm usually an ice cream elitist and don't settle for ice cream out of a carton from my own freezer. but kroger brand rainbow sherbert is good stuff, especially in a sugar cone right out of my own cabinet.   speaking of summer foods, which is an important concept has the rain (hopefully) goes away and it actually starts feeling like summer ... cara used to think (well, she may still, i'm not sure.) fudge rounds -- you know, the little debbie snacks -- were good summer food. i never really understood that, but, hey, everybody has their own summer food, you know.  i talked to jaclyn tonight. our conversation made me want to move to murray tonight.

      we're back from the beach. i wish we were still there. the time went by much too fast.  we went to perdido key, florida, with my family. it's a nice beach near the florida-alabama line on the panhandle. it's not a tourist trap, which i like. i spent the majority of my time lounging at the beach or the pool. i read three books in four days and really enjoyed hanging out with my family. it was the first family vacation for us since i was in high school, and we had a full house -- my parents, cassie, kevin and his girlfriend laine and greg and i.  i have nine more days of work before we move.  today i'm having a bridal shower for katie at my apartment. too bad i don't know any of the girls coming. oh well, it should still be fun.

      after a summer-fun weekend in murray, i'm ready to move there. some of you may remember how ready i was to leave murray after i graduated. but two years in louisville and lexington have made me appreciate the small town. this weekend we hung out with greg's family and jaclyn and bryan -- we went swimming in the pool at greg's aunt and uncle's house and in kentucky lake. we had a picnic. i got beat in bowling, but sitll had fun. jaclyn and i picked out paint for the house greg and i are going to live in. it's fabulous, really. the world slows down in murray, which puts my  mind at ease.   i only have 14 more days at work. that's counting today. monday night we're leaving for florida with my family. it's the first family vacation we've been on since i was in high school. it's my parents, kevin and his girlfriend laine, cassie and greg and i. it should be a lot of fun, especially being able to hang out with them before greg and i move to murray. although murray isn't the edge of the earth like some people (ryan...) think it is. after vacation i have only nine days left at work before we move. there's a few days between finishing my job here and moving, and those are reserved for katie's wedding and our first-year anniversary.   THEN after we move, which we plan on doing aug. 5, we're going on vacation to the smoky mountains with greg's family. yea, the beach AND the mountains within a month or so. we have some pretty great families.

      cassie scored a goal last night in austin peay's first win in women's soccer since the university formed a team last year. but, maybe you should know, cassie plays defense and scored from about 50 feet from the goal. it tied the game against alabama a & m at 1 and got the ball rolling, for lack of a better expression. oh, and there was a 90-minute delay about 20 minutes into the game, thanks to lightning.

      i have an interview tuesday at the murray ledger & times. yes, it's the newspaper we frequently bashed in journalism classes when i was in college, but it's really the only journalism opportunity here. i appreciate community journalism, but i would have to deal with the less-than-attractive appearance of the paper. it's published in the mornings, making it an afternoon paper, like the richmond register. but i don't think the ledger has a sunday edition. we'll see.

      ok, i know it's been awhile.  i started working part time with greg's parents this week. they own their own business and work from their home, so i'm helping them with some clerical tasks. i'm good at that stuff, so it's a good fit. they needed help and i needed something to do. plus it will be extra income, which is always nice. also, i'm going to cover the home murray state football games for the associated press. there are six of those. i'm hoping to do the same once basketball season starts. murray lacks journalism jobs, so i'm glad i at least get to do something in my field.  kevin and laine are having a girl. they found out yesterday, and kevin was really cute about it. he left a message for me, saying, "you are going to have a niece." he sounded happy. i really pray this is good coming from a mistake. i know God is big enough to make things work well. the baby is due in early january.

      since aug. 1, when i last posted, greg and i have:  been part of katie and brad's fabulous wedding.   celebrated our first anniversary.  moved all our worldly possessions in a big yellow truck to murray.  vacationed in the smoky mountains with greg's family for five days.  watched a titans pre-season game in nashville.  unpacked too many boxes.  painted one bedroom and the kitchen cabinets.  unpacked more boxes.  moved furniture.   started our life in murray, where everything is a bit slower than louisville or lexington. that's a good thing, though. setting up a bank account, registering to vote and getting our driver's licenses was so much easier here than lexington. we have new address and phone number now, too.  that's the nutshell version of the last two weeks of my life.

      i have 162 postcards. the majority of those made a lovely border in our bedroom. others will be incorporated in our new bedroom in murray, which will continue the travel-themed decor. postcards really are great and i love that people think enough of me to bring them or send them to me. my editors gave me two madison county postcards with my going-away gift yesterday. (that happened to be an EKU t-shirt. i'm developing an OVC collection -- murray state, austin peay, eastern.) anyway, i wasn't expecting my last day of work to be sad. but it was. i just really enjoyed the people there. i liked my job, but that's a lot easier to leave than the people who became my friends. that's what is weird about moving. it just jumbles everything. but i sure am looking forward to moving it to the sycamore house and being in the same town as jaclyn. we have big plans to grill out lots of dinner and walk, both as a social activity and exercise.   we move monday. then tuesday we are going on vacation with greg's family. we're staying in a cabin in the smoky mountains. it's not gatlinburg. but somewhere near there. i'm just looking forward to relaxing.   i still don't have a job, which will probably begin to worry me. but i shouldn't worry. at least greg has a job. maybe this is suppose to be a season about learning not to worry and to trust God. that's a lesson i tend to be taught over and over again. wonder when i will learn. that's life, though.   tonight is katie and brad's rehearsal dinner. then the wedding is tomorrow. i'm so excited. and as happy as i am for them, i know it's going to be a bit sad because they are moving to boston. that's far. again, my life feels slightly jumbled. katie and brad are great together, and i am so blessed by watching their relationship stay centered on God and what he has in store for them. katie and i have been friends for about 14 years. wow.   alright, i'm off to finish packing. as jaclyn said, i need to "get crackin' on packin.'"

      Electronic communication amazes me. (Yes, this comes from a person who wrote a 25-page paper in college about how electronic communication, primarily e-mail, affects interpersonal relationships in the work place. OK, I'm a dork.) Anyway, it amazes me because I can go 18 months without talking to a friend, and then all the sudden have a "conversation" with him despite the physical distance. I say conversation lightly because exchanging instant messages is a watered-down conversation. I learned some time ago to steer clear of serious topics on instant messenger. But it's fabulous for the small talk of catching up.  Jaclyn and I went for a walk tonight around campus. It was beautiful out. Cool enough to wear long sleeves and pants and not sweat. My kind of walking. This afternoon when I was home for lunch I was appreciating our shaded yard. There are trees that provide enough shade to cool the house inside, especially on a breezy day with the ceiling fan in the living room. Despite the name of our street, they aren't sycamores.

      Today I interviewed a minister who is leaving a church in Murray to go work at a church in Shelbyville, Indiana, the town in which he grew up. He said several neat things, but I've been thinking about something he said about change. First, he said it was an easy decision to return home, where some of his family still lives. Then he followed that with how hard it would be to leave his new home. And, still, he thinks change is stimulating for everyone it affects. Anyway, it just makes me feel good to know other people experience a mixed emotion to change. Sometimes it is easy. Sometimes it is hard. And sometimes it is a little of both at the same time.

      getting up at 5:45 a.m. hasn't been as awful as i thought it would be. i really can't believe i'm admitting that, but it's true. i like getting finished with work about 4. and even though i have been going to bed about 10 p.m., i feel like my days are longer.   yesterday i interviewed gov. patton when he was in town. today i met ernie fletcher and interviewed him. and i hope he will be the next governor.   i think it is silly people who buy things with money they have, rather than using credit cards, are essentially penalized when trying to establish a new cell phone service. i think having limited credit as a 24-year-old should be considered good credit. it's when someone has bad credit the company should worry.

      i got a job! starting monday, i'll be a reporter at the murray ledger & times. while it's a small-town paper and i'll cover many different things, my focus will be murray state university and city government. i like those things.   we spent most of yesterday afternoon out on kentucky lake in a pontoon boat. it was so great. the rain held off and the sun came out. and my skin is burnt. oh well, it may be the last time it feels like summer to me.

      Derek Abney is my favorite. I've been waiting all football season for him to return a punt for a touchdown, and he did today. He caught a pass for a touchdown later. My other favorite Wildcat, Arliss Beach, scored twice, too. During the first half, I told Greg is was frustrating being a UK football fan, then I changed my mind during the second half. UK 42, Miss. State 17.   We're dog-sitting Bailey this weekend. She's fun to have around, but she took up too much space in the bed last night.   I met Ben Chandler yesterday. He didn't really impress me, but he was less annoying than I expected. Regardless, I still like Ernie Fletcher.

      Busy, busy weekend.  We went to eat with some new friends Friday evening. Noah and Denette had us over to their apartment for corn and chicken chowder and cheesecake. It was good food. And we played euchre with some new friends. Then later that night I had to go back to work to finish up Saturday's paper and send it to press.   Saturday morning Jaclyn and I went to several yard sales. I found a few deals. Then my mom and dad came to visit. We ate lunch, then my mom and I went to Paducah, shopping for curtains. Yes, after living here two months, I have curtains to put up. Dad and Greg watched football while we were doing that. That evening Greg and I went to his parents' house for chicken and dumplins. Yummy. It was sort of celebration dinner for Greg passing the bar.   Yesterday we went to the Titans game in Nashville, then stopped to eat in Clarksville. Conveniently, we stopped about the same time Cassie was finishing up her soccer game, so Mom and Cassie got to eat with us. My dad had already left to go back to Indianapolis, where he is doing a lot of consulting work.   Austin Peay has improved to four wins, two of which came this weekend. I'm looking forward to watching Cassie play against Murray State in two weeks. Go Peay!  So, now after not much rest this weekend, I'm back in the swing of work. Although, I did go to bed at 9 last night. It was a fun weekend, though, so I don't mind sacrificing some sleep.

      Yes, I've neglected my blog. Nothing too exciting has been happening, though. I've noticed I'm a nerd. I enjoy covering city council and meeting the politicans who come to town.  My parents are coming to visit me Saturday. They are bringing Bailey, the dog, too. What a spoiled animal she is. Hopefully my mom and I can put some blinds or curtains up while she's here so the Greg can stop being paranoid that the neighbors can see him walking around in his towel. (OK, more information than you need, I know.)  I'll probably sacarifice some sleep tomorrow morning to go to some yard sales with Jaclyn. And tomorrow night we're having dinner with Greg's family sort of as a celebration dinner for him passing the bar. It's interesting how we celebrate with food so often. (We went to Outback to celebrate with Jaclyn and Bryan last Friday when we found out Greg passed.)  How about those Wildcats? The bursts of playing well won't get them anywhere, which is why they aren't winning. I'd love to see them fired up through a whole game and not just select minutes. It's frustrating to watch a team you like lose, but I can't imagine being a player on one of those teams. Losing like Kentucky loses would definitely get old.

      Let me tell you one reason I love living in Murray: Yesterday on my hour-long lunch break I picked up a few things at the grocery store, ate lunch with Greg at home, washed a sink full of dishes, deposited some checks at the bank and mailed a letter. That's fabulous. Sometimes I'm a bum during my lunch break, but sometimes it's nice to be able to be productive like that. Ah, the convenience.  We were in Louisville over the weekend for Bekah and Barrett's wedding. It was great to see them, Katie, Shelley and Dustin. And baby Evan Sapp is adorable. I got to hang out with Laine while she cut my hair. She looks good with her cute pregnant belly. I went shopping at Kohl's and got to hang out with my mom too. The only bad part of the weekend was having a sore throat and congested head.

      I sure miss Louisville and my parents' house. Sometimes I don't realize it when I'm not here. But I'm here now, and happy about it. Greg and I got here yesterday evening, and went to Damon's to watch the UK basketball game. Cassie and Kelly went with us. It was great to see Kelly and play catch-up. I love waking up here, reading The Courier-Journal and curling up in the big, comfy chair in the living room.   Thanksgiving was good. We spent the day at Greg's parents' house. While it was slightly odd because it was the first time I had spent Thanksgiving away from my family, I enjoyed myself. I played Rook with Greg's mom, aunt and grandma and ate fabulous potatoes and apple pie, among other things.

      These quotes totally sum up how I feel today:  "Today, I feel weak and vulnerable, unable to sustain even one minute of  mindfulness of prayer, the Scriptures are opaque and Jesus is hidden from consciousness. Yet, by the grace of God, I have an unwavering, unshaken trust that this is where I am supposed to be. God's love for me and the certainty in faith that He finds me lovable is independent of any good I may have done or any good I have neglected to do. Nothing is happening on a feeling level. I am much at peace with where I am and not questioning if I am doing something wrong and not panting for a felt sense of His presence." -- Brennan Manning  "... my self-imposed pressure leaves little time to simply live, for being human and playful, for delighting in pecan waffles and Scrabble. Is my life slipping by without  making time to be a friend with my friends?" -- Brennan Manning  (And, for what it is worth, I love waffles -- no peacans though -- and Scrabble. Those details, and the fact this man is a living testimony of grace, make Brennan Manning my hero. OK, and Greg and I did play Scrabble last night. And I beat him. But that was procrastinating, as is this, and I need to get busy.)

      Today was the last home Murray State football game. Thank God. I covered the six home games for the AP, and they were long, drawn out experiences each time. I'm really ready to move on to basketball, especially because I get to watch it as a fan and not worry with writing about it.   I had an M&M McFlurry from McDonald's tonight. It was totally not as satisfying as an M&M Blizzard from Dairy Queen. But for those of you who aren't familiar with Murray's DQ, it is only open from April 1 to Oct. 31. It's one of those where you walk up to the window, not a sit-down place. Small town and quaint, but not so convenient when I crave a Blizzard in November.   I'm so ready to go Christmas shopping. I've bought two presents, but I'm making myself wait until I finish this freelance project, which I should have worked on today but I totally neglected. Oh, well, I'll accomplish some tomorrow after Angela's baby shower.   Alright, bed time.

      Life is often full of contradictions. I want to be spontaneous. Yet I a planner and focus on details. I love road trips, but would rather someone else drive. I wish I could wear flip flops all year around, but I love socks. I like my feet to be rubbed. But my feet are ticklish. Summer is my favorite season, but I love snuggling up in blankets. I like to be in control. I like to follow the leader. I like attention. I hate to be the center of attention. I couldn't wait to move out of my parents' house. Now I can't wait to visit. I avoid drama. But I am emotionally high maintenance. I avoid conflict. But I want to talk about everything. I love to eat. I don't really know much about cooking. I miss living in Louisville and Lexington. I find peace in the convenience of Murray. CSI is my favorite show. I get nervous in the dark by myself. I like my house clean and organized. I can't remember the last time I washed my car.  Change makes me hesitant. Routines make me antsy. Yellow is my favorite color. I wear a lot of blue and black. I love listening to music. I can't sing a lick. Christmas is my favorite holiday. I don't like snow. I want to live at the lake. I don't fish. I think e-mail is fabulous. I love writing and receiving "real" letters. The Internet is an endless resource. But I'd rather read newspapers and magazines. I rarely drink milk. I love eating cereal. I love hugs. I have to sleep on my own side of the bed.  Friends are suppose to be forever. I haven't talked to Cara since January. I love to laugh. I'm not afraid to cry. I like to talk. I like to ask questions and listen. I'm a writer. I hate to speak in front of people. I was a shy kid. I call and talk to strangers on a daily basis at work. I am task-oriented. I am good at procrastinating.  I am a University of Kentucky basketball fan. I like Rick Pitino and Mike Davis. I love college basketball. Dick Vitale is annoying. Life is full of contradictions. Life can be whatever I want it to be.

      This is funny:  Dear Abby,  My boyfriend is not happy with my mood swings. The  other day, he bought me a mood ring so he would be able to monitor my moods.  When I'm in a good mood it turns green. When I'm in a bad mood it leaves a big red mark on his forehead. Maybe next time he'll buy me a diamond.  Sincerely, Bitchy in Boston

      This weekend was fabulous. A quick run-down for you, so you too feel included in my life:   FRIDAY we ate dinner at Greg's parents' house, which was delicious as always. Then we came home and played euchre with our friends Noah and Danette. I say friends, and they are, but we are just getting to know them. SATURDAY I wanted to sleep in, but woke up at 7:30 a.m., as I have already mentioned. That afternoon we had an open house for Greg at his law office. Lots of people came by. I wasn't sure what to expect. The highlight was Rod and Corbitt -- some of our friends from Lexington -- surprised and came to the open house. His parents live in Kuttawa, so they made a weekend out of it. So, after the open house we ate at Cracker Barrel with them. It was so good to catch up with them. Then we left Murray about 8:30 p.m. for Louisville. We got to Louisville after 1 a.m. that time and went to bed. SUNDAY I went to a baby shower for Laine. It was alright, but I really enjoyed seeing my mom and Cassie. I also went shopping at Kohl's and found my new favorite pants and long-sleeved T-shirt. We got back to Murray about 9:30 last night -- that's 25 hours after we left.   The trip was much too quick and I wanted to stay at my parents' house longer. Good thing we're going back in two weeks for Thanksgiving. I'm not a baby, I just appreciate my family more now that I don't live there. Oh, and my mom cooked me some of her fabulous chili to bring back. We ate it for dinner tonight. Yummy.   OK, more than you want to know about my life. I know.  Kevin and Laine are really naming their baby girl Milla. (That's ME-LA.) It's Hawaiian for "loved by all," or something like that. Her middle name is going to be Eve. Milla Eve Hill. I guess it will grow on me. Anglea and Charles are naming their baby boy Elijah William Taylor, which is so much more traditional. Those names in themselves define the differences between my family and Greg's. Oh, well, what kind of world would this be if we were all the same?  Alright, I'm totally procrastinating. I have this huge freelance project about Paducah due at the end of the month. I still have a ton to write, and yet I sit here playing on the Internet and writing in my journal. OK, I better get a few more paragraphs finished. CSI: Miami comes on in 15 minutes.

      While waking up at 7:30 a.m. is considered sleeping in compared to my normal weekday alarm of 5:45 a.m., it's still entirely too early to get up on the weekends. OK, so I went to sleep at 10:30 p.m., but I should still get to sleep in later.

      Journalists are destined to have carpal tunnel syndrome and poor eye sight. Computers are efficient, but sometimes it gets old looking at the screen. I'm probably only saying that because not only have I been writing and reporting at work, but I've been working on a freelance project for Turner Publishing in Paducah. I'm suppose to have 100 pages about Paducah's commerce and such finished by the end of the month. I've written 32 pages, I think. I guess that's progress, but I wished I had more finished. It's harder than my real job because I don't have as much time to work on it, especially calling people. Some of these people I'm suppose to talk to are next-to-impossible to in touch with.   I like lists. So, here's a list of some things I've been thinking about:  --Change is inevitable. --Friends are meant to be forever, but sometimes we, as humans, let circumstances dictate otherwise. --God is bigger and mightier than any detail in my life.  --Perfection is impossible, yet I keep trying. --Sometimes emotions seep in where they don't belong.  --Words mean more than people sometimes mean for them to mean. But, still, actions speak louder.

      "Ed" is a funny show. My mom tells me Ed's character reminds her of Greg. I think that's an alright observation. The even funnier part is the other night our friend Laura told Greg that Ed reminded her of him. I think it's the silliness and the ability to enjoy the simple things in life. And, well, of course, the fact he's a lawyer. How cool would it be if Greg had his law office in a bowling alley? That would be fun. But I bet he wouldn't get much work done.   Today I covered a meeting in the Curris Center. The meeting itself was incredibly boring, but I like going to the Curris Center -- that's the student center at Murray State -- because brings back good memories. Lots of good conversations with Greg and other college friends. Fun lunches in the cafeteria there. Yet at the same time, I am so glad they are memories and that I'm not in college anymore. Plus I can buy my favorite jelly beans there.   On a random note, I am so ready for UK basketball season to really get started.

      I just re-read a lot of my online journal, which I started in August 2001. It's crazy all that has changed since then, and it's funny how much I talk about change. There are these lessons I know I'm suppose to learn, but have to be taught over and over again, and accepting change is definitely one of the them. The biggest thing for me right now is that I open myself up to change, specifically not being so anal about everything. There are times I should strive for perfection, but there are many more times I should be blessed by change and all it involves, including relaxing and take life as it comes. God is mightier than anything I know or do. I really need to rest in the fact life is life and I am not in control.   On that note, it's sad to me how caught up people get in work and routine, not leaving much time for people. I talk about how I only have two friends. But in this disappointing sense it is true. I have friends all over the country, but it seems more often than not we make excuses about not calling or slacking with the emails.   OK, I haven't commented on here about the election. Go Republicans! I say that like it is a ball game. But Ernie Fletcher is Kentucky's next governor, and the first Republican to do so in 32 years. That's a long time of one party at the top. But I did vote for two Democrats, the first time I haven't voted a straight-party ticket. Whatever that is worth.

      I really thought UK would win. Even in the sixth overtime when the Wildcats scored first, I thought they would win. What a game, though. Too bad Arkansas won in seven overtimes.   Grocery shopping isn't my favorite chore. But I went to Kroger a little after 1 a.m. after I finished putting the paper out Friday night, well, uh, Saturday morning. It was a great time to grocery shop. All the workers stocking the shelves wanted to chat. I was the only person shopping then. The only downfall was having to put the groceries away when I got home about 1:30 a.m.

      I survived my first Christmas NOT at my parents' house. It was strange, but I had a good time with the Taylors on Christmas Eve and Day. Then we spent the weekend at my parents' house. AND I get to go again Wednesday and Thursday.   My dad, a hardcore UK fan, said Rick Pitino is the best college basketball coach ever. I'm not sure about that, but he did or said something right yesterday. And the Wildcats helped by playing lazy and missing shots.

      The randomness that is my life: --Greg and I have been to five Christmas dinners or parties in that past 10 days and we have at least three to go. The most random was the Murray Fire Department dinner. I was invited because I cover the department as part of my city beat at work. Last night was the big Taylor Christmas party. There were about 40 people there. I could tell it was a Taylor function when we pulled up in the driveway because there were lots of Chevy vehicles -- especially Suburbans -- all backed in. For those of you who don't know, Greg's great-uncle is a Chevy dealer and all Taylor men back in parking places.  --Jaclyn and I went to see "Mona Lisa Smile" yesterday afternoon. It wasn't as good as I was hoping, but a cute, fairly predictable moving. Greg and I watched "Something's Got to Give" earlier in the week, and it was funny. Jack Nicholason's character was great, actually all four man characters were.  --I finished Christmas shopping today, unless I find Greg another stocking stuffer or two. --Kentucky had an impressive win over Indiana yesterday. --The Titans pulled out a win today. --Every day I realize I act more and more like my mother. Speaking of mom, I am really looking forward to going to visit my family next weekend. Then we'll come back so I can work for a few days and go back to Oldham County for New Year's Eve and Day. And we're going to the Austin Peay-Kentucky game in Louisville on Dec. 31.

      The Supreme Court ruled there cannot be a nativity scene in Washington, D.C., this Christmas.   This isn't for any religious or constitutional reason, they simply have not been able to find three wise men and a virgin in the nation capitol. There was no problem however finding enough asses to fill the stable.

      I've had a good weekend and really wish it would last another day or two. FRIDAY night we hung out at Greg's parents' house and ate some fabulous potato soup. That's after I spent the majority of my work day covering the Murray State Board of Regents meeting. SATURDAY I slept in a little but not near as long as I would have liked then was productive wrapping Christmas presents and folding laundry before we watched the UK game. Um, a win is a win, but two points is cutting it close, especially after being up 23-6 early in the first half. Last night we went to southern Illinois to the Madrigal dinner, which included a play, at Shawnee Community College. My friend Sarah has written the scripts for the plays the last several years, so Greg and I went up there with Jaclyn and Bryan. We got to see Sarah and Kelly too, which was good. We went to the Madrigal dinner several times in college, so it was fun to do it again this year after not having been there for a few years. After dinner and the play, we all hung out at Sarah's parents' house, playing the name good. Good times. TODAY we went to Nashville for the Titans game. We had a good time and the weather was fabulous. Too bad the Titans lost by two. Too bad Justin McCareins fumbled the punt return with 50 seconds left after the Titans came close to having a come-from-behind victory. I know, close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, and definitely not in football. Oh, and Murray State beat Western in double overtime in Bowling Green. That would have been a fun game to watch.

      "Love Actually" was clever, sad and funny -- all at the same time. It's theme -- love actually is all around -- is so true. The movie showed new relationships and old love. It was about passionate love that makes people do things they otherwise wouldn't do and about loyal love, despite the circumstances. It was about love being born and love dying. I loved all the different stories going on at the same time and how they all were loosely connected, just like in life. It was a little weird to have Hugh Grant as the prime minister of Britain, but he's funny and his character was fun to watch.   I put the Christmas tree up last night and wrapped some presents. I was successful Christmas shopping in Louisville this weekend, but still have some to go. I love this time of the year, especially if the snow holds off. As much as I like flip flops and tank tops, I like sweaters, wool socks and corduroy pants, too.

      It's amazing how one moment can change your life.  Wednesday afternoon I found out I have diabetes.   I was at the doctor's office sort of for a check up when I found out. Then the doctor said she wanted to admit me to the hospital because my blood sugar level was outrageously high and my body was dehydrated. Basically, I was losing weight but ate a lot because I was hungry a lot and drank a lot because I was thirsty a lot. Turns out, my pancreas doesn't produce insulin and my body was burning fat because it couldn't properly break down sugar.   I was scared, but ended up going. I was there until this afternoon, but realize it was for the best. I learned a lot about Type 1 diabetes and how I am going to have to be disciplined about how I eat and what I eat. I have to give myself insulin shots and check my blood sugar several times a day. And that seems like the easy part. I also have to balance the number of carbohydrates I eat at each meal. I know it will get easier, but it's sort of information overload at the moment. I know enough to life safely right now, but I'm going to take a two-day class in a couple of weeks so I can start learning more about this disease.  The whole situation has made me think about a lot, and I had plenty of time to think in the hospital. First, we're complex beings. There's a lot going on inside of us, more than I will ever understand. Also, Greg and I had been talking recently about how we needed to eat better and learn about nutrition. Well, I guess I don't have much of a choice about that now. I probably can use a lesson in discipline, too. Unexpected situations, like being in the hospital, sure show who steps up to help. My mom came down for the day on Thursday, which really comforted me. The rest of my family called to check on me. Greg's family was so supportive and came to keep me company several times. Greg slept on an uncomfortable pull-out-chair-bed for me and brought me newspapers, ice water and anything else I wanted. Jaclyn brought me beautiful tulips and visited a couple of times. Michael came to visit a couple of times and listened to me freak out about the whole thing. Work sent flowers. Erin and Jodi sent flowers and Jodi called to check on me. The new church we've been going to sent flowers and the pastor stopped by. I felt loved, which was something I needed to get me past the emotional first stage of dealing with this.   Maybe the best part of the whole thing: When I called Greg Wednesday afternoon just a few minutes after I found I have diabetes, crying, of course, he said, "It's OK, we'll change our lifestyle." He said, "we," and I was reminded I'm married to my best friend who is willing to live life with me, despite circumstances that may alter the course we thought we were on.

      Sometimes I wish Murray wasn't so far from Cincinnati, Louisville and Lexington, and even Boston, Mass. I miss my friends way too much. Sometimes I live my life in Murray with complete peace, and at other moments my heart is an emotional jumble because I want to be with the people who know be better than most everyone else. Usually those missing-my-friends-and-family moments are passing and prompt me to send an email, write a letter or make a phone call. But every now and then they build up, and emotions overflow, disrupting every clear thought I have.

      So Milla is the cutest baby ever. She has beautiful skin, long fingers and toes, pretty blue eyes and the most precious lips and nose. She likes to touch her face a lot and kept sleeping with her hands near her eyes. Kevin is adorable with her; she's going to be a daddy's girl for sure. I hate that I don't get to see her for three weeks.   I got to see Cara and her Mexico pictures yesterday while we ate lunch at Panera Bread. I also talked to KatieKerns on the phone on the way back to Murray. Both were much-needed conversations to sort of refresh me. I was in a blah mood last week and needed a boost to my spirit. My friends and new niece sure did the trick.   Here are some good quotes Lori forwarded me today: "If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you." -- Winnie the Pooh  "Don't walk in front of me, I may not follow. Don't walk behind me, I may not lead.. Walk beside me and be my friend." -- Albert Camus  "Strangers are just friends waiting to happen." -- Anonymous  "I'll lean on you and you lean on me and we'll be okay." -- Dave Matthews  "We all take different paths in life, but no matter where we go, we take a little of each other everywhere." -- Tim McGraw  Another e-mail forward:  THINGS THAT IT TOOK ME OVER 48 YEARS TO LEARN        by Dave Barry  If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be "meetings."  You should not confuse your career with your life.   Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.   Never lick a steak knife.   The most destructive force in the universe is gossip.  You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling reason why we observe daylight savings time.   You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her at that moment.  The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we ALL believe that we are above average drivers.   A person, who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice person. (This is very important. Pay attention. It never fails.)   Your friends love you anyway.   Never be afraid to try something new. Remember that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built the Titanic.   Men are like a fine wine. They start out as grapes, and it's up to women to stomp the crap out of them until they turn into something acceptable to have dinner with.

      I'm an aunt again. That's twice in four days. Kevin and Laine had their baby girl this afternoon. Milla Eve Hill weighed 8 pounds 1 ounce and was 21 1/2 inches long. (Now, for those of you who don't know, the name is pronounced ME-LA.) My mom said she's beautiful. Kevin said she's cute. I can't wait to go see her this weekend.

      I'm in a time warp, not really sure what day or time it is. That's what the holidays have done to me. Seriously, though, working a full week is going to be strange after the last two weeks and all the driving we've done.   I'm an aunt. Angela and Charles (Greg's brother and sister-in-law) had their baby boy at 10:21 p.m. yesterday. Elijah William Taylor weighed 7 pounds 1 ounce and was 20 inches long. It's the first grandbaby in the family, so I'm sure you can imagine all the hype and celebration. I think Greg's parents took two rolls of film last night.   Speaking of yesterday, we left Murray at 8 a.m. to go to Louisville to watch Murray State get its butt kicked by UofL. The first half ended with the Racers up two points, but Murray State couldn't stay with Louisville in the second half. My mom came to the game with us, too. Then we watched the Titans game, which started out really slow and boring but turned out to be exciting. We headed back to Murray and got to the hospital five minutes after the baby was born.  Now if Laine will just have her baby girl.  I love those sugary conversation heart Valentine's Day candies. Yes, it's only the beginning of January, but I already bought some. They sure are tasty.  Back tracking, New Year's Eve was fun. My family -- Mom, Dad, Kevin, Laine, Cassie, Greg and I -- went to the UK-Austin Peay game in Louisville. The Governors almost pulled out a win over a sluggish Kentucky team. The crowd was pitiful -- only 11,000 fans in an arena that seats 18,000. After the game, Greg and I played games with my mom and Kevin and Laine. It was low-key but fun. New Year's Day I got to see my Aunt Carolyn and Uncle Jerry. I hadn't seen them since July or so. We ate chili and played games. We also watched "Calendar Girls" with my mom. Cute movie.  Cassie gave me Hoopla for Christmas. It's by the makers of Cranium and has some of the same activities involved. It's a game against the clock, though, and not the other players. We played it several times with my family and then again with friends in Murray Friday night.  OK, it's time to take the Christmas decorations down.

      I got Rochelle Riley's new book in the mail yesterday. It's a book of her columns, with topics ranging from parenthood to Sept. 11, 2001 and how that day changed America. I'm looking forward to reading it. She inspires me.   Here's a quote from her introduction about why she writes: "Written conversations can be more powerful than the cantakerous bluster that sometimes passes for dialogue these days." (See, I'm not passed the introduction and already quoting her.)  Maybe that's why things make more sense to me on paper -- in my own words and the words of others -- than anything I try to say, often stumbling over my own thoughts. One time Greg's counsin Quinnen (I think he's 8...) walked into a room, where multiple conversations were taking place, and said, "Stop. This is a communication wreck." He's right. Too often conversations collide. Sometimes it might be healthier and clearer for everyone to pick up a pen and string together their thoughts.

      A note on "The Passion of the Christ," which I haven't seen yet:  urlLink Rochelle Riley  is my favorite journalist. She used to be a columnist for The Courier-Journal, but now she writes for The Detroit Free Press. Anyway, she's not letting her 14-year-old daughter see the movie because of the violence. And that's OK. Here's part of what she had to say:  "Faith is the evidence of things unseen. That will remain true for us with the crucifixion."  I'm going to see it, especially now that I've written two stories about it. One was before Ash Wednesday about churches renting theaters to see it and the other was this morning about what people thought of the movie yesterday.

      alright,  the randomness that is my life...  This is HILARIOUS: Do you want to know what our economists do all day? Click on this  urlLink Web site  and move the cursor over the image.  This also makes me laugh: Here's a conversation between George W. Bush and his daughter... A father watched his daughter playing in the garden. He smiled as he reflected on how sweet and innocent his little girl was. Suddenly she just stopped and stared at the ground. He went over to her and noticed she was looking at two spiders mating.  "Daddy, what are those two spiders doing?" she asked.  "They're mating," her father replied.  "What do you call the spider on top, Daddy?" she asked.  "That's a Daddy Longlegs, " Her father answered.  A pause! "So, the other one is Mommy Longlegs?" the little girl asked.  "No," her father replied. "Both of them are Daddy Longlegs."  The little girl thought for a moment, then took her foot and stomped them flat."Well, that might be OK in California and New York, but we're not having any of that stuff in Texas!"  Other random notes: When Greg and I were in Louisville this weekend we saw Gerald Fitch in the mall. He was walking with a cute, little boy and another guy. I really wanted to talk to him, but I'm a star-struck chicken. Oh well.   I went to my second-ever NBA game last night. We went to Memphis to watch the Golden State Warriors beat the Grizzlies. (Are there really bears in Tennessee? They should change the mascot, really.) It was fun.

      Definitely time for an update.  First of all I must tell you about the most fabulous steakhouse I've ever eaten at:  urlLink The Palm . It was at the Hilton Suites in Nashville, but got started in New York. It was the nicest, most expensive restaurant at which I've ever eaten, but thankfully the Calloway County Bar Association was paying for it. You've got to love lawyers at some point. My 10-ounce filet mignon was $31. Just the steak. I had a salad with onions, tomatoes, shrimp, bacon green beans and a vinagrette dressing that cost $9. It was a crazy salad without lettuce, but it was so good. Then I had bread and we shared vegetables -- hash browns and fried asparagus -- at the table. It was SO good and a neat experience. There were 22 of us -- 11 lawyers and their spouses -- and the bill was $2,100. Plus the bar association paid for us to stay at the Hilton Suites that night. Fun times.   On another related note, that meal was the first time I ate out without knowing the amount of carbohydrates in each food since I was diagnosed with diabetes. I did really well and didn't make my blood sugar level rise too much. However, I've eat out three times in the last two days and really not done well at the guessing game that is sometimes counting carbs. My mom was with me and reminded me it's a learning experience right now. But you know how I strive for perfection. Dang anal retentiveness.  Speaking of my mom. She was here for the last couple of days to go to a diabetes self-management class at the hospital. It was pretty good. Some of it didn't apply to me and my Type 1 diabetes, but I learned some useful stuff about food and insulin. And I was definitely glad my mom was here. She brought Bailey the dog, too, who bonded with Greg. He took her out to pee most of the time and took her on a walk and jog. Therefore, she slept closer to him at night, which was fine with me because it let me sleep through the night.   On another family-related note (you've got to love these transitions), I saw Cassie on Saturday when Greg and I stopped to eat lunch with her in Clarksville on our way to Nashville. She even showed us the toe on which she recently had surgery in the middle of the restaurant. Yeah, I'm sure the other people enjoyed seeing her take her shoe off. Anyway, then we -- Greg, my mom and I -- went to eat with her last night. This coming Saturday Greg, his mom and I are going to Clarksville again for the Murray State-Austin Peay basketball game. It's a big game in the Ohio Valley Conference. APSU is undefeated in the conference and Murray has only lost once. So, I'll probably get to see Cassie again. Good times with the family.

      Something about afternoon naps is so much better than nighttime sleep. It's a dreary day here and I just woke up from a two-hour nap. It was lovely. And I'd probably still be sleeping but I was afraid I'd miss my meeting.

      What happened to my flip-flop weather?   And what happened to the Republican governor I voted for? I mean, he's there in Frankfort, running state government. But bribery isn't the way to the people's hearts. And that's pretty much what Gov. Fletcher and the Senate Republicans did to the Democrats in an attempt to ge their budget proposal passed with the tax planned somehow attached. Today the state senator from Murray told me it was the most partian budget process he's ever been a part of.   This is a bit delayed, but it's something I've been thinking about... Somtimes I feel like two people. I don't mean like I have multiple personalities. More like multiple perceptions of myself. I never really thought about it until Sunday in church, though. Or at least I couldn't define it in my mind until then. So, God offers grace to anyone to cover our human imperfections. Alright, I believe that. I believe God makes us new. I can be transformed. Rather, I am being transformed. It doesn't happen overnight. It's a life-long process. Grace redeems me, and you, making us saints who sometimes sin. Trust me, I strive for perfection and often get caught up in my human desires to control the details in my life. You'd think I learn I don't have control. God is mightier than any drama I create for myself or any detail I try to tend to. OK, a saint who sins. I can deal with that. That's how God sees me -- on my good days and the bad ones, during my selfish moments and my sweet ones, when I complain and when I love. Still, sometimes that's not how I feel. Other times I dwell on the fact I can't reach perfection. I can't meet these lofty expectations I have for myself. And the thing is, nobody truly meets my expectations. The people I love come close, but, then again, I expect them to. We're all human. And as humans we're a bundle of contradictions. We want people to like us, but we are easily annoyed by others' faults. We want to love each other unconditionally, but we still make assumptions and argue. We plan and organize and look so far ahead in the future, but we forget to live for the moment. Sometimes I get my identity as a saint who sometimes falters confused with a sinner who sometimes does the right thing. I mean, I'm going to fail sometimes so why strive for perfection. Anybody who even half-heartedly knows me knows there are very few moments when I accept less than perfect so easily. I want to please people, especially the people important to me. I want to everything I do well and expect other people to do so too. I like loyalty and commitment. Wishy-washy people frustrate me. (These people would also be milkshakes -- inconsistent and confused about whether it's milk or ice cream or something in between.) I want the real thing in the good moments when I laugh so hard I cry and in the crappy minutes when I tear up and want to cuddle up with my best friend.

      Diabetes is a mystery, which is frustrating. It's especially annoying when my blood sugar is so high and I have absolutely no idea why. So, this is how I'm feeling this morning.   And then I went to the  urlLink American Diabetes Association  Web site and read this:  Realize that "he who laughs. Lasts." Yes, diabetes is hard work and frustrating at times. There are situations and events that just cannot be explained or resolved. In tough times, humor can be the great healer.

      I love this weather, even though it's making our house a bit warm. I wore flip flops today and walked outside barefoot.   We went to see "The Ladykillers" this afternoon. It was funnier than I expected. Tom Hanks did a good job. Very entertaining.   I'm glad we don't have any pets of our own, but it's nice having Bailey around. She took a nap with me this morning. (When you wake up at 7 a.m. on a weekend, it's OK to take a nap at 10:30 or so.) She wants to be involved in everything, but it's cute most of the time. The exception would be when I was working on a puzzle and she walked through it. Maybe I shouldn't be working a puzzle on the floor, but I was. Speaking of the puzzle, I bought it for 50 cents this morning at a yard sale. And the money went to Relay for Life. It's called "Yellow," creatively named because everything in the puzzle is yellow. There are smiley faces, toys, crayons, lemons, yarn, Juicy Fruit and Chiclet gum packages...a very little that isn't yellow.   KatieKerns called me today. I write her name like that because it's fun to say quick, letting it all run together. Anyway, I sure miss her. Hopefully she and Brad are going to move from Boston to Nashville next year. That would be so great.   Greg's sitting on the back porch playing his guitar. It's nice to listen to. It's a summertime thing he always does.   That's all my babble for now.

      The bank temperature sign said it was 83 degrees today. Fabulous.   I bought two new pairs of capri pants last weekend at Old Navy. Then my mom gave me two more pairs that she doesn't wear anymore. Yes, that's four pairs of capri pants for the girl who used the complete oppose them. I used to think they were silly -- I mean, choose pants or shorts. But because I can't wear shorts to work, I'll settle for capris. The two pairs I got at Old Navy are comfy. The ones I'm wearing today from my mom are fine. So, I've accepted the fact I own multiple pairs of these trendy pants, but what gets me is that several women at work today are also wearing them. Hence the word trendy, I suppose.

      Name almost any social or political issue and I can give you an opinion about it.  Gay marriage. I think God intended marriage to be between a man and woman. Period.  Gun control. I think there should be stricter regulations so that not just anybody can get a gun.  Drugs. I think the problem goes beyond illegal use of sometimes helpful things. I think a poor economy and lack of education leads to drug problems. Sometimes drugs are sold, sadly, as an alternate income. Sometimes government tries too hard on prosecution of drug users and sellers and does do enough for prevention and education. I think Kentucky's drug court is the right approach and maybe others will catch on.   Abortion. I think life begins at conception and aborting a baby is depriving a life. Now, I know there are specific cases, such as rape and the mother's life being endangered, that might be exceptions.  Health care. I know sometimes needs to be done to get more insurance companies in this state. Electronic medical records seem to be one approach to reducing errors in medical facilities.   Education. I know education is the key to so many other things, including the economy and curbing drug use and other criminal activity. And I know education is deprived in many state budgets. Kids need to read and know how to apply other academic principles. But they also need to learn we need each other.   Economy. I believe the economy is a reflection of many other things and when it is failing there are more problems than a tight budget.   OK, so these aren't all necessarily deep opinions. But I can come up with something. There's one issue that continues to stump me: the death penalty.   "Dead Man Walking" showed me as much as I want to see of a lethal injection. I believe people change. Who are we to take their second chance away? But maybe it's somebody's third chance, and where do we stop? Grace is bigger than anyone, larger than any governor or government. Are we playing God to think we can kill someone for committing a sin, an offense in the eyes of God and, in this case, the law? But should we pay to keep people in jail for years and years at a time, sometimes for life? Does knowing they could be executed ever stop a potential crime?   I have tons of questions about the matter, but can't seem to figure out where I stand.

      I'm working on creating a soundtrack to my life, which I think sometimes resembles a sitcom. In college my friends and I constantly talked about "Everybody's Looking for Andy," the sitcom we created in our minds. We have had a little jingle made up for the theme song. The show would have been random, because that was the story of our lives, but every episode would have a cameo by Andy, our friend with crazy, curly hair. Sometimes he'd be easy to spot, other times it would be more like "Where's Waldo?"  So, I've thought about the soundtrack to my life before, but I've never made a list and pulled some lyrics, so here's my start, and these are in no particular order:  "Drops of Jupiter," Train  Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star One without a permanent scar And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there   "Crush," Dave Matthews Band  It's crazy I'm thinking Just as long as you're around And here I'll be dancing on the ground Am I right side up or upside down To each other we'll be facing By love we'll beat back the pain we've found You know I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking deep inside My friend With each moment the more I love you Crush me   "Wood Song," Indigo Girls  ... no way construction of this tricky plan was built by other than a greater hand with a love that passes all our understanding watching closely over the journey yeah but what it takes to cross the great divide seems more than all the courage i can muster up inside but we get to have some answers when we reach the other side the prize is always worth the rocky ride but the wood is tired and the wood is old and we'll make it fine if the weather holds but if the weather holds then we'll have missed the point that's where i need to go ...   "Pantala Naga Pampa," Dave Matthews Band  Come and relax now Put your troubles down No need to bear the weight of your worries Just let them all fall away.   "Mystery," Indigo Girls  ...you set up your place in my thoughts moved in and made my thinking crowded ... i could go crazy on a night like tonight when summer's beginning to give up her fight and every thought's a possibility and voices are heard but nothing is seen why do you spend this time with me maybe an equal mystery so what is love then is it dictated or chosen does it sing like the hymns of 1000 years or is it just pop emotion and if it ever was here and it left does it mean it was never true and to exist it must elude is that why i think these things of you ...   "Perfect," Sara Evans  Love can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams   "My List," Toby Keith  ...Go for a walk, say a little prayer  Take a deep breath of mountain air  Put on my glove and play some catch  It's time that I make time for that  Wade the shore and cast a line  Pick up a long lost friend of mine  Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss  Start livin' that' the next thing on my list   Wouldn't change the course of fate but cuttin' the grass just had to wait  'Cause I've bot more important things like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing  I won't break my back for a million bucks I can't take to my grave  So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today   ... Raise a little hell, laugh 'til it hurts  Put an extra five in the plate at church  Call up my folks just to chat  It's time that I make time for that  Stay up late, then oversleep  Show her what she means to me  Catch up on all the things I've always missed  Just start livin', that's the next thing on my list ...   "Mrs. Potter's Lullaby," Counting Crows  If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts.   "Omaha," Counting Crows  Somewhere in middle America Get right to the heart of matters It's the heart that matters more   "Clarity," John Mayer  By the time I recognize this moment This moment it will be gone But I will bend the light pretending That it somehow lingered on   "Why Georgia," John Mayer  so what so i've got a smile on it's hiding the quite superstitions in my head don't believe me don't you dare believe me when i say i've got it down  everybody's just a stranger but that's the danger in going my own way i guees it's a price i have to pay still everything happens for a reason it's no reason not to ask yourself   "Thousand Miles," Caedmon's Call  So take my broken offering and make it whole And set my feet upon the road that leads me home Let me walk as one fixed upon the goal Even though I've got a thousand miles to go

      Here's a funny joke: A new pastor was visiting in the homes of his parishioners. At one house it seemed obvious that someone was at home, but no answer came to his repeated knocks at the door. Therefore, he took out a card and wrote "Revelation 3:20" on the back of it and stuck it in the door.   When the offering was processed the following Sunday, he found that his card had been returned. Added to it was this cryptic message, "Genesis 3:10."  Reaching for his Bible to check out the citation, he broke up in gales of laughter. Revelation 3:20 begins "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." Genesis 3:10 reads, "I heard your voice in the garden and I was afraid for I was naked."

      Alright, I haven't addressed Kentucky losing to UAB in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. And that's precisely why -- Kentucky lost to UAB, a Conference USA team, in the second round. They didn't make it to the Sweet Sixteen with a team that dominated the SEC, a much stronger, tougher conference than Conference USA. People want to pick one moment -- a turnover, a charge call, a missed shot -- on which to hang the lose. But really a basketball game shouldn't come down to one moment. UAB did more things right in the game, even though the referees were apparently in their own world calling random fouls. Kentucky lacked energy and emotion in that game and previous against Florida A&M. I think sometimes teams bring too much emotion to the court, but I think sometimes teams need something to motivate them and Kentucky lacked whatever that is for its players. I think they got sort of cocky, and came out looking past these lower-seeded teams. They didn't play defense, they didn't play their game. I don't want to blame Tubby. He obviously does something right to get teams, especially the last two year's, to gel. But he doesn't do well in the tournament. He coaches the "team to beat," but doesn't lead them farther in the tournament everyone is watching. Sure, he won a championship in 1998, technically, but did so with players Pitino recruited and trained. All of this to say, the Wildcats shouldn't have lost, but they did. Good thing it's all a game.

      "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" looks interesting. Interesting enough I want to see it.   "I wanted to deal with someone's idea of their relationship. Because you're not seeing the relationship, you're seeing Joel's idea of the relationship. I was trying to figure out what a memory feels like. I think you just assume that your memory is just sort of a video playback of your experience, but it's nothing like that at all. It's a complete refabrication of an event and a lot of it is made up, because you're filling in spaces." --Movie writer Charlie Kaufman, who wrote about the fictional company Lacuna, which means "blank space or missing part."

      I think this is the first time since I've been married that I've been at my parents' house without Greg. I miss Greg, but I've really enjoyed hanging out with my mom. It has been just the two of us this weekend. Yesterday we went to the eye doctor so I could get new contacts, went shopping at Kohl's and Old Navy so I could get some new pants, ate lunch with Poppy at Buckhead's, went to visit Kevin and Milla (She's beautiful.) and ate dinner later at Cracker Barrel. Then at 8 p.m. or so we both were tired but managed to watch some basketball. I bonded with Kali the cat this morning, even though she makes me sneeze. And Bailey thinks I'm her best friend now, and that's a good thing because she's coming home with me for two weeks.   Speaking of basketball, my bracket isn't looking too good, but that's OK because the upsets are fun to see. My brother told me yesterday he heard a sports commentator say Kentucky would be the first No. 1 seed to lose. All I have to say is thanks, Stanford. Who cares that I had the Cardinal (who uses a tree as a mascot anyway?) going to the final game against Kentucky. And you've got to love that an SEC team beat them.   Friday night one of the CBS guys said Rick Pitino was a genius of college basketball. Only a few minutes later did UofL start to blow its 14-point lead. My mom and I were talking because we thought Louisville was going to start to run away with the game, but then we looked at the TV and saw that Xavier was within a couple of points. It sure got more interesting then, because maybe Pitino isn't a genius. (OK, I know, if he were to come back to Kentucky we'd all love it in a heartbeat. We being Wildcat fans, that is.)

      I've been accused of thinking too much. And while I am trying not to analyze every word someone speaks to me, I find myself analyzing whether I analyze. It's a vicious trap, really.  So, the other thing I've been thinking about is whether I'm needy. Do I depend on people too much for attention? Earlier this week I wrote on here about a friend of mine who makes me feel suffocated at times. The key words are "at times." I enjoy her conversations and we have a lot in common, but other times I just wish she didn't require so much attention and talk about herself so much. With that said, I wonder if I'm like that to anyone. I sure hope not. Greg has told me I depend on people too much. But too much is relative, I think. He doesn't depend on people for much. Self-sufficient, if you will. I like people. I like to talk. I like to listen. I like hugs and I like to feel like people need me. That's human, though, I think. Still, where's the line of loving people and being needy? So, I've come to the conclusion that I have my needy moments like a mood swing, but the necessity for others doesn't dominate my life. With that said, I also think it's different living in Murray right now. I know lots of people, but I only confide in a few. I meet new people all of the time, but I only have a couple of friends here. And maybe I seem needy because the people I actually want to spend time with are limited. But thank God for them.

OVER 60 POINTS : Others see you as someone they should "handle with care." You're seen as vain, self-centered, and who is extremely dominant. Others may admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't always trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.  51 TO 60 POINTS : Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate.  41 TO 50 POINTS : Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out.  31 TO 40 POINTS : Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful and practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest. Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over if that trust is ever broken.  21 TO 30 POINTS : Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder. It would really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then, usually decide against it. They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature.  UNDER 21 POINTS : People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions and who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything! They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist. Some people think you're boring. Only those who know you well know that you aren't.  OK, so I got a 33. Seems pretty accurate to me.

      So Greg is in Florida golfing. Well, when I talked to him tonight he was playing miniature golf. I guess he is gearing up for the "real" golf course. Golfing (and probably watching some NCAA basketball) is the agenda for the trip he took with his uncle and cousin. Anyway, he left this morning. Not to be all girly, but this is the second time since we've been married that he's been gone overnight. The other time was in July when he took the bar exam in Louisville. My life was busy then because I was finishing up my job in Richmond and packing our apartment to move to Murray. And it was just one night. I don't mind being here by myself. I lived by myself in Louisville for the year I worked at the AP and loved a lot about it. Trust me, I will stretch out in the middle of the night tonight. But I will be glad when Greg's back on Sunday.  I'm going to Louisville this weekend to hang out with my mom. I think we'll be the only ones home. Dad will be in Indianapolis and Cassie is going to Florida. I sure am looking forward to it though. And then Bailey the dog is coming to stay with us for two weeks because my parents are going on vacation.  Friends are important to me. I love conversations and relationships, even though I may depend on them too much. With that said, I have one friendship that is incredibly unbalanced. She tells a story, which prompts me to tell a story, but I never get the whole thing finished because whatever she has to say is more important. I rarely confide in her beyond surface-level topics and events. I guess because that's the case, I shouldn't even use the word confide. It's rather frustrating actually. I know she needs a friend, but it is incredibly draining on me to be that friend. I know friendships are going to vary with people's moods and different settings. I know friendships go back and forth, depending on who needs what. But my friendship with her is like a broken see-saw. Sometimes I wait my turn to go up, but never seem to get off the ground. More times than not, though, it makes me appreciate my other friends, knowing the street goes both ways, and that probably helps me be a better friend to her.  So, in the spirit of March Madness, here's part of an instant message conversation I had with Adam:  admitch4 : i am tempted to say "rough go of things for the racers"......then again.....i realize you could easily come back with either. A. "Kentucky is the #1 #1 seed", or B. "Who does Indiana play this weekend"  admitch4 : so, under the circumstances, i guess i wont bring up basketball  :-)  krishill10 : i was tempted to harass you all season about indiana...but i held back.  admitch4 : it would be no harassment......its simple.....so long as mike davis is the coach, indiana will never be a legitimate contender

      I love "When Harry Met Sally..." The movie is built on conversations, and I like that. Watching it, I feel like I know Harry and Sally. Jaclyn says she's going to "invite Harry and Sally" over when she watches it. It's really like that. Anyway, there are fabulous conversation and much bickering between Harry and Sally. I always wished I could write fast enough to get it all. This afternoon I found a  urlLink Web site  that has much of the good dialogue quoted with other descriptions from the movie.   I thought I'd include one of my favorites:   While watching "Casablanca:"   Harry : There are two kinds of women: high maintenance and low maintenance.  Sally : And Ingrid Bergman is low maintenance?  Harry : An L.M. Definitely.  Sally : Which one am I?  Harry : You're the worst kind. You're high maintenance, but you think you're low maintenance.  Sally : I don't see that.  Harry : You don't see that. (He mimics her typical ordering procedure.) 'Waiter, I'll begin with the house salad, but I don't want the regular dressing. I'll have balsamic vinegar and oil, but on the side, and then the salmon with the mustard sauce, but I want the mustard sauce on the side.' 'On the side' is a very big thing for you.  Sally : Well, I just want it the way I want it.  Harry : I know, high maintenance. (Sally sighs after Bogart says the final line of the film, when the two characters walk off into the fog-shrouded airport: 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.') Ooh. Best last line of a movie ever.

      According to The Associated Press... Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, long known for its high-calorie treats, says it plans to offer a low-sugar doughnut to attract dieters and diabetics. Exactly how low the sugar content would be was unclear. Krispy Kreme spokeswoman Amy Hughes said the new doughnut is still in the early stages of development. It is set to debut before the end of 2004. One of Krispy Kreme's Hot Original Glazed doughnuts has 10 grams of sugar and 200 calories. More than half those calories come from fat, 12 grams of it.  Yummy. Hopefully they'll use Splenda.

      I worked until about midnight last night, thinking maybe I'd sleep a little later than usual. But, no, that would be too easy. Instead, I woke up at 7 a.m. ready to eat breakfast and get moving for the day. The strange thing is I feel rested.  And the thing about feeling rested is I know it's a direct result of controlling my diabetes. Before I even knew I had diabetes but I did, I was sluggish and always felt worn out. I just thought that was life, or at least my life at that point. On the weekends I would sleep and nap all of the time, which I thought was just what I wanted to do on the weekends. Don't get me wrong, I love to nap. But I don't feel like every day when I come home from work I must take a nap before I go on. Diabetes is a weird disease. I haven't a coke with sugar in it since Jan. 28, the day I was diagnosed. And that's OK. Diet Dr Pepper and Diet Coke with Lime are my friends. I have other diet drink friends, but those are my favorites. I had to give Jaclyn about 10 pairs of pants because they didn't fit anymore, which is actually a good thing, although it's frustrating at times. I gained weight I needed to gain because before my body was flushing out the calories I ate, hence the reason I spent too much of my life in bathrooms. I don't even mind pricking my finger to check my blood sugar or giving myself insulin shots in my stomach. The absolute most challenging aspect of learning to live with diabetes is eating. Breakfast is easy for me. But lunch and dinner get frustrating because I eat the same things all of the time. I'm almost scared to venture way out, although I did attempt Mexican food for the first time. In a nutshell, I have to count the number of carbohydrates I eat and eat the same number at the same meal each day. It's not that isn't a low-carb diet, but rather a consistent carb diet. So, while I have that figured out in my head, I don't really like to cook. I don't like the time it takes to prepare something in relation to the 15 minutes it takes to eat it. I don't mind doing some dishes, but when I cook the sink overflows with dirty pots and pans and plates. And, maybe the hardest part, is I just never have ideas of what to cook. I bought some cookbooks and one of my goals this weekend is to sit down and look at them -- and choose some meals. I just need to plan better, but that's a whole new ballgame, considering I'm a person who never paid a bit of attention to serving size and nutrition information before. I ate what I wanted when I wanted. That's not the case anymore.  I've had a few hard days lately dealing with this, and diabetes in general. But I hate to let people know that. Very few people know the week before this was probably the worst week I've had since being in the hospital at the end of January. At first there was a fear factor that kept me going, not really questioning anything. Now, I feel comfortable enough I want to know reasons for high blood sugar levels in the afternoon or why my blood sugar sometimes is high after exercising, when it really should be go lower. There are so many variables -- food, insulin, exercise, stress -- that affect how I feel, both mentally and physically.   So Jaclyn told me I should tell people, well, not everyone, but my couple good friends, when I feel bad. I shouldn't just pretend. She just knows that friends are there to build each other up, and sometimes that's going to be that needs some encouragement. I totally see her point, and appreciate having a friend like her. But there's a thin line between saying, "Hey, today's been a bad day. I've had a headache." and whining. I know I've toed the line plenty of times and I know I've crossed the line just as many times.   Still as many bad days as I had two weeks ago, I've had many more good days. Thinking back to a year ago or six months ago or even just two months ago, I feel better than I've felt in a long time. I suppose this is the epitome of how a frustrating, challenging situation became, and I'm sure will continue to become, my saving grace.

      Despite the sad fact I don't sleep in anymore, it's been a good weekend. (I got up at 7 a.m. yesterday and today. OK, so what if I go to bed at 10 p.m.) I've been productive -- laundry, dishes, cleaning, grocery -- and I've relaxed. Greg and I went to see "50 First Dates." Very funny, random and sweet. We watched Murray State beat Austin Peay, whose fans didn't appear to sport their "Muck Furray" shirts this time. The Racers are going the NCAA tournament. Now, it's halftime of the Kentucky-Florida game now, and the Wildcats are looking good.  Here are some more good quotes. This time they are from the introduction to "Somebody Told Me," a collection of stories by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Rick Bragg.  How journalism at its best is like a family sitting on the front porch telling stories: "The only think that made it worthwhile was the words, which sometimes made sense and sometimes, once in a happy while, even sounded as if a real storyteller had put them together on some metaphorical front porch."   On journalism as a business: "Newspaper stories are fleeting things. The thing that makes this business so remarkable, that every day we get a new canvas to paint on, is also what makes it so unsatisfying. The story, almost always, dies with the day, the pages of the day-old paper turning yellow in the sun."

      I've had a headache almost constantly the past week. It's frustrated me because I know it's from fluctuating blood sugar levels. And that's frustrating because I'm doing everything I know to do, and I think I'm doing a good job. I don't want diabetes to control my life. I want to control it. This is the first week I have really felt discouraged by the whole thing. Add to that my emotional nature, and it all made for a long few days. I'm using this weekend to recover, and in doing so I've been reading a lot and flipping through my journal -- the one I keep with pen and paper. Emotional overflow makes me reflective.  So, with that said, I found something in my journal to share. I wrote it about six weeks ago, apparently during a moment of appreciation for my friends. The words combine thoughts and images of many people important to me:   We walked across the yard into one another's lives. We wondered if we'd ever be old enough to drive but settled for bike rides and runs through sprinklers. You knew my secrets about boys and taught me about God. You made me laugh so hard I'd cry and sang along to Alan Jackson. You wet your pants -- apparently literally -- when I told you I was getting married. We never really fought, still, you're like my sister. My excitement becomes your excitement, even 21 hours away.  We were inseparable. Teachers got us mixed up and everyone expected us to be together. We watched "My So-Called Life" and ate Funyuns. Grape Kool-Aid was our choice drink. You finished my sentences, reminded me life goes on when boys are stupid and knew me sometimes better than I knew myself. I grew up; you regressed. Or I settled while you partied. You changed; I changed.  We bonded over email. You came to visit me once, even though you though Murray was a world away. You shared music and movies with me, and sometimes your feelings. You held a grudge then forgave me. We watched baseball -- Go Cardinals. But your Reds won. We rode roller coasters and I fought with your friend.  We ate ice cream and stayed up all night talking. We fell in love fast but spent years figuring it out. Fear sometimes divided us, but friendship always kept us together. We cheered at ball games, competed at cards and laughed and cried about nothing and everything. Our lives intertwined in a way I never expected.   We became friends from across the room. You made lots of eye contact and talked to me, sometimes with words. You made me laugh with your randomness. We bickered and fought, but I couldn't stay mad. You were intriguing and frustrating all at the same time. We cheered for the Wildcats, but you wait for Patrick Sparks.   You are my friend. Maybe I gave you too much. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe. But joy comes from you. Your life touched my life. We hurt each other; we healed each other. I influenced you; you impacted me. You were my neighbor. You were my roommate. You were my co-worker. You were my friend. You are part of who I am.   I have been reading "A Glimpse of Jesus" by Brennan Manning. He's one of the best authors and speakers I've experienced:  "Feelings that are not expressed cannot be fixed. ... An integral life implies creative listening to our emotions, taking responsibility for them, and courageously expressing them. ... For the Nazarene carpenter, to have integrity meant to be genuine, to communicate authentically, to resonate with his feelings."  "The world does not understand vulnerability. Strength is made to look like weakness and freedom to look like failure. Vulnerability is flatly rejected by the world as incompetence, and compassionate caring is dismissed as unprofitable. ... His ministry was a seeming failure, his life appeared to have no difference; he was a naked, murdered, ineffectual, losing God. But in that weakness and vulnerability, the world would come to know the love of the Abba of the Compassionate One."

      It's awfully random every time somebody, really anyone, says a word, really any word, I can come up with a story relating to that word in a matter of seconds. I think it's a talent I'm developing, even though I'm not really sure where that would take me in this world. Maybe I think too much. Or maybe I babble too much.

      "Unload all your worries onto him, since he is looking after you." --1 Peter 5:7  "You and I are governed. The weather determines what we wear. The terrain tells us how to travel. Gravity dictates our speed, and health determines our strength. We may challenge these forces and alter them slightly, but we never remove them. God -- our Shepherd -- doesn't check the weather; he makes it. He doesn't defy gravity; he created it. He isn't affected by health; he has no body. Jesus said, 'God is spirit.' Since he has no body, he has no limitations -- equally active in Cambodia as he is in Connecticut." -- Max Lucado in "Traveling Light"  "Relationships change. Health changes. The weather changes. But the Yaweh who ruled the earth last night is the same Yaweh who rules it today. Same convictions. Same plan. Same mood. Same love. He never changes. You can no more alter God than a pebble can alter the rhythm of the Pacific." -- Max Lucado in "Traveling Light"  "People take a measure of your vision, your character. They really want to know how you can affect their lives -- whether they can trust you," Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry on people's perceptions of politicians, but maybe more so on life.  All of these other people's words to say I am a more complex person than I like to admit. I hate fickleness but sometimes can't make up my mind. I despise change but grow restless with routine. I have faith God is greater than any detail of my life, yet I strive for perfection. I yearn for simplicity in a complex life. And it is good to know when I have my milkshake moments, God is steadfast.

      The sunshine turned to rain. The lovely random weather in Kentucky continues. Of course, today I only worked half a day but don't have the pretty weather to enjoy like I could have yesterday.

      I'm addicted to steamed broccoli and this raw broccoli salad my mom recently gave me the recipe for. That's strange if you know anything about me and my limited appreciation for vegetables. The good thing, though, is broccoli is a low-carb vegetable, so it's easy on my blood sugar levels. Also, I'm becoming quite addicted to The Real World and The Inferno. For the record, I don't care for Road Rules, but I like The Inferno because it combines The Real World with a Survivor-like twist. Plus, The Real World folks are going to Greece on their next episode and I'm going to Greece, among other places, in June, so it should be fun to watch.

      I honestly haven't been following all this Sept. 11, 2001, and war in Iraq investigation about who's lying and who's got the best information and blah, blah, blah, but I thought this was interesting:  "One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line." - President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998   "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program." - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998   Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." - Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998   "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten time since 1983." - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb 18,1998   "[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the US Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI), Tom Daschle (D-SD), John Kerry (D - MA), and others Oct. 9,1998   "Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." - Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998   "Hussein has . chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies." - Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999   "There is no doubt that .. Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate  that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." - Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001   "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction  and the means of delivering them." - Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002   "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country." - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002   "Iraq's search for  weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power." - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002   "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002   "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons..." - Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002   "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly  arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9,2002   "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years .. We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of  weapons of mass destruction."- Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002   "He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do" - Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002   "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members.. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons." - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002   "We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction." - Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002   "Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime  ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction .. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real." - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003   Now every one of these people say President Bush lied, that there never were any weapons of mass destruction and he took us to war unnecessarily.

      When I clocked in this morning, it said 6:66. Great. What a way to start of the day. I'm really not superstitious but still I can't help but to notice the numbers. It's almost lunch time, now, and I can say I haven't noticed any unusual evil. I think the sun might even be trying to shine outside.  Greg made his Little League coaching debut last night. I went to a little more than half the game. He's really great with the boys (They are 13- to 15-year-olds.) and is quite the encourager. That's one of the reasons he's going to make a great dad one day. I want to re-emphasize ONE DAY.   I woke up with a headache at 2:40 a.m. Ridiculous. I know getting my diabetes under control has caused all kinds of changes -- good changes -- in my body but sometimes that means I have to deal with headaches. I got nervous, though, and checked my blood sugar at that ridiculous hour, thinking it might be low. But it was at a solid 97. (That would be in the normal range.)

      I had a really great weekend...  Last week was the week of meetings at work, so after I finished writing my story about city council Thursday night, Greg and I headed up to Louisville. Jaclyn and Bryan left then too and ended up staying at my parents' house with us for two nights. We didn't leave Murray until 9 p.m. and I'm pretty sure I was asleep before we were in Marshall County. When we got to my parents' a little before 2 a.m. Eastern Time, Bailey kept bringing toys into the bed for Greg and I -- well, probably Greg -- to play with. She loves him, but it was much to late for all of that.  Friday I went to see an endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in the study of hormones and glands and their disorders. Anyway, she was encouraging and offered some good advice, the biggest being the way I take my insulin now based on the number of carbohydrates I eat. That means I can vary what I eat more in terms of carbs. Before I was eating a certain number of carbs at each meal and taking the same amount of insulin at each meal. Now, I'm tweaking a carb-to-insulin ratio so I can eat any number of carbs and take an appropriate amount of insulin.  Laine cut my hair on Friday, too. I went in for a trim and then she asked if she could cut it so the back flipped out. Sure, Laine's creative and I trust her... But she might have been a bit too creative. Once I got home and the way she styled it started falling out, I started not liking it so much. I like the back, which was cut shorter than I realized I agreed to. But I hated the sides, which were longer and really didn't blend in with the back. So, Saturday morning I tried to call Laine and ask if I could come by so she could fix the sides like I wanted them. But the receptionist said she was busy and wouldn't have time for me until 3. Well, that wasn't working in my plan so I went somewhere else and had it cut -- again. So I've ended up with a shorter haircut than I originally intended, but I think that's good because I wouldn't have thought about getting it cut like this and I like it. It's a good summer haircut. Jaclyn says when she gets her hair cut short she gets feisty, or feistier than usual. We'll see.  Saturday I hung out with Jaclyn. We ate lunch with Kelly and then went shopping for awhile. I was on a hunt for these black capri pants at Old Navy and didn't find them. Jaclyn also met Milla, the most beautiful baby ever. Then we, including Greg, met Shelley, Dustin, Evan, Bekah and Barrett for dinner at Cracker Barrel. I sure wish Shelley and Dustin lived closer, and not only because Evan is up there on the list of cutest babies ever. But, then again, that's my wish for a few other friends as well. Then we went to Kent's wedding, which was fabulous. Kent looked so nice in his Air Force uniform. The wedding was sweet and the reception was fun because several friends I don't see often were there. I especially had fun with Cara -- we laughed a lot like old times. Old times are good when new times are different. I also talked to Jonathan, my freshman year, high school boyfriend. He's married and had a little girl who's almost 2. The irony was Greg and Jonathan played paintball with lots of guys, including Kent, on Friday, and Greg didn't realize the Jonathan playing paintball was the old boyfriend Jonathan. It's sort of weird when worlds collide, but that's life, I suppose.   Cassie and I went shopping Sunday. I found the black capris I wanted. Well, they aren't exactly what I wanted but may actually be better than the ones I was originally looking for. I got some birthday money from my dad and grandpa and believe I successful spent it Sunday on the pants, some black sandals and some other new goodies. It was fun to hang out with Cassie.  That's some of the highlights of my weekend. I also want to mention I had some yummy home-cooked meals, thanks to my mom, and got to hang out with Milla. She was cranky Friday night because she was sleepy but she was quite a joy Saturday and Sunday, especially when I was feeding her. That's totally the way to bond with a baby. I hung out with Kevin and Dad some, too.   We got back into town at 10:30 last night. Nothing like filling every minute of a weekend. Still, it was time for such a weekend. And I get to see Mom and Cassie again this coming Sunday because they are coming to Murray to celebrate my birthday -- which is a week from today -- with me and Greg's family.   Alright, other random comments: - I really like Derek Abney. But the Baltimore Ravens drafted him. I don't like the Ravens. Is starting to like the Ravens because Abney plays for them sort of like being a fair-weather fan? But I don't think I can like the Ravens, there's too much of a rivalry with the Titans. Hopefully Abney will do well then I can just cheer for him. - "Love Actually" comes out on DVD this week. I loved that movie. - What's the deal with Brewers beating the Cardinals multiple times this season? And it's only April.

      Sometimes I wonder if I should refrain from talking about the same things on here. I tend to be repetitive. But then I remember this is my blog and I write about whatever I want. I go through phases with the blog, but lately it has replaced my on-paper journal. Maybe that's not so good because this isn't as private and people probably really aren't interested in my repetition. I learn through repetition, though, so maybe this is how I have to come to revelations in my life.   Oh, I'm totally babbling. But isn't babbling what a blog is for basically?  OK, so onto my seemingly-repetitive banter. Yesterday I was at a meeting with the mayor (Well, actually I was at two meetings with the mayor yesterday but that's far from the point of this story.) and I asked him about his wife, who recently had knee replacement surgery. He told me how she is doing well with her rehab and feeling emotionally better. Then he said she has diabetes and that really affects her whole body. He stressed how hard it can be on her. Then he randomly says, "You don't have diabetes, do you?"  First, I swear he and I have talked about it before because I remember him telling me about how his wife didn't find out she had diabetes until she was in her 50s. I'm pretty sure she has Type 2, so she doesn't have to take insulin. Second, what a weird question to tack onto the end of a conversation.  Yesterday I also heard about somebody dying "from diabetes." But I know that diabetes itself doesn't usually kill people. Rather long-term complications affect and damage other organs and other parts of the body when diabetics' blood sugar levels run consistently high or low. People say they think it's good I'm dealing with the diabetes now and learning how to manage it. Truth is, it scares me to death to even consider ignoring it. That goes with my perfectionist personality as well as my fear of the unknown.   Last night was the first time I really questioned why and how this happened to me. I love details and am so frustrated with the fact that there are unanswered questions with this. I have faith enough to know that this is for the better, whatever the better is, however the better will change me. But I'm human enough to wish I didn't have to deal with it.   Moving on... Greg is in Lexington for a new lawyers' conference. He just called me from the car with Rod and Corbitt. They were on their way to eat Donato's Pizza for lunch. First of all, I miss Rod and Corbitt. Secondly, I wish I had some Donato's. It's funny to me that when Greg goes out of town I think I'm going to look forward to all this Kristin time, but then I miss him more than I expect. That's probably a good thing for our marriage but a frustrating thing for my heart.

      The blessing of this job specifically and career in general is that I don't do the same thing everyday. The burden is sometimes I have to do things other than be a reporter. Most people know I was hesitant to take this job after Greg and I moved to Murray in August. But I'm anal and tend to worry, so the thought of not having a job freaked me out. (Don't get me wrong, some days I wish I could sleep until 9 and then watch two hours of Dawson's Creek reruns, but in the long run I'd get bored because I need to be doing something.) Anyway, turns out that on most days I like my job more than I thought I would. I'm a nerd, and don't mind covering city council and other government meetings in town and at the university. I generally like the people I have to talk to often for my stories. I like knowing what's going on locally and with state government. And I like learning about the court process first hand while hearing stories from Greg. On the other hand, however, I don't really enjoy laying out a special section for Administrative Professionals Week and the local International Association of Administrative Professionals chapter...That would be one of those burdens of small-town journalism. I understand that and really shouldn't complain about it, but still I'd rather be writing.   I've had the itch lately to write a book. But I want to write a non-fiction book and my latest idea is to travel to different baseball parks and talk to people, random people, and then just tell their stories. I don't necessarily want to talk to athletes; I want to talk to people who have other stories to tell in the stadium setting -- a long-time ticket-taker and concession stand worker, one of the guys who pull the tarp out when it rains, whoever is in charge of the scoreboard. Plus then I'd get to visit baseball parks. I'd like to go to Boston and stay with Katie and Brad, who can see Fenway Park from their apartment and watched the Boston Marathon runners pass down their street, Beacon Street. As much as I hope Barry Bonds stays on 666 homeruns forever, I want to see Pac Bell Park. I can't stand the Yankees, but I know their stadium is filled with history and stories. Great American Ballpark is nice and I wish Busch would stay where it is, how it is. Wrigley Field is classic and Cominsky Park is modern. Maybe if I visited Seattle again it would only rain one of the seven days I'm there, like years ago. I've never been to Kansas City, Houston, San Diego, Miami or Detroit. I've never stepped foot in Arizona or Colorado.

      It's been a nice weekend involving a lot of hanging out at home, which I wanted.   Saturday I had to cover a press conference at Murray State. It was about how the university's private donations and assets have reached $50 million for the first time in school history. (In other words, MSU knows it has had some bad press lately, thanks to some basketball players getting arrested and no state budget, why not toot its own horn when there's something good to report. Well, that's probably only partially true. But that's sort of how I felt about it when I was there yesterday.) Anyway, then Greg and I went out to his parents' house for a picnic at our of their ponds. The boys went fishin' and I hung out with Peggy, Angela, her mom and Elijah and got some sun. Not that I want to be sunburned, but it's refreshing to know it's warm enough to get burned. My nose and shoulders got the best of it. Last night we went to Paducah with Jaclyn and Bryan to celebrate his birthday at Outback. It was yummy, especially the Bloomin' Onion. Then we went to the mall for a bit and Books-A-Million, where I found a fun toy for work. But only because I'm a nerd do I think magnetic poetry is going to be fun at my metal desk. (I do realize I just wrote that I've enjoyed my time at home this weekend, then went on to tell about how I spent most of Saturday not at home. Still, it was relaxing and didn't involve much effort.)  This morning I woke up at my regular too-early-for-a-weekend hour, ate breakfast and then returned to the bed and slept until 9:30. It was fabulous. Then we went to church and out to lunch with Brandon. I've spent this afternoon folding clothes, washing clothes, cleaning up around here, making a CD...  And I think I frustrate Greg on days like this because he's not good at sticking around the house doing odds and ends when it's beautiful outside. Granted, it would be a great day to do something outside. Still, after the busy week I had, I'm in the mood to just hang out. He'd like to play golf, but I don't think he can find anybody to go with him and decided to settle for flipping between two golf tournaments on TV.   So the Cardinals had the bases loaded with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, when they were down three runs this afternoon. Albert Pujols comes to the plate, fouls several pitches. The commentators rattle off all these statistics about how Pujols has a better batting average so far this season (Yes, it's only April.) when he's behind in the count and how he's clutch with the bases loaded. He hits the ball far and hard, Cardinals fans cheer more than they already were, thinking he just hit a grand slam for the win...  The Rockies outfielder reaches up and catches it at the wall. Six more inches, if that, and it was gone.   Good thing it's only April and the Reds beat the Cubs in 10 innings today. I think it's easier to be into baseball when it's warm outside. I mean, it's hard to appreciate the boys of summer when it's snowing outside like it did here Tuesday. Yes, it snowed and I got sunburned in the same week in the same town.

      Michael shared this quote with me at work today before lunch. And I still think it's funny: "Never try to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and it annyos the pig." Paul Dickson. Who's Paul Dickson, you ask? Well, I asked the same thing, so I looked him up. Apparently he's an author who's written a variety of books, including some on baseball. What this has to do with a pig is beyond me.  Here is a quote about words. It's funny to me to quote people talking about words. Words about words. "There are little constellations of language here and there, and the meaning of a word changes according to its context in the constellation."

      Yes, I've neglected the blog this week. That's unfortunate because I had some randomness to share.   First, Ryan decided to let me know he is indeed alive. You'd think Cincinnati was a world away the way we go months without even an e-mail. It's good to hear from him, though, because it's always familiar. I like that about our friendship. Being baseball season, Greg and I are hoping to make it to a Red-Cards game in Cincinnati (I wonder if I could fit in Skyline and King's Island, too?). Hopefully that happens. Anyway, Ryan said when I blog he feels like I'm talking to him. I like that because sometimes when I blog I wonder if I'm talking to anyone or maybe just a wall. Still, it's nice to know somebody feels included.  I also ate dinner with Cassie on Wednesday night in Clarksville. It was a spur-of-the-moment trip there because I needed a venting-talking session and she seemed to be a good person. I realized for maybe the first time how alike we really are. On the surface she seems to be party girl who likes to be the center of attention and I'm the one who prefers a small, close group of friends and shies from the spotlight. But really it comes down to we both wish we were low-maintenance but we're high-maintenance and we want relationships to be refreshing not routine. While talking about that, she said she often tells her boyfriend Zac she just wishes he'd leave her a random Post-It Note with a sweet note. I can't count the times I've told Greg the same thing and even reversed the gesture and left him nice notes on the bathroom mirror when I leave for work and he's still in bed. I guess Post-It Notes represent something deeper to us, and it's probably just our mom's fault because she got us hooked on the lovely, sticky paper.  Alright, on to politics... Gov. Fletcher could lead the legislators to a budget or his tax modernization plan. Some would probably say he's one person and he can't bear that total responsibility. But I say he's the leader and he has a job to do, and that's to be productive in state government. The most important thing state government does is operate the different departments and such throughout the state, but nobody can do that without a budget. Yes, partisan politics got in the way. Almost every budget or tax vote was passed or rejected along party lines. Surely each side could have some good points and the legislators would be mature enough to learn the art of compromise. Then again, you have a party controlling the governor's office for the first time in more than three decades, so what can you expect? I voted for Fletcher, and I don't totally regret that. But I think he went in there trying to do too much at first. He'll be in office for four years. How about getting a budget through the first year, then worrying about overhauling the state's tax system. I mean, the legislators wouldn't have to worry about a budget next year if they'd pass one this year, so give them one thing at a time.   On that note, here's a funny story, thanks to Michael.  The Ant and the Grasshopper  OLD VERSION: The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed.  The grasshopper has no food or shelter, so he dies out in the cold.  MORAL OF THE STORY: Be responsible for yourself!   MODERN VERSION: The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.  Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.  CBS, NBC, and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food.  America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when they sing, "It's Not Easy Being Green."  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where the news stations film the group singing, "We shall overcome."  Jesse then has the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's sake.  Tom Daschle and John Kerry exclaim in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and both call for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share."  Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act," retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients.  The ant loses the case.  The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him because he doesn't maintain it.  The ant has disappeared in the snow.  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house, now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once peaceful neighborhood.  MORAL OF THE STORY: Vote Republican.

      I decided Saturday afternoon I wanted to go hang out with my mom. So, Greg and I went to Louisville about 2 p.m. Saturday and got there in time to have dinner with Mom. We spent Sunday just hanging out with my parents (Greg and I had a marvelous come-from-behind victory against my parents in Rook and I tied my mom in Scrabble...) and later Poppy, Kevin, Laine and Milla. We ate steak and they had cheesecake while I ate my sugar-free Snickers Pie dessert and watched the Master's. I got to bond with my beautiful niece and had some much-needed rest at my parents' house. I was worried about making the in-laws angry for changing Easter plans, but Peggy seemed to understand a girl needing her mom.   I wrote a little Saturday about how I sometimes put on my tough exterior when I talk about diabetes. People ask how I'm dealing with it and I answer with some optimistic "Oh, it's been a change, but I feel better" or "I don't mind the insulin shots." While those things are true, sometimes it would be more honest to say, "Yeah, I miss snacking in the middle of the afternoon just because I want to" or "It sucks to stick my stomach with a needle before every meal and before I go to bed." There's no doubt it's made me more disciplined, but there's no doubt sometimes I just have to wonder why I have to deal with this. Contradictions are the story of my emotions. I truly see the both sides of things so much of the time, and I really want to see diabetes as a means to a healthier life, not a mystery that burdens my days. (OK, I realize I'm repeating myself, but this is my blog and I can repeat myself as much as I would like.)  Last night Greg and I were having sing-a-long time driving back from Louisville. Sometimes it's hard to find music we both want to listen to in the car. (Actually, he wanted to listen to the Giants-Padres baseball game...um, who cares. They both play in California, and do I really want to hear about Barry Bonds hitting another homerum? Although I don't think he did last night.) Anyway, we listened to Bebo Norman, an artist on which we agree. I've listened to Bebo hundreds of times, and Katie and Aaron even played one of his songs in our wedding. Last night one song really put how I was feeling into perspective for me, and I think Greg too once I told him Bebo's word summed it up:   I got a little hope in my pocket Want to share of it with you Just be careful that you dont drop it Dont worry if you do Cause Ive got broken down inside me And I might just need some help But I will get by Hey, hey  And Ive got demons in my history Got bone beneath my skin Ive been taken by a mystery Yes Ive been taken in And sometimes voices down inside me Try to fight me for myself I will get by Hey, hey  Cause what have I got to live for There is nothing beating in my chest And what have I got to live for When this world starts turning Its burning me up Im alright  I used to think love was just a barter Second hand coincidence What doesnt kill you just makes you harder So I use my common sense Keeping cold to keep my distance Till I tuck my pride away I will get by Yeah, yeah  Cause what have I got to live for There is nothing beating in my chest And what have I got to live for When this world starts turning Its burning me up Im alright  But I am not afraid No I am not afraid  And I will not go crazy  I got a little hope here in my pocket Want to share of it with you Just be careful that you dont drop it Dont worry if you do Cause Ive got voices down inside me And I might just need some help I will get by Hey, hey  What have I got to live for Theres nothing beating in my chest And what have I got to live for When this world starts turning Burning me up  When my heart is hurting Im learning about love When this world starts turning Its burning me up Im alright

      A couple days this week I got frustrated with my diabetes. Most of the time I'm pretty accepting of it and how it affects my life. But some days are tougher, and I try not to dwell on those. But, in all honesty, it sucks some days. Still, I continue to be encouraged at the right times. One of those times was Thursday with an article in The Courier-Journal. If this athlete can live a fine life with diabetes, I can do. And the story does a good job of explaining this disease, which is sort of a mystery.   Battling more than pitchers  Top prospect Smitherman deals with diabetes every day   By BRIAN BENNETT  Dane Sardinha assumed the worst the first time he saw muscular outfielder Stephen Smitherman pull a black medical bag out of his locker and jam a needle into his leg.   "I was like, `This guy is shooting steroids right in front of everybody,'" said Sardinha, who played with Smitherman last year at Double-A Chattanooga.   In this era of heightened steroid suspicion surrounding baseball, most of Smitherman's new teammates shared the same thought. The truth is, Smitherman  a top Cincinnati Reds hitting prospect who will open the season in Richmond tonight with the Louisville Bats  must take four injections a day merely to function.   Smitherman, the Reds' minor league Player of the Year last season, is an insulin-dependent diabetic.   "People always look at me and are like, `Ah, I thought you were on steroids,'" he said. "It's really not funny, because if I don't take my shots, I don't live. I get a little tired of explaining myself."   The explanations rarely cease, however. Not for someone dealing with a disease that's often misunderstood and rarely associated with elite-level athletes.   There are more than 18 million diabetics in the United States, according to the American Diabetes Association. Fewer than 10 percent of those diagnosed have Type 1 diabetes, as Smitherman does. His pancreas does not produce insulin, which is the hormone that converts sugars and starches into energy the body needs for daily activities.   Though the disease can be controlled through insulin injections, diabetes left unchecked can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, blindness and organ and nerve damage. Diabetes is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control.     Several high-profile athletes  including Hall of Fame pitcher Catfish Hunter, Olympic gold medal swimmer Gary Hall Jr. and hockey legend Bobby Clarke  have succeeded despite having Type 1 diabetes. But experts say coping with the disease can be challenging for athletes.   "It takes a lot of commitment, in addition to everything you have to do to become a well-trained athlete at the highest level," said Paula Harper, president and founder of the Diabetes Exercise and Sports Association. "You have to learn how your body deals with exercise and playing sports so you can always make the right choices. You have to always be on a schedule."   The nature of Smitherman's chosen profession presents its own challenges. Many Type I diabetics test their blood sugar several times a day. Smitherman does so only in the morning and at night because the pain from pricking his fingers makes it hard to grip a bat.   He takes an insulin shot before breakfast, lunch and dinner and once more before going to sleep. It's important to keep those shots and meals within the same hour every day, but long bus rides, rain delays and extra-inning games can make that difficult.   Minor fluctuations in his schedule can have major consequences, such as what happened in a Double-A game last summer. The game's unusual 5 p.m. starting time threw Smitherman's schedule out of whack, and he began to feel woozy while standing in the outfield during one of the middle innings.   He was experiencing hypoglycemia, which occurs when a diabetic's blood sugar gets too low and which can lead to unconsciousness. Smitherman usually can bring his blood sugar back to normal quickly with a candy bar or sugary drink, but he doesn't carry any sweets in his uniform pockets because the heat will turn them to mush.   Since there already were two out in the inning, he decided to wait it out and address the problem in the dugout. But the other team put together a time-consuming rally, and suddenly 20 minutes had passed with Smitherman still wobbling on the field.   "I got to the point where I was like, man, I need some help," he said.   Struggling to maintain his balance, he waved to the dugout before going down on one knee. Trainer Steve Baumann rushed out and asked him, "Where are you?" and "What day is it?" Smitherman said he knew the answers but couldn't produce a response.   Paramedics arrived, but Smitherman said he was fine after teammate Gary Senjem brought him a soda from the clubhouse. Smitherman insisted he could have returned to the game, and he played the next day without any ill effects. Still, it was a scary moment and one that could be repeated in Louisville this summer.   "Episodes like that are going to happen, and they're hard to predict," Smitherman said. "What I should have done is call timeout right away. I'll never wait like that again."   Baumann will serve as the Bats' trainer this season, so he is fully aware of Smitherman's condition. He keeps an emergency box of Snickers near the dugout in case anything happens.   "Stephen does a great job of monitoring himself," Baumann said. "I just try to look out and see if he's getting fatigued at times. You've just got to be prepared and understand what to look for."   Bats manager Rick Burleson also became familiar with Smitherman's situation while managing him last year in the Arizona Fall League.   "He's just got to communicate with me if there's a problem," Burleson said. "There has not been one situation, either in the fall league or any time in the spring, where it's been an issue."   Smitherman, 25, doesn't want to be defined by his disease, and he doesn't expect to be treated different than anyone else. But there's little denying that his condition played a role in where he is today.   Diabetes runs in Smitherman's family; his father, grandfather and aunt all have it. But he was the first to be diagnosed as a child. A stomach virus led to the onset of diabetes when he was 11 years old.   He adjusted quickly and developed into an outstanding high school athlete in Hartshorne, Okla., a dusty, two-stoplight town in the southeast corner of the state. Howard Schnellenberger recruited Smitherman to play quarterback for the University of Oklahoma. But then John Blake replaced Schnellenberger and wanted Smitherman to switch to tight end. That position change would have required significant weight gain, a medical risk he was unwilling to take.   Instead, he went off to play junior-college baseball at Eastern Oklahoma State. Brian Rhees, the baseball coach at Arkansas-Little Rock, discovered Smitherman there by accident while scouting another player. He couldn't believe that no other school was recruiting this raw but undeniably powerful 6-foot-4, 230-pound athlete.   "I kept asking myself, `What am I missing here?'" Rhees said. "His medical condition was a real scary subject for a lot of organizations and for a lot of colleges. But at the same time, imagine how disciplined one has to be with that condition. It's not like you can ever take a day off from your insulin. In the end, the discipline imparted by his diabetes is what helped make him a very good baseball player."   A couple of times during his two years at Little Rock, Smitherman had to have a Snickers or a peppermint brought to him on the field, Rhees said. But what set him apart was not his diabetes but a work ethic unmatched by any player Rhees had seen.   That work ethic helped turn Smitherman into a polished power hitter by his senior season. Yet he did not get drafted until the 23rd round of the 2000 draft. Scout Jimmy Gonzales, who first noticed Smitherman in junior college, convinced the Reds to select him. Gonzales once had coached a diabetic player in college and knew the facts.   "You could tell right away Stephen had all the major league tools," Gonzales said. "His diabetes may have been the reason so many teams passed on him. But I looked at him as someone who was forced to become disciplined at an early age. I knew he had what it takes."   Smitherman has proved Gonzales right. He has averaged nearly 20 home runs while batting close to .300 his first four professional seasons. Last year he hit .310 with 19 homers at Chattanooga and smacked the game-winning home run at the Major League Futures Game as part of All-Star weekend.   In fact, Smitherman's only failure thus far happened last season in Louisville. After he received a brief promotion to the Reds as a bench player, he was sent to Triple-A. He hit just .127 in 17 games and was demoted back to Double-A.   In retrospect, he said not playing regularly for several days in Cincinnati, plus his desire to return to the major leagues quickly, threw off his timing at the plate.   "I was pressing a little bit," he said. "Instead of taking my time and just see the ball, hit the ball, I was trying to hit the ball into the Ohio River. They probably could have thrown me a beach ball up there and I wouldn't have hit it."   The Reds called Smitherman back up in late August, and he hit his first major league home run against Milwaukee. They have few doubts that he'll succeed this time around in Triple-A.   "People in Louisville didn't get an accurate assessment of what this guy is," Cincinnati farm director Tim Naehring said. "He's going to be a good one."   Those who have been teammates with Smitherman for a while don't notice much different about him. He eats the same meals off the clubhouse spread, except that he sticks to meats and greens and avoids starches. He goes out with the boys after a game; he just drives everybody home since he doesn't drink alcohol.   Now when Sardinha sees Smitherman poke a syringe in his thigh or arm in the Bats clubhouse, he has only respect.   "It just makes you think, `Thank God you don't have to do that every day for your whole life,'" he said.   Taking four shots a day can be a headache, Smitherman admits. But he doesn't complain, and he's happy to talk openly about it. He is on the doorstep of a major league career, and one day he'd like to use that platform to inform more people about diabetes.   "If people see my face and hear about my condition on television every day, they'll say, `Well, he's a diabetic. Look at what he's doing,'" Smitherman said.   "There is a lot of misunderstanding about diabetics. People say they can't do this or they can't do that, and that's just not true."

One day, an atheist bought the house next door to her, and he became very irritated with the spiritual lady. So after a month or so of her yelling, "Praise the Lord" from her porch, he went outside on his porch and yelled back, "There is no Lord."   Yet, the little old lady continued. One cold, wintery day, when the little old lady couldn't get to the store, she went out on her porch, raised her hands up to the sky and said, "Help me Lord, I have no more money, it's cold, and I have no more food."   The next morning, she went outside, and there were three bags of food on the porch, enough to last her a week. "Praise the Lord," she yelled. The Atheist stepped out from the bushes and said, "There is no Lord, hahaha, I bought those groceries!"   The little old lady raised her arms to the sky and said, "Praise the Lord, you sent me groceries and you made the Devil pay for them!"

      I watched a Rascal Flatts concert on DVD this afternoon. I love their songs. But the DVD made me want several things: to see Rascal Flatts in concert (and just maybe I can at the end of August at the state fair in Louisville...), to go to the beach (OK, I am going on a Mediterranean cruise and site-seeing tour this summer. I probably shouldn't yearn for any other vacations anytime soon.), to listen to "Mayberry" over and over again (And I did multiple times until Greg had enough...).   Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster /Than it did in the old days/So naturally, we have more natural disasters/From the strain of a fast pace/Sunday was a day of rest /Now, its one more day for progress /And we cant slow down cause more is best /Its all an endless process/ /(Well) I miss Mayberry/Sitting on the porch drinking ice-cold cherry Coke/Where everything is black and white/Picking on a six string/Where people pass by and you call them by their first name/Watching the clouds roll by/Bye, bye/Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting/Through the trees as the wind blows/Thats when I climb up here on this mountain/To look through Gods window/Now I cant fly/But I got two feet that get me high up here/Above the noise and city streets/My worries disappear/(Repeat Chorus)/ Sometimes I dream Im driving down an old dirt road/Not even listed on a map/I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole/But I always wake up every time I try to turn back/(Repeat Chorus)/Bye, bye/I miss Mayberry, I miss Mayberry   In general it made me want to go to a concert... Right now at the top of my wish list are Rascal Flatts, Toby Keith, Alan Jackson, John Mayer and Counting Crows. Dave Matthews and Indigo Girls remain on my list, although I think I've lost count of the number of times I've seen them. I love concerts, which is funny because I can't sing well and can't play an instrument. (Playing the clarinet for three years in middle school probably doesn't count.) Still, music is such a good thing to me. I can associate almost every moment of my life with a song. I can associate most songs with specific moments. (That's sort of like which came first, the chicken or the egg?) Songs remind me of people. Songs give me peace and drown out the literal and figurative noise in this world.   I went to several concerts in high school and college. I had some good friends who didn't think twice about a road trip. So, besides Dave (I can only wish I was on a first-name basis with him.) and Indigo Girls, I've seen the Counting Crows (I love the Palace on Fourth Street in Louisville), U2, Color Me Badd (I believe that was my first concert, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I was an eighth grader, for whatever that's worth.), John Michael Montgomery, Third Day, Jennifer Knapp, Caedmon's Call, John Mayer, Dixie Chicks, Clay Walker, Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds acoustic (And that was at Murray State. Impressive, huh?), Rebecca St. James and probably a few others I can't seem to think of at the moment. And I've seen Toby Keith and Alison Krauss sing the National Anthem at different Titans games.

      Rochelle Riley is a fabulous writer. She's like a mentor to me and helped me get started as a writer in high school. She used to work at The Courier-Journal and I loved reading her columns because I could picture most of what she wrote about. She loved Louisville and always found inspiring stories to tell or hot topics on which to take a stand. She moved to Detroit to write for The Free-Press there. I still love reading her columns. And the thing is, her word choice is so excellent that I can still picture most of what she talks about. She's black and a single mother of her adopted daughter. She's from North Carolina. On the surface we don't have anything in common. But I admire her passion for people and words and how she weaves the two together so beautifully. She wrote a  urlLink column  about a museum in Detroit and somehow made me care about it.   I have been thinking about my high school friend (well, specifically freshman year friend) Elliott this week, which is the 10th anniversary of when Kurt Cobain killed himself. OK, odd, I know, but let me explain. My group of friends my freshman year (we later "split" because of some conflicting interests) included several Nirvana fans. Anyway, I remember sitting in freshman English class next to Elliott the day after Cobain killed himself and we had do some kind of project that day and somehow we did ours about how the world was mourning him. I'm not real sure what the point of the project was or what exactly we even did, but I remember Elliott being so sad about the whole thing. I think for him it was deeper than a rock star killing himself at 27 years old. I think it was about losing someone who stood for (and sang about) something so different than what was trendy at that point.   My friend Kent is getting married April 24. Kent and I have been friends since eighth grade and remained friends through our group's social split in ninth grade. (It was dramatic at the time.) Anyway, Kent was the guy who was friends with everyone. He was this unifying force among us. Anyway, his wedding is in Louisville soon and there is certain to be some random people there, hopefully including Elliott. Kent also transferred to Murray State from UK our sophomore year of college. So we have lots of mutual high school and college friends. His wedding will be a reunion of sorts.

      Baseball is here. Too bad the Cardinals weren't on TV. Or maybe it's better they weren't, as they lost to the Brewers. Still, President Bush was there to throw out the opening pitch. Right over the plate. And I'm sure he picked up some votes over John Kerry. Dick Cheney was in Cincinnati. I don't know if his opening pitch was a strike, and I'm not sure if he helped the Republican cause in Ohio.   I thought I was excited to watch the NCAA basketball championship last night. But not so much. I like championships. I like the emotions and stories associated with winning, and even somtimes losing. But I never got interested last night. Before the game, we grilled out and played Rook with Greg's parents until the game came on. But then Jaclyn came over and I ended up sitting in the kitchen through most of the first half talking with her. I sat down to watch the second half and Katy called. I talked to her for a half hour or so, and that was more interesting than the basektball game. So, I called it a night after that. Georgia Tech apparently called it a night before the game even got started. Maybe the team just needed Michael to sing its fight song...

      Last night Greg said the second best thing that could happen in the NCAA Tournament is Duke losing. I agree. (The best thing would be Kentucky winning the national championship, but so much for that this year.) Anyway, thanks UConn. And now I'll cheer for Georgia Tech. Greg says he can't cheer for an ACC school. I say, as long as it isn't Duke or North Carolina, who cares.  Here's a new word: DELTIOLOGY means postcard collecting.   My mom, Cassie and her boyfriend Zac came to visit yesterday. We had a good time. We went to lunch at Applebee's then watched a soccer game on TV. Not very exciting, I know, but we wanted to see Freddy Adu play. Then we watched some of the Georgia Tech-Oklahoma State game. Greg was cheering for Oklahoma State, well, maybe more so Eddie Sutton. My mom said there was no way she could cheer for Eddie Sutton because "he left Kentucky in a probation mess and came out smelling like a rose." When Georgia Tech won, she said, "Take that Eddie Sutton." Pretty funny. And I agree with her. Then we went to eat dinner at Tom's Grille. Cassie and Zac headed back to Clarksville and the rest of us went to David and Jennifer's for Dumplin's strawberry cake for Nana's birthday. I didn't eat as many carbs at dinner so I could have some cake. It was so yummy, and I guessed correctly because my blood sugar didn't go up. That's a moral victory for me. Anyway, then we came home and finished watching UConn beat Duke. My mom stayed here last night, and that's only the second time we've had an overnight guest.   I hadn't seen Cassie in about a month, so it was fun to hang out with her. She's really one of the funniest people I know. It was also the first time we've seen her and Zac since Murray State beat Austin Peay in the OVC Tournament. It was nice to talk about that. Although, they enjoyed hearing about how the only four players Mick Cronin has recruited since he's was hired about a year ago have been arrested -- all in the last past month.   I woke up at 7 this morning. That's alright, except it was really more like 6 because we lost an hour last night, thanks to springing forward. Time zones and time changes are a mystery to me. I don't really comprehend it. Yet, somehow, I prefer the eastern time zone, especially in the winter.

      I've talked with (or e-mailed) four people today about Survivor. It's funny to me that everyone has a different idea of who should win or who is playing the game well. I have to admit, Boston Rob cracks me up. Usually he's an egotistical guy who thinks he owns the game. But, still, he's hilarious. And he loves (um, maybe loves...) Amber. She's alright, too. But together they are pretty funny. I just wonder how much of their relationship is genuine and how much is a strategy to try to win a million dollars. Anyway, last night on the show, the tribes were mixed up, except the weren't really mixed up. The pulled new buffs out of a jar and ended up just reversing tribes. Except Amber, who was shuffled to the other side to even up the teams. So, Boston Rob and Amber are split up. And it appeared to break Rob's heart. How sweet. I mean, he's going to live, it's just a game. He said he didn't care if the other tribe was living at his former camp with his stuff, but he did care that the other tribe has his girl. Sweet in a Boston Rob way. So, I'm rooting for them. And I hope there's still some spark for them when the game is over. Amber could have easily been voted out last night, but instead Jerri went. And that's fine by me.   I got an email about trees and birthdays today and some strange connection between the two. For certain birthdays, certain trees and their descriptions were associated. My birthday is a month from tomorrow and here's what the email said about me and my tree:   Poplar Tree (the Uncertainty) -- looks very decorative, talented, not very self-confident, extremely courageous if necessary, needs goodwill and pleasant surroundings, very choosy, often lonely, great animosity, great artistic nature, good organizer, tends to lean toward philosophy, reliable in any situation, takes partnership seriously.   Interesting.

      ...also known as feeling.  I often react emotionally to things that may not necessarily call for such a reaction. Then again, there are not many secrets about how I feel with anyone. Yet I shouldn't make decisions, including reactions, based on my feelings. And I do that much too often.  That's my most recent revelation.   With that, I often justify my actions and reactions as well as those of others with personality type. I think personalities are powerful reflections of who we are, our intentions and our perspectives. But I think people like me -- perfect melancholy people -- to often say, "Well, that's just how I am." And move on. Some of my personality traits are weaknesses, though, and I should want to become a better person. There are people around me who I admire for different reasons. I spend a lot of time thinking about why I get along with this person and click with this person but am annoyed by this person ... When really I should be thankful I know these people and take from them what I admire. Not take from them, but use them as role models in whatever aspect of life might be their strengths. I'm stuck in my perfectionist, stubborn ways too often because that's "how I am." Really I need to recognize there's room to grow.   Quick weekend run down: I worked Friday night. Yesterday I ran the dreaded Rite-Aid errand, when I had to buy extra diabetes supplies for our trip. (The dreaded part would be that insurance didn't cover them this time because it was too soon ...) Then I wasn't feeling super so I laid around much of the afternoon, watching The Learning Channel and other lazy-afternoon TV. Last night we went to Greg's parents' house for dinner, a trip talk and some cards. This morning Greg treated me to Cracker Barrel for breakfast, then we went to church. I took a picture for work, then we went to see "The Day After Tomorrow" with Brandon. I've spent much of the evening on the phone -- with Jodi, Katy, my mom, Greg's mom -- and now the thunder and lightning have arrived so I'm going to end this so I won't be on the computer near the window.

      And I hate it.  The last two mornings my blood sugar has been totally normal when I woke up then after breakfast it rises too high. This hasn't been a problem, and I don't understand why all of the sudden I'd need more insulin at breakfast. Dang it. It's so much a guessing game, and that just doesn't seem to be a way anybody should have to live their life.   Yet I know the frustration, and headaches, will pass -- eventually.  Speaking of a game, though, I did go to Greg's baseball game last night. He's really adorable with the kids, and his team even won. The best part was a run down between first and secon. The boy kept trying to either get back to first or onto second while the fielders tossed the ball back and forth. Eventually the first baseman overthrew it and the kid got on second. Lucky. I kept thinking it was going to rain, but the clouds held off, thankfully.

      I got a letter from a man in jail today. I've covering a story that involves him and another man both of whom are accused of two counts of attempted murder of a police officer for allegedly opening a tank of anhydrous ammonia during a drug bust. When I looked at the envelope, I thought it was going to be hate mail, but it really wasn't. He just wanted to tell me that he didn't ask for this 15 minutes of fame and would eventually clear his name. OK. Then he told me some of his story, as he called it. Then apologized for possibly wasting my time, but time was all he had at this point. Random.

      Saturday night I talked to my friend Katy about stem-cell research. She knows a little bit about it because of her biology minor. Anyway, she said she believes stem cells can come from umbilical cords, which would mean you don't need a fetus to get the cells to manipulate into necessary cells (such as insulin-producing cells) to cure diseases (such as diabetes). I just think politics weighs the whole thing down. But I still want to learn more about it.  The headaches resurfaced last night and this afternoon because of some fluctuations in my blood sugar levels. But I'm doing my best to be patient.  I spent a good portion of my work day in court today. In the morning a woman pleaded guilty to shooting her husband in the head (attempted murder) and this afternoon there was some debate about some records taken from a funeral home during a fraud investigation. And I saw Greg in passing both times I was at the judicial building. I thought I might, and was glad I did.

      Friday night was family time. Greg and I ate at Captain D's with his parents and then all came back to our house and played Rook. And Greg and I won both games.   Saturday I woke up early to go yard sale-ing with Jaclyn. We didn't find much. But we did go to Lowe's and dream about projects we want to do at our houses. Little by little I'm sure we'll get them done. Then I went shopping in Paducah with Greg's mom. I didn't find much, but it was fun. We ate at the Holman House. Usually I'm not a fan of cafeteria-style restaurants, but this might have been the exception. The food was good AND they had my favorite low-carb cheesecake that I usually get a Dumplin's in Murray. I've got to figure out where I can order because one day low-carb eating isn't going to be trendy and I'm going to need to maintain a supply of the cheesecake. Also, Saturday, Greg was super productive around the house, which I really appreciate. He even vacuumed out of my car, which I washed Friday afternoon after I went to Wal-Mart and bought a hose.   Last night we had friends over for a cook out and game night. It was a lot of fun. There were some friends from college and a couple other random couples. We ate hamburgers and such, then played Trivia Pursuit and the Name Game (although you all probably don't know our version of the Name Game...). And I even stayed up until midnight.  I've been thinkin' this weekend about my personality and there's no wonder Greg sometimes thinks I'm difficult. I like to be independent, but love to be with the people I love. I want to please people, especially people important to me, but I'm stubborn with lots of expectations.

      I like politics. I like religion. Somehow the two weave themselves into many, many issues. I even like the debates and hot-topic conversations. Stem-cell research -- an issue I've never taken much interest or cared to know anything about -- has its political and religious arguments. But for some reason it seems more about saving lives to me. But I can't figure out what I think about it. Selfishly, the though of a cure for diabetes seems worth almost anything. But is it risking any others' lives? If so, nobody should suffer in solving health problems. But what if the cells come from embryos donated to science that can't function in other capacities?  Goodness, it's a tough issue, but I thought I'd share this article about it from the May 17, 2004, issue of Time. One day I'm sure I'll develop an opinion on it all.   Katie Zucker, 16, has sky blue eyes, wild curly hair and a dazzling smile. She is a champion equestrian and an A student. Her parents are doting, her friends devoted. So what's not to envy? Well, there's the small rectangular box attached to her belt that pumps insulin through a tube into her hip. To test her blood, she pricks her finger seven times a day. "It's scary," she says. "If your blood sugar goes too low, you could go into a coma." Sometimes at school her eyes swell, and she can't see the blackboard. She knows that her diabetes can result in kidney failure, amputation and blindness. But mostly, she says, "I try to think it won't affect me too much in the future."  If there's any hope for a cure for Zucker and more than 1 million other Americans with Type 1 diabetes, the most debilitating form of the disease, it may lie in a revolutionary new field of research based on manipulating human embryonic stem cells. These building blocks of life, when isolated in a microscopic cluster of cells, can morph into any kind of tissue. (So-called adult stem cells, which can be harvested without sacrificing embryos, can turn into only a few tissue types.) One day, scientists hope, the entire genetic makeup of a patient like Zucker could be transferred into a cloned human egg that can produce the insulin-producing cells her body lacks.  But some religious groups believe the clumps of 100 to 200 cells from which embryonic stem cells are taken represent a potential human life as worthy of protection as any child's. Three years ago, President George W. Bush, under pressure from both sides, adopted a compromise that ended up choking off most federal research funds to the field. He said at the time that although the research offered "great promise" in saving lives, it could lead to "growing human beings for spare body parts."  Today a brush-fire challenge to Bush's stem-cell policy is spreading across the U.S., fueled by the frustration of such families as Zucker's who have allied themselves with patient activists for other diseases, major universities, several state legislatures and members of Congress. Last month 206 U.S. Representatives wrote to the President, calling on him to fund stem-cell research on spare embryos from a pool of some 400,000 stored in the freezers of in vitro fertilization clinics. These embryos, only a few days old and smaller than the head of a pin, will probably be discarded unless they are donated to science. Embryonic stem cells, the letter noted, can be used to treat "diseases that affect more than 100 million Americans, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury ..." The signatories included two dozen pro-life Republicans.  Given the emotional nature of the debate, the Bush White House is unlikely to make any sudden moves before the November election. But in a startling rebellion against the federal biomedical establishment, several states are moving forcefully into the vacuum. California and New Jersey have passed laws specifically authorizing the cloning of human eggs to create stem cells (so-called therapeutic cloning), and the legislatures of seven other states, including Illinois and New York, are considering similar bills. This week New Jersey Governor James McGreevey, in a nod to the state's pharmaceutical industry, will inaugurate a $50 million stem-cell institute to be funded with state and private money. In California, activists last month submitted 1.1 million signatures %97 nearly twice as many as necessary %97 to launch a November ballot measure that would underwrite stem-cell research with $3 billion in state bonds over 10 years. The California funds would dwarf federal grants, which have stalled at about $17 million a year for human embryonic research since Bush restricted funding to a few dozen pre-existing stem-cell lines. Only 19 of those turned out to be available. Says Stanford Nobel prizewinner Paul Berg: "California is paving the way for a revolt in a lot of other states."  Meanwhile, universities are maneuvering for position, fearing that they could lose their brightest scientists to programs overseas. It was only six years ago that a biologist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, James Thomson, isolated the first human stem cells from in vitro embryos. But in February, South Korean researchers stunned the scientific world by successfully harvesting stem cells from cloned human embryos %97 considered the most promising avenue for treating disease. A prestigious American investigator moved to Britain, where the research is encouraged. Now Stanford and Harvard hope to raise at least $100 million each for new stem-cell institutes. The universities of Wisconsin and Minnesota are expanding their labs, and in March an anonymous donor gave $25 million to the University of Texas to boost its Houston program.  Billions of dollars are at stake in the race for medical cures. California boasts half of the nation's biomedical research capacity and one-third of its biotech companies. The bond initiative, if it passes, would pay to build 12 to 15 new stem-cell research centers, a massive magnet for scientific talent. "California will be the center of stem-cell research for the world," predicts Palo Alto real estate developer Robert Klein, co-chairman of the initiative campaign. Klein, who has contributed $1.4 million of his money toward the effort, touts the economic benefits, forecasting $70 million in tax revenues from new jobs even before any cures are discovered. And if cures are found, the profits would accrue to California companies, along with substantial savings on the state's $114 billion annual health-care bill.  inances, however, have little to do with Klein's passion for the measure. Like Janet and Jerry Zucker, Katie's parents and the initiative's other chief organizers, Klein is the father of a diabetic, Jordan, 13. In addition, his mother, 84, has Alzheimer's. Distraught at the federal cutoff of stem-cell research, Klein and the Zuckers, who are Los Angeles film producers, were brought together last year by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, one of the nation's most forceful disease-advocacy groups. They hired a clutch of sophisticated lawyers and political consultants to draft the measure and conduct polls. They enlisted allies from Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, Parkinson's and other disease-advocacy groups and spent $2.5 million gathering signatures for the initiative. Ten Nobel prizewinners have endorsed the measure, including David Baltimore, president of the California Institute of Technology, and Berg, who created the first recombinant DNA molecule. Behind the scenes, Silicon Valley venture capitalists are backing what is expected to be a $20 million campaign.  It will certainly be a celebrity-studded crusade. Last Saturday, the Zuckers and other Hollywood notables were hosts of a Beverly Hills tribute to Nancy Reagan that raised $2 million for stem-cell research. The former First Lady, who took up the cause after her husband developed Alzheimer's, had earlier written to President Bush in favor of federal funding. But this is the first time Mrs. Reagan has spoken out publicly on the issue. Proponents of the California initiative hope that advocacy by an icon of the conservative movement will help neutralize resistance to the November bond measure.  Opponents have barely begun to organize. "We're not Hollywood producers," says Richard Doerflinger, spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. "We don't have the money they do." Nonetheless, he says, pro-life groups will explain to voters that embryonic stem-cell cloning is "unpromising for cures" and offers "a gateway to all kinds of possible genetic engineering in humans." Although the California measure would initially limit research to embryos less than 12 days old, Doerflinger contends it could lead to "the exploitation of women as 'fetus farms.'" Such arguments have persuaded eight states, including Iowa, Michigan and Kansas, to restrict therapeutic-cloning research. More dramatically, the U.S. House passed legislation last year that would make cloning human cells a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The bill stalled in the Senate, in part because of opposition from Utah Republican Orrin Hatch, who is antiabortion yet favors stem-cell research.  The initiative's backers plan to run a grass-roots operation urging the 5 million Californians who are members of disease-advocacy groups to e-mail friends and neighbors. A December poll commissioned by organizers showed that 85% of probable voters have a relative or close friend with one of five illnesses most likely to be a target of the research. The possibility of curing such afflictions as Alzheimer's and diabetes will be the focus of a multimillion-dollar statewide television campaign. "This is not a wedge issue," contends state senator Deborah Ortiz, who was attacked by Catholic Church officials, with little effect, for authoring the law to encourage stem-cell inquiry. "Ours will be a heartwarming message: that millions of people might be cured of diseases."  Whatever happens in California is likely to reverberate nationally. Already, breakthroughs in stem-cell science, published almost weekly in medical journals, are ratcheting up the stakes. If the initiative passes in the nation's largest state, "it will put tremendous pressure on the White House to re-evaluate its policy," predicts Daniel Perry, head of the Washington-based Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research. If it doesn't, scientists claim, the work will move to such research-friendly countries as Israel, Singapore and even China.  No one is more aware of the issues than Katie Zucker. A couple of years ago, she visited Congress with her parents to lobby for stem-cell research, and she plans to help generate support for the initiative. "I have dreams and goals in life," she says, fingering her insulin pump. "What keeps me going is that people are working so hard to find a cure."

      I like that this profile thing on here tells me that I've written 79,760 words in my blog. Although I guess that's ... 79,782 now.  Anyway, I'm glad it's Friday. It's been a busy, busy week at work. And I'm not really complaining about that because not only does it make the work day go faster but I also will have a nice bit of overtime on my paycheck. Yesterday Eric was gone to a meeting or something in Frankfort, so I had to put out the paper in the morning. I was a bit nervous because that's not my strength in this job. But, I have to say, it went much smoother than I expected. And the front page looks alright. Mission accomplished, I suppose.   I'm looking forward to a weekend hanging around here... Play cards. Grill out. Yard sale. It's about the simple things in life, really.  I don't know if anybody cares, but the diabetes update would be it's been a really good week. My blood sugar levels have been consistently good and I actually had to eat a cookie this morning because my blood sugar was slightly low. Not that low is a good thing, but it's a change from the high-causing headaches. And because it was only slightly low, it was easy to fix.

      I apologized to Brian at work for flippin' out when he mentioned insulin shock. He doesn't know me very well, as most people at work, so he had no idea I feel challenged by diabetes sometimes. When I talked to him a few minutes ago, he told me he thought I was upset at him, and I hate that because it had nothing to do with him and everything to do with a mystery that consumes me sometimes. He asked if he could go ahead and tell me the story he was going to tell me...  His stepdad's blood sugar dropped to 20 last night. He passed out. That's scary stuff, but it's comforting to know it has more to do with him not properly managing the diabetes than just a random scare. That's the thing about the so-called horror stories some people tell me -- usually it's a matter of not making good decisions. Usually.  I've been listening to Glen Phillips... It's relaxing.    The water's getting deeper and I can't feel my feet I keep on bailing buckets but it flows right back to me And everything is put away, the children are asleep but the water's getting deeper and I can't feel my feet  How am I gonna make time This is gonna take time  Everything looks different, colors all seem strange Light comes down in shafts here underneath the waves...  I am provider, but providence has been swayed And by design nothing is ever the same I thought that time had only one way to go I learned how to swim, but not to breathe underwater...  -It Takes Time

      When I was in the hospital in January, Ann, the diabetes educator, told me I seemed tough. Not that it's ever good for someone to have diabetes, but when someone is disciplined and tough, it's easier for them than some others. I think I was scared then. I don't think I'm so tough. I am easily broken. I have headaches a lot, and sometimes that makes me cry. This morning was one of those touchy days because I get frustrated that while I doing everything I know how, I continue to have flunctuating blood sugar levels and headaches. But I was dealing with it -- until someone at work decided to tell me about his dad going into insulin shock, and I'm not even sure what that means. But it doesn't sound good. While I never like to hear diabetes horror stories, today was especially not the day. He (and I know it's not his fault...) didn't get out one sentence when I jumped up from my desk in tears. I really should have more control over my emotions than that, but there is this fear inside that takes away any control I be able to muster up.  But I feel better now. Thanks to a chat with Michael and a release of thoughts on here. Good thing because I have several things to do at work today -- MSU athletes in court at two different times today, a planning commission meeting at 5 and a fiscal court meeting at 7. Surely I can keep my emotions in check and move on with my day.

      Here's a deep question to ponder:  Your hand has been replaced by a rubber stamp. What does it say?   Mine would say: One time... (Then I'd proceed with a random story because I'm good with on-demand stories whether the person with whom I'm conversing cares or not.)  I'm going on a cruise from June 3-15, in case anybody (among that mass of faithful readers, and all) has missed that. I've been asked a couple of times where we're going and I can never remember to specifics. Here are the destinations: Athens, Delphi, Thessalonica, Mykonos, Ephesus, Patmos, Rhodes, Crete, Santorini, Corinth, Rome and Vatican City. Istanbul (not Constantinople) was on the list until the cruise company decided that might be a little risky given the current state of international affairs. Trust me, there will be plenty more to tell because I plan on keeping a travel journal.   The fact I came home from work a bit past 4 and almost immediately put on a tank top and pajama pants tells you my big plans for the evening. They don't involve leaving the house, for sure. I've decided from 5 to 6 p.m. is the worst hour of TV. Anyway, The Inferno and CSI:Miami come on tonight. Until then, I may clean up a little. Speaking of cleaning up, I was walking around the house this afternoon thinking about how some days I wish we had tons of money so we could do lots of little projects to this house. Then I remember that I don't really like those kind of things and that we don't have lots of money. Then I am thankful living in a perfect is house is one of the few things I'm not high-maintenance about. That's not to say I like a messy house; Greg knows that's far from the truth. I like cleanliness and organizations, but I can deal with other imperfections. This summer I would like to paint the attic, which is a nasty shade of pale green now, complete with a light pink bathroom. (And I mean bathroom, as in the sink, walls and floor. At least the toilet and tub are white.) I think we could afford that, as well as tearing up the carpet in the bathroom (Who puts carpet in the bathroom?) and putting some tile or something down. That's a short list, if I would just take the time to initiate.  I've been thinking lately when I am pregnant (emphasis: WHEN), I don't want to find out the baby's sex. Yes, that's coming from the perfectionist planner who thrives on details and developing expectations. I almost think it would be good for me not to know. But, then again, it would be hard. How fun would it be, though, to be surprised. People ask, how would you decorate and buy clothes and such. Well, I've always wanted my baby's room to be in bright, primary colors, so that works for either a boy or girl. And I suppose my child would begin its life with a bunch of yellow clothes. And names? We'd just have to choose a boy's name and a girl's name, which should be too hard because I already have my girl named Catherine Anna, to be called Cate. The boy's is harder for us to agree on. I like Jacob and Isaac, especially Isaac because it means "laughter." But I have awhile, thankfully, on this subject. There are just several babies around me, so it's been on the brain a little more than usual.  I like blogging because it's my world on here. I can ramble and babble, repeat myself, whine, be silly, and none of it matters because it's my blog. Others are invited in, even to comment on the randomness now that I figured that out, but how long they stay and how often they return is totally up to them. In the meantime, I'll entertain myself.

      ...at work on a Monday morning but wishin' I wasn't. Work is alright, and most days I even like my job. But I worked 47 hours last week, including more than 12 on Friday and just a bit on Saturday. Then Greg and I went to Louisville on Saturday afternoon. My aunt Kim from New Jersey was in town for the weekend, so it was fun to see her. She's my mom's sister and they two are quite funny together. The older I get, the more I act like them. Mom cooked dinner for everyone -- Poppy, Kim, Greg and I, Cassie and Zac, Kevin and Laine -- Saturday night. And Milla entertained us. She's the most beautiful girl, and such a well-behaved baby. Saturday we did some shopping (I got a few things for my upcoming vacation...) and then ate dinner at Buckhead. Yummy. We also got some Krispy Kremes. I hadn't had a doughnut since January. And while I shouldn't eat them all of the time, it's nice and tasty every now and then.   I think I might become addicted to Law and Order. Speaking of shows that are on every night of the week, tonight CSI: Miami goes to New York to introduce that new group. I might have to abandon Horatio and the others if the New York CSI is better. As much as I love TV, I don't need to be so addicted to it. That's part of my personality, though. Like that makes it OK.

      I've been complaining lately about high blood sugar levels. They haven't been anything even close to how high they were when I was admitted to the hospital in January, but they've often risen too high for my liking given me plenty of headaches. Anyway, this morning I woke up early with the intention to exercise (ride the exercise bike). I decided I should check my blood sugar first, knowing exercise directly impacts those numbers. I was low. Yes, that's the complete opposite of the previous problem. Until this morning, I have only experienced a low when I didn't eat enough carbohydrates when I took my fast-acting insulin at a meal. Never random like this. Alright, so I corrected it. I went on with my morning and then about three hours after I ate breakfast I was feeling a little shaky again. I check my blood sugar, and again it was low. Random. So I ate some cheese and crackers. A couple hours later before lunch, it was risen to higher than what I'd like... If it's not one problem, it seems to be another. I guess that's part of the mystery. But it's hard to manage when I can't figure out why the sudden lows and then why it rises in the afternoon. Yesterday I was really motivated to start exercising, more for the long-term benefit, but days like today scare me from introducing a new variable.   I met with the hospital CEO today. Just an off-the-record sort of meet-and-greet because he's fairly new to the community and I'm new to the hospital beat for work. We just talked about some of the current drama and fiscal situation at the hospital. He asked me what I thought about some things and actually seemed to listen to my perspective, as an outsider. Apparently he didn't think the last reporter who covered the hospital board and other related affairs was getting the important stories out. And from the little I know first hand, she wasn't. The hospital is important in any community, but it is even more so in a community like Murray, where lots of the same people are involved in different things and the community takes a pride and ownership in its organizations. I just wanted to meet with him when neither of us had a specific agenda -- for me that would be a list of questions to which I'm seeking answers and for him that could be a variety of PRish moves. He seemed opened and honest and said things I'm certain he wouldn't want published in the newspapers. Community journalism is a funny thing in that I've worked here not-quite nine months and I have people who trust me. Another guy involved with the hospital board (among other things, including the local Republican Party) called me trustworthy and professional. That's totally a compliment, and that's what I like about working here. The newspapers office itself is bearable, but I like the community and the people I get to work with. And I like that I've built relationships to the point that when the hospital wasn't happy with its relationship with the newspaper, its leaders sought me out.   So, I voted for Rupert to win the audience-choice reward of a $1 million on Survivor. My first instinct was to go ahead with Boston Rob. He ruled that game. But I decided he's marrying the original $1 million winner. Plus Rupert played the game well both this time and his original show, which actually meant he played back-to-back seasons. He's a good guy and it's probably fair to give someone else a crack at the prize. We'll see tonight, but I think Rupert has it wrapped up. As much as I liked this season, I sure hope they don't do this audience-pick-'em after the game's tribal council and reward two winners. It's nice for this one because it was so emotion- and drama-packed, but I hope CBS goes back to the original one-time reward with the next season. This twist of the game is a bit too American Idol-ish.

      Change is suppose to be good for me. Makes me stronger and more adaptable. And freaks me out along the way. Still, I'm learning to accept new things and realize sometimes good things only get better.   This new blog appearance is a good start. I even set it up so my faithful readers, whomever they may be, can comment on my randomness. I also added titles to the blog entries. They remind me of subject lines of an email, which I used to be really good at creating. But, then again, they are sort of like headlines to a news article, which I'm not so good at creating.

      I got to see KatieKerns yesterday. A few minutes more than an hour is not enough time to catch up with one of my favorite people in the world. Catch up might not be the right words. We email and talk on the phone, but this was the first time I've seen her since September. She and I grew up living next door to each other, and used to know exactly how many steps it was from her house to mine. We spent a lot of time wishing we'd grow up, so we could drive instead of ride our bikes. Her quiet house was an escape from my family's hectic household. We liked to go to Dairy Queen in the convertible. She's the reason I like country music and have tendencies to like to shop. Her parents moved from Mockingbird Valley subdivision to Pennslyvania after Katie graduated from high school, when I was already at Murray State. It made seeing her more difficult, but she went to college at UK, so at least were in the same state. We didn't do a good job of keeping in touch in college, but whenever we talked it was like we were sitting on one of our front porches in the neighborhood again, probably drinking Dr Pepper and eating Circus Peanuts or Hometown Pizza. She was in my wedding, I was in hers. The best was last year when Greg and I lived in Lexington, she and Brad did too. They live in Boston now, but I'm working my persuasive powers to talk them into moving to Nashville, where Brad is considering going to school. Plus, they are both into music, and there are so many musical opportunities there. And they'd be closer to me. But not just me. They'd be closer to his family in Tennessee and her family in Owensboro and Lexington. I mean, anything is closer compared to Boston. She brought me a sea shell from Boston, from some unknown cape, on a pretty pink ribbon for my birthday. Katie and I used to talk about how much we hated pink, but we both have since come to terms with loving it. She wrote me a sweet birthday card that made me want to cry. But that's OK because when I hugged her yesterday at Applebee's, she got teary-eyed. I used to have this idealistic thought that my friends today would be the friends for the rest of my life. Cara, Kelly and I used to talk about being fake aunts to each other kids and all going on parent vacations... I love Cara and Kelly for their influence in my life, but I don't know about being friends forever in the childish sense of the phrase. It may be months between telephone conversations with Katie and I, but I know we have a bond that goes beyond anything, even Boston or diabetes, as she put it in a recent email.

      All weekend I've been making mental notes about what I wanted to write about on here...  First, I spent several hours Friday night at a party thing for John, Greg's youngest brother. He graduated Saturday from Murray State. Greg's family is incredibly sentimental, which is the complete opposite from my family. Anyway, they make events a lot of people take for granted special. Sweet, yeah, I suppose. But sometimes I just feel out of place because it's so foreign to anything my family ever does. During the get together Friday night I thought about how I'm really in the middle. I'm not either of our families' extremes, and that's probably why I can get along with both sides. Plus, I'm a people-pleaser and perfectionist, so I try to hard to keep the people I love happy. Peggy put together a video chronically John's life, but that of course included video of Greg. They were the cutest boys. It's fun to look back on the part of his life I don't know first hand. I also reminds me that Greg's heart is deeply rooted in solid values and he's going to make a fabulous father -- one day.  Saturday was a busy day. We watched John graduate then went to lunch with Greg's family. Greg's Little League team played back-to-back games in the afternoon. I watched the first one but opted out of the second because I was sunburned and frustrated with high blood sugar levels. I covered a fund-raiser for Ken Winters' senate campaign Saturday night. That's alright, though, because some of my favorite Republicans were there.   More Taylor family time on Sunday. After church, we met his family at Ryan's, maybe the worst restaurant in Murray, for a Mother's Day lunch. There were 18 of us there, counting baby Elijah, and I'm sure the loud voices annoyed those smaller parties sitting in the same room. But we had a good time. I had my moments of productivity with laundry, dishes and grocery shopping. We also went to see "Laws of Attraction." It was cute. Divorce lawyers falling love has a bit of irony to it.   I also wanted to write -- solely for therapeutic purposes -- about my perfectionist personality and how that is a blessing and a curse with having diabetes. But that's not news to anyone. The mystery is why I can't let go of some of my anal retentiveness and realize I don't have complete control over my body. I can be disciplined, thanks perfectionism, with this disease, but there are still going to be so-called bad days. I freaked out, yes, again, Sunday morning. I used to think being in a dark forest by myself was the scariest situation, but this far surpasses that. I was babbling about the possibility -- I should emphasize POSSIBILITY -- of having health problems when I'm older because my body is more vulnerable with diabetes and Greg put it all into perspective for me. He said he was more worried about me driving myself crazy by the time I was 35 than having heart or kidney problems when I'm 70. He's right, I let it dictate my mood way too much. I need to relax and have faith that I will learn and change and be a stronger person because of this.   Alright, I'll keep my Survivor comments to a minimum... Rob didn't technically get the million dollars, but he has the girl who did. I'm glad they weren't totally playing each other as they played the game. Their flirting and alliance was strategy in the beginning, but in the end he proposed on national television while she wore a shirt proclaiming her love for him. Ah, how sweet. It's a game, totally, but people's emotions do become involved, and that's why the show, particularly this season, was so appealing to me.

      Words about words from Ralph Waldo Emerson:   Be a little careful about your library. Do you foresee what you will do with it? Very little to be sure. But the real question is, What it will do with you? You will come here and get books that will open your eyes, and your ears, and your curiosity, and turn you inside out or outside in.  Use what language you will, you can never say anything but what you are.  In conversation, the game is to say something new with old words.

      The Survivor contestants are so-called all-stars but they are letting Boston Rob run the game. That cracks me up and, just for that, I hope Boston Rob takes home $1 million. Factor in the girl. Amber and Rob have something going on. The question is, how authentic is it? Is he playing her as a way to win the game? Is her strategy to play Rob as she plays the game? I think there's more chance she's fooling him, but I still think there's really some romantic interest. Either way, their "relationship" will play into the outcome of the game. If they are the final two, she's got the game won.   Poor Big Tom. He didn't see that one coming, and neither did i. I don't know why these all-star players didn't try to break up the alliances that are as plain as day. Jenna and Rupert have an alliance and Rob and Amber have ... whatever it is they have. Big Tom seemed to be with Rob and Amber for some unknown reason, but really they all just stabbed him in the back. Good thing it's just a game, and that's how Tom apparently sees it.  Rob and Amber both won cars last night and had a "date" at the drive-in movie set up. Ahh, how sweet. I didn't know if it was smart strategy on Rob's part to take Amber on his reward challenge reward (is that redundant?), but the move didn't seem to hurt him last night. She was even wearing his dirty, sweaty Boston Red Sox hat in the episode. That must be love.  I read about a class at some college (vague, I know, especially for someone who thrives on details...) that studies organizational management and relationships by watching Survivor every Thursday night. Fabulous. I took several organizational communication classes and we didn't get to watch Survivor. Although we did get to watch "When Harry Met Sally..." in one of my classes and then wrote papers about interpersonal communication and gender difference in verbal and non-verbal communication. I'm such a nerd.  My random diabetes note of the day: Thank God for a normal blood sugar level this morning, unlike the rest of the week because of some unknown overnight factor that causes high numbers. Now if it will only stay that way through the rest of the day, I'd be a happy camper.

      I've read several articles about "Friends" ending... Don't ask why I read several; they are all basically the same. But Herald-Leader pop culture writer Heather Svokos spoke a little more to me about it all, and maybe that's because I think she's a neat lady. We bonded some when I worked there. Anyway, she wrote:   When we form true friendships, we typically settle in, revel in the moments that bring joy. We usually don't spend much time dwelling on the reality that, one day, things are bound to change for good.  Maybe someone gets married.  Someone has a baby.  Someone moves to the 'burbs.  That's what makes tonight so sad. A perfectly good fantasy gets busted up by a dang-blasted reflection of reality.   "Friends" is one of those shows, like Seinfeld, that is fabulous on rerun but I never watched much of during its primetime slot. Still, I'm going to record tonight's finale while I'm watching my favorite shows on CBS. It is nice to know even the six Friends have to move on like the rest of us, however much it does sometimes suck.

      Alright, so I feel better about life.  But first I must say that it took another bout with frustration to reach this calming point. I tried to two days to get some lab results faxed to me so I could take them with me to my doctor's appointment this afternoon. Couldn't get them. Couldn't get them. Got them. A few hours before my appointment. The nurse lady, though, tells me my cholesterol is high. Too high. I really should take some medicine for that, she says the endocrinologist recommends. Hold on, let me talk to my primary doctor first. Plus, I gave more blood this morning at the different lab, and was fasting like I was suppose to, so let's see what those numbers say...  In the meantime, I stay at work, finishing up some things. But am pretty preoccupied with the fact I could have heart disease later in life. Yeah, jumping to hypothetical conclusions, I know. But, still, I try so hard not to think about long-term complications that I am automatically at a higher risk for just because I have diabetes. Heart disease, kidney problems, eye problems, feet problems...Problems, problems, problems, as if diabetes isn't problem enough. Anyway, the whole principle is if I keep my blood sugar levels regulated in the "normal" range, I will be at less risk for such things...  Dr. Mangold says my cholesterol is slightly high. But I've known I've had diabetes (It's all connected, you know?), so let's give it a few more months and see if it isn't better then. THEN maybe I'll need some medicine. I'm not necessarily opposed to taking medicine. BUT I also know tons of things have changed in my body and I really need to be patient and let some things get settled before I add other variables.   I didn't think the doctor's appointment was going to do much for me today, but it really helped give me some peace that I understand diabetes. Well, not totally understand it because it's a mystery, but understand enough to feel like I have some control over it rather than it totally monopolizing my life. Um, I still wish it wasn't me dealing with this, but I do believe everything happens for a reason and will work out for the better in the end. That's the hope I hold in my pocket. And thanks goes to Greg and Michael who have listened to me be scared and frustrated multiple times the last two days.   I love "Love Actually." It's hilarious and cleverly weaves several plots together for a broader point. Hugh Grant is adorable, but all the characters are developed so well, even if they are quirky. To me, it's about love -- Love is actually all around -- and all the shapes and sizes it takes on for different people. There's committed love. There's friendship love. There's passionate love and intense lust. There's romantic love and helping love. Sometimes you mourn losing love. Sometimes you rejoice in falling in love. New love. Old love. Fresh love that makes you squirm. Routine love that keeps you balanced. It's amazing, really, how relationships are more complicated than they appear on the surface. Relationships go through phases and with those come different types of love for the same person. Relationships are hard sometimes, but in the end love wins. Other times love makes relationships seems easy. There's a lot of juxtaposition in love.   "Love Actually" takes all of this, at least to me, and makes it funny. There's a couple moments in the movie that make my heart cringe. But most of the two hours I spent laughing. Good thing I have this movie on DVD because there are some quotable moments I haven't gotten down yet.

      Doctors, hospitals and health insurance are frustrating. It's annoying when I try to call my doctor in Louisville to get her office to fax results from blood work to my doctor in Murray and I can't even get a hold of a person. Silly automatic answering. Then I get a real, live person but she says the person I need to talk to isn't in, but she will get right back with me. Right. That was four hours ago. So, putting a long, uninteresting story aside, I have to go get blood work again this afternoon before my doctor's appointment tomorrow, even though I had the same tests done a week and a half ago in Louisville. And I'm sure I'll have to pay part of whatever it costs for the two minutes I'll be in there. And, really, how pleasant is it when blood is drawn? Who cares that they always say I have "good" veins from which to draw blood. Good for them, I suppose. Not so good for me, unless it makes it a little more comfortable. I was going to go to the hospital after I ate my lunch, but then I looked at the blood work request thing from Dr. Mangold and it said I needed to do with when my blood sugar levels were at "fasting," meaning not right after I ate. So, I'm going to try to go there before my meeting this afternoon.   I also would really like it if someone would explain to me why I have a near-perfect week of blood sugar levels last week and then wake up yesterday and today with high numbers. And I have strange feeling my doctor isn't going to be able to tell me tomorrow. I'm as disciplined as I know how to be about this, yet there are so many unknowns and I continue to have headaches every day. So much remains a mystery to me, and that alone is frustrating. But I go back to the Bebo Norman song I love:   ...But I am not afraid No I am not afraid  And I will not go crazy  I got a little hope here in my pocket Want to share of it with you Just be careful that you dont drop it Dont worry if you do Cause Ive got voices down inside me And I might just need some help I will get by Hey, hey...   Alright, moving on to more pleasant topics... I ate lunch at the park this afternoon. I ran by Quizno's and picked up a sandwich and then went to the park. I spread out my fuzzy UK blanket and enjoyed the lovely weather and my tasty (or toasty) sandwich. I read some of my book, too. Usually I hate to eat lunch by myself, but with those circumstances, I loved every minute of the peace and quiet. Maybe I'll do that more this summer. It calms me. (Yeah, I know it didn't sound like in the previous paragraphs, where I was whining about medical things.)

      An update is due... Although I don't know if this is the best time because our computer at home is making a funny humming sound. I sure hope it doesn't explode. My computer at work used to make a similar sound when it was "thinking," so I probably shouldn't worry because it never exploded or anything. Greg thinks we need -- is need really the right word? -- a new computer. I can think of better things to do with our money. We'll see.  So, the weekend was great. First, it's May, and that's just fabulous on its own. Although I haven't seen many May flowers; it's been more about April showers. And it's not even April anymore.   Friday night we played Rook with Greg's parents. I wish we had more friends who played cards, actually.    Saturday we left about 8 a.m. for St. Louis. It was cloudy and overcast in Murray. It was rainy and cloudy on the way to St. Louis. And it was rainy in St. Louis. Lovely day, weather wise, for the beginning of May. (I'm not really obsessed with months and weather, although I'm aware by reading my blog lately that wouldn't appear to be the case...) We went to eat at the Old Spaghetti Factory. I think the last time I ate there was in Louisville in January 2002 a few hours after Greg proposed. (There goes my random stories...) Anyway, it was closed when we got there. Who knew it didn't open until 3 on Saturday. So we went to Landry's Seafood at Union Station...and it was fabulous. Jaclyn had recommended it before, but she loves the steak. I had grilled salmon...yummy. It was nice, too, because we don't usually eat at places that expensive. It was for my birthday, or at least that was a good excuse. Then we did some shopping at Union Station. We each bought a long-sleeved T-shirt because the rain apparently wasn't going away and we were going to a baseball game later. Anyway, then we acted like tourists and went up to the top of the arch. Greg also toured the museum there. I did briefly, but I really spent more time reading some books in the store. I bought my mom a Lewis and Clark book with gorgeous pictures from places on their westward journey,some journal excerpts and history about them and a double deck of cards with pictures of the arch and its construction. Random? I know. She likes American history a lot (That's what being a fifth-grade teacher will do to you.) and plays bridge twice a month with friends. So random becomes appropriate. Apparently Greg Maddux went up in the arch a couple of hours before us, at least that's what the ticket man said. I get a little star struck with celebrities.   Then it was off to the baseball game. It was in the high 40s or so when the game started and dropped as the innings went on. I was wearing a T-shirt, a long-sleeved T-shirt, a sweater jacket thing and a rain jacket. Oh, but I had on jeans, unlike my husband who was wearing shorts. (The lesson: Listen to your wife when she says it's suppose to rain and be colder, even if she didn't know exactly what colder meant.) It was OK, but I got cold, also because I was damp from walking around in the drizzle a few times during the day. Our seats, ironically thankfully, were in the third to last row. We were sitting near LOTS of Cubs fans, but we were dry. The Cubs won 4-2, but at least the Cardinals won two of the four games this weekend. (Side note: On Friday night, the Cubs bullpen shot themselves in the foot -- or arm in this case -- and walked four straight batters in the bottom of the ninth of a tied game. Yes, the winning run was walked in for St. Louis. A win is a win.)   So, if you recall from a recent entry, I want to write a book about baseball stadium. Not so much about baseball, but moreso about the people who make stadiums have the culture they have. So, after sitting in a slightly rain-delayed game in cold weather at Busch Stadium Saturday night, this is who and what I'd want to write about there: the 18 people who work on the field, especially about rolling and unrolling the tarp in nasty weather so these over-paid athletes have a nice field on which to play; the person who manually changes the scoreboard with not only that game's numbers but also those for other MLB games going on; and the ball boys, especially in this case the one who slipped on the wet field when he tried to pick up a foul ball to throw to a fan.   Moving on from baseball and St. Louis... Sunday we celebrated my birthday. My mom, Cassie and Zac came to Murray to go to Greg's parents' house with us for lunch. Our families are night-and-day different, so it's always slightly awkward when my mom is hanging out with them. I say always, but we've only all gotten together a few times. And when I saw all, I usually mean my mom and I with Greg's family. It seems to get more comfortable each time, and I just keep in mind how intimidating and obnoxious I thought Greg's dad was at first. Now, I'm totally fine with him and understand him tons better. His mom and I clicked fairly quickly because we're a lot alike. (I just hope when we have kids we have at least a girl among a couple boys so I don't raise only boys like she did.) Greg's mom made a fabulous lunch and bought me a low-carb cheesecake from Dumplin's. (It's yummy, really? Ask my friends who were lucky enough to share it.) We were also sort of celebrating Greg's birthday because we were in Louisville for his last week. It's sort of fun to have birthdays 10 days apart.   I got some pretty great presents. My mom got me some clothes -- two skirts and a cute shirt -- and a handy travel bag (conveniently for my cruise, which I leave for a month from today...) and my dad and grandpa gave me money. I got some gift certificates to the scrapbooking store, Vintage Rose, Cracker Barrel and Pier 1. I got a dictionary, shower radio, "Love Actually" on DVD and a fabulous-smelling cucumber and canteloupe candle. I got some funny cards -- one about a frog, one with a lengthy lawyer disclaimer and one about a fake ID -- and a dumb card, but that deserves no futher comment. I also got some other cards and notes, including one from my birthday twin Katie Mitchell. The thing is I really like to do things for other people's birthday, mainly because it's a good excuse to buy presents and cards. So it's sweet when people think about me.   I've been thinking about this whole used-to-be-a-morning-person things. I'm totally a morning person now. I don't dread going to work at 7 a.m. and don't cringe when my alarm goes off at 5:30 a.m. Of course, that means I'm ready for bed by 9 p.m. It's quite a transformation considering my prime sleeping hours used to from 1 a.m. to 9 or 10 a.m. Oh, well, I guess that's life. But, with my birthday, I've been thinking I was destined to be a morning person. I was born at 4 or 4:30 a.m. That's early, just ask my mom. Maybe it just took me almost 25 years (or, as Greg says, a quarter century) to get there.   Alright, enough about my birthday. Although, it's funny because as much as I hate to be the center of attention in groups, I love my birthday. Still, I don't like it so much when people sing "Happy Birthday," although I appreciated the couple of emails I got today featuring my friends singing, um, typing, the song to me. Oh, one more birthday story: We were going to go to Tom's Grille at lunch. Greg picked me up from work to be sweet and then we went there. But it was closed. That's twice in three days we chose a restaurant we don't usually eat at that wasn't opened during normal eating hours. So much for going outside the box. Although, we ate Mexican at Los Portales, where I haven't been in awhile.  A fellow reporter at work told me today she's quitting in two weeks, well, two weeks from last Friday. It's interesting because I recently took over one of her beats, the hospital board. I didn't really mind because I'm a nerd and like meetings to an extent. I also think meetings are one of the easier things to cover because I just go there and the information is presented to me. Usually, if I have an follow-up questions, the right people are there to talk to following the meeting. Anyway, now that's she's leaving May 14, I wonder if I'll get a lot of her other crap to do. She does more page layout and the rest of us news reporters (that would be me and another guy). That's far from my favorite thing to do at a newspaper, so I'm hoping that doesn't fall on me, but I'm expecting some of it to. We'll see. I sure wish I knew someone who wanted a reporter job in Murray.   Thank God the computer hasn't blown up yet.

      Seriously, how hard can it be to write a story about a circus coming to town?   MACON, Ga. (AP)  A reporter for The Macon Telegraph has resigned after editors determined that a story he wrote about the circus coming to town was plagiarized from a weekly circus newsletter, the newspaper said. The resignation came three months after a Telegraph reporter was fired for lifting material from other publications.

      ...at least that's what the local law enforcement agencies want us to believe.   On that note, here's a funny story from Greg's Aunt Jennifer who recently moved back to Murray from Memphis and is looking for a job. She hopes to do some counseling/social work, but has filled out her paperwork to substitute teach. To substitute teach, she has to get fingerprinted and have a background check. That involves going to the sheriff's department or the police station. Here's what she told me last night:  She went to the sheriff's department first, but they told her the guy who fingerprints people was busy. But she got the feeling he wasn't there or just didn't want to do his job. Regardless of the reason, she realized it would take awhile, so she left for the police station. When she got there, just down the street from the sheriff's department, an officer told her they didn't have any ink. OK, right, because the police never actually arrest anyone. So she went back to the sheriff's department. Persistent. She told them the police said they didn't have any ink and the dispatcher there said she knew the police had ink because the sheriff took it over there recently. Jennifer asked if they'd inform their fellow law enforcement agency of the truth. So the dispatcher called and said just that -- "You have ink. The sheriff gave it to you." Jennifer went back to the police station, where she was fingerprinted, at last. Although while doing so, the officer said, "You know, this isn't the ink we usually use." Who cares, I would have been thinking, act like you have some idea of what's going on.   These are the people who protect us.

      I've been having some conflict -- well, not real conflict, but conflict in my head -- with Greg's dad. He's just been acting in this way that makes me think he doesn't care for me to be around. It's deeper and more complicated than that, but that's the brief explanation of something I started thinking on our vacation. Then I read this today, maybe it's some advice I'm suppose to take:   Don't take it personally. Whatever happens, remember that your in-laws' actions more likely stem from deep-seated beliefs and behavior patterns than from something you did or said.

      We went to see "The Terminal" Friday night. I liked it, but I don't think it will be one I watch again. It's quirky, though, in a good way. Then I had to go back to work for awhile to finish my story about the kidnapping incident that began in our office parking lot Friday morning. I finally talked to the newspaper carrier whose 2-year-old was kidnapped when an acquaintance drove off in her car. Long story, but my publisher was overly worried The Paducah Sun would have a better story than me. Her exact words: "The Paducah Sun better not have a better story than you." A threat, I suppose, but I'm not sure what the consequence would have been. You see, my editor gave The Paducah Sun reporter the carrier's home phone number, and that made Alice mad. I had the carrier's number, but hadn't been able to get in touch with her yet. Drama. The outcome: The Paducah Sun reporter only talked to the police. I talked to the police, the carrier, the woman who witnessed the kidnap suspect leaving the child on the side of the road and a witness from work who saw the car drive off. Regardless, I'm sure Alice will find something else not to be happy about come Monday.   I went to some yard sales Saturday morning with Greg's mom. I found two pair of jeans for $5 each. Then we had a girly lunch at Dumpin's. I spent the afternoon doing some laundry and catching up on some laziness while I watched five episodes of "The Real World." The San Diego finale is Tuesday and these were some I hadn't seen from the beginning. Then I worked from 4:45 to 9 p.m. covering some political events. I'm a nerd, though, so I didn't mind. Although Jim Bunning, the Hall of Fame pitcher turned U.S. senator with some other stops in between, didn't impress me. I really don't think my vote will keep him from being re-elected to a second term, but I think I'll vote for the Democrat. Bunning seemed to think every journalist is Al Cross from The Courier-Journal. At one point he was standing there sort of by himself and I introduced myself, he seemed less than interested. And that's fine, really, but then I was trying to take some candid pictures of him meeting people, thinking that would be better than just a picture of him speaking, but every time he saw me, he intentionally turned the other way. It's really OK because when I met Dan Mongiardo earlier this year when he was campaigning in Murray, I liked him and thought he had some good ideas on healthcare.

      So my new favorite author is Rick Bragg. I thought he was a reporter for The New York Times, but apparently it is accurate to say he is a former reporter for the paper at which he worked when he won the Pulitzer-Prize for feature writing. Some drama about a dateline and having an intern do the reporting for a story, probably many storiese, led to his resignation about a year ago. Oh well, I still think he's a fabulous writer. And others must think so too because he did write that Jessica Lynch story called "I'm A Soldier Too."

      I wanted to be a writer because of Rochelle Riley. She didn't teach me how to write, but she taught me to find stories in everyone and everywhere. She taught me to create pictures with words and phrases. She taught me communicate my thoughts honestly and openly on paper. When I was a senior in high school I participated in a workshop for high school journalism students at The Courier-Journal. It was her project because she likes to teach kids about writing, and ultimately about life. We produced this newspaper that focused on high school-related issues. In it she wrote about each of us who had been part of the workshop, explaining the purpose and a little about who we were. She gave me the best compliment in that article: She said I reminded her of herself because I worked hard but knew laughing was good for me. (She, of course, worded it better than that, but that was the gist of it.) Then she said something about how she could see me with a desk one day next to hers. She didn't have to say those things. She could have just said I knew how to use commas and apostrophes and run spell check.  Rochelle used to be a columnist for The Courier-Journal, but now she writes for The Detroit Free-Press. I've never been to Detroit, but she takes me there when I read her columns online. She has a book of columns from Louisville and now one from Detroit. And she's working on a novel. I can't wait to read it.   She called me today. A month or two ago she emailed me and asked me for my phone number. Well, I emailed her and hadn't heard back. Apparently she saved my phone number in her cell phone as "K," and was trying to figure out who it belonged to. When I answered my phone, she explained all of this, and then she realized it was me. I was driving in my car, already going the wrong way to where I was suppose to be going, so I was a bit distracted, but it was so good to hear from her. She told me she's going to send me a chapter of her novel. I really hope she does because I'm sure it would inspire me. Inspire is a cheesy word, but, really, that's what she does for me. Even her emails make me want to be a writer. A real writer. And here I am bloggin' about her. I wrote a story about her in college for a feature writing class. The assignment, as best as I can remember it, was to write about a person, maybe just any person, I'm not sure. Anyway, I really wish I could find it. I was actually looking for it recently.   So our conversation was brief. She was working on a column looking for a cell phone number when she stumbled upon "K" and was curious. She told me about her daughter who is now 15 and needed to be reminded of my married name. I told her Taylor. She said, "Kristin Hill Taylor, sounds like a writer's name." I hope she's right.

      Journalism isn't a business filled with people -- bosses or sources -- giving compliments. So when they come, they are nice to hear. I wrote a story about an education professor at Murray State who competed in the pentathlon in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Last week he went to St. Louis, where Jackie Joyner-Kersee lit the cauldron with the torch. It just made for a nice local feature in connection with the Olympics. He was a funny guy and fun to talk with. Yesterday he called and thanked me for writing the story and then this morning his wife called and thanked me again, saying how much they enjoyed it. It's nice when people call when they have something nice to say because more often it is the quite the opposite with people either wanting something or complaining. The other thing that made me appreciate the compliments is I actually enjoyed writing the story. Too often I write court and police news that takes no creativity. This story gave me some room to actually write. And it even inspired me to write a column about Athens, where I just visited, and how I saw the city and country as a whole preparing for the Olympics, which are returning to where they began after more than 100 years.

      When I have kids, I really hope they want to play sports. I lacked some hand-eye coordination and endurance athletes need, so I became a nerd. While that's not all bad, I sure hope our kids have some of both worlds. I went to Greg's Little League game (He coaches a team of 13- to 15-year-old boys.) and thought about how fun it would be to go to baseball, basketball and soccer games if our kids were playing. I guess football would be OK, too, but that might make me more nervous. Anyway, the game didn't start until a little after 9, so I was at the ballpark until 11 p.m. or so, but enjoyed myself. Ballparks also are places for social gatherings in communities like Murray. And that's OK, too. I ran into Beth Brockman last night. She was my high school guidance counselor and moved to Murray the same year I started college here. It's nice to see a familiar face who knew me when...  Michael brought snickerdoodles to work today. I love snickerdoodles. Both saying the word and eating the cookies. They remind me of middle school, where the cafeteria's snickerdoodles probably really were the best thing about those years.   Supposedly, this is what Andy Rooney said on "60 Minutes" a few weeks ago. But I have to wonder. It's good stuff, though, and hopefully he really did say it on TV:   "I like big cars, big boats, big motorcycles, big houses and big campfires. I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some governmental stooge with a bad comb-over who wants to give it away to crack addicts for squirting out babies.   Guns do not make you a killer. I think killing makes you a killer. You can kill someone with a baseball bat or a car, but no one is trying to ban you from driving to the ball game.  I believe they are called the Boy Scouts for a reason, that is why there are no girls allowed. Girls belong in the Girl Scouts! ARE YOU LISTENING MARTHA BURKE?  I think that if you feel homosexuality is wrong, it is not a phobia, it is an opinion.  I don't think being a minority makes you a victim of anything except numbers. The only things I can think of that are truly discriminatory are things like the United Negro College Fund, Jet Magazine, Black Entertainment Television, and Miss Black America.  Try to have things like the United Caucasian College Fund, Cloud Magazine, White Entertainment Television, or Miss White America; and see what happens. Jesse Jackson will be knocking down your door.  I have the right "NOT" to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird, or tick me off. When 70 percent of the people who get arrested are black, in cities where 70 percent of the population is black, that is not racial profiling, it is the Law of Probability.  I believe that if you are selling me a milk shake, a pack of cigarettes, a newspaper or a hotel room, you must do it in English! As a matter of fact, if you want to be an American citizen, you should have to speak English!  My father and grandfather didn't die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come over and disrespect ours.  I think the police should have every right to shoot your sorry self ifyou threaten them after they tell you to stop. If you can't understand the word "freeze" or "stop" in English, see the above lines.  I don't think just because you were not born in this country, you are qualified for any special loan programs, government sponsored bank loans or tax breaks, etc., so you can open a hotel, coffee shop, trinket store, or any other business.  We did not go to the aid of certain foreign countries and risk our lives in wars to defend their freedoms, so that decades later they could come over here and tell us our constitution is a living document; and open to their interpretations.  I believe a self-righteous liberal or conservative with a cause is more dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.  I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue to make more. If it ticks you off, go and invent the next operating system that's better, and put your name on the building. Ask your buddy who invented the Internet to help you.  "I think tattoos and piercing are fine if you want them, but please don't pretend they are a political statement.  I am sick of "Political Correctness." I know a lot of black people, and not a single one of them was born in Africa; so how can they be "African-Americans"? Besides, Africa is a continent. I don't go around saying I am a European-American because my great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather was from Europe.  I am proud to be from America and nowhere else. And if you don't like my point of view, tough.

      Once again my trip to Louisville was too short.  Milla is the cutest thing ever, if I've failed to mention that. She's such a happy, happy baby, which I know must be a blessing for Kevin and Laine. She giggles and smiles, especially at Kevin. She thinks her daddy is the funniest thing ever. She's so good with people, pretty much anyone, which makes me think she's going to be a good-natured person in general. It's good to see a controversial situation, at least in some people's eyes, turn into a blessing.  The trip was quick. Up on Saturday afternoon and back on Sunday afternoon. But I did get to eat at Mark's Feed Store. Sometimes I ask myself why I like Louisville so much more now. I remember graduating from high school and living that last real summer at home, hanging out with my high school boyfriend and friends, wishing it was time to go to college. (Although for an 18-year-old, leaving the boyfriend was dramatic.) I came to college and really didn't go home that much -- holidays, mainly. Then the longer I was in college, the more I went home. Then I moved to Louisville and then Lexington, so I went to my parents' house often because it was easy, and closer. Sometime in there, I found a peace at my parents' house I never felt growing up. It's sort of ironic, really. But I just love being there, watching movies with Dad or reading The Courier-Journal when it comes to my parents' driveway. I like that when I'm looking for something (a certain book, as was the case this weekend) I can go to a store fairly quickly a get it. I like that there are things -- Diet Big Red, Mark's Feed Store, good shopping -- that just make Louisville and the area different from Murray and the area. And I think I just like it because I've bonded with my family on a new level since we've all grown up. Kevin and Cassie (and this weekend Laine and Zac) can hang out on a fun level that is so much better than any fight we had growing up. My mom and I talk like friends and my dad trusts me to take care of things for him.   I bought Rick Bragg's other book -- "Ava's Man. It's the sequel to my new favorite, "All Over but the Shoutin'," so I'm looking forward to starting that.

      While on my trip, I read my is likely to become my favorite book. "All Over but the Shoutin'" by Rick Bragg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the New York Times. I loved the book because it took me through his life from rural Alabama to New York and back to the South again, with lots of stops in between. I really felt like I knew him and his family and the people he met along the way. I knew it was going to be a good book when I wasn't through the first chapter and wanted to write down many of the word combinations he had the described the South, being a writer or just life in general. And to think I bought the book at a yard sale, knowing the stories I had read by him before had held my attention and surely his autobiography would too.  Here are some:  ...dreaming backwards can carry a man through some dark rooms where the walls seem lined with razor blades.  ...to tell a story right you have to lean the words against each other so they they don't all fall down...  The opportunity hung perfectly still in the air in front of my face and fists, and I held my temper and let it float on by.  I read it to the end, and found a dozen things I wished I had written differently, like I always do. But there is no way to make that gigantic press run backwards once they turn the key, once the siren sounds, once it begins to tumble over and over and over again. Like time. Sometimes the warm newspaper in your hads reads clumsy and sometimes it doesn't even read right, but there it is. There you are. And it is much, much too late for the rewrite man.  I didn't get into this business to change the world; I just wanted to tell stories. But now and then, you can make people care, make people notice that something ain't quite right, and nudge them gently, with the words, to get off their ass and fix it.  I made some friends for life, the way I usually make them. Any jackass can be pleasant company, but if people help you when you're at your worst, that's a friend. ... They, especially, taught me that you can't go through life not liking people because they didn't have to work as hard or come as far as you did.

      I can't decide how I want to start this blog...  I thought about beginning with how I used a Turkish toilet -- actually that's a fancy name for a hole in the ground -- in a small town in Greece or how I had to pay 50 cents to use the bathroom -- more often called a water closet -- in Turkey. They liked my American quarters and I was happy the toilet was more than a hole in the ground.   But that doesn't seem to be the best way to start talking about my trip because it wasn't the best part, just the most random part.   I could talk about how the Greek islands we visited were picture perfect, really. White houses and stores with blue shutters that were built into the sides of mountains. The contrast of the blue water and white buildings was beautiful. And I can only hope one of my 140 pictures captures that.   But words can't really paint that picture accurately.   I could just list chronologically where we visited: Delphi, where Greek mythology is deeply rooted; Thessalonica, Greece's second largest city; Mykonos, a lovely Greek island filled with quaint shops and a beautiful port; Ephesus, the amazing ancient city that is prominent in Paul's teaching in the New Testament; Patmos, a Greek island to which John was exiled and where he wrote Revelation; Rhodes, an island that has more shops that anyone can imagine; Crete, where Europe's oldest civilization called home; Santorini, a picture-perfect island built into an old volcano site; Corinth, the other prominent city from the New Testament; Athens, a fabulous old city sprinkled with modern buildings among its historical roots that is quickly preparing for the Olympics; and Rome, which was probably my favorite place because of my appreciate for the history of the Catholic church. In these places I was a little obsessed with churches, especially their steeples, and windows on old buildings with neat shutters and flowers in window boxes.   But doesn't that listing seem a bit mundane?  I could share the emotional side of it all, especially how it was a good chance to clear my head after months of busyness and unnecessary worry in my everyday Murray life. It was good for Greg and me to get away, even among a 40-person tour group including his family, and just enjoy each other's company in this fabulous atmosphere. I was introverted and reflective, not really focused on getting to know the other people we were traveling with like Greg's dad seemed so concerned about doing. I know as well as anyone strangers have stories to tell from which anyone can learn, but sometimes I think it pays to take a break from the world and breath a sigh of relief and rest. That's what the trip was for me. Emotional rest. Physically, it was a tiring trip because we were on the go so much. We saw a lot, traveled much and I'm sure I'll keep learning from this trip for days to come.   But maybe I'm too emotional and should just keep in mind that stressed spelled backward makes desserts.

      I have this method of packing that involves making piles. So right now there are multiple piles -- organized piles -- in my house. Tonight I suppose I better put everything in the suitcase or backpack. It keeps me from forgetting things, though, I think, because I just put stuff there as I think about it, and I also don't feel like I waste much time packing. Honestly, over the weekend I was worried about this trip. One, I know the change in my routine and the eight-hour time difference is going to affect my diabetes. Everything is going so well with it right now that I hate to disrupt it. Reminder: This is a once-in-a-lifetime trip, really, and I need to suck the diabetes worry up and be tough. Also, it's no secret Angela and I aren't exactly friends. I tolerate her for awhile, then her personality and mouth rub me the wrong way. Again, suck it up, Kristin, she's not going anywhere, so learn to like her. Greg told me my goal on this trip whenever I get frustrated with her should be to think of something positive about her. We'll see how that works. I think all of that is behind me now, and I'm ready to travel. We leave early, early tomorrow morning and we'll be back late, late June 15.

      Here's a personality profile based on a  urlLink color quiz  I took.     You're a Problem Solver  You are constantly considering what else each person or situation requires. You want to know what is missing. During this period of mulling things over, others might view you as passive or quiet.  The passionate you thrives on orchestrated plans. Figuring out how to make your ideas a reality and seeing things through to completion is the ultimate high. These pursuits empower your self-confidence.  The centered you is very grounding. You see what is authentic about each activity or relationship. When all is quiet within, you consider how you can feel more complete.  The emotional you avoids asking what's missing. Novel adventures seem to appear. Honor your forbidden thoughts. They are merely signposts to exciting new paths you need to follow.   And here is a frienship-style profile. Yes, I took another  urlLink quiz .    50% Loving Sister  You're an affectionate, sensitive, intuitive sweetie who takes her friendships very seriously -- people love being friends with you because they know you understand them. You nurture your friends, which is a constantly-renewing gift: you're the first one to step forward with chicken soup if they're sick, tissue if they're crying, and a phone call if they're lonely. You love being cared for yourself, too -- not that you'd ever admit it. It's not surprising that you build such strong bonds with your friends, loyal and steadfast as you are. Be careful not to pamper your buddies too much, though, since it can drain you of much-needed energy and encourage otherwise good friends to take your big-hearted nature for granted.    30% Bright Spark  You're a kick in the pants, an inspirer, an activator -- people love being friends with you because you're full of energy and fun ideas. You aim to make the people around you feel happy and comfortable, and you nearly always succeed. You have a wide circle of devoted buddies and admirers, and you take vicarious pleasure in their successes and accomplishments while inspiring your friends with your own passion for life. Although you may sometimes resent the pressure of being everybody's muse or ray of sunshine, you try not to let it show -- but do listen to those voices in your head that urge you to slow down and savor your friendships more fully.    10% Lone Wolf  You're an independent, intelligent free thinker who cherishes her individuality as well as her friendships -- people love being friends with you because you inspire them to self-reflection and self-improvement. Your friends may not see you every day, but they know you support them and care about them, and you share your knowledge and your gifts freely when asked. People look up to you because you understand yourself well, and you understand your own needs for stimulation and personal growth. As independent and forceful as you are, though, you may sometimes leave a buddy out in the cold.    10% Reliable Adviser  You're accomplished, thoughtful, and generous, a font of wisdom and constructive criticism -- people love being friends with you because they know you've got their back. Your trustworthy nature and balanced, fair judgment make you a superb confidante and mediator, and while you may sometimes feel that your friends turn to you for advice about everything, you'd never let down anyone you cared about. Besides, your friends know your opinions are too valuable to do without! Your insight and loyalty are in high demand, but be sure to make friends aware that you're not just Old Faithful. You're the leading actress in your own life -- if some relationships make you feel more like the trusty sidekick, put a new face on your friendship by adopting the some of the attitude of your Bright Spark buddies.

      Tonight is the fourth day in a row this week I've walked with Katy. It's good for me, emotionally and physically. I can be disciplined, but I can procrastinate. It's a weird juxtaposition of my personality, I suppose. Anyway, Katy is good to walk with because she's fun to talk with, and she likes plans, and that's a sort of accountability. Each time we finish walking, well, actually when we finish talking after walking, we talk about when the next time is we can walk. This has been a consistent week because I didn't have anything to cover for work at night. Weird, I know.   So, do you think it's possible I'm healthier now that I have diabetes and am managing it well because I know I have it? There was a good year, probably, that my body was hurting inside even though I didn't know it because I didn't know my pancreas had decided, or maybe been forced, to stop producing insulin to properly break down sugars (and starches, which turn to sugar...). I mean, I eat healthier now and exercise more. That's got to be a good combination. With that, I feel better, sleep better... It's really amazing how everything is connected. It's just weird to think that having a chronic disease like diabetes could be good for me in a certain, maybe slightly twisted, way. I've had a couple high blood sugar numbers lately, which is sort of random, but I know it happens. But I've learned to deal with that and take it all as it comes and not stress about what-ifs. And, trust me, that's hard for a perfect melancholy girl who likes to control everything and be able to have all her expectations met.   I've also been thinking about personality, birth order, nature versus nurture, family influence, friend influence ... The psychology behind who I am, and who others around me are, I guess. Some people can define their mood in a word. Others moods change with the second hand of a clock. Some people love easily; some people find it easier to complain. One person might forgive easily, when another shoves the sadness and hurt inside. Laughing comes easier to some. Some people are easier to laugh with for me. Closure is important to some people, but others move on easily. Simplicity and complexity get confused in some lives, while others live comfortably in shades of gray. Relationships are built by strangers but are too often influenced by their individual experiences and backgrounds, most of which are rooted in childhood moments over which we didn't have much control. Some people welcome change; others run from it. But, probably, most people, at least most people I love, are a strange combination of in between all extremes. Probably because we're all stuck in trying to be who we want to be in a world of who others want us to be and how other people have helped shape our lives, intentionally or accidentally.   I took a personality test a few months ago...  In short, there are four personality types -- popular sanguine, powerful choleric, perfect melancholy and peaceful phlegmatic. The test is divided into strengths and weaknesses, and often people are a combination of two of those types.   My strengths are dominated with perfect melancholy traits:   deep and analytical  serious and purposeful  talented and creative  sensitive to others  self-sacrificing  conscientious  idealistic  schedule-oriented  perfectionist with high standards  orderly and organized  neat and tidy  sees the problems  needs to finish what's started  likes lists, graphs, charts  makes friend cautiously  content to stay in the background  avoids causing attention  faithful  will listen to complaints  deep concern for people    My weaknesses are split between powerful choleric and perfect melancholy, leaning a bit more toward the choleric:   bossy  impatient  can't relax  enjoys controversy and arguments  won't give up when losing  little tolerance for mistakes  demanding of others  decides for others  is too independent  possessive of friends and mate    Then melancholy slips in the weakness column, sometimes contradicting choleric-like traits, such as dislikes emotions and tears, manipulates others, is not complimentary, knows everything and can't say "i'm sorry":  moody   self-centered  guilt feelings  not people-oriented with work  depressed over imperfections  chooses difficult work  hard to please  standards often too high  deep need for approval  critical of others  full of contradictions  skeptical of compliments    This is very interesting to me, mainly because those lists of strengths and weakness ring so true in my life. It would interesting to hear what other people think about my interpretation of myself. There I go, analyzing...   I'll end with a quote from a good book I just finished reading. It's a political, legal drama by Richard North Patterson called "Balance of Power."  Personal lives are as complex as the reasons that people are happy, or sad. ... In any life, there are decisions which keep up us at night, long after they are made. There are decisions which others would make differently.

      And I love this Counting Crows song -- "Accidentally in Love" -- from the "Shrek 2" soundtrack:  So she said what's the problem baby  What's the problem I don't know  Well maybe I'm in love  Think about it every time  I think about it  Can't stop thinking 'bout it   How much longer will it take to cure this  Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if it's love  Makes me wanna turn around and face me but I don't know nothing 'bout love   Come on, come on  Turn a little faster  Come on, come on  The world will follow after  Come on, come on  Cause everybody's after love   So I said I'm a snowball running  Running down into the spring that's coming all this love  Melting under blue skies  Belting out sunlight  Shimmering love   Well baby I surrender  To the strawberry ice cream  Never ever end of all this love  Well I didn't mean to do it  But there's no escaping your love   These lines of lightning  Mean we're never alone,  Never alone, no, no   Come on, Come on  Move a little closer  Come on, Come on  I want to hear you whisper  Come on, Come on  Settle down inside my love   Come on, come on  Jump a little higher  Come on, come on  If you feel a little lighter  Come on, come on  We were once  Upon a time in love   We're accidentally in love  Accidentally in love ...  Come on, come on  Spin a little tighter  Come on, come on  And the world's a little brighter  Come on, come on  Just get yourself inside her ...

      Rob Reiner was on "Cold Pizza" this morning. I like that show because it's full of randomness. They interviewed Rob Reiner about how John Kerry and Teresa Heinz Kerry compare to "The American President" because he is at the Democratic National Convention. But then they talked to a guy from the Nashville Sounds about their faith-based promotions on Friday nights. They give out Jesus and Noah bobbleheads and have music. Anyway, random.  OK, back to my Rob Reiner. I love his movies. "The American President" and "When Harry Met Sally..." are two of my most favorite movies ever. Anyway, the "Cold Pizza" girl asked him something about being at the Democratic convention then said something about "I'm sure there will be celebrities at the Republican National Convention, too." But Rob Reiner quickly disagreed, saying more celebrities are the Democratic convention because celebrities are creative people and creative people are more in touch with people in general, like Democrats are.   Right.  Whether a politician is "more in touch with the people" totally depends on one's perspective. It's politics, I know, but come on, what a generality to make. And what a odd thing to say about "creative people" who have much more money than the average person.

      Yesterday I was writing a story and wanted to quote a guy who said "oomph" when he was talking about a new tax-exempt industrial development authority here. I wasn't sure how to spell it, but I must have gotten close because the spell check fixed it. Then this morning "oomph" was in my horoscope. Now, just to set the record straight, I'm not much on horoscopes and don't believe they are true, except sometimes they are based on personalities, which can explain some things.... Anyway, I just thought it was ironic I was trying to figure out the correct spelling yesterday and then read it this morning.   So Ernie Fletcher was on Jay Leno. I didn't stay up to watch it, although if he had been on David Letterman I might have. I taped it and watched it this morning. Fletcher participated in a comedy routine about slogans for Kentucky and Los Angeles and how they two places are difference. He wasn't really funny, though. His timing was off and he seemed nervous. Leno said something about comedy being difficult, and Fletcher said he'd stick to politics. Then Ashley Judd was a guest, an actual sit-down guest. She was funny. (A proposed slogan: If your initials are Ky., you've got to be good.) She talked about loving UK basketball and how her racecar-driving husband doesn't like the sport. She was a better representative from Kentucky, really. Then she told a funny story about getting locked out of a cabin in Yosemite National Park naked and having to use a yoga mat to cover up when she walked into the hotel lobby to get a key.

      Have I mentioned she's my hero? She's a fabulous writer, mostly because she's a single, black mother in Detroit who was raised in North Carolina by her grandparents but some how can speak to me. It doesn't matter our backgrounds and life experiences are different. And it doesn't matter her motherhood inspired this column because it speaks to me about life in general and how maybe I shouldn't have spent my high school senior year wishing away being a teenager.    BY ROCHELLE RILEY FREE PRESS COLUMNIST  I've said it before: One of the things I like about the Internet, the thing that almost makes up for the daily shots of pornography and fake e-mails telling me about my new mortgage or cash from wealthy Africans, is a simple little nugget whose author is usually unknown, but whose wisdom is profound.  When I got the one I'm sharing today, my first and only thought was, "Count me in." But my second thought was, "Oh, how I wish I could convince my daughter and her friends to read this with straight faces and to understand and, in their hurry to grow up, to not rush the years that soon will come rushing on their own." I hoped that maybe if they hear it from someone other than me, it might make a difference:  So for all of you moms and dads whose children don't get it and for all of my colleagues in whatever field you're in, whether it's construction of buildings or of sentences, whether it's cleanup of grocery aisles or the checkbooks of bank customers with poor math skills, this is for you.  "I am hereby officially tendering my resignation as an ADULT. I have decided I would like to accept the responsibilities of an 8-year-old again. I want to go to McDonald's and think it is a four-star restaurant. I want to sail sticks across a fresh mud puddle. I want to see who can blow the biggest bubble. I want to think M&M's are better than money because you can eat them. I want to drink Kool-Aid, and eat Lemonheadswith my friends. I don't want to change clothes because I got a little dirt on them. I want to enjoy every day like it's summer vacation.  "I want to return to a time when life was simple. When all you knew were colors, multiplication tables and TV show theme songs, but that didn't bother you because you didn't know what you didn't know, and you didn't care. All you knew was to be happy because you were blissfully unaware of all the things that should make you worried or upset. I want to think the world is fair. That everyone is honest and good. I want to believe that anything is possible, I want to be oblivious to the complexities of life and be overly excited by the little things again, like a new Hot Wheels car.  "I want to live simple again. I don't want my days to consist of computer crashes, mountains of paperwork, depressing news, how to survive more illness, and loss of loved ones. I want to believe in the power of smiles, hugs, a kind word, truth, justice, peace, dreams and the imagination. I want to be in the roller derby and actually believe the Three Stooges are real.  "So . . . here's my checkbook and my car keys, my credit card bills and my 401K statements, my pager, my cell phone, my Palm Pilot, my fax machineand my DVD player, and last but not least my mortgage book. I am hereby officially resigning from adulthood. And if you want to discuss this further, you'll have to catch me first 'cause . . .  "Tag, you're it! And you have cooties."  That says it all for me, in a nutshell, a nutshell I hope to hand to my daughter and her friends and encourage them to enjoy. And to the author, I say: Thank you, and you must have teenagers.

      My doctor's appointment yesterday morning was in downtown Louisville. It got me thinking...  I want to go to a Riverbats game. Dumb mascot, cool stadium. I've only been a couple of times, but minor league games are fun. There's still time for that this summer. And I don't need much of a reason to go to Louisville.   Waterfront park is continuing to look great. I even think the skate park is neat. I love walking down there, and I really should have taken a pit stop there when Greg and I were finished at my doctor's appointment. But instead we met my parents at Rafferty's on the east end. The east end and its Summit and Springhurst shopping areas are convenient and serve my shopping addiction moments well, but I downtown is good sometimes, too. I also should have driven down by Fourth Street, where the city has put in new restaurants and clubs to see what that looks like. Apparently the Galleria, which was sketchy anyway, is gone.   I liked working downtown when I was at the AP. I lived 10 minutes, if that, from downtown and liked watching people walk downtown, dressed in dresses and suits but wearing tennis shoes. I just liked the atmosphere, and realized yesterday I miss it.   Then I read today Tumbleweed is opening a restaurant there. First, I love Tumbleweed. (And it's opening in February.) Two, I love waterfront restaurants and was just commenting on that yesterday.   And then I was thinking about how I haven't been to Lexington since we moved, and that was almost a year ago. It will be a year Aug. 4. That's next week.

      I had to play editor Friday at work because Eric was out. I can handle it, but I sure am glad my priority most days is writing. All that layout is better off in someone else's hands, anyone else's hands, really. I thought I was going to get out early because of the sudden demand to eliminate any overtime, but I realized there were some tasks I needed to take care of for Saturday's and Monday's papers before I left. So much for eliminating overtime. But I'll be glad when the paycheck comes.   So it was off to Louisville Friday afternoon. Mom ordered Hometown Pizza for us when we got there. It is a local favorite. Saturday morning I dragged Greg along with me to run some errands -- two scrapbook stores, Target and Kohl's. I didn't find anything at Kohl's. I love Target. And the scrapbook stores were OK, but Murray's store actually has as good a selection. Later Cassie and I went shopping and I found a cute shirt on sale at Old Navy.   Kevin, Laine and Milla came over Saturday for dinner. Milla continues to be the cutest baby ever. She's adorable, loves to giggle and laugh and is starting to show her personality. She can roll over and scoot around and it's going to be no time before she's getting all around. She's easily entertained, and kept thinking I was a jungle gym.   I went to the church I grew up going to Sunday morning, and I didn't recognize but a handful of people. That's sort of weird to me. I shouldn't be surprised, but it's just that oh-wow-I'm-growing-up feeling again. Mom, Greg and I went to Evan's first birthday party after church. Evan is the son of Shelley and Dustin, who are among the few real friends I keep in touch with from high school. It was fun to see them, and Bekah and Barrett.  Kevin brough Milla over again Sunday night for dinner, and this time Poppy joined us. (Dad was in Indy all weekend.) Guess what? She was still adorable, especially because Kevin dressed her in this adorable pink and yellow striped shirt with a cute white skirt with a butterfly on it. Later that night Greg and I went to visit college friends Laura and Dave who actually live in La Grange, even though neither one of them grew up there. It was nice to see them. They are expecting their first child at the end of January. The pregnancy bug must be in the air, although it hasn't quite reached me.   I went to the endrocinologist this morning. She's the diabetes specialist. She was pleased with how I'm doing. The visit was brief, if you eliminate the waiting room time, and rather encouraging. We had lunch with Mom and Dad at Rafferty's before coming back to Murray. It was sort of nice to get back in the afternoon rather than walk in the house and go straight to bed. But, then again, it was nice to have Monday too.   My doctor and I talked a lot about the value of exercise, in general and with diabetes. So I'm glad I have my walkin' friend in Katy. We walked tonight and plan on doing so other times this week, which (knock on wood) seems to be free of evening meetings and such.

      Some days are good. Some days are bad. Then some days are just neither, and I almost wish they'd swing to either extreme. These are the kind of days where I just want to curl up on the couch, listen to one of my favorite CDs over and over, cuddle and hug, or have a really good conversations. Actually some combination would be lovely. These are the days I wish I had a place in Murray that gave me an escape from my frustrations, as minor as they are. On these kind of days I wish people could read my mind and realize it's OK that I could cry or laugh at any moment.  I think these kind of days are the epitmoe of a perfectionist with overflowing emotions. Feelings mean more than logic on days like today.

      I left work a little after 1 this afternoon, I think. I've had some random thoughts since then:  I'm addicted to scrapbooking. I've moved on to phase two of my vacation album. That would be Rome. I went to Wal-Mart to get two pictures printed as 5-by-7s. Now it's all laying in my living room floor again.   Nobody told me the Cubs and Cardinals played this afternoon. Well, that's until Greg called this afternoon to see if it was on 79, our Murray Electric channel that airs FoxSports-Midwest coverage of Cardinals games. Just the games, though, then the stations goes black. Anyway, good thing I turned it on in the eighth inning when it was tied at 8. I got to see the part that mattered most. Although the comeback was impressive I'm sure, thanks to Albert and his three homeruns. Oh, and the two others didn't hurt either. Tensions were high, fans were up and down depending on the moment and the Cardinals came out on top with a 10-game lead over the Cubs. It's fun to watch, though. But it's July and who knows what will happen by September. Oh, but Kyle Farnsworth remains my favorite Cubs pitcher. Today he gave up a homerun to So Taguchi to tie the game. Oh, and one to Albert. Not quite as classic as walking in the winning run earlier in the season, but still helpful.   OK, enough about baseball...  So then I put on my reporter's cap and went to Robbie Rudolph's tire warehouse, where he and Gov. Ernie Fletcher were meeting with some Mayfield officials about the state of that economy and how they are planning to rebound from the loss of General Tire. The meeting was closed so me and other reporters and photographers -- reporters and cameramen from two different TV stations, a reporter and photographer from The Paducah Sun, a radio guy, the Mayfield newspaper girl and some other random guy whom I could never figure out where he belonged -- waited for almost an hour before they came out. Then the silly TV cameramen, well, one specifically, got in the way and I think went live randomly in the chaos. In was an impromptu press conference that was suppose to be planned, if that makes sense. I came away with enough quote to make a story, sweatier than I went in and probably smelling like rubber. Lovely.  Then it was off to a fund-raiser for Melvin Henley at this massive house here. I pulled out of Robbie's not far behind the governor and entourage (I have mentioned I love Robbie?), but apparently politicians drive fast, so they quickly disappeared. I got to the fund-raiser not far behind them and began covering my second event of the evening.   So, I'm a better writer than photographer. But I think I figured out why tonight, well, probably one of many reasons. If I concentrate, I can take decent pictures. I love my pictures of Greece, for instance. But when it comes down to taking pictures quickly, with people moving around, I'm not quite as successful. Add to that trying to take notes, and I feel like I slack on the pictures and concentrate on the words. It's my nature to pay more attention to the words first, plus I'm better at that part.  Yeah, so, I'm a nerd. I like these political things. But I also was thinking tonight about how I like my job because I've been here long enough people trust me. I've also developed relationships with people apart from being related to the Taylors. All the Taylors in Murray. Don't get my wrong. Great, great people. But it's nice I have developed an identity and people appreciate the work I do apart from marrying into a nice, local family.   The newspaper publisher was at the fund-raiser. (I think she's a Republican, but she doesn't try to let too many people know it. But there were 240 people there, so maybe her secret is out!) Anyway, before I left, I told her bye, and she decided she wanted a heart-to-heart talk about work, random things there, before I left. It was fine.  Now I'm home, ready for bed and glad to be out of the dress I've had on since 6 a.m. At least the dress looked nice with my orange, slightly muted, fingernails. Goodness, I'm glad I don't usually pick out clothes to match fingernail polish, or vice versa, really. I couldn't handle being that kind of girl.

      I got my second piece of jail mail, which is actually stamped on the envelope identifying it as such. It's from the same guy who sent me a  urlLink letter a couple months ago . He accused with multiple things, most seriously two counts of attempted murder of a police officer and felony meth-related offenses, for a drug-bust incident at the end of April. Anyway, apparently I'm ruining his life now, even though in the first letter he told me understood the public had a right to know. But he claims he's innocent and I write with "accusing ways," even though I'm only reporting what happened that day and what has since happened in court. The best part, though, is the drawing of a pile of poop on the envelope, which he refers to in the letter as a illustration of how he feels about my stories. Awfully sweet, huh?

      I tend to only talk about diabetes on here when it's giving me fits, but I thought I'd go the other direction this morning. There's a blood test -- hemoglobin A1C -- that tells somehow what my blood sugar has been over the past three months or so. I'm not really sure how it works. That would probably take a medical degree. But I know that the result is a number that coordinates with an avergae blood sugar reading. So, in January when I was at the doctor's office, my A1C result was 15. In other words, outrageously high, dangerously high. In April is was around 7, which is acceptable for diabetes patients, but maybe still slightly high. Yesterday, it was 6.4, which is ideal, really. See, I can test my blood sugar randomly throughout the day, but that reading is only for that exact moment. There are so many factors -- heat, food, exercise, stress -- that make the numbers go up and down, and make me feel good and bad. So it's hard to know how much it is flunctuating sometimes. That's what this test is for.   I know this world is bigger than numbers, but it helps my confidence to know I'm doing this right.  Now, there were a few other numbers on my blood test results that were slightly high or slightly low. I think most of them are different proteins in blood, but I'm not sure if any of that is anything to be worried about. Maybe ignorance is OK for a worryer. Anyway, I go to the doctor -- the endocrinologist -- on Monday in Louisville, so I'll know more then.

      I had my first professional massage this afternoon. And it was fabulous, this coming from a girl who likes her head scratched and her feet rubbed. Greg had gotten me a gift certificate for one of the packages at the spa for Christmas. Yes, I know, it's July. Anyway, it included an aroma steam, 30-minute massage, facial and manicure. Pretty girly, yes, but a sweet gift.  OK, so the aroma steam. She asked me to pick a "scent." I did. I don't know what it was or if I really liked it. Then I got 20 minutes in this steam room. The first 10 minutes were really good. Then it was too hot. Yes, a steam room is suppose to be hot, but it was too hot, at least for that amount of time. I got out a couple of times in the last 10 minutes. For one, I read one time that being in a hot tub would make my blood sugar drop. I don't know why, really, but Lord knows I've had enough of that hypoglycemia stuff lately. So I was being careful. Plus, I was sweating and wet and the "aroma," whatever that scent was, was starting to fill my nose and eyes, creating a strange feeling I wasn't so sure about. Somehow the steam was relaxing, I would have just shortened the time.  Moving on the massage... It was great. I could have fallen asleep, but I thought that might have been a little weird. On that note, back to the steam room, it's really hot and wet but I really wanted to read or talk. That's my task-oriented nature, though, so after a few minutes I realized I should probably just enjoy the peace and quiet. The massage was nice, although I would have chosen different background music. It was some instrumental stuff, soothing, I suppose, and I can't really even remember it so it must not have been that bad, but still...  The massage and facial sort of went together, and who knew it would feel good to have my face massaged? She used all kinds of smelly-good clensers and lotions on my face. Then I got my nails done. I never paint my fingernails a color. I do good to keep them at a good length and not pick them down. Anyway, the lady asked what color I wanted, and I told her I really didn't care. (Does indecisiveness come with relaxation?) She said she had this new color she had been wanting to use, so I looked at it. It looked fine, a sort of peach color. Well, at least that's what it looked like in the bottle. Three coats later on my fingers it looked orange. She kept saying it looked tangerine on her, and that's why she couldn't wear it, but it looked more apricot on me. Um, sure, whatever you say, Miss Manicure Lady. It looked orange on me, whatever fruit you want to use to describe it. But this was just a fun day and I really didn't care. The more I looked at it through the evening, the more I decided it was too bright. I tamed it by putting something else -- a whitish color -- on top of it, so it's better now.   After that, Katy and I walked. It wasn't as hot as it was last week. Then she, Chad and I went to eat dinner at Subway. Then I came home and cleaned up because as good as I felt from my relaxation afternoon and walking, I was sweaty and my hair was disgusting. (Too much information, maybe...) I got out of the shower just in time to see Edmonds hit a homerun in the fourth inning of the Cubs-Cardinals game. Zambrano apparently had it out for Edmonds, whom he hit twice in the game with pitches. Doesn't matter, a nine-game lead is nice. Even in July.

      I was thinking about my diabetes this morning. I had a weird week with it last week and I had to get my blood taken for my doctor's visit next week, so it has been on my mind. The last part of last week my blood sugar kept going low, usually after meals, even though I took less insulin than I had been taking. It is sort of frustrating not to understand, yet to feel shaky, sweaty and slightly disoriented because my blood sugar is lower than it is suppose to be. So Saturday night it dropped dangerously low, and I took some glucose tablets and ate some crackers, but Greg also went to the gas station to buy me a Coke. Thing is, I haven't had a Coke since lunch on Jan. 28 at Quizno's. (I only remember because Greg and I had lunch there before I went to the doctor for the dreaded appointment.) Anyway, Coke is one of the things that raises my blood sugar quickly, so we thought that would be good. The glucose tablets work fast, too, but it gets old eating them, especially because I would have had to eaten the whole package because my blood sugar was so low. So, the Coke didn't even taste that good. I think I'm so used to diet drinks that the real thing just didn't even taste as good as I thought it would have. It's a nice thing to learn though, as I sit here with my Diet Cherry Coke.

       And God has put all things under his feet and made him the supreme head of the church -- which is his body, filled with himself, the author and giver of everything everywhere.    -Ephesians 1:22-23   &nbsp;  We live in a physical body surrounded by spirituality, but too often I get caught up in the physical world -- right here, right now -- and ignore the big picture, the spiritual realm. That's silly of me because God is going to hold everything together better than anything I even attempt to do. I can organize. I can plan. I can encourage. I can love. Yet somewhere among every decision I make, there's God tending to every detail, truly controlling every situation. God is greater than every thing I have, every thing I try to be, everything I feel. He's greater than all my five senses combined, really. I get caught up in trying to be a certain way. I'm a perfectionist, so maybe I should relax. I'm a people pleaser, so maybe I should just be myself. I'm a worrier, so maybe I should take every moment one at a time. Maybe. But really life comes down to my heart, your heart. Our hearts sum up who we are. From my heart springs my emotions, my intellect and my will. I once heard "character" defined as who I am when no one is looking. In other words, I am who I am in my heart. I am who I am every inch inside me, even the parts I don't like to show others. Whatever I hide will one day surface. I'm pretty good at developing a pleasing outward appearance, but is that really who I am? Does an emotion or experience cause me to believe something is true even when it isn't true? Maybe a false belief is rooted in a childhood experience or a grass-is-greener-on-the-other-side thought. Maybe I'm sinfully seeking immediate satisfaction. Maybe my perfectionism pushes me to play by the rules for the sake of playing by the rules and no other reason. Sometimes these things take power over my life, a life given to me by the creator of the universe. I should probably just trust&nbsp;God to take care of what he already started. &nbsp;  &nbsp; OK, so today was a good summer day. After church and lunch at Backyard Burger, we (that would be Jaclyn, Bryan, Brandon, Greg and I)&nbsp; went to David and Jennifer's to swim and hang out in the sun. I took some pictures, read my book and tried to back dive. Some of the pictures are good, I didn't get very far in my book and I kept flipping all the way over when I dove backward. Then Jaclyn I went to the grocery and we all came back to our house to eat supper. Then Greg, who somehow still had energy, went to play tennis while the rest of us went to Jaclyn and Bryan's, where Jaclyn, Brandon and I played Scrabble. I won. And now here I am, getting ready to go to bed, probably. The sun was shining (I think my arms might be a little red), but it wasn't too hot. Lovely summer day. We even had hot dogs for dinner. That's such a summer food. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Yesterday I kept falling asleep. First I laid down to watch the Cardinals-Reds game after I went to some yard sales and Dumplin's with Peggy. I made it through a couple of innings, then it was all over for me. I got up and cleaned some and corrected the three errors Greg found in my scrapbook (Yes, it is finished now. I think Katy will be proud of my effort.)&nbsp; before Greg and I had Mexican for dinner then rented "Mystic River." I liked the movie, even though I dozed off in the middle. But I must not have slept long because I didn't miss much.

      My blogger seems suddenly HTML-smarter. But that's OK. You just know how I am about change... &nbsp; It's been a good week. Nothing too overly exciting and nothing bad either. I've spent a lot of time scrapbooking, and I believe I can officially say I'm addicted. (The six hours I spent working on my scrapbook last night should probably&nbsp;prove that.)&nbsp;I'm almost finished with the Greece portion of our trip and will then move on to Rome, which will probably be its own smaller book. And then I have other ideas floating around my mind.  &nbsp;  I tend to get addicted to songs and play them over and over, in my head and in the car. Right now it's "This Everyday Love" by Rascal Flatts.

      And I thought the story couldn't get any better...  WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP)  A woman who offered to use her 5-month-old pig as bait to lure a tiger that escaped from the home of an actor who once played Tarzan will be cited for animal cruelty, officials said.  Linda Meredith, of Loxahatchee, put the pig in the trunk of her car and drove to the neighborhood where officials were searching for the tiger shortly after she heard of its escape.  Meredith asked officers to grab the hind legs of the pig, named Baby, or twist its ears so it would squeal and attract the tiger. The officers declined her offer.  Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control Director Dianne Sauve said Meredith will be cited for transporting the pig in her trunk.  I was appalled, Sauve said. Carrying an animal in a trunk in 90-degree heat, where its probably 140 degrees inside, is not acceptable.  Suave said she planned to meet with county sheriffs officials Thursday to determine specific charges.  Meredith said the trunk of her Cadillac is air conditioned, and she was planning to eat the pig when it is full grown. I cant believe they have the gall, she said. I was just trying to help the tiger find his way back home.  Following a 26-hour search, the tiger, which belonged to actor Steve Sipek, was shot and killed Tuesday after lunging at a wildlife officer.

       The headline:  Prosecution, defense paint very different pictures of Holbrook   The lead:  The jury heard two different versions of a man accused of killing his wife on Easter Sunday 2002 just outside of Richmond during the opening statements of a capital murder trial Wednesday in Madison Circuit Court.  Really? I'm in Murray, probably five hours from Richmond, and I could have written that from here, never getting up from my desk. Come on, seriously, that's the most generic lead possible for a murder trial. Sure, the guy has admitted to stabbing his wife, but surely something a little more interesting was said. It's a murder trial in Richmond.

      Two afternoons -- hot afternoons at that -- I walked with Katy. Power walked, I suppose. We walked in neighborhoods near her place Monday and Tuesday. Yesterday we even had to briefly detour into some sprinklers spraying someone's grass that conveniently rotated into the street. I don't think shade existed, even though we tried to walk in the more shady (shadier?) streets. It was good though -- the company and the fact getting out like that makes me feel good. Yes, this coming from the person who hates to sweat and choose swimming in high school because even when I got hot in the pool, I couldn't tell I was sweating, well, and swimming doesn't involve much of that hand-eye coordination thing I lack.   I talked to Kevin last night. I had mailed Milla a 6-month birthday outfit and card. He called to thank me for it. You know, he and I had our share -- actually more than our share -- of fights, physically and verbally, growing up. I really wondered if we were ever going to connect on any level beyond this love-hate thing. But Milla changed him. He's always struggled with having focus. He always seemed to be searching for purpose. I don't know much about his relationship with Laine. But I know he loves her and wants to do what he has to for her and Milla. There was drama -- well, as dramatic as my unemotional family gets -- surrounding Laine's pregnancy just because it wasn't part of the preferred order of big life moments. Still, Milla was born and nobody seems to think twice about the situation now. Besides Milla being the most adorable, best behaved baby ever, she has changed and is changing Kevin, and I think people see that. He's more considerate to me, Cassie, Mom, and I'm sure others. He realizes life is about more than himself and he has a daughter depending on him. He works hard and seems to like his electrician job.

      OK, I'm still laughing about this... Although maybe I shouldn't. Tarzan-wannabe said the authorities committed murder. I'd say they were protecting the community from a wild animal, even if he didn't have claws. What kind of Tiger doesn't have claws? Or as Michael said, "Why couldn't Tarzan catch his own tiger?"   While Tarzan mourns his tiger, I'm glad the story has concluded, as much as it makes me laugh. I couldn't leave you without the finale after all my gigglin' about it:  LOXAHATCHEE, Fla. (AP)  A movie actor who once played Tarzan criticized authorities for killing a tiger that escaped from his home, saying the animal had a heart of gold.  The 6-year-old tiger was shot and killed Tuesday when it lunged at a wildlife officer who was trying to capture it. Steve Sipek, who developed a soft spot for jungle beasts after playing Tarzan in B-movies decades ago, said he doubted the tiger had to be killed.  He said he would have been able to coax the tiger, named Bobo, if officers had called him to the scene before shooting it.  Murder is the word, Sipek said. They murdered a poor helpless animal that only looked ferocious, as any tiger would, but Bobo had a heart of gold.  A dozen wildlife trackers and sheriffs deputies had searched more than 24 hours for the animal, which escaped Monday. They had kept watch Tuesday in a five-acre area of dense slash pines and palm trees, hoping to catch it.  Officers approached the tiger intending to shoot it with tranquilizers. But the tiger jumped at one officer, who shot it with a shotgun in self-defense, said Jorge Pino, a spokesman with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.  Needless to say, the owner is very distraught. Were distraught, Pino said. Our concern was to recover this tiger alive and well.  Some nearby residents, who moved to the rural area so they could have room for their own pets, were less sympathetic.  What I want to know is when he was in captivity, how long did he go without a feeding? said Kim Smith, who has horses and dogs that she normally keeps outside. Tigers are predatorial. All of us moved out here because were city people wanting a taste of the country. But this is a little funky.  Wildlife officials had said they did not believe the declawed pet would attack. He was never taught to hunt, and had never killed anything or lived in the wild. However, he did bite a woman working inside his cage two years ago, severely injuring her. An expert on tiger behavior disagreed that Bobo had posed no danger.  Tigers are wild animals and they retain hard-wired instincts and to say just because a tiger doesnt have his claws  so what? He still has his teeth and theyre powerful, said Ron Tilson, conservation director at the Minnesota Zoo.  Sipeks compound sits about 10 miles from West Palm Beach, just off a main east-west thoroughfare. Sipek has another tiger, a panther, a cougar and lions on his five-acre compound, which is marked by a sign that reads, Trespassers will be eaten.  He never should have had these animals in the first place, said Andrea Newell, who grew up two doors away and was visiting family on Tuesday.  The tigers escape and the shooting were under investigation, officials said.

      I can't stop laughing about this... The Associated Press keeps moving write-thrus on the wire about this escaped tiger.   Wildlife trackers were maintaining a perimeter around the area, hoping that the tiger, named Bobo, will head back into owner Steve Sipeks compound later Tuesday for his normal evening feeding. Officials said they are limiting the number of trackers in the area so the cat wont get spooked.  He is hunkered down. Hes taking a cat nap, said Lt. Charles Dennis with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

      Apparently the tiger's name is Bobo and the searchers are making progress.   Wildlife trackers, joined by the cats owner, Steve Sipek, felt confident they were closing in on the cat, named Bobo, after finding fresh paw prints. They planned to shoot the 6-year-old tiger with tranquilizers but carried shotguns just in case.  Sipek was very distraught over the whole situation. He feels confident that if he spots the tiger he may be able to talk him into coming to him in a peaceful way, said Jorge Pino, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.   This story is hilarious to me. I mean, I'd probably be scared if a tiger was free-roaming in Murray, but the seriousness is overshadowed by the goofiness of the story.

      This story, even just the first sentence alone, is funny for lots of reasons. My comments are inserted in  italics .  LOXAHATCHEE, Fla. (AP)  Where?   A 600-pound tiger  (That seems awfully large to me.)  eluded capture for a second day Tuesday ( Come on, it's an animal, catch it.)  after escaping from the compound of its owner, a former actor who once played Tarzan.  And, really, why does he have a pet Tiger? He just acted like he belongs in a jungle. He actually lives in Florida.   Deputy sheriffs and state game officials set up a perimeter around a search area and started beating the bush again at daybreak, said Willie Puz, spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.  Drama.   The 6-year-old tiger was spotted several times, most recently around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday by a woman who said it was in her back yard ( like the neighbor's cat came over...) . Officials hoped it would simply grow hungry and return home in search of food, Puz said.  As if it really has to come home for food. It could devour anybody or anything if it got that hungry.   The tiger was reported missing Monday afternoon from the home of Steve Sipek, who played Tarzan decades ago under the screen name Steve Hawkes ( Hold this thought, this portion of the story gets better...) , said Paul Miller, spokesman for the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office. Sipek has raised the tiger since it was a cub.  When the first deputies arrived on the scene Monday, the cat ( Yes, technically it's a cat, but really... ) jumped on top of their car, Miller said. Puz said searchers who spotted it several times Monday evening were never close enough to shoot it with tranquilizer darts.  And how close would that be?   Though law enforcement officers were available to escort nervous residents away from the area, Puz said officials were encouraging people to go about their normal business.  The tiger has only roamed about 200 yards from its home, which means its not out free-roaming all over, he said.  I'd say free-roaming actually is accurate.   Sipek has another tiger, two lions, a black leopard and a cougar on his property, the Palm Beach Post reported. The cats, mostly castoffs from zoos  (Maybe that's the problem.) , are usually kept in a mazelike series of interlocking cages.  In February 2002, a 750-pound tiger  (That's even larger.)  mauled a woman who was helping Sipek during a photo shoot at his compound. She was bit on the head.  In 1985, a tame, three-legged black leopard belonging to Sipek eluded searchers for nearly three days before being found wandering near a fence on his property.  A leopard that was missing a leg also eluded searchers?  Sipek said at the time that he had been devoted to the big cats  (At least they are considered "big cats" now.)  ever since one pulled him from a fire during the filming of a Tarzan movie.  According to the Internet Movie Data Base  (That sounds like a great source.) , Steve Hawkes played Tarzan in a series of Spanish-language Tarzan movies around 1970 and was called Zan of the Jungle when they were released in English.  (Maybe he really thought he belonged in the jungle among the animals.)  He retired from acting after an on-set accident  (Involving an animal?) , it said.  His property is about 15 miles west of Palm Beach.  (Or so that's where Loxahatchee is.)  It is bordered by other similar sized estates and mini-ranches, many with livestock.  (Maybe that's another part of the problem.)  Canals and wooded areas and scrubby brush surround the homes that sit on five-acre lots off dirt roads.  (Like the jungle...)  Lion County Safari and the swampy Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge are a few miles away.

      Blogs are weird concepts. The idea of posting random thoughts, observations and ideas in one place is attractive to be for a few reasons: One, I'm random. Two, I'm a writer who finds peace in compiling my thoughts. Three, I'm anal (I guess the nice phrase would be a "perfect melancholy with some "powerful choleric"...) so I like the built-in organization. Also, I like feeling like I have an audience. Yes, I write for myself and could careless if anyone reads it, but from classes in writing I want to have a defined audience. A letter is addressed to a specific person. My newspaper stories are written to the community. My blog is written to an audience of sorts, even if it borders on undefined and possibly non-existent. Throughout my life I've kept journals. Sometimes I write poems. Sometimes I babble seemingly endlessly. Other times I just chronicle events. I share feelings. I quote people I admire or words I like. My traditional journals have been neglected. It's easier to go back and read this. It's all in one place, not separate books on the shelf or in boxes. I just like everything this blog brings together.   And I like making this 21st century noun "blog" into a verb, "bloggin'."   Blogs are sort of entries into people's mind. Maybe as close as we'll ever get. A few of my friends have blogs, and they are a convenient, much-too-modern way to keep up with people. Take Ryan for instance. Quick history: We worked together at The Park at Middletown, a small amusement, miniature golf facility in Louisville. We were friends there, but really got to be friends via e-mail my freshman year of college. He was a senior at St. Xavier High School and I was at Murray State. Somehow we bonded that way, probably because we are both much better at expressing ourselves through these modern forms of communication. He even drove to Murray once to visit. (Although I don't think that will ever happen again because he thinks Murray and Cincinnati are worlds apart.) He moved to Cincinnati, went to college for awhile, started working... I visited him there a few times, saw some Reds-Cardinals games, rode roller coasters at Kings Island, fought with his former roommate Justin. We'd hang out in Louisville sometimes, usually at Denny's. OK, that's not such a quick history. But there you have it. Well, I sure wished we talked more. I mean, I could tell you a little bit about his baseball team in a northern Kentucky league or about his girlfriend Ann. I know he's alive and I assume well. But even a blog doesn't substitute for friendship. I was hoping I'd get to see him when I go with some friends to Kings Island at the end of the month, but he's going to a wedding of some friends. Sometimes timing and distance hinder good ideas. Memories are good because those are the moments that teach us a little bit more about who we are, who we want to be, where we're going and where we've been. Friends are friends for a reason, and it's good to know nobody can change how we got to where we are.   I've also been thinking about the twisted concept of blogs because of Jessica Cutler and her scandalous Capital Hill sexual activity with only God knows who, all of which was documented on a blog. I talk a lot and let a lot of people into my life on here, but some things probably should be kept inside one's mind and life. Anyway, from articles and interviews I've read about her, I'm fairly certain she loves every ounce of attention she's gotten since leaving her cushy, $25,000-a-year job in D.C. for who knows what beyond a book deal in New York.   I just blogged about bloggin'.

      I got Rascal Flatts tickets today for their concert at the state fair Aug. 29. Chris Cagle is going to be with them. I didn't realize who he was, but the few songs I now know he sings make me excited about him too.

      Later in the weekend we played Rook with Greg's parents and then Scene It and Balderdash with Jaclyn and her family and Brandon. Games are fun, especially with all our competitive personalities, and they are cheap entertainment. I need to start making a list of games that would make good Christmas presents from the family. Our stock could use a boost.  I also started my scrapbook Saturday night and plan to work more on it tonight. Katy helped me get started, and while I'm a little slow with the creativity right now, I think I'm going to like this, maybe a little too much.

      In our bank statements that came in the mail today we were informed The Murray Bank will start online banking Aug. 1. Thank God. Maybe then I will able to get the checkbook balanced to the penny, unlike the past few months we I can't account for a few dollars and a few more cents here and there. At least the checkbook is off to my advantage. The banks says I have more money than I think I have. It's nice the local bank is coming into the 21st century.

      So I came home from work yesterday with a bad attitude. It was a mixture of sadness, bitterness and frustration combined with my too emotional mind set. I was dreading hosting the 14 people we invited over for dinner and games. I cleaned and made a side dish and dessert after work. Then Greg came home and cleaned some. We didn't talk much then I yelled and cried a little, not really at him, just at the situation. Then everything was out and I was ready to move on. Refreshing, really. Yes, I'm emotional, but at the same time that's just me looking for answers and explanations.   So people came over and we all had a good time eating hamburgers and hot dogs and playing games -- Scene It (Katy, Jaclyn, Brandon and I won), Outburst (Katy, Jaclyn, Chad, Bryan and I won), and Trivia Pursuit (Katy, Bryan, Eric and I won). Apparently Katy and I are the game masters. Our team even came from behind in Trivia. We had three pie pieces when the other team (Greg, Chad, John and Brandon) got to the middle for the final question. We gave them a brown (literature) question and the missed it. They went out and eventually back and missed several other brown questions. Meanwhile, we got some pieces, reached the middle and answered "John Grisham" for the win. At 1 a.m. the last people left and Greg and I went to bed cuddly. I only say cuddly because I told you I was refreshed.  Sleeping in was good this morning. I love reading newspapers on Saturday mornings. I cleaned up from last night, talked to Mom, surprised Greg with Dumplin's lunch and watched the Cardinals beat the Cubs. Eight games up. Well, I say I watched the Cardinals, truth be told, though, I dozed off and on, mostly off, during the game. I guess I needed some more sleep.  I've been thinking about love languages. I love by giving. Whether it's my husband or friends, I love by giving presents, cards, Post-It Notes and attention. Everyone loves differently and loves to be loved in certain ways. Often the way I love is the way I love to be loved. Sometimes it's important to love people the way they love naturally, even if it's not personally naturally. What speaks most lovingly to one person might not speak most powerfully to another. I have to remember not everyone will love me exactly the way I love them, and that's OK.

      Sometimes I wonder if I'm settling for Murray for the sake of settling. I generally like it here. But when I'm overly sad or happy I wish I was in Louisville. When I graduated from college, I told myself I'd never live in Murray. Sure, visit. But live? Not so much. Then I changed my mind, decided love with worth it. Worth moving away from my family. Some days it seems worth it. Some days I wish I could just move my world back to where I seem to fall back on naturally. I believe everything happens for a reason. Maybe this is to make me stronger. Maybe this is to teach me patience. Maybe this is to make me rely on myself and not run to familiarity.   I cried today at work this afternoon. I HATE crying at work. I actually am not fond of crying, but it's a natural release for me. Thank the perfect melancholy personality for that. Without details, I cried because I have a friend at work who is the best friend I've made in a long time and Greg doesn't care for my friendship with him. To a point I understand. But then I think about how Greg should give him a chance, see why he's my friend. I'm almost insulted, as silly as that sounds. I'm sure there is a lesson in all of this. I'm just not sure what it could be. Greg says we hang out all of the time at work, but, like I told Michael, life sure is more fun outside of this office. I like my job, but I love my friends. And I hate that right now I feel like I live in two worlds that can't seem to mesh.   Sometimes I just wish life could be as simple as it seems on the surface.

      I might get to see Katie Kerns at the beginning of August. That would be fabulous. She's trying to make plans to fly to Louisville from Boston for a friend's wedding. And if she's that close I'll make a way to see her, even if it is just for lunch or ice cream. We emailed and talked on the phone yesterday, and I am just reminded how lucky I am to have her. Growing up together seems so long ago, but something clicked when she, a fifth-grader, moved next door when I was in sixth grade. It hasn't mattered if we were at different colleges in the same state or living 20-something hours apart, she knows me better than most people. We were spoiled both living in Lexington last year, but I think it recharged our friendship. If only she and Brad move to Nashville next...

      A couple of days late, I know, but I think John Kerry is smart for choosing John Edwards as his running mate. Kerry is so liberal that I think Edwards balances him. Also, geographically, Edwards will win him some Southern votes. Mitch McConnell was quoted this week saying people to vote for the No. 2 person, they are electing a president. Still, I think if some conservative-leaning Democrats were deciding whether to vote for Bush, even though they might not be happy with him, or Kerry, Edwards on the ballot might persuade them to stay with the Democrats. We'll see what happens.  The thing about having a not-so-good day is the next day can be better. Today is going to be better. Yesterday was a strange mixture of good times and emotional times for no real good reason. (But there was no question is was my own doing and nobody else's fault because I was snappy and grouchy with Greg at lunch and Michael and work. I sure wanted to place blame elsewhere, but it was obviously my bad day that was running over into other people's lives.) I took the afternoon off from work, and apparently that didn't sit well with my editor because I didn't really tell him. But I used to always take Wednesday afternoons off (then Brandi quit and the newsroom was a little busier than usual) and figured he'd know that was the plan now that work has slowed down some. So much for assuming. Anyway, I spent about an hour at the scrapbook store, where Katy showed me around and helped me pick out some things to get started with this new project, which I'm sure will develop into a very addicting habit. Katy works there and loves to scrapbook. I've always wanted to, but never really knew where to start. With talking to her and going to Greece, I have plenty of inspiration now. I ran a few other errands, then organized all my pictures and brochures and such from the trip into chronological order so I can start scrapbooking this weekend. We'll see how that goes.   I also walked last night with Katy. I keep myself I need to walk because it helps maintain lower blood sugar levels. Theoretically, if I get into a habit -- maybe routine is a better word -- of walking, I should be able to take less insulin. Plus it's just good for me all around. I actually like to walk, but sometimes it's unmotivating when I can't find anybody to walk with. Walking is usually grounds for good conversation, so company is good. We'll see how this new goal works out for me.

      Sometimes the words are too few. I rely upon gestures and glares, hugs and stares to let people know  how I feel. Even for a writer, I can't string together words to complete a thought. Sometimes frustration  makes  my words fickle. Sometimes love  makes my words too loose. Sometimes the emotions collide and clutter my heart.  Sometimes the words are too many. I seem desperate  to explain a thought, but string together fragments, dancing around it. Even for a writer, this babble is far from brilliant and certainly not concise. Sometimes love becomes lost in lingering letters. Sometimes emotions take over and I laugh and cry.

      If I wanted to hear songs just like they sound on a CD, I'd drive around with the CD playing. But when I go to concerts I want to hear live music, even variations of the recorded version. That's why I love Dave Matthews in concert. I'll recognize a song, then never quite know what Dave will sing or his band will play. Today at work a guy was talking about how he didn't like it when musicians mixed up their songs live. He said he'd prefer for everything to sound like the CD. He also said he didn't like it when they talked. Come on. Why even go to a concert?

      Our computer at home is dying, or maybe I should go ahead and pronounce it dead, so I've been writing this blog in my head all weekend.   I don't really understand parades or fireworks and why they are appealing. Parades just involve a lot of random people walking or riding down the street and even more random people watching them from the sidewalk. What's that about? Then fireworks. I guess once anyone has seen Thunder of Louisville any other fireworks show is ruined. They are pretty for a minute, then they just keep going. I don't think it's that I'm unpatriotic. (I mean, I love Toby Keith.) I think it has more to do with wanting purpose and meaning in everything. Or maybe the fact my in-laws love parades and fireworks. Like the joke the other night at a Republican dinner, although apparently the Democrats made the same joke: Republicans think every day is the Fourth of July. Democrats think every day is April 15th.   Saturday we went to the parade and people kept asking me if I wanted candy. No, I have diabetes. Eating candy probably isn't the smartest thing in the world. While I mocked them in my head, though, my blood sugar dropped, and I needed to eat a peppermint. I would have rather had a cinnamon candy, but Greg's cousin was more willing to part with the peppermint. Beggars can't be choosers, right? Then we went to Pagliai's for lunch. (The choice came down to Pagliai's or Mr. Gatti's. Um, that's a toss up of maybe the two worst places in Murray. Oh well, I cast the deciding vote, so I'm not complaining.) I took a nap Saturday afternoon until it was time to go to Serenity and Patrick's shower shin-dig. Serenity is probably my favorite of Greg's cousins. She works in logistics at John Deere in Iowa and is marrying a guy at least 10 years older than her. (I think it's actually 11 or so.) Anyway, he's cool, though. So it was fun hanging out with them this weekend.   That night we went to the country concert at Murray State. Jimmy Wayne was good. His songs blurred the line between rock and country. And Greg swears one sounded more R&B, but that's Greg's opinion that new country isn't like old country. Well, OK, but that doesn't mean a black man is interchangeable on a Jimmy Wayne song. John Anderson was old country -- On A Straight Tequila Night and Swingin'. Greg enjoyed him the most; I could have lived without that hour of the show. Sara Evans was great. Not only was she adorable with her pregnant belly, but her songs were great, too.   Sunday we continued the Taylor Fourth of July celebration with a cook-out and swim party at David and Jennifer's. It would have better if the sun would have stayed out. I mean, I didn't even get sunburned. But Jaclyn and Bryan went over there with us, so I had a good time hanging out with her. Good thing she was there because Gary must have decided sometime Saturday I wasn't cool enough to pay attention to again and Angela pretty much doesn't acknowledge me either. I would think I was just beginning to develop an insecure complex with the in-laws, but Jaclyn noticed too, and I didn't even tell her to pay attention to how they ignore me. Of course, Elijah cried a lot Saturday and Sunday. He was best at the parade, which doesn't make any sense because sometimes all those sirens drive me crazy and if I were a 6-month-old child I might even cry. But he didn't. No he waited until later in the day and the weekend. Although, I must say, Elijah is cuter than he used to be. He's grown into his funky-shaped head and is a cute baby.  Jaclyn and I went shopping in Clarksville yesterday. My sister's wasn't in town, though, because she's at home for the summer, so going to Clarksville wasn't quite as good as when I get to hang out with her too. But we found some good stuff at Old Navy and I bought Milla at Target. We ate at Steak-N-Shake and later ate a soft pretzel from Auntie Anne's. Oh, and we went to Books-A-Million. I love that place. Well, actually I like Barnes and Noble and Joseph-Beth better, but I have to take what I can get.   I think I'll have more to say later.

      I've neglected the blog this week, but I really haven't had anything to say. One could probably argue I've posted many times without any clear point...  Murrayans love their Fourth of July. A parade, country concert, fireworks, baseball tournament, youth activities. I'm sure the list could go on. I guess it just a good time to promote the little city, but, still, I don't quite understand. I do like that the country concert usually involves somebody pretty good. That would be Sara Evans and Jimmy Wayne this year. Hey, I can't complain for $4. I'm sure I'll get roped into going to the parade. Greg's family loves parades. The thing is, I don't know if the LOVE parades or they think they should like them because everybody in Murray likes parades. This town has more parades than anywhere I've been. Angela and Charles are bringing baby Elijah into town; I'm sure he'll cry again when everybody is around. There's a family cookout/shower for Greg's cousin Serenity and her fiance Patrick on Saturday. On Sunday, we're doing the annual swimming/grilling out party at his uncle and aunt's house. Those are some good summertime activities -- if only the rain will hold off.   This week has been typical. Fairly busy at work. A few things to cover in the evenings. I did go see Spider-Man 2 Wednesday night. I figured even being opening night the crowd would be less than this weekend. It was good. It went well with the first one, which is what I like to see in a sequel. I read several reviews that said this was one of the few sequels that's better than the original. I don't know if I would go that far. Speaking of sequels, that makes me think about a trilogy. I'd like to watch all of the Scream movies. Maybe I can do that this weekend. Afterall, I do get Monday off. Explain that. Yeah, Fourth of July is Sunday, but word has it Christmas and New Year's are on Saturdays and we don't get any extra day off. I'm proud to be an American and vote regularly, but why is the extra holiday necessary in July but neglected in December and January?  Wow, for not having much to say, I said a lot.

      Baskin-Robbins used to have this fabulous ice cream in July called Stars and Stripes and Exploding Bites. It was red, white and blue (maybe cherry, vanilla and raspberry, I can't remember...) ice cream with Pop Rocks candy.  My world was filled with red, white and blue and politics yesterday. In the afternoon I went to Dover, Tenn., because they were having a rally in support of the Ten Commandments. That monument from Alabama that was the center of the debate that ended in a Supreme Court justice losing his job because he refused to remove the monument, which he owned. Anyway, the monument is on tour across the country on its way to Washington, D.C.  Last night I went to a rally for the Democratic candidate for the state House seat. Buddy Buckingham (sometimes I have to be careful not to say Bucky Buddingham...) is seeking his fourth term against a Republican who used to be Murray's mayor and a chemistry professor at Murray State. Now they both are involved in economic development locally. Anyway, I think it's going to be a close race, and definitely closer than the Democrats think it's going to be. The thing is Murray traditionally votes Democratic but leans conservatively. The Republican Party here is growing and being much more active, so I think it will turn the tables in some elections.   I like political functions because there are always random people there, sort of having my different work worlds collide. Last night I talked with the sheriff for a long time. He's a great country boy. I told him last night was the first time I've ever seen him out of his uniform. He told me he likes to try and blend in sometimes, but that never really works for him. He introduced me to his wife as his favorite reporter. That's sweet. Then my favorite criminal defense attorney was there. He's nuts and loves to talk about his MSU athlete-clients. Then there are the people who know I usually vote Republican and like to tease me. But they still seem to like me, so I must be doing something right with the objectivity in my stories.  Also on a political note: I think it is ridiculous Alan Keyes, a talk show host from MARYLAND, is going to accept the bid to run for the ILLINOIS Senate. Um, really, what makes him qualified if he has NEVER lived in the state? Apparently as long as he lives in Illinois by Election Day everything is OK. I guess it's what Hilary Clinton did in New York, but that's not right either. Republicans in Illinois must be desperate. Too bad their other candidate was embarassed with some sex club allegations from his divorce records.

      Sometimes I blog because I want to talk and nobody is around. Other times boredom prompts it. But most of the time it's because I think too much and have too many random thoughts to remember and I figure if I chronicle them everything will make just a bit more sense to me. Selfish, I suppose. But maybe in the process someone will learn something about me. Plus on here I can talk about whatever I want because it's my blog. Religion and politics make some people nervous, but I like to talk about both of them. And my blog doesn't talk back, although I guess people who read it can.   Blogs are popular now. When Ryan persuaded me to start one almost three years ago, he was a little in front of the trend. But now all kinds of people use them. There's Jessica Cutler, the crazy intern from Capitol Hill who liked to publish her sexual escapades. Politicans use them as campaign forums. And I read a story about soldiers using them to stay connected to their civilian lives.   And here mine is, a bunch of babble.

      Our bank has Internet banking! My checkbook has been off by $10.91 for a long time. Even though the difference was to my advantage, it's been driving me crazy. Now I can balance my checkbook more frequently than once a month when the statement comes in the mail. I have it to the penny now. It's really a lovely moment in the world of a perfectionist.   When we lived in Lexington, I balanced my checkbook at least once a week, and now I can get back to that anal habit because The Murray Bank has moved into the 21st century.

      But it's hot outside. I left work early today because I have to work tomorrow night, Friday night and Saturday and overtime is from the devil in my office. That's according to my bosses. Personally, I might as well go work and make the extra money. Anyway, I've been out running errands -- Wal-Mart, Lowe's, Post Office and the bank -- and each time I got in and out of my car, I felt like I was stuck to the seat. Lovely feeling, really.   So our anniversary was yesterday, as I've mentioned, but today I was thinking about how Aug. 3, 2002, was apparently the hottest day Louisville had experienced in five years, according to my aunt and uncle who were in town for our wedding from Yellowstone National Park and their research. All of that to say, I bet it's not as hot as it was that day, but I bet it's close.  Katy called this morning to tell me she thought it was going to be too hot to walk. I think she might be right. So we're going to replace the exercise time with dinner. Healthy.    And now I'm going to take care of some things in the air-conditioned house.

      1. You accidentally enter your password on the microwave. 2. You haven't played solitaire with real cards in years. 3. You have a list of 15 phone numbers to reach your family of 3. 4. You e-mail the person who works at the desk next to you. 5. Your reason for not staying in touch with friends is that they don't have e-mail addresses. 6. When you go home after a long day at work you still answer the phone in a business manner. 7. When you make phone calls from home, you accidentally dial "9" to get an outside line. 8. You've sat at the same desk for four years and worked for three different companies. 10. You learn about your redundancy on the 11 o'clock news. 11. Your boss doesn't have the ability to do your job. 12. Contractors outnumber permanent staff and are more likely to get long-service awards.  AND... 13. You read this entire list, and kept nodding and smiling. 14. As you read this list, you think about forwarding it to your "friends." 15. You got this e-mail from a friend that never talks to you anymore, except to send you jokes from the net. 16. You are too busy to notice there was no #9 17. You actually scrolled back up to check that there wasn't a # and now you're laughing at yourself.  (And here I am publishing it on my blog...)

      A year ago today Greg and I moved to Murray. That's one day after our anniversary, so I guess it will always be easy to remember. I used to not want to live in Murray, but really this last year has been pretty great overall.   We ate at Patti's last night for our anniversary. They are famous for bread baked in a flower pot, porkchops and desserts. But I had grilled shrimp and it was SO good. I had to take a lot of insulin to eat there, but it was well worth it and I even kept my blood sugar under control and ate a piece of chess pie. Greg brought home these gorgeous, bold-colored flowers yesterday and gave me some scrapbooking stuff and a Cardinals shirt that goes along with the Cardinals tickets I bought him. It was a busy day for both of us, but I'm glad we got to do something fun last night.

      In three years I've written more than 100,000 words on here. That's a lot.   I like to go to court when I have stories to cover there because there's always crazy stuff going on with crazy people. But I have issues with this we-don't-write-about-DUIs policy at the paper. I understand not writing about Joe Nobody's DUI, but if someone is a public figure -- MSU athlete, for example -- it's a different story. There was a football player in court this morning who pleaded guilty to a DUI charge, and I'm not allowed to write about it even though there was another football player in court who pleaded guilty to drug parpapheralia. First, DUI is a more serious charge. Also, it's sort of unfair to not write about both of them. I mean, football player one, who happens to be walk-on, hates to see his name in the paper and mistakes shared with the community. Meanwhile, football player two, who used to play for a Division I school but found himself at Murray State, passes through the court system without a word publicly.   BUT if someone is charged with DUI among other charges, such as a basketball player who will be in court next week, then it's OK to write about it. And to think this policy was created because the former publisher wanted to keep his friends' names out of the paper. I just wonder if it wasn't an athlete but rather a state legislator or university administrator if I could write about it. According to the current "policy," I couldn't. But I'd argue that one harder, I think.   And all of this comes from the girl who saw stories about her dad's two DUIs in a few years' time on the front of the city section of The Courier-Journal. As his daughter, I hated to see my dad's story shared with the world. But as a journalist, I understood he was a public figure, even if only in the local community, because he was an middle school principal. His life was shaken up, but it wasn't the newspaper or the police that instigated those changes.  I was chatting with a police detective this morning in court. He said when he was first a patrol officer, he felt bad arresting people because he knew the criminal charges could contribute to a divorce or a job loss or a number of other things. But then he realized, as a police officer he didn't put that person in that situation; he was just doing this job. I really understand that from the experiences with my dad and with covering police and courts for the paper.

      so bloggin' is my break from being productive tonight.   I wasn't sure what I was going to do tonight. I ran errands after work then made Greg's anniversary present. Then I walked with Katy. Usually I'm the one with a to-do list of tasks, but tonight Greg came home ready to work. Our bathroom sucks, for a lack of a better adjective. Right now there is tan carpet, a red counter top, taupe walls, grundgy white cabinets with goldish trim ... It's just real mix-matched and old. So, we're painting the cabinets tonight. Um, let me rephrase that: Greg is painting the cabinets. I cleaned the cabinets, took of the hinges and knobs and prepared the area for him. Sweet, I know.   Anyway, I'm taking a break now because he's in there painting and our bathroom definitely isn't big enough for the both of us, or any two people in general. So this is the first step toward my recent home improvement list. Baby steps are better than nothing. Hopefully tiling our bathroom is the next step. Then we'll conquer the guest bedroom in the attic, complete with a pink bathroom. When I say pink, I don't just mean a pink-painted wall. I mean a pink sink and pink tile with a partially pink-painted and partially white-tiled wall. It's really kind of cool, though. The real issue is the light green walls in the staircase and front room. That definitely needs to be taken care of, as soon as the weather is cooler because it's pretty stinkin' hot up there right now. I could pass the living room as my favorite room in the house once we get crackin' on the improvements.  People who haven't been to our house are probably thinking we live in a crazy place, but really the main rooms are nice. We just sort of stopped there when we moved in, and now I'm motivated again to get some things done. It comes in waves, you know.

      In second grade I made this friend named Elizabeth, who moved to Kentucky from Rhode Island. We lived diagonally across the neighborhood from each other. The path from my house to hers was so often traveled one winter we walked through the snow the same way so much that in the spring that tract of grass in the mutual neighbor's yard was dead. We went to church and school together. We played flashlight tag in the neighborhood with our friends. We stayed up laughing and talking lots of nights. She was a good friend to have.  Although she's still my friend, the type of friendship has just changed a lot. It's neat to see how people come and go, literally and figuratively, but there are certain people who remain part of your life, even if their capacity changes. Elizabeth moved in the ninth grade to Tacoma, Wash., which is near Seattle. Later she moved with her family to Buffalo, N.Y. Then she went to college in Portland, Ore., and still lives out that way. Her parents, brother and sister even moved back to the west coast. I've seen her a handful of times since the ninth grade. I went to Seattle once, and she's visited Louisville a few times, including flying in for my wedding. We keep in touch with e-mail and the random letter or card (and she even wrote me once on the back of chemistry notes) because we know a envelope other than a bill is welcome sight in the mailbox.   I learned recently Elizabeth's mom works as an office manager in a diabetes center. It's interesting to me how my life sort of meshed. Here I am living in Murray, Ky., having been diagnosed with diabetes about six months ago and there the mom of my oldest friend is working in my field. Elizabeth's mom told me she's surrounded with some expert diabetes educators and nutritionist. It's a good resource to know about, especially because I trust that family so much, like they were my own.   Elizabeth emailed me today, and it's neat to me that we can still be part of each other's lives, even if it is more electronically than living in the same part of the country. We aren't neighbors anymore, but I'm thankful for the continued connection.

      Good thing I had a lot of car time yesterday because I read "Ten Big Ones" in a day, actually not even that. I read a couple of chapters on our way to Kings Islands, but then I had it finished before we were at Beaver Dam yesterday.   It's the 10th book in Janet Evanovich's series about bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. They are hilarious. More funny than anything. But there is some suspence thrown in. She's a smart author, though, because she left me hanging at the end, knowing she has published the next installment yet. That's why she can write 10 books about the same character and keep people interested. Rather brilliant, really, but frustrating for me, who has formed an addiction to her books. She has another series of humor/suspense novels but they aren't as good. I think I just don't like the characters as much.  Anyway, here's a sample. It's the very beginning of the book.   The way I see it, life is a jelly doughnut. You don't really know what it's about until you bite into it. And then, just when you decide it's good, you drop a big glob of jelly on your best T-shirt.  My name is Stephanie Plum, and I drop a lot of jelly globs, figuratively and literally. Like the time I accidentally burned down a funeral home. That was the mother of all jelly globs. I got my picture in the paper for that one. I'd walk down the street and people would recognize me.  "You're famous now," my mother said when the paper came out. " You have to set an example. You have to exercise, eat good food and be nice to old people."  Okay, so my mother was probably right, but I'm from Jersey and truth is, I have a hard time getting a grip on the good example thing. A good example in Jersey isn't exactly the national ideal. Not to mention, I inherited a lot of unmanageable brown hair and rude hand gestures from my father's Italian side of the family. What am I supposed to do with that?  My mother's side is Hungarian and from this I get blue eyes and the ability to eat birthday cake and still button the top snap on my jeans. I'm told the good Hungarian metabolism only lasts until I'm forty, so I'm counting down. The Hungarian genes also carry a certain amount of luck and gypsy intuition, both of which I need in my present job. I'm a Bond Enforcement Agent, working for my cousin Vincent Plum, and I run down bad guys. I'm not the best BEA in the world and I'm not the worst. An incredibly hot guy with the street name Ranger is the best. And my sometimes partner, Lula, is possibly the worst.  Maybe it's not fair to have Lula in the running for worst bounty hunter of all time. To begin with, there are some really bad bounty hunters out there. And more to the point, Lula isn't actually a bounty hunter. Lula is a former hooker who was hired to do the filing for the bail bonds office but spends a lot of her day trailing after me.  At the moment, Lula and I were standing in the parking lot of a deli-mart on Hamilton Avenue. We were about a half-mile from the office and we were leaning against my yellow Ford Escape, trying to make a lunch choice. We were debating nachos at the deli-mart against a sub at Giovichinni's.

      I rode roller coasters and ate Krispy Kreme doughnuts and Skyline Chili this week.   Jaclyn, Bryan, Brandon, Greg and I went to Kings Island this weekend. We drove to my parents' house on Friday and then went to Kings Island Saturday morning. It rained all day Friday here and in Louisville, so we weren't feeling confident in Saturday. We drove in the rain Saturday morning toward Cincinnati. It was overcast and sprinkled a little once we got to the park, but within a little while it cleared up and it was a nice amusement park day. We even took a roller coaster break for the lazy river and a group water slide at the water park. I love The Beast and Face Off. Those are probably my two favorites there. But The Vortex, Flight of Fear, Son of the Beast Top Gun and Drop Zone are good too. At the water park, we went down this slide thing in a four-person intertube. First it goes through a tunnel and then into this opening that allows the tube to go up the wall and then back up the other (like a ramp, kind of) and then on down the slide into the pool. It was so fun, and by far the most thrilling water park attraction I've ever experienced.   Today we hung out at my parents' house, even though I don't think everyone else enjoyed just sitting around there as much as I did. Kevin and Milla came over for lunch -- mom-made lasagna and manicotti. This morning we watched "Bend It Like Beckham." I had been wanting to, and it was conveniently on TV today. Cute movie.
