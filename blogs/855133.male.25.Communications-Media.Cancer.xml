      My  urlLink Mac OS 10.2  package is still being held at the my building's front desk due to bad timing on my part, but this weekend, the change will happen!  Just a few very brief things before my Pennsylvania governor's race discussion.  Check out this very cool link. I sent an e-mail to a bunch of random people I know, but now I'll share it with the rest of the world. It's from a  urlLink story  I read at The Register - a tech site from the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, as I'm typing several days after reading the story, it no longer works. What a waste.  My second gripe, very quickly: The Israel-Palestine situation. The United Nations essentially created Israel. (This is according to a  urlLink CIA Web site , which also doesn't list any terrority that Israel seized during its wars as terroritory belonging to the country.) For this very simple paragraph, that makes Israel the child and the United Nations the mother. Now, the mother says don't do that. A good, respectful kid listens. Not Israel. They continue the trouble, like a bad kid.  Also, along this line: Israel is breaking a U.N. resolution to cease and desist their seige of Arafat's compound. Does this mean Bush is going to take up a war against Israel?  **  Most of my discussion regarding the Pennsylvania governor's race - pretty much just  urlLink Mike Fisher (R)   (Link is dead)  and  urlLink Ed Rendell (D)   (Link is dead)  - has been brewing for quite some time.   I could get into the other two, but seriously, they don't stand a chance. Unfortunately with the American government we are currently stuck with just two parties. What third parties do, is push their agendas and hope to get enough public support so that in the end, the two major parties implement Green, Libertarian, etc. issues.   I do have to mention The Philadelphia Inquirer  urlLink story  saying that the environment should be a big issue with this election. Will it be? So far it doesn't look like it. Also, for all the issues check out  urlLink IssuesPa .  What it has been about for quite some time is Rendell's track record with education in Philadelphia. He's been attacked for not having done anything about it and for letting the problem worsen. Well, guess what, if Ed Rendell didn't have to spend his time as mayor dealing with a nearly bankrupt city, he could have spent more time dealing with education. Or, he could have ignored the other more pressing matters and fixed education, only to have the entire city go under. There are trade-offs, this is not new. Because the city is now in a much better situation, education can be dealt with head on.  What is now facing Pennsylvania was what Ed Rendell faced in Philadelphia when he won the mayor's race. He turned the city around. Pennsylvania needs turned around. It has to clean up its environment; it has to balance its budget; it has to retain workers; and attract college students. All of these, sans the environment, were either directly or indirectly dealt with and changed due to Rendell when he served as mayor. How could someone with all of the experience needed for Pennsylvania be kept from the governor's position?  Am I glad Fisher filed a suit attempting to block the Hershey Chocolate sale? Yes. I'm glad he did it. The board can claim they didn't get a good enough asking price for the company, but the state and protesters cracking down on the board ultimately forced them to back down from the sale.  How does this qualify Mike Fisher for the serious job of turning a state around? I don't think it does. I am unable to attribute much of his work to my well being. I can attribute a lot to Ed Rendell. While not everyone reading this is in Philly and can say that, the people of Philly can. I don't want to say "take it from us," but we've had experience with the man and it went pretty well.  As for the issues of gambling and abortion stances, these don't affect me. I don't gamble, though I had a great time losing in Atlantic City once, and I don't have to worry about an abortion. More importantly, I pro-choice in 75% of all cases, limiting it or leaving it unchanged doesn't pull me in any direction.  There's a few other issues, but I have time to get to them. Election isn't until Nov. 5.  Also in the future, the music industry's big names are taking on music piracy in a big way, but honestly, they should just suck it up and work on changing their industry.

      So it seems I'm finally updating on a regular basis. I just had to work out a few kinks, but now I've got things working.  Something weird to ponder at  urlLink CNN.com   (Link is dead) .  Two points to make before my little tirade: It is possible for the United States to be on the offensive - against terrorism, countries deemed dangerous - without war. And, it's a good day because California is proposing a rail initiative to transport people rather than building more highways, thereby wasting land and most likely forcing people from their homes.  Today, I'm talking about the Israel-Palestine situation. I'm happy that Jews have a homeland all their own, one that has been given to them by their God and one which they inhabited for many centuries.  But they hardly seem to be good neighbors. Neither are the Palestinians, but give me a second. My understanding of the situation is that a religion got a country in an area that was divided by government, not religion. This is partly why religion and government don't mix. It never works. Sort of the like the failed creation of Yugoslavia. You don't take battling groups, make them neighbors and tell them to get along.  Palestinians also should clean up their act. Their religion is essentially born of Judaism - this is what your doing wrong, kind of thing. It goes beyond that, yes, but they all go back to Abraham and since they both have their start with the man, the Muslims must know that a certain land was given to the Jews.  Now that I have my overly simplistic - thereby slightly incorrect - beginning, let's move on to Israel's latest raid on Arafat's compound. It's a stupid move on Israel's part. It does nothing to further any process of peace and simply feeds the militant Muslims' desire for more suicide bombings. It also takes away Arafat's ability to maintain any kind of control, so how will he and his government stop future attempts? It can't. Israel is setting up the self-fulfilling prophecy that Arafat cannot control his people.  The most irksome aspect to the situation came across in a story I read today. The latest seige results from (and I quote) the "Tel Aviv bus blast claimed by Arafat's militant rivals..." Why not go after those rivals, the Hamas, instead of Arafat. Or even, why don't Arafat and Israel join to stop the Hamas?  If this group is Arafat's rivals, they aren't going to listen to him or his mandates. How can you suddenly go on the offensive against your attackers rival and not the attacker? Where is the mantra, the enemy of my enemy is my friend?  The second aspect to the Israeli attacks on Muslims comes from the same article. It's also happened many times previously, but I can only just now mention it. "... near the town of Rafah, on the Egyptian border, Israeli troops fired on stone throwers, killing 2 and wounding 25 others."  Stone throwers vs. guns. Does this sound extreme? Yes, it is. Does it only feed Arabs' hatred for Israel? Yes, it does.  So, in the end, nothing has been accomplished. Though, Palestinians' plea for help from the United Nations will hopefully result in something. The United Nations did create Israel, I think Israel needs to listen.  It also brought the expected terse and slightly empty yelling from the United States.  Well this has been especially short, but the next will deal with the governor's race in Pennsylvania and why Ed Rendell is better and Mike Fisher needs to admit this and move on.  I'm updateing to Mac OS 10.2 this weekend. That should be fun.  The bubonic plague was a nature's version of population control, and probably so is homosexuality.

      Just what exactly does Bush think he is doing?  Even after Iraq has decided to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to return - political ploy or not - Bush's actions are not necessary. What he is doing is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure in Iraq. A recent  urlLink article  in  urlLink  The New York Times  ' article reported that our Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, thinks the United States needs to take immediate action - essentially overstepping the U.N. Security Council - because Iraq could strike.  Seriously, why is Rumsfeld our Defense Secretary?   I've read in other columns that Saddam Hussein would be a fool to force a strike, and Saddam is not a fool. One wrong step and the United Nations and NATO - essentially the entire world - would come down on him swifter than the United States did in Afghanistan.  I'm also still waiting to hear exactly how this ties into the war on terrorism and when the United States was authorized to police the world on its own.  In the previously stated article Rumsfeld also makes a very vague reference to "a number of countries" who would help with United States's preemptive strike on Iraq. Britain is already in, this much is obvious. That leaves just one more country to make it plural, justify his statement and suddenly it seems the United States has broad international support. Odd, didn't every sane world leader just last week make calls for inspectors and not war?  Either someone is lying or those sane leaders were swayed by Bush's comments at the U.N. General Assembly.  I wonder how much longer Bush will ignore the protests against him all across his country - one is set for his Trenton visit - which maybe, just maybe, might make his political ploy backfire. He certainly hasn't brought any certainty back to the economy. I don't know if the economy is even a priority of his. Certainly the stock market isn't. Those numbers, which rule your 401(k) and set the tone for the world markets, continues its downward spiral each day that Bush brings his frail country to the brink of war.  I've recently taken to letter writing campaign to my U.S. Senators, you can do the same  urlLink here . Contacting my U.S. Representative has been less than fruitful. Apparently the only way to do so is through the mail, but recent account say land mail takes up to two weeks to get to the addressed person. Let your representatives know what you want, if enough people are against something, the official will have to sway to public opinion or lose reelection. Let's hope this is the case for Bush.  **  To spare Bush from my contempt - briefly - I do support his decision to not back down to Caterpillar and other heavy machinery manufacturers who want to lift the self-imposed nitrous oxide omissions cut they signed years ago.   I'm also happy that he is essentially our first leader to openly state - and repeatedly, no less - his desire for a Palestinian state. I just hope the latter hasn't been a ploy to win favor with Arabs and Muslims during the war on terror and human rights violations he and United States have committed stateside.

      OK, so the last post was rather long, I apologize. I'm slowly getting the hang of having all of this free space to fill.  It appears I'm on a slight environmental kick this week with this post and the last. Sure, I've got plenty to say about Bush, but thank god people like Colin Powell and Senator Biden from Delaware have working heads on their shoulders. They are more level-headed and are keeping me from going off about the Bush-Iraq situation since they propose more diplomatic methods to alleviate the confrontation, which I might add seem to be getting somewhere much quicker than "let's go blow the hell out of this country."  But today, I'm discussing the drought crisis and Philadelphia's desire for an exemption. I've been sitting on this one for a bit and now it's raining, but this is still fairly relevant.  While the city is making the partly legitimate excuse that because the water used is pulled from the bordering rivers and not groundwater, it should be exempt, it's still a very short-sighted excuse.  Just to be very brief: water works in a cycle. It fall to the earth, some seeps into the underground resevoirs and the rest runs off into streams and lakes. Underground resevoirs also feed rivers, so by pulling the same amount of water from rivers, the level still drops because less and less water is feeding the river.  A recent  urlLink story  that crossed my desk the other day reported on how urban sprawl is depeleting the water table. The  urlLink report   (Link has changed)  that led to the story put  Philadelphia in or just outside of the Top 10 sprawling cities in America that result in increased water table loss. It was also put in the Top 10 cities capable of saving land and thereby green space, through better development.  Where am I go with this? The city is partly responsible for the exacerbated drought and should take it's part in helping solve and alleviate the problem.  More importantly all levels of government should do something to fight drought. We're a wasteful society, this isn't news. It's not hard to cut back, yet we do only when forced to. Very few people apparently are learning much. Since this is a drought that has been around for at least a year and looks to continue, water restrictions should be kept regardless, both to alleviate the water crisis and work on bettering our mentality.  It also wouldn't hurt to to fight urban sprawl through all levels of government. Urban sprawl  prevents water loss because rainfall cannot get into the ground. Highways and parking lots drain water into pipes that empty the water into streams and rivers, not expanses of forests or lawns that need it. Yet highways grow at an astonishing rate and park lots, rather than parking garages, are the norm. If the billions of dollars that flowed into the production of highways and parking lots were put towards increasing density, more open land would form outside the cities, thereby feeding the water table. When will this happen? I have no idea.  We can only wait and see. And trust me on this one: You'll read stories in the paper or watch them on TV that say the most recent rain did little to help the drought situation. It's not difficult for people to conserve water on their own, by refraining from car washing or lawn watering (at least during the daytime) or long showers ... the list goes on. It's a start and from there, it's your voice that has to be heard at all levels of government, so without further ado:  You can find your state's officials at the state's Web site (most likely state.[postal abbreviation].us). Write to you U.S. Senators, after identifying them  urlLink here  and your U.S. Reps  urlLink here .  I do know that I'm voting for Ed Rendell for mayor (more about him in a later post), and urban sprawl and the drought should be made a serious issue in government. So regardless of who you're voting for and which race it is, let your government officials know what needs to be done, what matters to you, no the to business funding them.

      Thanks to the people who responded. Sure, you're all my friends, but someday, an outsider will join...   If you are interested in more reading about the last topic, check out the  urlLink City Paper 's recent series of articles finally (and still one of the few) raising the questions we need to ask and answering some of them.  I was hoping to spruce up the Web site a little bit, but I can't understand the code that put this thing together. Neither can Jigsha, so I figure it's not real code; I'll just deal with it for now. Someday, it'd be nice to have people respond to posts on the site, but, one step at a time, please.  Someday I'll also have lots of links jumping everywhere so that people online can practically stalk me and model themselves after me.  ** Well onto a less caustic post, which deals with my other interest: Cities and Urban Studies.  This week marks the beginning of a  urlLink pilot program ,  (Link is dead, alternate story at  urlLink  The Philadelphia Inquirer  ),  in Philadelphia that is run by the Fannie Mae Foundation that is trying to rebuild neighbors. Fannie Mae is officially known as a The Federal National Mortgage Association and is a quasi-governement entity that ticks a lot of other mortgage companies. Quasi-governmental organizations are difficult like that.  The program aims to bring people back into homes near transportation hubs, such as bus stops and rail stations. Noting the damage that cars have done to the American landscape and how they are congesting our cities, the ultimate purpose is to curb car use. It's finally time someone took notice of the traffic jams, deaths and fumes the car culture has caused in America. Bush would only like to increase oil dependency by killing the national rail system, but that?s a topic for another day.  Thankfully, Philly is still one of the few largely pedestrian-friendly cities left in America, and it looks like things will continue in that way if the pilot program works. Yeah, we can complain all we want about public transportation in the city, but it's convenience still beats car driving anyday. And seriously, less cars on the roads would only improve the transportation network because double-parked cars wouldn't block trolleys and jammed streets wouldn't prevent buses from making turns on their routes.  The savings add up both environmentally and financially. Imagine what you could do with the extra $20,000 or more (plus interest) you'd be able to keep and spend on any number of other things you need in your life. We're talking money saved for college (if you are one of the under 18 people who feel they need a car), for trips, for an actual home to own or rent in a nicer part of town. SEPTA might be the second most expensive base fare public transportation in the country, but any sensible person would just buy a TransPass. Instead of $1.60 per trip, you pay $18.75 for unlimited riding for a week. I buy a TrailPass each week to use Regional Rail to Trenton and I pay $34.50 a week for unlimited train, subway, bus and trolley rides. With the travelling I do, a motorist would spend twice that just on gas.  It doesn't make sense just wasting so much, including your time. Ever feel to tired to get up for work, then nap on the train or sleep in and eat breakfast on your way to work. When was the last time you read a good book? Read on the bus instead of moving at 25 mph with honking horns and drivers cutting you off. How about last minute meeting preparations, all while looking out the window at the snarled traffic you left behind. Furthermore, an increased use of public transportation doesn't mean giving up your car, if you don't want to. Chances are, if you live in suburbia near a transportation hub, you'll need to get to the hub, somehow. Most rail station make heavy use of parking, so you'd save on gas and insurance. It'd be nice if they were more like parking garages instead of eating up acres of grass, but I can't expect Utopia just yet.  Taking advantage of all of these benefits requires foresight and our country's mentality ignores a lot sometimes. It also doesn't help that automobile companies feed the car addiction with pointless vehicles like the ever deadly SUV. Cars are designed low to the ground because they are safer and more efficient that way, but no, let's raise the vehicle, making it less stable and less efficient and charge more money. I could better stand SUVs if they didn't show up in my city. How unnecessary are these gas-guzzling monsters?  I'll leave this for you to think about... (This is my take on a passage from the "EcoCities" book. I don't own the book, so I'm not sure of the exact wording, but you get the drift.")  All of those beautiful artistic commercials with the tinted-window vehicles driving through the wilderness, handling the turns and dangers so well: 100% of America used to look like the lush green back drop those cars drive against. But urban sprawl - a vicious cycle the car feeds - destroys it at an appalling rate. Replaces it with four lane highways. Kills it with fumes and other pollution. Buying more cars increases manufacturing with feeds all the above mentioned problems meaning that 100% continues to drop and drop...  ** A rather extreme group of people would like to see cars cut completely, an idea Richard Register pushes in his book  urlLink "Ecocities,"  but let's face it, that isn't going to happen. Curbing cars is a far more logical and plausible step.  Another book to check out, which is less extreme than Rogers is  urlLink "Asphalt Nation"  by Jane Holtz Kay.  Both are available at the bookstore I work at as well (Wow, that was a big advertisement.) If you're interested, it's the  urlLink AIA Bookstore  on 17th & Sansom. You might be able to order it on the web, but maybe not. We don't have everything up there. Oh, and I'm not really trying to be commercial, I'm just using lots of links because I can do that easily, and hopefully it'll feed traffic back to me at some point.

      Well everyone, welcome to my blog. This is just one big experiment that my friend Jigsha suggested because she didn't think I'd make it as a columnist for a newspaper. And like I could handle that job anyway.  I'd love to hear what you have to say about what I've written or even personal suggestions, pats on the back or vicious torrents against my ideals. I'm hardly HTML savvy, so just copy bswope@att.net and send me some feedback.  I guess I'll just start with a brief introduction. I'm a recently graduated Journalism major from  urlLink Temple University  in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - my new "hometown." I now work as a copy editor for  urlLink The Times  of Trenton. That basically means I do a lot of clean up, all while reading up to 20 stories a night. This gives me plenty to vent about - considering Bush is president and Sept. 11 is still being pushed around as an excuse for taking away privacy and civil liberties and instigating war with whomever we choose.  ** My latest complaint with America surrounds the Sept. 11 nonsense and how far British Prime Minister Tony Blair is up President Bush's ass. I guess they both go hand in hand seeing as how Bush's attempt to finish what his father failed all stems from the rather uncowardly attack on New York and Washington.   OK, so very conveniently a  urlLink story  comes across my desk about how Saddam Hussein is working to further his grasp on nuclear armaments. After weeks of no solid evidence, European nations refusing to stand behind Bush and protests on American soil. Does it seem a little convenient? Yes. I wouldn't have jumped to that conclusion so soon, but Blair is citing satellite photographs of construction at previous nuclear sites as evidence. Would Saddam be so obvious?   More importantly, let's say that Saddam does have weapons of mass destruction. What better reason does he have to use them then against an attack instigated by us? Sure, in the end Bush can say "I told you so," but then we'd have a large number of troops and others dead by radiation or whatever biological weapon Saddam chose to launch against us.  I'm also still waiting to find out exactly how he is going to justify an attack. Continuing with the presumption that Saddam has nuclear weapons how does that justify America's sudden tirade on the country? Hasn't he been "well behaved"? Bush has yet to provide any evidence linking  him to terrorism. Bush is just using our frenzy and energized and wrongly-placed "patriotism" to continue coming up with ways to take the attention away from his crumbling country and justify a wholly unneeded defense spending increase.  Why have our efforts been turned away from Afghanistan, al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden? When was the last time that was his goal in the newly expanded world policing efforts? Bin Laden's name only shows up in stories related to his terrorism network anymore and the random "Is he alive or dead" brief.  Bush has left so many open holes, the only way he'll be able to cover any of it up is to launch a full scale attack and leave America rallying for our win, because regardless of whether we support the effort or not, very few people are going to support a loss on our part. I should state now, as self-incriminating evidence, that should these "wars" escalate any further I am skipping any draft attempt made by the government.  ** As for Sept 11, it's hard for me not to be cold about it. It hasn't affected me in anyway except for loss of privacy and, though it hasn't happened yet, the government's ability to take my rights away from me for "special circumstances," which have yet to be fully put in ink. Since the attacks and the crumbling of the economy I have found a second job, one in my college major that I have used to put my former job as back up. I have received ample raises, am lowering my debt and getting along just fine. I'm actually better off now than I was one year ago. I only had to deal with the anthrax attack at one time and that was some extremist anti-Semite who was exploiting fear. That was during my time as editor in chief of the  urlLink Temple News .   Contrary to a rather annoying column published in the Sept. 8 issues of The Times of Trenton, I don't fear my mail. In fact, I got a job in Trenton where the original anthrax mail was sent from. I do not look up at planes wondering if they will crash into Liberty One or Two and I will not spend my life reliving that day. In fact, it won't even go down at one of the Top Ten most memorable days of my life.  Sept. 11 may have had more power in my life had things changed. But no, Americans became zealot patriots who only pushed their hatred and distrust of blacks, asians and whomever else we (dislike, distrust, etc.) onto anyone who they deemed of Muslim decent. America hardly stood united as many people have claimed. We pushed our hatred onto another group. We infringed on other people's rights to freedom, happiness and all the other fragile concepts deemed to our citizens in the Constitution. Our new found "patriotism" was quickly picked up by business and government interests who sold their wares - some, unfortunately, successfully - and destructively, respectively.   Do we need to hang the Red, White and Blue in our windows to be patriots? Did our Afghanistan mission need to be so extensive and forced? Did so many Afghanistan civilians have to die in our "successful" airstrikes. Did we have to muscle around the rest of the world into support for fear of them being deemed terrorist-friendly?  America hardly grew from the Sept. 11 experience. What it did do, ultimately, was cement a deep hatred for people who weren't like us, give us reason to direct our anger and ignorance at people who didn't deserve it and lead to the cancellation of Bill Maher's "Politically Incorrect."  Just to finish with more about my thoughts, David Letterman kicks Jay Leno's ass, Apple's are far superior to Wintels and please give up your car for public transportation or railway whenever possible.  Has all of this maybe been a little bit choppy? Did my logic jump some? Well, it's 2:15 on a Sunday morning. More later. Brian

      Happy Halloween!!  Maybe, maybe not. The following  urlLink story from  The Times of Trenton  , which in the beginning few grafs, refers to canceled or almost canceled Halloween events because parents complained for religious reasons. The story focuses more on safety this time of year, but also from living and talking to the "male parental unit" in my family I know that there are others out there with the preposterous religion claim.  So what follows is a defense of the holiday. Not that it needs any. In the United States it's lost all meaning and has become a time for chocolate and a reason for toilet papering the neighbor’s trees. I guess throwing eggs at people can be fun to.  Vampires, witches and ghosts, none of these are related to the Devil. Witches can be, but their origination is a pagan past and they fall into the good and bad categories.  So let's say you want to look beyond the glossed over holiday version. You'll have to go back more than 2,000 years to the Celts and their Druid priests. Celts definitely weren’t Satanic, of course they weren't Christian either, which is where most the complaints of religious questionability start, I'm sure.  The Celts believed that on their day of Samhain - not our Oct. 31 - the dead would return to Earth. Now depending on the where you want to take your information ( urlLink The History Channel  or  urlLink History and Customs of Halloween , or any other myriad of choices) the scary costumes were part of a fortune telling rite or a way to scare the dead from possessing people.  The Roman conquest of much of Europe by 100 A.D., merged Samhain with the Roman holiday of Feralia, which also honored their dead, and the following day to honor Pomona, the Roman god of fruits and trees.  Following the rise of Christianity, Pope Boniface IV created a Catholic holiday to honor the dead and probably replace a pagan holiday. Without going to far on a tangent, the Christian Church incorporated a lot of holiday to coincide with pagan and other religious days as a way of incorporating new followers.  Trick-or-treating actually started as a Christian addition to the earlier festival, according to the  urlLink Customs site.   The Jack O'Lantern began as a legend, but it's purpose was to scare away evil spirits, according to the  urlLink History Channel site.   All of this doesn't seem evil at all, and it makes for one evening.  So what's all the ho-hum about? Nothing. People who aren't as educated as they think about something that spans 2 millennia.  Sure, some things have gotten out of hand, but that's hardly reason to kill of a holiday or ruin it for anyone. It's actually a great learning experience. This is one of the few blogs that required me to do serious research and checking and double checking of facts and there's more interesting stuff, I’m sure.  And so to the associate pastor of the Fountain of Life evangelical church in  The Times  story, it’s hardly a "glorification of Satan’s kingdom," when the U.S. version is based on money and chocolate and when the real Halloween was about scaring away evil to protect one's self.

      Well, what a weekend, both personally - blah, blah, blah - and internationally with an antiwar protest spanning the globe.  What I have to say today is indirectly related to said protests. It's about a 33-page document titled  urlLink "National Security Strategy of the United States."   The New York Times  has a lengthy  urlLink article  covering it. Unfortunately the page will force to you view an MSN ad. I apologize.  The United States' regime (hey, the Rev. Jesse Jackson referred to Bush that way just this weekend) has taken the stance that this country is No. 1 and  will not accept challenges to its authority.  Wow.  Where is the reality? Where is the levelheadedness? Why did we not take the events of Sept. 11, 2001 and afterwards as a wake up call, that this kind of attitude was not acceptable last century and isn't in the 21st Century?  The problem that the fundamental Islamic nations have with the United States  is this exact mindset. The problem they have is the walking all over the globe asserting American  beliefs and our way of life on cultures that: a) don’t share these views and b) don’t understand these views.  In our bid to be No. 1, to rule the globe, we shove capitalism down everyone's throats like it's the only way, like it's the correct way. Guess what, it's not. Capitalism results in race and class clashes. Capitalism is why the minimum wage is $5.25 per hour and why  urlLink the average CEO makes 411 times the salary of an average worker.   I'm not a religion buff, but capitalism sure goes a long way to killing religion as well, something that doesn't go over very well with fundamental religious nations or sects, militias and whomever wants a nation based on religion.  Capitalism is why the environment comes third or fourth on a list and the dollar comes first. Capitalism is why I have to turn on the radio and hear created boy bands.  Capitalism does have some good points to it, but this is pure capitalism we’re talking about, not the mixed (add any other -ism) version that is more true to life.  More importantly, doesn't this whole mindset seem a little anticompetitive and don't we have laws in this country to stop that because it's wrong? Also, doesn't the stance have a ring of anticapitalism to it? Ah, the confusion that is the United States.  Isn't is also quite obvious from the Saturday protests that many people within in this country and elsewhere do not support such actions?  I am not saying that this country suddenly needs to drop its stance and let everyone else walk over us. Hardly.  In a world of diplomacy and understanding (the ever-impossible Utopia) military supremacy isn't needed. More diplomacy and less muscle-headed force means a lot less confrontation. In turn less of a need for military and in turn more money to put to the failing education system that is the United States. Not to mention a hundred other other forgotten facets of the United States’ budget.  In closing, all I'm saying is that our might could be better expressed and better used. With our might, we should be a leader in cutting pollution and fixing the environment. As a leader we should raising up other peoples, countries, technologies, whatever rather than doing the opposite.  My god, do I sound like an aging hippie? I need to get away from the computer, sit back and listen to some Beatles...

      The media’s relationship with the those that feed it and read it never ceases to amaze me.  2 perfect examples:  1) ‘76er Allen Iverson’s expletive laden tirade last season when he went back and forth between attacking the media’s coverage of him, and then offering understanding, saying the journalists were just doing there job.  This just highlights the celebrity/media relationship, which usually is fairly aggressive and abusive to each other. Take Michael Jackson’s “Leave Me Alone” song from the  Bad  CD. In it, and in subsequent similar songs or subsequently inferior CDs (after  Dangerous ), Jackson takes on the media’s “lies.” In actuality, Jackson fed quite a number of stories to the tabloids. Namely the hyperbaric chamber story. There’s others I’m sure, but that’s one that I’m certain of from reading.   A recent anthrax story dealing with American Media (aka  The Enquirer, Star,  etc.) a year later quoted the editor who said that a majority of their stories come right from the horse’s mouth. Not a surprise, when you think about it.  2) The authorities behind the sniper case have been back and forth on their media relationship. One day criticizing the media for reports on the tarot card and another day making very public pleas (i.e. press meetings for TV, radio and newspaper) to the sniper and calling on all media to get the word out.  Guess how the media is supposed to work in the United States? It’s not a government entity. The media reports on what there is to report (for the most part.) It’s not a pick and chose thing. ***  While on the sniper story, let me share my outrage with TV media on this night, as the sniper case unravels for the whole world to see.   1) CNN and Philadelphia’s Channel 6 ABC, you are reporters. You are talking to other reporters. You are not experts, don’t posit theories and make assumptions because then it’s not news, it’s  speculation (which can be lies) and it’s the reason that the media has lost it’s credibility. It’s also why in my Theories of Communication final project, my research showed that TV news is seen as the least credible now, was not very credible before and no one expects it’s credibility to improve.  If a news entity has an ‘expert’ there, then ask these questions of the person. But if one isn’t present, it’d serve the media entity better to just shut up and report what is known.  2) Channel 6 ABC, in all of its zealous bid to break the unraveling story first, made a big boo-boo. Above an info graphic, which listed the names of the 2 suspects and license plate number for the car they were last seen in, was the erroneous title: Suspects. Err, wrong. They were ‘material witnesses’ and after a commercial break the station had to make an apology.  Furthermore, every station on TV was reporting on the situation as if the 2 were suspects who were on the run. This may turn out to be the case, but that’s the future and the future isn’t news. It will be later, but report on the news happening now and that’s it.  Also, should they turn out to not even be legitimate 'material witnesses' then all the speculating will be more incorrect (if that's possible) and the entire segment of coverage can be blasted for any number of things from bias to racism to unethical journalism.  The negatives seem to outweigh the positives, but will that stop anyone?

      I'm stepping out of the urban, liberal setting for a brief jaunt through the mass-suburbia, conservative world of Lancaster County. When I return, and following a much-needed Tuesday Happy Hour, I'll have something to put on the site.

      Hmm, well there’s plenty of political shit to go on about, but I need to get this  urlLink story  through from  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution  because it goes off on Sunday or Monday.  It deals with green architecture in Atlanta. More specifically, in educational institutions in that area. The notable aspect to this?   There's 2. First,  urlLink Metropolis  magazine listed that city as one of the 100 worst inventions/things of the last century because of it's sprawl and maybe because the city seems rather boring - both go hand in hand. Second, it's generally the cash-strapped educational institutions that are leading the way with sustainable architecture in the city.  God, if only Temple University had done this with its newest dorm and Student Center renovations.  Putting sustainable architecture in these venues serves as a teaching tool for students at the school. While it’s also more expensive at first, the building pays for itself over the years with utility savings. Also, how else does a technology advance? By being used, tested and studied so improvements can be made.  More importantly, these buildings make for interesting settings, something cool to show off to students and parents. It gives a cutting edge to cookie cutter cities and cities which are lacking. This technology can put a city map.  I hardly expect Philadelphia to suddenly pick up cutting-edge technology and do something to increase the city’s status - it’s part of the Quaker mentality battling the (thankfully) Democratic mentality.  OK, so there’s the new Robert Stern building, which takes the environmentally conscious route, but not as far as it could go.   One aspect of sustainable architecture obviously is energy saving; the other side of it was covered by Metropolis magazine, but the story isn’t available. That story covered Toyota’s facilities in California and how they took sustainability to the extreme. While it’s not available, a basic breakdown is available at the car company’s  urlLink Web site  under the headline “Campus building expansion showcases...”  The second side covers materials and where they come from. It’s safer, more environmentally friendly to rehabilitate old buildings rather than demolish them. It’s friendlier to use local wood or stone rather than have wood cut from a forest or stone mined and transported here from other countries.  Toyota is also an auto industry leader with environmentally friendly cars. Where Ford has failed and other companies have delayed, they are pushing the technology and setting higher standards for sales.  At least a company is looking to protect their investment for the future.  One other company doing this BP, whose solar power devision sees a huge market and is taking advantage of it now.  While yes, I generally dislike cars, it’s nice to go for a ride/drive when I make my way back to sprawling Lancaster County, but American cars have generally gone bland.   My sister is all about Volkswagen and besides them, it’s the Japanese manufacturers with the interesting cars and the more interesting commercials. All of this because they are a more interesting company.   And I’m not just hawking this now. My insane green mentality is really only a few years old - since I came to Philly and learned there wasn’t anything worth my time outside of urban life (except the occasional trip to see the night sky and breathe slightly better air) - but I've felt this way for quite some time.

      Well, I've got more coming  shortly, but for now a nice little link to a copy cat attempt gone horribly wrong.   Microsoft attempted to do an "Apple to Windows" switch ad, but as  urlLink reported  at The Register, the company had to pull it for ethical reasons.

      OK, so I said I would have something yesterday, but it's here today. Sort of like at  The Times  when deadline is 9:30 p.m., but stories still come in at 11, and when layout for the first zone is 10:30, but the papers doesn't hit the presses until midnight.  The  urlLink race story  covers Unity Day at Rider University and the story is only available for 2 weeks. Now, I'm about to go out on a limb, but the part I'm commenting on covers religion. Spanish actor/activist Edward James Olmos told the crowd about a speech he made at Brigham Young University. He made the audacious (!) claim that Jesus was a man of color and half of the auditorium walked out on him.   Olmos' reasoning: "since Jesus lived on the Mediterranean and was a Jew, and since the first Jews were from North Africa, he could not have been white." Makes sense to me, but I guess that takes part of the superior nature away from the white population.   "Dogma," makes the assertion that Jesus was a black man, maybe not completely accurate, but it still touches on the issue of color and it gives a reason to put Chris Rock in as "Rufus, the 13th Apostle."  Just to keep myself out of hot water on that issue: While Egypt was part of Africa, there is a definite difference between the color/race of Egyptians and those living in the rest of Africa.  More importantly, Olmos' statement still stands: Jesus was a Jew and Jews originated in Middle East.  "Dogma" also makes the correct the statement that God isn't male or female. God is just "I am." Of course this doesn't fit into a lot of other religions so well, but lets stick with most gods being generally sexless.  Without jumping to heavily into conspiracy theory, which I read on occasion, there are plenty of other choices for religion's basis. The last part of  urlLink  Rule By Secrecy   covers alternative creation themes. Since I'm all about having options, I really enjoyed this portion of the book because of it's challenges. But, more importantly, it weaves a common theme through at least 4 civilizations, 2,000 years and at least 3 different languages.  And just so no one thinks I'm a crazy conspiracy type: I support teaching creationism in schools. I think that if people look hard enough - open their minds or whatever - the two can help explain each other to a point.   Olmos also decries a United States without a national holiday for people of color. He notes the one day: Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which has to be a catch-all for the man different people living here.  I'm not sure if Native Americans actually have holidays, but it would make sense that if they did, something would filter into the holiday calendar for the country. A Mexican holiday other than Cinco de Mayo would be nice as well, wouldn’t it? Sure, $1 Coronas are nice, but there's a little bit more to it than that.  Of course, a lot of the citizenry's ignorance comes from a failed public school system that doesn't attribute significant contributions to people other than whites. Blacks get a few, but from there it completely drops off.  More importantly what do our schools teach us regarding our neighbors? What do people really know about Canada and Mexico? Thank some higher power for my history classes in college, which both got closer to real history than anything I've previously had. I actually finished a full year of history at Temple learning that some of the stuff I was taught before was wrong. Only in our education system could this happen.  Does this 'great' (ha) country have far to go or what?  Oh, and I welcome everyone to the beginning of a long, drawn out confrontation with Iraq, which will certainly expand to more of the Middle East and most certainly we will feel backlash on our soil.  OK, so I've spread rather far from the beginning, but I did a half-ass job weaving it all together, right?

      Just to clarify my oil drilling stance: Democrats have all but successfully kept it off the Energy Bill for this session, but the bill is still being debated. Republicans conceded defeat on the oil issue, allowing them to move on to other topics in the bill.  Wednesday’s big  urlLink story  was CIA Director George Tenet’s assertion that Saddam would not attack first. What made this big is that it seems a departure from Bush’s pre-emptive attack stance, yet Bush’s PR guy Ari Fleischer asserts that this is what Bush feels as well.  I’ve been saying this since the beginning: What better reason to give Iraq for using their weapons than to instigate them? In the end, will Saddam probably have weapons to use on U.S. troops, most likely. And will their be deaths resulting from this? Most likely.  But there are protocols and laws that have to be followed and that means going in with inspections first. Without laws and protocols there is anarchy, which isn't any better.  I wanted to get into some other things, but working 60 hours a week doesn’t leave me with much time.  There’s some stories from tonight’s paper I wanted to say something about, but we didn’t get off to the press (note the singular, my paper is NOT major) in time because of the breaking story with the latest death in the Washington, D.C. area sniper shootings.   Today was also a horrible day on Wall Street and I’m convinced that everything I own stock will continue plummeting more than others, just because. I know sitting and waiting it out is the way to go, but Christ, do we really need to go this low?  Tomorrow’s topic will cover race, and issue I haven’t gotten into here very much, but the story that I’m dealing with raises some serious issues that I can’t say were ever gone over in any of my many race classes at Temple.  Of course, I wasn’t about to bring them up, I fall more to the Socialist (oh god, the FBI will be watching now) viewpoint and think race confuses the larger issue: class.  With that can of worms open, good night!  P.S. I'm not sure what the screw up is that immediately follows this paragraph, but I can't edit it. Somehow my edit link takes me to  The New York Times  link. Weird.

      An almost brush with fame: Kevin Smith's new movie "Jersey Girl" was filming just a block away from my bookstore. I didn't see anyone really famous, of course, except some extras, but they were there, I know it! They also started shooting at the insane hour of 7 a.m., which doesn't work for me.  Personally, I'm a fan of "Dogma," though it obviously is short of many of the things that made his previous movies cult hits. That's what I get for jumping on the wagon late.  Today, let’s consider my topics briefs, though the total length of them may get unbearable. It’ll help to come back repeatedly after small breaks of reading something more fun.  1. President Bush is now  talking of overthrowing the Iraq government and instituting one of our very stable regimes. Sunday’s AP story quotes Bush: “Should force be required to bring Saddam to account, the United States will work with the other nations to help the Iraqi people rebuild and form a just government.”  Let’s pause for just a second. Yugoslavia, fell apart and not just (see Slobadan Milosevic). Israel destabilized the area; just, depends on whom you ask. Afghanistan, still in its infancy as a puppet regime, but stable doesn’t seem to be exactly it. Just, we have to wait and see.  Hmm, I wonder what could possibly go wrong with setting up reestablishing a government in Iraq with 3 very distinct groups of people.  2. A recent  urlLink General Accounting Office report  has found that the government has been taking more time responding to Freedom of Information Act requests, even though fewer are being made. FOIA is a 1966 law that make the government more open. It’s obviously been used extensively by the media, but it is available to anyone.   The law is to provide openness because that what a democracy, or whatever it is we are supposed to live in, thrives on. Information. While, yes, the public in general has probably taken the opportunity to ignore or be apathetic,  that certainly isn’t the case with many of us.  While most amendments to the act have benefited the public, the Regime has not been so open. The story from my newspaper isn’t available online, but a similar  urlLink  Washington Post story   noted  urlLink John Ashcroft’s new policy , which asks:  “Any discretionary decision by your agency to disclose information protected under the FOIA should be made only after full and deliberate consideration of the institutional, commercial, and personal privacy interests that could be implicated by disclosure of the information.”   It goes further to say that for “significant issues,” the Department of Justice should be consulted. The JD will also back any denials that have a “sound legal basis,” which in this day and age could be anything.  “Significant issues” is terribly vague and unlike with the Legislature where vague is good and open to interpretation by the courts, vague in this sense is not.  It should also be noted that Bush is backing legislation that creates “a new exemption to protect information provided by businesses on ‘critical infrastructure’ that could be a possible target for terrorists.” That is from  The Times  story, which goes on to add that critics contend business could use it to keep problems secret. Only in a time of shady account practice would Bush give businesses more blankets to hide under.  If our government is based on being open, on being informed; if this government is supposed to be of, by and for the people, then include the people. Inform the people. Don’t push our country continually away from the people and into the hands of the elite and the business.  And...  3. Oil drilling in Alaska thankfully failed in the Senate. Links to the story are difficult, but as part of the 2002 Energy bill, Republicans tried to open up part of the  urlLink Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . The story states that Republicans are looking to curb America’s thirst for “foreign oil.” Why not curb our thirst for oil completely? Because America is the largest energy hog, cutting back our use in general gives us more bargaining power, should we need it. But no, let’s just transfer our thirst onto other countries.  Also, according to the  urlLink Energy Information Administration , the United States imports more oil from Canada (9.6%) then from Saudi Arabia (7.5%).  Why is this even a discussion? Because shortsighted people are only looking ahead to next year, not the next decade or the next century.  What better time than now, when we have room to play, to get moving along with renewable energy resources, which many are still in their infancy with providing a significant portion of our energy manufacturing. When is there a better time to start to pound into our heads energy conservation? Why doesn’t it? Because conservation doesn’t bring in money to the government or to business.  I for one do not want to pay the price for shortsighted politicians, nor do I want other generations to pay the price. It’s time to wake up.

      Some promised links:  Here is the  urlLink story  that has popped up a few places about the music industry's big names taking on music downloads in full-page newspaper ads. How much good will it do and are the artists taking on the wrong people?   Also, a very interesting Microsoft note. The company has, so far this year, released 57(!) security patches to its software. How is that they are so dominate and pervasive in the computer world? I have no idea. That's more than one a week.  And finally a  urlLink story  from  The New York Times  regarding urban sprawl.  Just a quick line from the story to make you want to read the rest: While the nation's population grew 17% from 1982 to 1997, the amount of land turned into urban areas increased 47%.   I hope many of links still work. Most news sites, such as  The Philadelphia Inquirer  and  The New York Times  force payment for stories older than 2 weeks. Most of the rest should work. I'll try to leave notation beside broken links or look for free versions at random Web sites. I pick the "objective" news sites first, but in the end, to keep a link going, I may need a "subjective" site.

      OK, so here I go with the music the industry. It sucks, it’s getting worse and because of it we have to listen to Creed, N’Sync and Shania Twain among nearly 1,000 others.   I have to wonder why more people continue trying to break into the music scene. Very few are actually presenting a solution. I understand the lure of money, but can we be more obvious? The Spice Girls. The Britney clones - all who have fallen to the way side even though one or two have more talent than her? N’Sync - the Backstreet Boys clone and then the many who followed and failed as well. This is all just about the quick buck as, within 5 years, they’ve gone from top to bottom.   Why don’t the record labels get it when they see the Beatle’s  Anthology  series and subsequent No. 1 CDs top the chart for weeks. The year  Anthology  were released, the Beatles were the biggest selling act. Not a single new group could touch them! Elvis’ new greatest hits package is debuting at No. 1 across the world.    When will people wake up? Madonna is still bigger than most new hit makers. Maybe not in terms of sales - at least not in the United States - but she still has drawing power, after 20 years.   I was really refreshed when I heard Eminem's new CD would finally street. His no-holds barred, tell it like it is style was desperately needed and it's acceptance by fans definitely said most of the people were ready to move beyond the Sept. 11 rememberance that is finally giving way.   I'll post some links later, but it's 2:13 p.m. and I have to go to work.   The following  urlLink CNN story  deals with the death of good music because of the radio. The story has been instigated by Tom Petty, a real rock ‘n’ roller who’s been at it for a more than 20 years. He has a new CD coming out and on it, he laments the death of good music. He attributes it pretty heavily to the conglomerization of radio and to the entertainment industry itself.   My biggest beef is the capitalist society and desire to feed the shareholders’ and CEO’s pockets with cash and not the listener’s/buyer’s ears with something worth listening to. $18.99 for mediocre CD with one good song; you've got to be kidding.   I find it hard to believe that the music industry refuses to change when it’s basis has always been so radical. I know things are supposed to grow and mature, but at least keep the cool.   Napster has not had the affect on the industry that the RIAA and others claim. The downturn in sales has dropped because very little is worth paying for at the prices they set. I worked at tower for nearly a year and the CD the customer bought, was $6 or $7 more than what the store charged. I wasn't making that money. They paid minimum wage. Where'd the money go?   Let’s also not forget that the economy is down, so don’t blame every problem on Napster and it’s many clones. If you’re actually raising the price of CDs and dropping singles at the same time, you have to expect fans will find alternative means for getting what they want.   Way back when - the early ‘90s - singles still carried the main radio play song and one or two songs from the album, making it a decent sampler. Releasing the radio hit and 4 remixes of the same song doesn’t tell the buyer what to expect on the full album. Nor do remixes interest 90% of the population.   Napster did get out of hand with entire CDs being copied. I admit, I’ve copied a few CDs, mostly just trying to move from tape to CD with the cost and if there’s a completely new artist I have an interest in, it’s nice to get a full dose of it. I have bought plenty of CDs through my experience at Napster, so the industry really doesn’t have anything going for their claim.   How else are people supposed to be introduced to new music? Radio surely doesn’t play anything new and groundbreaking, nor does it play 99% of the old stuff, just a few hundred songs are played from a catalog of tens of thousands. Doesn’t seem fair. And of course it isn’t. But the CNN story makes a point. You’ve got to pay for what you want now. Essentially the free radio world is dead. I can only open that Clear Channel really takes a hit from what they caused.   I also think artists give into much. It certainly isn't just the industry. Mandy Moore did know who she was supposed to look like, sing like and rip off. Courtney Love’s recent battle was refreshing. Her support by many in the industry has shown there is a serious problem, but who will continue the battle now? Tom Petty, Lenny Kravitz and Sheryl Crow have put their views in their latest CDs but other than that, things seems fairly dead. Some panel was supposed to look into the industry’s practices, but that was a story that passed my desks 2 months ago and no news from it.   Just a side bar to the industry and the government. When the artists were fighting the "Parental Advisory" label, where were the labels? When the artists call for the government to step in and investigate practices, does anyone really think the panel will do much?   Industry ownership of an artist's catalog has definitely worked to kill off creativity. I’m a true believer that the CEO doesn’t need to make diddly squat. He’s not writing, producing or arranging anything. In fact, it doesn’t seem that any of the people actually running the industry have ever put out a CD. I might be wrong about that, but I’m doubting it.   While I know it’s fad, I praise the artists who sell their CDs through their own Web sites or who make some their music available over the Web for free. It’s a radical concept which is just what the entertainment industry needs to rejuvenate itself. A non-conglomerization shake up would be nice to.   Just one last random rant: I really hate that radio stations fail to introduce their music anymore. Obviously, since they limit the the play list, most of the music is known, but occasionally, there’s that blissful tune that perks your ear and it’s not mentioned...   Video didn’t kill the radio star: they both killed the rock star.

      It's been a little bit since I added anything, and believe, my list of things is growing by the day: music industry rubbish, bad media conglomerization (my own word, I think) and of course the Regime of the U.S.A.   I've finally gotten OS 10.2, so I've ben figdeting with that, rather than putting together half-insightful, half-obvious posts. But more will come. And now it seems, I've taken my commentary Web site and turned it into mindless rambling, but focus will return. If you're new, read my old stuff, if not, wait patiently...

      Let me be surprising for a second and berate the United Airlines mechanics for not taking a bit of a pay cut. Do pay cuts suck? Yes. I may have to deal with the same thing if my internship ends without a hire.   Personally, i think if you work for a company, you should have some loyalty to it.  urlLink United  has claimed that no concessions from the mechanics will force the company into bankruptcy.  If that happens, the mechanics might end up jobless and without any money.  I’m rather on the fence when it comes to unions. I doubt I’ll ever join one because I’ll only work at a place I enjoy and where I am treated fairly. If the company doesn’t fit these criteria, then I leave and I leave loud - Tower Records on Chestnut Street changed the employee handbook after Jenn and I quit and the Better Business Bureau got a letter from me; The manager at Structure vowed I would never be allowed work in the store (maybe the company) again, but I ended up returning briefly after his incompetence (which I told him and the company about) led to his departure.  I’ve stayed at the AIA Bookstore because I enjoy working there and they treat me with respect and have adequate pay raises.  So why join a union? You pay dues - on top of taxes - to an organization pushing for what you deserve - or don’t, which is the problem I have with them.   For example, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority union drivers battled it out with the beleaguered public transit and threatened to shutdown service a few years ago. Guess what brilliant people - SEPTA is already a cash strapped organization, it has been and it will be for awhile because public transit receives less support than it needs, but that’s another post. Fighting for pay raises and more health benefits doesn’t help the company as it struggles to close a deficit.  Take concessions or flat hikes now and when the company is faring better, make that your main point. But don’t put your employer in jeopardy.  I should add that all of this is in the gray and not black and white. If the blue collars are taking concessions or flat hikes, then the same should go for the white collar worker.  That’s the case with United: Management took a 10% cut and pilots cut 18% and additional unions will soon be voting on concessions.  Now that I’ve taken a swipe at blue collar, let me praise a  urlLink corporate association  that would like to see new tax cuts for individuals rather than businesses. President Bush is expected to announce a tax cut plan in the coming weeks that may surely do this, should he hope to get it through the Senate where GOP majority is not enough to guarantee passage.  Middle- and low-income people could really use the money. The rich are complaining because they can’t afford 2 houses and a yacht, meanwhile some in the United States are in jeopardy of losing their only home and their debt could very quickly crush them. I know I’m partially in that category with 5 years of college loans dropping on me in just a few weeks.  Last year’s emergency IRS refund helped how many people? E-mail me if it did. How many  people actually got the refund? E-mail me if you did.  I know it did nothing for me. Surprisingly I’m not part of the rich the GOP generally favors.  For starters, Bush’s last tax plan was irresponsible because he’s already thrown the country back into deficit budgeting. His last tax plan was an eery reminder of former President Regan’s trickle-down stimulus package that didn’t.  Fortunately, some of the ideas being tossed around could help: put more people into the lowest 15% tax bracket or cut social security taxes from the first $10,000 made - something that helps both workers and businesses, which isn’t so bad.  Hmm, I’m stopping rather abruptly,  but then even a small part of big corporate America asking to pass the tax cuts to the workers rather than themselves is shocking.  Plus, I need to head to the job. Forgive editing errors, I'm running on a tight schedule today.

      Well, before I run out of time. Happy Turkey Day and bah humbug!   Piss off an animal-hugger and eat turkey, even if you're vegan.  This was quite a different Thanksgiving for me. My first ever working. What am I thankful for this year? I'm not working at the AIA Bookstore this Black Friday. But the week up til now has been hectic. Thankfully - and maybe not - our store has been kicking ass as other chains have been pulling their hair out. So I've had a hectic week already. But, I'll get reacquainted with it Monday. Til then, it's just the newspaper.  OK, pointless rambling done. I have a post for tomorrow, but none of the links are available on the Internet yet - that's how ahead I am this time - so you'll have to wait a bit.

      OK, the following is a heavily edited version of my previous post; All thanks to Jigsha. Writing about race can be a difficult thing, because it’s such a point of contention in society.I tried tackling it with less than stellar result, but now, hopefully a bit better. *** Let me just state for the record that racism is wrong. It’s generalizating, which is wrong. Stereotypes hurt people, both the perpetrator and the victim.  But, people are free to dislike each other. It happens; people clash. It creates tension but that can be productive. And let’s be serious: Stereotypes, racism, sexism, etc. - it isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. To think it is is naive. That’s Utopia and Utopia doesn’t happen.  On the subject I have 2 stories to point out. The first is from my old paper, the  Temple News . The  urlLink opinion piece  asserts that anti-Israel sentiment (as in its treatment of and actions against Palestinians) is too often made to look like anti-Semitism (which is religion based and therefore racism on some level).  This is wrong because because it throws non-racist views into a racist light. Rather than building up a cause, it undermines the cause.  Some are saying they hate Jews. But most just find Israel’s policies to be harsh, wrong, oppressive - the list goes on and on.   The people who are bombing in Jerusalem are racist. Osama bin Laden is racist. Throwing people who disagree with Israel’s policies into the bunch with bin Laden and bombers is ignorant.  Without jumping to stories and other Web pages, awhile back several pro-Israel groups protested  The Philadelphia Inquirer  because they felt the paper had a pro-Palestine stance. Their reasoning: Stories covering the plight of the Palestinians were placed front page, while some stories dealing with attacks on Jews were placed deeper inside.  I often wonder how many people understand how the media works. For starters, it sounds cold, but 8 deaths in Israel does not get the same placement in the  Inky , or any other U.S. paper, as 3 deaths in New Jersey, which doesn’t get the same placement as 2 deaths in Philadelphia. It’s called impact and proximity.  Also, poverty and lockdown of an entire town or people gets better placement than the burial of 5 victims of a bus bombing.  It’s not being racist. It’s just how the media works.  The second story covers the  urlLink black boycott of the Philadelphia  Daily News  . For those who don’t know, the  Daily News  is the area’s daily tabloid. It's sensational - just a step shy of supermarket tabloid, at times.  On Sept. 12, 2001 its front page called for war, this was before any facts were publicly substantiated. It was irresponsible.  On Aug. 22 of this year, the  News  ran a cover story on fugitives at large in Philadelphia. The cover photo was a montage of 18 murder suspects, all were minorities. The story covered 41 at-large suspects. Black community leaders were outraged by the cover and a boycott has followed.  I agree that the cover was in poor taste, only because the lack of whites on the front cover went unexplained. This could have been banked on by the paper and could have prevented the outcry. The truth is Philly had no white murder fugitives at large so there were no pictures to include. Could the paper have chosen a different crime for the front cover? Yeah, but what's more important - catching murderers or car theives?  A  urlLink  Los Angeles Daily News  columnist  summed this up and more.  In the end, the story led to the arrest of 2 of the suspects. One by the tipster, the other by himself.  So if the newspaper was strictly reporting the facts how can it be racist? There was no bias.  You could make the statement that racial profiling is wrong but still leads to arrests and so the arrests aren't more important than the message. But this is different. With highway drug busts and other actions falling under the profiling headline, at least there are whites or other races available to pull over and arrest. This wasn’t the case in Philadelphia with murder suspects.  To close out the conversation, the fight for equality has unfortunatly stalled. Too many interest groups are out for their own agenda, not a broad-based one. Why did the civil rights movement succeed? Because millions of blacks and other racial groups came together with no boundaries. It was on the national and state front. It was in the legislatures and the courts. The media took it into every home.  Now it's fragmented. It's here or there, rarely both. And false claims of racism only hurt the movement. It is possible for a white person to not hire a black person for a number of reasons and not be racist - and vice versa.

      Blah, Blah, Blah. I promised more, but this past week has me whooped. A 65-hour week and 26 of those are in a retail job that is gearing up for the holidays. I'll become more cynical and testy as time goes on. Until then, give me some feedback, I'll feed off that for a bit. Give me a few days, I'll be back in full force, or full whimper, whatever it is you consider my posts.

       Osama bin Livin’   Do you really need a link to any of the stories covering this topic? I hope not.  Did the revelation shock anyone? I hope not.  WARNING!  Extreme position ahead. It's from an academic point of view. I do not necessarily support any of the events I discuss. ***  The truth of the matter is that Bush's war on terrorism, regardless of what he says, is hardly a success. Yes, arrests have been made. Yes, assests have been frozen. And yes, outside funding has been intercepted.  But al-Qaida is a fragmented group. It's largely autonomous. Making Osama bin Laden the No. 1 man to get would have proved pointless if the United States had captured him.  One would also have to wonder how much he knows about all of his cells, considering they are mostly autonomous and sleepers. More importantly affiliated terrorists groups have their own agenda and plans.  I think what was probably the most shocking aspect to the released tape is why it didn't come sooner. He could accomplished a hell of a lot more if he'd made his life known at more strategic times.  But what do I know. The entire terrorist thinking is beyond me.  Not to be obvious, but the Sept. 11 attacks were not the way to go if you want to bring a country to its knees. Especially not the United States. It was a little hiccup that really lasted a few weeks. It's effect lingered on, but it was back to business as usual for the most part.   Did it work well as a wake up call? It could have. But I won’t go into that. I've dealt with all of it in previous posts.  What it did do was bring the whole world down on the terrorist networks. What it did was force sides, there was no middle ground in a stance on the attacks. And it was suicide in itself to not support action against the network.  So after the arrests and thwarted attacks why didn't bin Laden come forward and taunt the Operation Whatever The Hell It Was Called?  It would have done 10 times more than what the attacks did. It would  have underminded the operation and Iraq couldn't have been used as a way to divert attention away from the failed operation.    Let me reiterate: I'm not supporting any of this. I'm just saying what makes sense. Plus, it would have hurt the regime much more and I always live for that.  OK, on to other things.  About Iraq, why is it that North Korea is flaunting nuclear capabilities and the only thing the United States has planned is cutting oil shipments and sending diplomats to surrounding countries to try and put the squeeze on the North Korea to disarm? Could it be that North Korea has no economical purpose to the United States? Could it be that the United States is saving OIL by not shipping it. Could it be that Iraq is important because it has OIL fields. How does all of this tie into the Bush family's OIL wealth. Into Dick Cheney's OIL background. ...  One, check out  urlLink  The Onion   this week for sniper irreverence.  Also, the most bizarre thing from Greenpeace:  urlLink A guide for getting it on without hurting the planet. .  There was more, but some links are down. So this should mean the next post will not be a week away.  I also love feedback. Respond with hate mail, props or ideas. I'm open to all of it. My e-mail link is at the top under the heading.

       "Verstehen Sie diesen Titel?  Vielleicht hätten Sie eine andere Sprache einnehmen sollen."   I've been quiet these past few days. I'm dealing with shock, or feigned shock. It's become increasingly obvious that the regime is more swayed by hearts then minds: a very dangerous thing in politics. And, of course, U.S. citizens are thinking more with their hearts as well, fueling silly government. So reality and reasonability are thrown out the window and some type of Mideast confrontation is looming.  The GOP gains in Congress will increase my letter writing campaign to my 2 GOP (ugh) Senators. But, I've got Ed Rendell as governor as my state, so that's kept me sane.  Now, on to education in the not-so-bright United States of America.  Last week,  urlLink Colorado  defeated a measure to ban bilingual education while  urlLink Massachusetts  voted to force English-immersion programs on non-English-speaking students. Sounds good enough to the average U.S. citizen who thinks everyone should speak English and to hell with other languages in this world superpower. Silly citizens.  This decision follows  urlLink Arizona's ban  and  urlLink California's earlier ban  on bilingual schools. I would hardly expect this from Calif., but such measures could be expected from Ariz. - a  urlLink governor did, in 1987, repeal Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a state holiday  and many legislative attempts failed before protests and pressure forced the state to reinstate it.  I find the lack of multilingual education in U.S. schools a major blemish. In 9th grade I started  German classes and took the language each year until my graduation in 1997. Following that, I took a year of German at Temple University. I've never been to Germany and at this point my grasp on the language is mediocre at best and deteriorating quickly. But  I had the opportunity to learn another culture, another history, another present - a world outside the United States.  Even if I never use the language again I can say that my German studies improved my English. I improved simple things, such as putting plural verb forms with plural nouns and pronouns - which so many in this country fail to understand - and misplaced modifiers - which can really sounds stupid. Don't even get me started on incorrect prepositions. OK, I'm being anal about this, but I'm a copy editor and so many in the journalism industry don't have a grasp of these concepts - in the language they write.  During my German studies, I learned that my high school had once started language studies in the 7th grade. Oh, to have had the chance to start earlier and finish with 6 years of the language.  Are all of these positives just a freak occurrence on my part? No. Why do you think most bilingual foreigners have such impeccable English that put this English-speaking country to shame? Would you be surprised to learn that in some countries, such as Germany, students are required to take a second language and many speak several languages fluently? My German pen pal spoke German, English and French. A Portuguese man, who works with my sister, speaks 7 languages.  A  urlLink BBC story  notes Europe's push to start multilingual studies at an earlier age, which has some basis, but also some baloney.  A George Washington University-based institute put forth a  urlLink report  citing no scientific evidence that children learn languages easier because their brains are more malleable. Is this a nail in my position’s coffin?  No, the report does cite increased interest by children or increased contact with other languages that may spark their learning.  And finally...  A  urlLink story  from  The New York Times  that covers a strange phenomenon in New York City. Black students attending a Chinese school and learning Mandarin and Chinese culture and history.  Not to belabor the point, but consider this the wrap-up: Multilingual studies is necessary in today's world. It creates understanding by breaking language barriers and teaching cultures.  Still guessing the title to this story? Copy it and paste it  urlLink here . Make sure the site is set to translate German to English.

      OK, it's about time for another product push/name drop.  I would love it if everyone went out purchased and  urlLink Apple  computer, but that's a rather expensive push. Maybe the link will help.  The biggest thing I have to push this week is Opera Internet browser. It's practically free and it has tabbed browsing, which makes visiting my page (and scores of others) much more manageable with tabbed browsing. It's also an alternative, which I'm all about supporting.   urlLink      There's also  urlLink Netscape 7 , which a lot of people might balk at, but it's pretty compact for having mail and chat included. Think all in one.  OK, so that's it for now. I have some opinions on bilingual education in the United States and that'll be next. I've been wanting to just tear into education, considering it's a topic that I've experienced and read about, but I keep going around in circles. So this will be another circle.

       "Reason to vote for Ed Rendell for governor of Pennsylvania," or  "Why Mike Fisher is an idiot"   I had been planning on going more into the issues behind the governor's race in my mediocre state, but issues aren't on my mind right now. What is on my mind is how Mike Fisher's recent showing proves he is incapable of leading this state.  For those who want the issues as well, take the link to  urlLink Issues Pa .   urlLink Click here for my past post on the governor's race.    The Philadelphia Inquirer  recently  urlLink  reported on Mike Fisher's ad campaign in Pittsburgh  and his campaign's remarks on Philadelphia. For now, let's just say it isn't very nice.  Some quick facts: 1)  urlLink Center City District of Philadelphia  lists 78,000-plus residents in Philadelphia's downtown - making it the third largest downtown population in the United States.  2) The  urlLink U.S. Census site  lists Philadelphia as the 6th largest metropolitan area in the United States for the 2000 census. Pittsburgh: 22nd.  3) Philadelphia is the economic center of Pennsylvania.  With all of this in mind, what does Mike Fisher do? He attacks Philadelphia.  Believe me, I've lived all over this state: In Lancaster County (Central Pa.) and Mercer County (Western Pa.). Lancaster has some importance to the state, Mercer, probably not - certainly Philly doesn’t draw everyone here. But I left Mercer for a reason: there's not much life there. The dying and graying of Pennsylvania has been happening for many years through many Republican governors from everywhere in the state except Philly.  Yes, Philly will probably get a significant chunk of funding for schools, but guess what, it needs it! Outdated and decrepit buildings were not part of my education at any of my school districts (2) in the Lancaster County area or in Mercer County (1). Nor was it a problem in my girlfriend's school district outside Pittsburgh. It is a problem in Philly. How does capital - like buildings, books and computers - get upgraded? With money!   And that's just the education side. Not to mention a need to increase density and business in the Philadelphia area to cut down on sprawl elsewhere in the state. Of course this needs to be in the Pittsburgh and Lancaster areas as well, but again, that’s a concentrated area of the state. That and a need to control pollution and cleanup, which will certainly take dollars away from areas that don’t need it.  In the  Inquirer  story, Rendell gives the more levelheaded (i.e. well-thought political) response that all the areas have an importance, but Philly is the big attraction. Throughout the campaigning, I haven’t heard or read about Rendell attacking one part of the state.  So this is why Ed Rendell is it for mayor.

       New York City’s Tower of Babel     To see the mostly silly, but not all so, World Trade Center designs, check out the  urlLink Lower Manahattan Development Corporation’s site  and click away.    Without jumping all over the place (The LMDC has enough links and interactive shit to make you not come back to my site) let me tell you that former Mayor Rudy Giuliani doesn’t think too highly of the plans. If you couldn’t tell by now, neither do I. Does this mean I’ll be mayor of New York someday?     The biggest problem I have with most of the projects is their desire to build higher than the previous towers, and in several instances, the tallest buildings in the world. I hardly expect anyone to fly any planes into the towers anytime soon, but    1. How many people really want to be up that high on that site? and    2. The original twin towers were much maligned when they were built for being so high. Disregard most people’s professed love for the towers, they were long despised.    The following paragraphs are just my cap of the projects.  urlLink Click here  and you can skip to where the discussion starts up again.  ***  Probably the plan I disagree with the most comes from the team headed by Richard Meier. Maybe it’s because I had to study a home he designed, which I liked, for Design III and then design an addition to it. But it just doesn’t fit into the city, any city for that matter.    One of the designs I like the best is by Think, which includes the architect behind the much maligned Kimmel Center in Philadelphia. This is where I backtrack and get all confusing. This team is one of those who is pushing for the world’s tallest building. But to their credit there is actual city planning involved. They include a park, which plenty of other designers do, but a park doesn’t just attract people. Included is retail space, a library, theater, transit hub ... Everything to keep an area alive from dawn to dawn. And just as important, the design is interesting.    The SOM-led team proposes buildings that sit off-center, as in the don’t go straight up. For ground zero, maybe not the best of ideas. But the plan pushes sustainable design - energy efficiency, water recycling, etc.    Foster also proposes the tallest buildings in the world, but he adds the green architecture slant and discusses a city transit hub, simply for my sake. Despite how precarious they may look, it’s one of the more interesting design concepts. And it certainly isn’t the phallic symbol he erected in Great Britain.    The Peterson team designs from an urban planning standpoint, which is nice, but they also propose very tall buildings.    Daniel Libeskind certainly has a way with designing memorials; he designed the Jewish Museum in Berlin. He proposed some of the tallest buildings in the world, but the grouping of the buildings, each jutting up further, rather that 2 monoliths without procession, make the design much more to my liking, maybe other people’s as well. His introduction and slides deal little with sustainable design, something that cannot be overlooked in today’s designs.    The last design is by a team called United Architects and they certainly are. The list of members runs on and on. Their design pushes safety, but it does so with the tallest building in the world.     So now back  to the meat and potatoes of the post.    The world of architecture is moving beyond the race to the sky. Most skyscrapers being built now - and have been completed recently - won’t place in the Top 20 tallest list. And when a buildings height is significant, it’s because the city where it is going up is short-statured - like Philadelphia. The Robert Stern building proposed will be tall, but Philly really only has 4 buildings to contend with. This new one will make 5.    As for my height problem, I don't think we need to bow to the terrorist threat, but it's possible to stand up, just not stand the tallest. You also have to take into consideration people will be working on those floors that took the brunt of the crashes. Regardless of how safe anyone calls their building, when workers step onto the floor numbers that took the plane hit, do you think business will be on their mind?    Skyscrapers certainly aren’t going anywhere anytime soon, but like the iMac, it’s time for the skyscraper 2. Height has already been conquered, how about now making up for what was lacking, rather than having a pissing contest. Rather than racing to the sky, which now has the added cost of skyrocketing insurance, architecture should be working on weaving their buildings into the city and focusing on efficiency, something skyscrapers have not been known to do.    But that’s the ego behind it. The skyscraper almost always stands out and it footprint takes up an entire city block, which requires demolition and displacement. Hardly friendly. They also serve little purpose to protecting people on the street. Look at some older buildings with awnings and overhangs providing this protection.    Fortunately for New York City, a number of the plans take the urban experience and build on it, but how successful will they be?    As I mentioned with Think’s design, a site needs uses beyond offices and retail. Those all have hours of operation that, when closed, vacate an area and create dead space. The nature of a memorial will bring in additional people after hours; An amphitheater and library bolsters that space.    Mixed use is the way to go for success. This and sustainable design were major program requirements for the design teams, yet many of the teams mentioned this as an afterthought in their introductions.    Another aspect to Lower Manhattan comes into question. The LMDC specified 10 million square feet of office space, about what existed in the original structures.    But does New York need that much?    A  urlLink study by Plymouth Partners , which calls itself a brokerage & tenant representative (?), found Manhattan’s vacancy rate - unrented, but available office space - doubled from 5.1% in 2000 to 10.9% by Sept. 10, 2001. Notice this number is unaffected by the attacks. It ticked up even higher to 11.6% by the end of that year.    Certainly New York City will swing back in action, but there’s plenty of available office space throughout the rest of the city that the new tower plans could be scaled back some.    New York City has also been known for largely unflattering buildings of late. Aside from the twin towers - which had the distinction of being the tallest - what buildings, post-1960s, really draw attention like the Chrysler, Citicorp or Empire State buildings?    Which design is picked, and a few should easily make the final decision difficult, New York City could be back in whatever saddle it was in before. It also has the opportunity to go above and beyond, reinvent itself and once again earn it's reputation rather than banking on the old. Count how many bad cliches I used today and win a prize!

       "Things that Make You Go, Hmm" -  Other Than C + C Music Factory   So, I get to work at the newspaper today and what should be the big news for Monday's paper? Trent Lott and North Korea.  I'm not going to get into North Korea right now. It'll be too much of my time, and I still haven't got to the architecture thing yet.  But one quote from Trent Lott surely I can get that in:   "When you're from Mississippi and you're a conservative and you're a Christian, there are a lot of people that don't like that. I fell into their trap and so I have only myself to blame."   Does this guy say more bizarre things than imprisoned former Ohio Representative James A. Traficant Jr.?  He may be paranoid, but thank God he isn't racist, right?  And this guy was leading the Republicans?

      OK, so it's been awhile. Maybe awhile longer, I'll have to see. I definitely had plenty to say about the new World Trade Center designs. Since I've had 2 years of architecture, I can call myself a critic, right?  All of this was planned except a big AIA Bookstore bru-haha got in the way, and in the way throughout the next day, if you get my drift.  So, should it be even longer than I had planned, "Mele Kalikimaka" and "Hau'oli Makahiki Hou."  I'm such a diversified person, aren't I?

       Big Media, Big Problems, Part 2   The media should be in the business of news not a department of the newsmakers. I can’t say that it has happened, but if General Electric were the center of a major scandal, how would NBC (owned by GE) handle the situation? GE could use the network for damage control or even try to suppress the story. NBC might not accept/go along with the situation, but it’s a very real ethical problem should it happen. More importantly, it’s a problem that shouldn’t have arisen.  GE is one of the few glaring possibilities. For the most part, the little media is owned by bigger media, which is owned by the biggest media. It just so happens, that some of them own major Internet properties (AOL Time Warner). And, of course, some are partnerships with crappy computer systems (MSNBC).  Regulation is designed to make sure such problems don’t arise. Regulation should remain for this reason. We’ve already seen what happens when big corporations and people are left to their own vices (i.e. Enron, WorldCom and Michael Jackson).  A scandal in the news industry would only create more outrage and destroy credibility, which is sagging already. Regulation keeps the chances of that to a minimum, something media outlets should be thankful for.  Media outlets are supposed to provide news - and to stay a float, provide business to other businesses through advertising. They should not be worried about shareholder sentiment. Once again, look at AOL Time Warner. When news is about profit, it's "infotainment" and sensational - only making problems worse.  As I said in Part 1, mega-media-mergers kill voices and viewpoints. Here's 2 more examples: One very real, the other potential:  1. A story lamenting the lack of   urlLink "minority" ownership and access to the media  has been posted on Alternet.org. Near the bottom of the page is an interesting Nielsen rating of the Top 20 most visited sites. The list doesn’t deal specifically with news sites, just the most visited.  2. The two biggest Philadelphia newspapers -  The Philadelphia Inquirer  and  Daily News  - are owned by the same company. If a TV or radio company bought Knight Ridder - the national parent company - chances are that company is large enough that it owns other media properties in Philadelphia and suddenly the competition dwindles. One company, would own the top 2 newspapers, a major network and a few radio stations. Different media, same angle, all the time.  Thankfully Philadelphia has 2 alternative weeklies and some fairly decent niche newspapers, but niche is not where newspapers belong. To fully inform, the scope must be larger. Niche works for magazines, which I feel have a slant far beyond what newspapers offer.  As I’ve said before, an individual effort must be made to combat what is likely to happen. Seek out alternative sources of newspapers. Where the people go, so goes the money in the news industry.

       In Between Media Problems, Part 1 & 2  Just something quick to note on my rail obsession. Philadelphia Mayor Street has thrown the  urlLink ">city’s support  to the Metrorail project connecting Philadelphia to Reading as a way to cut down on car traffic on I-76. That project has been languishing without city support, but maybe something will change. It differs slightly from the  urlLink Delaware Valley Association of Rail Passengers ’ plan to simply upgrade old tracks.  In a side note, for some reason, Democratic governors are asking the Bush administration for road expansion money as a way to bolster jobs. I guess I’ve got to get a letter out to Governor-elect Ed Rendell so he knows more money and manpower should go to updating Amtrak  and other rail systems in the state. And I thought Democrats were supposed to be environmental. Does this mean I have to Green?  Part 2 (and final) media posting is coming this week. Check out my links to the issues and stances in the last post. Hell, read the last post - It'll make Part 2 that much easier, or not.  Also, apparently my readership has expanded beyond myself because the Web site meter is logging disturbingly high numbers of Window's/IE people rather than my OSX/Netscape/Opera combo. Sad, sad day. But, my readers are still a classy bunch: Mac OS accounts for 27% and Netscape for a combined 25%.

       Big Media, Big Problems, Part 1   OK, so I missed my self-imposed deadline, but tonight was not a short night at the paper. It's a legitimate excuse, I swear.  To start my media merger story, let me provide a few links:   This post stems from the  urlLink Federal Communication Commission ’s expected review and rule change of media ownership (i.e. who/what can own how much in a particular market or nationally; how many forms of media can be owned by a particular person/company; etc.).   Through recent mergers, many of these regulations have become outdated and rather than forcing compliance, an easing of the regulations is underway.  The following stories provide more background information and current thought on the matter:  The first is a  urlLink  New York Times   story outlining the FCC’s current regulations and what might happen to them.  The second is from  urlLink Alternet.org  (not mainstream!!). The story does not support media mergers or slackening the Federal Communications Commission regulation.  The third is from  urlLink  The World Socialist Web Site  (not mainstream!!). It covers a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling  that pushed the FCC to review media ownership.  The fourth story is an older one from  urlLink USA Today .  The biggest problem with eased rules - hence bigger conglomerates - is lost voices. As the media consolidate into fewer companies - and fewer slants - different viewpoints and interests have more trouble being heard.  Also, as voices move to accepting alternative media, they run the risk of losing credibility and possible readers and falling into the “conspiracy theory” category. Print the same story in  The New York Times  and a city weekly and the story will not be taken the same way.  Many who advocate the weaker FCC rules cite the Internet as an example of why voices will not be drowned out in the mega-media-merger future.   Let’s not kid ourselves. Who controls the news on the Internet? CNN, the BBC, a newspaper or two and a U.S. based television station? These groups already have the credibility and muscle needed to succeed on the Internet and the possibility of credible, smaller alternative news sources making a dent is laughable, unfortunately.  Also, which is the most available to the most number of people at any one time? Not the Internet.   Until the computer and Internet are as common in the home as the television, they can’t serve the same purpose. By the time the computer is that common, the media may be controlled by an even smaller group of people, making start up voices that much more difficult.  Many who attack the weaker FCC rules cite the radio as what to expect from all media. Clear Channel owns such a significant portion of the radio spectrum, that one story quoted a source as saying that the listener is changing channels, but the channels aren’t changing.  This is already beginning to happen in the news through the many wire services available. It’s not necessarily bad: The Associated Press, Reuters and others have the job of providing national and international news to smaller news outlets.  But as AOL Time Warner is learning, big media doesn’t always pay off. AOL Time Warner is responsible for CNN,  Time magazine  and I can’t even begin to list what else. Because of this CNN can now be a news provider with hundreds of other news sources. But if you can get  Entertainment Weekly  news through CNN, then why bother visiting the Web site or buying the magazine?  One company has essentially become an entire marketplace of competing news sources, and competition always produces winners and losers. The behemoth that is AOL Time Warner is slowing eating itself up.  I’m not calling for a tightening of the regulations, but I do not think they need to be as eased as they may be. What shouldn’t happen is different media mixing. The Internet provides a viable outlet for each to make additional revenue to remain afloat, while offering competing stories with different viewpoints and outcomes. Television companies do not need to own newspapers.  But as consolidation continues, people must search out the news, rather than taking what is served up on the doorstep or through their television. Actively seeking information is the only defense to being sucked in to a one-viewpoint world. That search can voice disapproval more than a letter. Why? Because when circulation and market share drops, so does ad money and so does the company.

      I've found back-up material for my rather jumbled, re-edited race piece. The first link in that story took you to a  urlLink  Temple News  story  about the differences between anti-Semite and anti-Israel. A recent piece in  The Times of Trenton , which appears online in a different form, covers N.J. poet laureate Amiri Baraka's upcoming visit to Rider University.  If you haven't heard, the state would rather he not be poet laureate, but he can't be removed. He's been attacked by the Anti-Defamation League, the governor and numerous people for being anti-Semitic.  Why?  Because of a poem he wrote about Sept. 11. The suspect lines reads:   "Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed/ Who told 4,000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers to stay home that day/ Why did Sharon stay away?"   Anti-Semitic is anti-Jew. Where's the anti-Jew remark? Baraka claims Israel had prior knowledge of the attacks. Conspiracy theorists say Bush knew in advance. Conspiracy theorists also say President Franklin D. Roosevelt knew about the Pearl Harbor attacks.  I'm not going to say someone did or didn't know, but that is a very real belief many people hold.  The man has admitted to using "Jew" in a derogatory manner in a poem he wrote years ago, but he's standing by this poem - the one that's caused all the rage - as not being anti-Semitic. I don't see why not. He's standing on solid ground.  The following quote is from  The Times  article mentioned above:   "If a white supremacists came to Rider, people would say 'no,' " [Miriam Mills, a professor of drama said]. "It's so sad that because he is saying something anti-Semitic, somehow it is acceptable."   A professor - someone who is supposed to be teaching people - doesn't know the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Israel? These people claim they are about peace and promoting peace, but promote the truth first, otherwise you are the one promoting hatred and ignorance.  And through all of this uproar, with both sides being expressed, people seem to have trouble changing their minds. If you want, attack his poetry because it's not good - if that's what you think - at least that is subjective and open to debate.  In another  Times  that won't be posted until later, he says his lines are backed by a Jordanian television broadcast and 2 Israeli newspapers. No one has been able to provide information that refutes his stance. Until that happens, lay-off the anti-whatever bit.  I'll post a link to the new story when it's available. And I swear, a media posting this weekend. I'm not crying wolf, I swear.

       Nothing About Bush Here   I'm a bad journalist. I didn't watch "President" George Bush give his speech tonight. I was out attending a political gathering for a guy who wants an at-large seat on Philadelphia's City Council. There was beer, so I had some, came home and popped in an episode of "The X-Files" from 5 years ago. It was far more interesting, and I'll get to read all about Bush tomorrow.  A sign-up sheet for volunteerism came around and I had to pass. It's the objectivity thing. They do have my signature for his petition to get him on the ballot. That's my part. And he got $20 from my wallet. I can post my opinion here because it's all for my sake, but I can't really go out and push for signatures. Disseminating news and creating news don't exactly mix.  More to come later. Can't really say what the topic is on. My urban planning/architecture posts get the most response (yeah 2!!).

       Governor Paints N.J. Green with building   That’s a headline I tried dropping on one of the stories referenced for this post, but it didn’t get printed.  As Gov. James E. McGreevey begins his 2nd year, he’s become quite the green machine. His ideas are good, his rhetoric isn’t and same goes for the chances of it passing through the Legislature in tact. But politics is more about ideas and less about what gets passed. You can always scapegoat the others.  McGreevey used his first State of the State address to tackle sprawl head on. His ideas include regional planning - who’d have thought one town’s actions would affect its neighbors - and incentives to build in already developed areas.   That goes back to an architecture lecture I attended at Textile - Philadelphia University to newbies. A professor said that truly sustainable (i.e. green, environmentally friendly, etc.) building and design is in cities where you can improve on the already destroyed and not break what’s already fixed in the environment.  So how does McGreevey plan on doing this? With a  urlLink big-ass color-coded map . Environmentally protected areas are marked red (STOP) and areas open to building, green (GO). Laws, fees and taxes will making building in the green areas cheaper and more worthwhile.  Environmentalists laud the plan (big surprise), while builders hate it (big surprise). Builders say the green areas are already built out. What they mean is the green areas in the nice parts of the state are built out. But plenty of cities in New Jersey have vacant areas that need help.   And before anyone goes on about why the vacant areas are vacant, urban and regional planning can alleviate and clear out those problems, which will maintain and boost population. Most cities, while still losing population, are the vital centers for its surrounding suburbs and that will never change. Planning needs to add vitality and accessibility making the cities more desirable.  Even during times of white flight, where were the opera houses and museums and other cultural events and places? They never moved to the suburbs, but some smaller and less grand versions popped up there.   The Star-Ledger  reported  urlLink mixed feelings from suburban and rural officials.  Some suburbs are afraid McGreevey’s plan will cut tax revenue. They want shopping centers to bring in revenue, but that’s now how it should be. Rather than spreading retail everywhere, with a Wal-Mart and Gap in every town, concentrate it to denser areas. It’s more feasible for companies: fewer stores mean fewer employees, and because there are fewer stores, the shopping population is less spread out increasing revenue at each store.  Keep pristine, quiet areas that way. Chances are the population moved there for that reason, so don’t destroy it.  Other officials are ready for a plan to kill off traffic congestion and pollution, but are wary of the governors plan.  What McGreevey needs to add to his sprawl initiative is tax reform, so municipalities don’t use growth to cover their costs. Funding for activities and necessities, such as school and fire and police personnel, must come more from the state and less from business and property taxes.  So, I applaud the Green Machine's, plan, no matter how vague the details are now, but I worry it will falter later when it doesn't fix the other problems. New Jersey has the chance to lead the nation in change - hell, even beating out Oregon as a big environmental state, but it also has the chance to stifle the efforts of others.

       Blah Blah   As usual, I'm missing all of my set deadlines. the sprawl post is coming.  But,  The Times  has decided to extend my internship until May. No part-time job, but not out of work.  So what about Bush? His political war is getting on my nerves and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's "Old Europe" looks to factionalize Europe. Only in the United States, where people are given choice, where people are given the chance to disagree with the government, would the government call such disagreement "a problem" and un-American.  Just in time for the Iraq inspecters to make their report to the United Nations, Bush presents "evidence" of the Iraq's hidden weapons of mass destruction. Just in time to possibly discredit the inspectors' findings, just in time for his State of the Union address. Why not just wait until the inspectors have their says. It's their job, lay off it Bush.

       Blah   I've got stuff coming, mostly dealing with N.J. Governor James E. McGreevey's new focus on stopping sprawl. So, maybe architecture and urban planning are where I'm at for awhile. It only took me 5 months to find my groove. Plus these things might be more focused in my life as President Bush's ruined economy has put an end date on my internship and severely jeopardized the prospect of it turning into a part-time job at  The Times .  Until then, check out  urlLink  The New York Times ' story on favorite World Trade Center designs.   Also,  urlLink  The New York Times  has a Reuters news service story  covering academics and working media types battling the bosses and FCC over media ownership.  Also, should free time suddenly emerge in my life, the site will get a nice clean up and a link page with cool shit about moi - that's far more subjective than I should be.

         Philadelphia Wasteland   My mom now has Internet. After providing her 1 hour and 15 minutes of tech support (and I don't have AOL or Windows), she has it up and running. Until she breaks it again. I spent the day building bookshelves and staining, so the fumes have gotten to me. This should be a fun post.  The other day I was walking by the Gallery along Market Street expecting to still see Disney Hole - the thankfully failed venture - only to see a parking lot. (For lots of info on DisneyQuest, visit  urlLink City Paper  and type it into the search function.) This parking lot is more disappointing than the giant 1-block hole and DisneyQuest combined.  A parking lot. "Yeah," some idiots say. More parking in Philly.  "Blah," others say, "Another drab parking lot."  "How fucking stupid," I and others are saying.  What a waste. It brings in little revenue during the Gallery's open-to-close hours and from some surrounding offices - when compared to what a building with business could generate. It's a black 1-block expanse that will  add to the stifling heat of the summer.  I had an idea for Disney Hole way back when, but I never said anything about. Go activism! But it was the important people of Philly who decided it should go back to a parking lot. It won't help Philly; I won't be helping City Council when they run for election again.  Here was my vision:  A megaplex of stuff to do in Philly after the city dies each day at 7 p.m. What does Center City currently lack? The list might be shorter to name what they do have, but just a few: 1) a major theater (the ghetto theater is long gone). It's either University City, 69th Street or way down Delaware Avenue to Tasker Street. 2) recreational activities aside from drinking, 420 and criminal mischief.  What could have filled Disney Void is a lower level roller skating rink (plenty of people do this, or would if it were available) or a bowling alley (plenty people do this or would if it were available). Above that would sit a major-run movie theater with stadium seating and all that goes with it. Also, along this row could be additional shops and offices (the site is big enough).  Notice I did not mention a parking lot anywhere. Why? Because the site doesn't need one, even with all of the extra people this would draw.  Just to refresh important people's and others' minds and inform out-of-towners: The Gallery is a major transit hub. The El makes 5 (FIVE) stops in this part of town. The Broad-Ridge Spur (subway) stops here. All 5 (FIVE) of the trolley lines stop in this area. PATCO - subway/train to New Jersey - stops here. NJ Transit buses stop here. SEPTA buses stop here as do all 7 (SEVEN) regional rail lines.  What's the need for parking?? There isn't. And Monday through Thursday, I'm sure most of the surrounding parking lots sit half empty after dark, so car drivers could use them.  And this venture, appropriately named Swope Square, Center or whatever, would bring x times more revenue into the city's pockets than the parking lot ever will or ever could.  How many people do you know who flock to a spot because there is something to do during the day and night? How many people do you know who flock to a new parking lot?  What the lot is doing is alleviating - in a minuscule way - the parking crunch, which encourages more cars, more exhaust and less use of public transit.  So you have beef with public transit? Increased use, means more money for SEPTA, PATCO and NJ Transit, which gives them more money for improvements. Rather than a downward spiral, it's upward. And of course, Philly would offer more to do to attract people from the burbs and retain those who live in the city.

       The Return   I'm back from the digital divide, which ended up not as long, even though I was in Pennsyltucky for the same amount of time. Yes, my mom decided to upgrade from a Packard Bell running Windows 3.1 to a Compaq running XP on an AMD. Had it completely been my decision, it obviously wouldn't have been a Gates-controlled piece of shit, but I opted for a still-decent one, no Intel-Dell crap. It was Circuit City, so I couldn't ask for an IBM.  Still no Internet, but that will apparently change when a new line delivers AOL (like I'd waste my time with  MSN).  I landed in Hell on Friday and was ready to leave by Monday afternoon following my dentist appointment, but alas, I didn't depart for Lancaster until Wednesday afternoon. All of this meant I got to hear the "n" word (you know what I mean) about as many times as the usual double-standard rapper/hip-hopper. Oh, wait, they end it with an "a" to make it endearing and non-offensive.  My sister drove up, so we donated some money to the oil industry. How will I even forgive myself. Rail just isn't an option for my sister who lives in the sprawling suburbia world. Plus, she still has friends in that place, and a car is the only way to get around. I haven't talked to a person from my high school in nearly 5 years so I had nowhere to go. I was too busy teaching Excel to my mom anyway.  I'm told I should talk more about architecture and urban planning because it's the only thing I can make a solid case on - OK, the e-mail wasn't that harsh, but I'm not easy on myself - so I'll have another post shortly.   Then it'll be back to trite ranting on things I know only what media tells me.

      Well Happy New Year to everyone.  I'll try and get one more post up before my "vacation" starts. "Vacation" because it's all unpaid - two part-time jobs, Damn!  But during part of it I will venture as far as west Pennsylvania can go. Exciting, right? I'll be cut off from the digital world, save my phone. In the heart of country music and NASCAR racing. It will be too much, and I'll want to come home as soon as I step out of the car. It's only 5 days, I just have to keep telling myself that - 5 days.  As long as I get to sleep and get home-cooked meals - the ramen and Checkers might be killing me - I may survive physically, but not mentally.

       Some Delay   OK, it's been awhile since I posted anything. I worked 3 double-shift days in a row this week and the last thing I wanted to do was post while my mind was shutting down. Also, I got a futon and that required assembly.  I have plenty to say about the Libeskind plan winning the World Trade Center design, but for now, let me note 2 stories, one about the peace coalition in the entertainment industry and the other about information that failed to catch on with the major media regarding Iraq's disarmament.    urlLink Billboard magazine   reported on an artist coalition -  urlLink Musicians United to Win Without War  - which has formed to push the peace stance. Annoyingly, the story reports that one of the artists involved believes the media is pushing for war.  The most radical stance I've heard by a major newspaper is war, but only with U.N. support. Because that doesn't seem likely, those papers can at least be on the better side of George Bush, while offering conditional support. It's a middle of the road no-balls approach, but newspapers do have to worry about being alienated.  If a newspaper takes a stance against war, how many of their informants in the White House or Pentagon inner circles will suddenly dry up?  That argument came up once regarding  The Philadelphia Inquirer 's unsupportive stance of Mumia Abu-Jamal. They could publish stories supporting him, but then the Philadelphia police department could VERY quickly and easily close up information and aid to the newspaper.  But, I digress...  A  urlLink story from Alternet  notes a  Newsweek  article regarding a high-ranking Iraqi who defected to the United States and reported that Iraq had destroyed its illegal weapons arsenal.  OK, I'm getting some sleep this weekend, expect something.

       Damn New York   I was in the Big Apple yesterday to check out the Leonardo da Vinci show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was pretty good, for being old pages from sketch books and occasion larger pieces. I probably would have liked it more, but the place was packed. I expected it to be, but that always takes away from the experience.  I also got to see the outside of the Apple store in SoHo - didn't make it until after hours - but the store was designed by a big Philadelphia firm, so I had to check it out. Very cool, I must say.  I am angered my trip. Everytime I go there, I get drawn in a little more. I've had to change my stance from "I hate that city" to "It's OK to visit." Certainly I'll never be able to afford living there and hopefully by the time I'd be able, Philly will have its act cleaned up a little bit more and I won't ever consider NYC as a place to live.  Nobody in my family understands by love of the city, but it certainly has to do with a good mix of people and the constant bustle, and, oh the bustle on the NYC subways, even well into the night.  One of the only things really drawing me to the city, aside from things like exhibit and conventions is the non-tourist stuff. The first time I went, it was all about the touristy stuff. Hell, the tourists annoy me when I'm home in Lancaster, why do I want to deal with them elsewhere?  But at the newspaper convention last year, we met up with an old  Temple News  editor to show us around and this last time I was with a friend who is all about New York, so we got a nice Thai lunch and Greek supper at restaurants in the heart of where New Yorkers live.  So, if you go, check out Times Square, but check out more of the city with some long walks.

         Why Pennsyltucky Should Not Run Pennsylvania   I’m hardly a romantic, but the snow today, which kept me away from the newspaper for a second day, was very soothing and beautiful. Probably more because the mostly untouched snow did a great job of covering up the trash and sending the homeless indoors.  An AP story coming across the wire this weekend detailed Temple University's plans to offer same-sex benefits to it employees and the subsequent disapproval by state elected officials. The story wasn't carried on any online news source, so you’ll have to take my word for it.  The story quoted a state Representative (of western Pennsylvania) in Harrisburg who wants to fully "defund" Temple (Temple is officially a quasi-state funded university - i.e. it received significant funding from the state). The representative also said he had colleagues who would support his move.  Bad!  I'm currently reading "Rise of the Creative Class" by a very egotistical Richard Florida. It's an urban studies book and it notes that many thriving "creative centers" attract the gay population. Florida also notes that many businesses offering same-sex benefits attract other "creative people" because it shows the institution is tolerant and supportive. Offering same-sex benefits can attract many people outside the gay population because of this, which Temple President David Adamany noted in the story.  While I do not support gay marriage (and most marriage actually) - it's been a religious-based ceremony since the beginning of time and has always been between a man and a woman - I do support same-sex benefits. I have been unable to find references to gay marriage in ancient Greece, probably the first bastion of a gay culture, which leads me to believe it hasn't ever existed in a truly accepted and popular form.  Temple's benefit plan, however much anyone wants to criticize it, is strict enough. Shared property and other proof of a couple living together and committed to each other for the long term is required.  Philadelphia is also the liberal stronghold in Pennsylvania, and a few other local colleges have offered same-sex benefits. This should not be surprising, nor should it be met with such strong disgust from the people running our government.  These days, laws and regulations seem to impose one view’s morals rather than everyone’s fairness. Providing same-sex benefits does not take anything from other groups, it merely levels a playing field. Why is this a problem?  It is this kind of opposition in the state that fuels our shriveling, graying population, while other cities, other states flourish. People are not fleeing because of the weather. I’m still here!  And while on the topic of marriage, ABC reports on some of the bizarre  urlLink marriage rituals of yore.

      So this blizzard of '03 has me stranded a second day. The news says 17" have fallen, but I can't really tell from 10 stories up.   The newspaper didn't have me go in yesterday, they had  plenty of people closer and today I'm waiting to hear from them about going in.  The bookstore is closed as well.  So all of this time to relax, but it's eating in my money situation.  This means I'll be posting my 3rd blog in as many days. Quite a feat. I've also started work on a half-assed page about myself to go with this. If I can get my HTML down, I'll probably attach my archives I pulled off because of the dying links.

       Can Peace Activists Read?   This post compliments my previous. I wish I didn't have to say anything about this, but it showed up again in some war protest stories that went over the wire yesterday.  Peace groups are always going on about how their "opinion is not heard in the media." Bullshit. Have you ever picked up a newspaper? I know  The Times  has had a peace group demonstration or forum or something covered at least 5 times a week. Every time it is major, such as yesterday's protests or the last worldwide protest, it goes front cover. It's the newspaper's lead story with photographs and it jumps to inside pages with local angles and everything.  Also, yesterdays' protests, as with every major one that happens, is the lead story on news sites such as CNN. It was the lead story of  The Philadelphia Inquirer  the regional newspaper here. It's the lead story on ABC, NBC and  The New York Times .   In fact, every time someone mentions it, they are mentioning to a reporter.  So next time you decided to make the statement, at least think about whom you are talking to.

       Bush Bamboozling Us or Himself   A showdown, in the Middle East versus Saddam Hussein, with the U.N. versus world powers or both is looming.  A note came over the copy desk at  The Times  earlier this week; The copy desk is now on standby should conflict break out in Iraq, or I assume should terrorists strike on U.S. soil The note made it clear 7-day work weeks could lie ahead and ad revenue will not control paper size during this time. This whole conflict is so surreal at this point.  George W. Bush's war mongering isn't moving U.N. members, and why should it? In a recent speech Bush said the United States would protect itself, its allies and friends from these thugs (presumably Iraq?). He also has said world peace and freedom is at stake.  1) What nations have come forward asking for our protection? The United States and Great Britain are about the only countries fearing an attack and an attack from Iraq on these 2 is unlikely. Iraq's neighbors are building up only because of our actions in the Middle East.  2) Bush has yet to present evidence of a threat from Iraq. Illegal weapons have been found containing mustard gas, but those were left over and not destroyed from the first set of inspections No new chemical or biological agents have been found. Missiles have been tested that extend beyond the U.N.-sanctioned range, but who would Iraq attack and why in this time of heightened scrutiny?  3) Preserving peace and freedom are not results of war. There are 2 results: In the first the aggressor wins and takes territory or the entire country and becoming an area for exploitation. In the second the aggressor loses, the winner takes territory or all and the loser is now exploited and given strict sanctions, all the while dreaming of reconquest.  Examples: The Revolutionary War (vs. Great Britain) followed by the War of 1812 (vs. Great Britain); Israel's many wars with its neighbors; and Germany's loss during WWI fueling it's aggression leading to WWII. The list goes on.   Bush would also have the world believe that because a statement, believed to be from Osama bin Laden, calls for al-Qaida support of Iraq, Iraq must be harboring the terrorist organization. A similar statement, made by the organization called for support of Palestinians, but we aren't accusing them of harboring terrorists or supporting their attack on us. Al-Qaida is an extremist Muslim organization ad Iraq is largely Islamic. Al-Qaida hates the West and Iraq at least strongly dislikes us. Is it not likely al-Qaida is pushing for support of Muslim strife against the United States? History seems to support this.  So, while Bush sees the United Nations fading away because of endless debate, I support caution by the world powers. May the United Nations and the world cry for peace against U.S. imperialism and the "cowboy mentality" put this democracy in check.

       Rigged Monopoly   Taking away choice in the private sector is like starting a game of monopoly with the opponent already putting hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place. It's an unfair advantage, one that isn't beat easily. As the government seems more likely to loosen controls on media ownership, let's look back at a few other government-sanctioned behemoths.  I'll skip Amtrak because it's quasi-governmental and some legislation (S.104) is trying to take it off the private track. Rail hasn't been profitable in decades in the United States, Britain or elsewhere, plus enough alternatives exist: SEPTA regional rail, NJ Transit, the MTA in New York and others in Chicago and Los Angeles, just to name a few.  To start this post, let me point out the governmental dismantling of AT&T. It relied on efficiency and good service to beat the competition to death. The government chopped it into regional local companies, called Bells, and gave AT&T the long-distance market. In doing this, AT&T lost significant amounts of its infrastructure.  Less than 20 years later, the U.S. government approved the creation of Verizon, now the dominant local carrier in the Northeast. So dominant, there isn't really a No. 2. The government has since approved Verizon to deliver long-distance services, putting it into direct competition with other players (e.g. AT&T, Sprint and MCI), while not giving those other players better access to the local market. (To note, my DSL and local calls are administered by  urlLink Cavalier Telephone  for a fraction of the Verizon price, and  urlLink AT&T Wireless  connects me to the rest of the United States, eventually the world.)  Another example is Microsoft. The antitrust case has essentially fallen to pieces with joke penalties against Microsoft. Even though every major virus attack that has stopped the Internet and cost billions has been attributed to its flaws; even though it commands market percentages in the 90s for operating system and browser; and even though it has spearheaded efforts for complete dominance as an ISP, game console and wireless OS, it is apparently not a monopoly.  Apple, Sun Microsystems, AOL, Netscape and Real Networks, etc. have all sued or offered "friends of the court" statements claiming losses because of Microsoft's actions, almost to no avail. Apple is still around because of an agreement between the two, Sun Microsystems' lawsuit is stuck in appeal after winning against Microsoft. The list goes on and on.  It should be noted that in nearly every other field there are first, second and so on places, but not in the above 2 noted cases. Yet, the government is creating and sustaining them.   And we really expect that FCC won't overly loosen regulation on the media market? Quite a frightening future with out choice. If only the right to choice had been included in the Bill of Rights. Maybe the little people would have something to stand on.

         Bush is Worse at Budgeting Than I   This is just a quick vent. I haven't vented in awhile. I fear I may have some legitimacy in my other recent posts, so I must cut myself down.  George W. Bush released his $2.23 trillion budget on Monday, which would set record deficits this year and next. Then smaller deficits each year at least for the next 3 years. Bush provides no aid to the states, and what he would like to do is push more onto them with an overhaul of the Medicare program. I won't even get into the cut environmental programs.  States are already facing deep deficits. California ($26 billion), New Jersey ($4.6 billion) and Pennsylvania ($600 million this year, nearly 2 billion next), just to name a few.  But guess what Bush does have more money for? The Armed Forces. Last year received the largest increase since former President Ronald Reagan. He proposes another 4% increase even as the very states that are united have the worst budget deficits in more than a decade with no fix in sight.  Because of the deficit and unemployement in Oregon, the state plans to close many public schools early, the numbers vary from 8 or 9 up to 20 days cut according to an  urlLink AP story  and the  urlLink Oregon School Boards Association  Web site. Only in the great United States do we spend billions more on wars outside our borders and preparing for one with Iraq - which has yet to pose a threat - while our school children are forced to have their educations cut. Is it any surprise that the United States lags behind other industrialized countries in education and learning?  So you want to complain to me and say the military needs the money. I edited a  New York Times  story this summer, which is no longer available on the Web without paying, which reported on all the  necessary  items being shipped to the Armed Forces in the Middle East. Among the medpacks, ammunition and other gadgets were $12,000 cappuccino machines. In case you didn't get that: NECESSARY ITEMS INCLUDING $12,000 CAPPUCCINO MACHINES.  Is this war or is this old ladies sitting in the parlor?  Yeah, more funds for the military sounds great. Maybe with the new money they'll train using PlayStation 2.  Bush also plans to add some funding to his missile defense program, which is so needed after Sept. 11. The defense system might have worked for the Cold War, but obviously war and attacks are far more sophisticated and stealthy than before.  Let's hope some intelligent Republicans and Democrats can chop this budget thing all to hell and turn it into something that:  a) actually boosts the economy and b) puts funding where funding is due.

       Spin the Wheel to Pick a Reason for War    ***WARNING: The following posts are as equally American as the statements made by those flying American flags, those putting "Support Our Troops" bumper stickers on their cars, those saying shut up to war protesters. ***     Is it possible for me to go on about this war anymore? Yes.  Why? Because support for the war grows for any number of wrong reasons.   Is it because U.S. soldiers have died and been taken captive? That's war. These people knew what the possibilities were. It was the United States who invaded another country.  Is it because in the beginning the quick and decisive win seemed imminent? Way to jump on the bandwagon.   Is it because people are buying the propaganda that we shouldn't diss the president while at war? The First Amendment gives free speech unconditionally at all times.  What follows is the most recent list of reasons for going to war. As a reminder the U.N. resolution that George W. Bush is using to legitimize the war is over weapons of mass destruction:  1.) Weapons of mass destruction. U.S. forces have secured a site which has been called a possible chemical agent factory. Verdict is still out on whether it is or was.  2.) Freeing the Iraqi people. As I have said before, the only way the Iraqi people will truly be free is for them to rise up against Saddam Hussein on their own or even with U.S. backing, but not U.S.-led war.  It should be noted that a  Washington Post  analysis piece takes note of the violence following the U.S. juggernaut moving toward Baghdad. As forces root out Saddam's control along its path, citizens are left in a lawless world of fighting, looting and murder. This was apparently part of the design to the invasion force. Keep on plowing ahead, don't look back.  What does all of this mean? With Operation Iraqi Freedom, the freedom, civility and liberties, which the United States would like to put into place, come second to violence.   With U.S. forces so lean and single-minded, they miss the opportunity to include the Iraqi people in tearing down the old regime and building up a new government. The U.S. is missing the chance to root out the suspected weapons of mass destruction that would justify the war to me and the 80% of the world population who doesn't support this strike.  It was this very tactic that lead to the U.S. deaths and POWs. Very few of those came from the front lines, but rather from behind, where U.S.-led forces had less than needed to maintain control and lookout.  3.) Overthrowing a dictator. He's been a dictator for decades, so why now when he has been at his most peaceable?  4.) Oil. Stories abound on this one, but as recently as Sunday during a church sermon, a Princeton, N.J.,-area pastor was concerned that this was the reason behind the war. Pastors aren't generally the conspiracy theorists.  To go along with this: A Reuters story detailing  urlLink  windfall for Vice President Dick Cheney's former company, Halliburton.   5.) Water. This came through from someone at the AIA Bookstore who has read at least two stories/blogs/theories stating the mighty Tigris and Euphrates rivers are behind U.S. control of the largely arid Arabian Peninsula.  6.) Revenge. Saddam wanted to kill his daddy, so little Bush takes the chance to settle a family thorn.  Having trouble picking a reason for this war?

       Nothing important happening here   I have plenty to say on the war happening, but that will have to wait until I have the Sunday paper in my hands from work. It used to be that when I  left work at midnight, I'd have the first edition in my hands, but alas, no more.  Especially last night. I got to work at 4:30 p.m. like a good employee, but by 7:30 only 10 stories had come through that 3 of the copy editors were fighting for. By 8:30 they were piling up and we couldn't keep up. I'm sure the paper got out on time in the end, we just missed an initial deadline, or two.  The following is blasphemy and should be ignored:  I'm considering leaving Philly for awhile. I've been all about Portland, Ore., of late, but because the economy is in the toilet jobs in the news industry, jobs are few and far between, so there's nothing out there. It means I'll be in this city for probably another year  I'm flying ot to visit the area next month as I accompany the male parental unit on a business trip to Hollywood. Because I'll go nuts with him after a few days, I'm skipping out part of the time to take in Portland.  This trip requires me to get a suit. I'm against suits. I'm against much more than jeans and t-shirt or polo. But it's Hollywood. Is Gwyneth Paltrow available?  This will be the farthest west I've been. So, to the terrorists: Stay away from my plane. I'm quite against Bush, this war and American imperialism. Don't shoot the messenger! And please make the Oscar security pointless. Hollywood is a liberal bastion that is rather against this war and all.  Damn, I need a one-liner to end this now. Thanks Jigsha, I'm crumbling under pressure.

       From Oil Magnate to Oil Emperor   It has begun, but how long will it last?  George W. Bush says he will use the entire force of the U.S. military in Iraq. Overkill? I think so.  The big thing to watch out for as this conflict continues is if Saddam Hussein will use chemical weapons and if, as the United States marches across the country saving oil wells for the Bushes and their cohorts, the Armed Forces stumble across any of the supposed weapons of mass destruction.  But I'm sure just as Bush tired of bin Laden, he'll tire of the weapons of mass destruction and suddenly this war will be saluted for freeing the Iraqi people.  Call me a cynic, but, understandably living under Saddam can't be a pleasant. Yet in the many stories I've read, including interviews with Iraqis, few mention a desire to overthrow the government. They simply say it’s been hard times.  What is the best way for freedom? The 1700s American way. Internally. Saddam's power over his entire country is thin. He is centered in Baghdad and his hometown. Elsewhere is rather lawless. Uprisings could easily be started around the country and certainly the United States would have helped.  But that option doesn't seem to have played out. Instead a puppet regime is part of the plan. Someday the United States will learn that puppet regimes and country building rarely works successfully.  Afghanistan failed the first time and the second is shaky; Korea fell apart, leading to that war decades ago; Yugoslavia was utter chaos; and Israel has been fighting one endless war since its creation.  More importantly, the Middle East isn't looking for the kind of government Bush is proposing. Whether you agree with monarchies and such is not the point. The point is that the United States has no place to uproot government and countries to install American values. The creation is incompatible, and incompatible is why country building has failed every time.  The war might be ashort stint, but the United States is in Iraq for the long haul. Unlike previous country building, the Iraq’s oil makes it too good to let go, which means the United States will fight there until the oil is gone.  I have 53 years to go until I reach the average age of death of a male in the United States. My tax dollars will be paying for Iraq well beyond that.  Ah, pleasant thoughts ...  I really have this burning desire to do more than write about my feelings on Iraq. But it's a journalistic no-no. Maybe being a journalist isn't for me, but it's more difficult to stay connected and up-to-date. At the newspaper I get to read all the stories that don't run and the unedited stories that get cropped for space.  Of course, that will be ending soon anyway. Bush's past reckless disregard (tax cuts) and present (more tax cuts) one with economy has ended my internship on the last day of May. Few advertisers means less money, which means fewer employed. And this isn't just at my newspaper. Finding a job at any newspaper in the area is proving to be challenging.

       Finishing Off Where Daddy Left Off   So here we are, on the brink of war - to use the already overused CNN phrase.  In George W. Bush's speech last night, he claimed he has been patient with diplomacy, which has failed and that the United States citizens are a peace-loving people.  Try selling that one to someone who isn't paying attention. Diplomacy failed because every resolution started or backed by the United States called for war, hardly peace.  As I quoted Albert Einstein before: "You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war." Bush has been preparing and pushing for war since September.  Bush's latest push for war dealt with a lot from the past. There was Saddam's aggression on neighboring countries Iran and Kuwait. The United States ran to help Kuwait (oil), but where was this country, which as Bush says cares for the Iraqi people and is so peace-loving, when Saddam Hussein attacked Iran? The chance was had in the 1980s to contain him, but that never happened. Saddam was stopped by the first Gulf War and subsequent weapons inspections of the 1990s. His might is a mere fraction of what it was before. To claim he presents a threat on U.S. soil is laughable.  He also brought up Saddam's chemical attack on his own people. That was also decades ago and once again I ask, where was the United State's desire to give freedom to the Iraqi people then? There wasn't any. Also, the first war and subsequent weapons inspections have destroyed and continued to hamper his chemical stockpile so this is not possible a second time.  Bush also again connected Iraq to al-Qaida without evidence. I point you to 2 CNN stories. 1.)  About a U.S. plan to strike a suspected al-Qaida camp in Northern Iraq.  Note the story reports the camp is outside of Saddam’s zone of power.  2.)  urlLink  About the scant decades-old evidence Bush is basing his current standing on.   In one swift stroke Bush has burned some bridges and undermined an international governmental body.  And one final thing. All the pro-war people claiming anti-war activists are hurting the moral of the troops abroad and not supporting them:  Many in the anti-war camp are strictly so because there is no U.N. backing. Bush is the one without support, but certainly anti-war activists are not wishing harm on their soldiers. There are some in the Armed Forces who do not support this, but it is their job. There are families of soldiers in the Gulf right now who do not support this war. There are many more families who have lost sons, daughters, etc. or had them return home disfigured and dismembered who do not support this war.  There is support for our troops, but not for the policy that currently has them there.  Here's to a disturbingly well executed attack against an army who couldn't present a threat to us if they had moral. Let freedom echo the bomb blasts off the walls of Iraqi homes. And may you sleep well at night while children cower in basements not knowing if they will see the sunrise.  So much for peace-loving.

        urlLink J'ai peur d'Américains    Click on the link and copy the text in the box, then translate from French to English.  Afraid seems like such a strong word, but stupidity and immaturity scare me at times. So it's fitting. Case in point, the French boycott.   Yes, I mentioned this in my previous post, but it's gotten worse, if that's possible.   Within the past week, a petition has formed to have the New Orleans French Quarter dubbed "Freedom Quarter." It doesn't do much for tourism because it kills centuries of heritage and history. When asked if the section of town could just be dubbed it's actual French name - Vieux Carre - the man disagreed because it was still French. He also noted most names in Louisiana are French and the New Orleans thing was just the beginning.  At a pro-war rally today, some zealot stood with his poodle and a sign noting his poodle lacked any French in it.  It should be noted that reinforced concrete is a French invention, so I expect boycotts of at least the  urlLink  the 10 tallest reinforced concrete skyscrapers . You can’t be a hypocrite and no double standards. Oh, and let’s not forget America’s greatest architect Frank Lloyd Wright. You must hate his buildings. Tear them down!  In fact, most any concrete structure built since the mid-1800s must be boycotted.  And just think, all of this because the French don’t agree with us. Sadly, the French are doing the very thing that America was founded on. They are standing by their ideals and voicing their disagreement.  It’s the very thing that built the United States into a world superpower. It’s what led to compromises in the U.S. Constitution, which is the reason it is still relevant more than 200 years later.  The U.S. colonies revolted against the British because of oppression and persecution, yet this is what we lay on those who don’t support us. In fact, George W. Bush has gone as far as saying not supporting the United States on Iraq will adversely affect economic, academic and other interests and ventures with the United States.  Also, as a show of the shortsighted mentality, this country is awfully supportive of the British when only their Prime Minister Tony Blair is gunning for U.S. plans of war. His cabinet and others in his political party have threatened to quit over his support of the U.S. effort. His country refuses any attack without a U.N. resolution, yet U.S. citizens call Great Britain our friend because one man supports the effort. U.S. citizens and Bush tear down the United Nations, when the British are gunning for it.  Other disturbing outbreaks: radio stations boycotting the Dixie Chicks because one singer voiced dislike and disapproval of Bush. People are smashing their CDs and a recent poll found that around 75% of those queried would return Dixie Chicks CDs. It’s all very similar to what happened to the Beatles when John Lennon correctly noted the Beatles were more popular than God. (You can call it sacrilege, but their popularity spanned religions and atheists around the world.)  The Dixie Chicks have since apologized for the harshest statement but still refuse to support war.   If you are going to smash and boycott their CDs, do it for a reason: because they suck, because they are part of the watered down pop scene.  Don’t do it because you don’t agree with their statements. They were being very American for expressing their opinions. And for that reason, I must regretfully support them in this post.

       Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones ...   French-bashing used to be fun. I work across from the Sofitel in Philadelphia and it's always easy to hurl a joke in their direction. But the new vogue is lower than my potshots.  "Freedom Fries"?? And served in the House of Representatives no less. And with support from U.S. Representatives? Is it possible to get any more childish? It'd surprise me.  Here's the other shocking thing, which will lead in to my future post on U.S. government. All of this is over a dispute, a contention of right and wrong. It's about the U.S. grandstanding. The United States doesn't want anyone standing up to it, and that's not how things should work.  Dissention happens because very rarely is someone completely right. There are more grays in the world than blacks and whites. Contention works to root out the wrongs and make the rights more so. Disagreement should lead to diplomatic fighting that in the end is resolved peaceably, not baby games and most  certainly not  ignoring the other side and charging ahead.  So I don't know about you, but I'm about to order a supersize of french fries.  A little quote from an intelligent person, to counter the shallow rhetoric of George W. Bush:  "You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war" - Albert Einstein.

       Links to the Facts   Just so no one can claim my facts were hollow rhetoric:  1.) A Reuters story reporting on the  urlLink destruction of 40 al Samoud 2 missiles.  That fact that people are even upset about them wanting to hold out on destroying them is alarming. Iraq is destroying missiles that would be used to counter a U.S. attack.  2.) An AP story reporting on U.N. weapons inspectors claim that the  urlLink document provided by the United States and Britain were forged.  The documents were to prove Iraq was pursuing buying uranium for nuclear bombs. The story also reports that radiation sweeps have turned up nothing in Iraq.  3.)Links to the frontpage story of  The Times of Trenton  are unavailable, but chief weapons inspector Hans Blix reports there is no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

       Bush and facts, fictions and hypotheses   Originally I was going to discuss the American way that seems to have been lost of late. Not the zealots, but the dissent and compromise that have forged the United States into a great country.  But then came along Bush and his 50-minute address/Q&A. *** This is how truth works: You have physical evidence (i.e. numbers, photographs, the actual piece in question). Having the truth allows you to make a case. It’s how the judicial system is supposed to work and because the judicial system is ‘fair’ it’s the basis for a lot of other things in the United States, namely making and passing laws and such.  Apparently, this has escaped George Bush.  The facts are this:   1.) More than 78 weapons inspectors currently in Iraq, working as teams, making random visits to any and all types of places.  2.) Surveillance fly overs by U.S. spy drones that lead to new sites inspections.  3.) U.S. intelligence reports naming potential sites, which inspectors then visit.  4.) Iraq is destroying al Samoud 2 missiles under U.N. surveillance and has turned over others (albeit after they were supposed to).  All of these are reasons why most of the world is holding out on blowing the hell out of Iraq.  Through all of this, Bush has said with a certainty that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction, that Saddam is a threat to U.S. citizens and that he is aiding and abetting al Qaida, yet he never offers proof.   Where are his facts, where is his evidence? Words are not evidence. In court, that is called hearsay and it doesn’t stand up.  Thankfully, Bush has not spouted the oft-said and questionable defense of withholding it for reasons of National Security.  I’m not saying that Saddam isn’t capable of or hasn’t done the things Bush says, but what Bush offers are hypotheses. If he can prove them, without hollow rhetoric, he could have  far more in the United Nations and far more U.S. citizens supporting a move against Iraq.  Because Bush does not hold out the ‘evidence’ to the public, because the evidence he has provided to U.N. inspectors has not panned out, Bush’s position and motive must be questioned and his aggression should not be supported.  We run too great a risk with starting wars on unfounded information.

       God, Satan and Details   OK, after much delay and a never ending introductory drum beat:  The winning design for the World Trade Center site was Daniel Libeskind's, and you can view the project at  urlLink the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation Web site .  I feel like quite a jackass taking on a great architect's work, but I am not the only one.   Let me start by saying that the gradual thrust upward of his many buildings cuts down the abruptness of them as part of the skyline, which actually plays better than the old towers.  This is one of the reasons I first leaned toward his design over many of the others.  It also has some nice 'gee-whiz' factors going for it, but they also weigh down the overall project. The uninterrupted sun shining between two of the towers every Sept. 11 between the hours of the first plane crash and the last tower fall has significant mean and is a nice touch, but these things will be forgotten. They always are. Details fall through the cracks.  It may act as a learning experience, but it will also go largely unnoticed 364.5 days out of the year. Other great symbols will elude visitors, too. How many people will actually acknowledge the significance of the 1,776-ft. tall spire? Surprisingly, in the United States too many will not get it.  Details are usually what make a building a pop, but ethereal symbolism risks losing the observer. And while the museum and such will most likely point out the meaning behind the details, explanations are tiring and may fall on deaf or overcrowded ears. People may read about in the brochures, books and articles certain to accompany this project, but to have impact, it has to be delivered and noticed while you are there.  And there lies the question: Is it God or the devil in the details?  My other complaint is the memorial overkill. Yes, it was a tragic event, but people do have to work there. A successful plan requires that people will want to go there to visit it as a memorial will want to go there as recreation space, will have to go there for work without being constantly reminded and even depressed.  Unlike the Berlin Jewish Museum he designed, this a city space, meant to attract people for more than just reflection.  Think's design included a good deal of city planning to go with their towers and that’s why I felt that design was better. Libeskind mentions retail and office space, but is short on details regarding the use of space after normal business hours. A cultural center and performance space are dropped in a paragraph or two of the design explanation, but with nothing concrete. While the design will surely change, concrete details are provided about almost everything else; why not here. These should not be afterthoughts considering they will be responsible for after-business-hours visitors.  Think's design included open park space, not enveloped by reminders everywhere you turn, as well as a library and other spaces, which would work to draw people in long after the last accountant and CEO has left.  My other question regards what was entirely left out of information provided on the site and in the few stories I've read since then. If this is truly to be a great architectural design how does it fit in with the movement of green architecture? Is this the beginning of a new architectural style or thought process?  Daniel Libeskind has created the tallest building, but issues of safety and evacuation have been left out and so has sustainability. The safety issue was thrust forward following the attacks, yet here they are absent.  Following the attacks academics and professionals debated how this would change the skyscraper. How is this a reaction to the attacks? In the end, the answer to that question will live on well beyond the sunshine and tower height.  It's definitely possible I will be more supportive of the design in time, but my questions remain unanswered for now.  While the "corporation" leading the design competitions and future of the site downplays the politics behind process, one must ask when is the next step and how long will it take to complete?  Hopefully enough foresight has been included, because most groups don't expect a finished project until the end of this decade. By then, how much of this will matter?

         Philadelphia Wasteland, Part 2       Curse me, I'm posting from a Windows... from work at the AIA Bookstore.   urlLink Part 1  was posted awhile ago and dealt with the giant waste of space across from The Gallery (a Center City mall) in the form of a parking lot. That waste of prime space has spawned more unnecessary parking lots in prime urban space.  For starters, a giant block or half block of blacktop does nothing to cool the city, but guess what does? Trees. It's obvious, but a  urlLink new study reported in  The Philadelphia Inquirer   lends it some credence for the disbelievers.   The first new lot sits right across from City Hall. Yes, a quarter block expanse of emptiness (Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday - the days I've checked on it so far) sits beside the seat of the most powerful municipal government in Pennsylvania. Sunday, when the surrounding streets were packed with people, 3 cars were parked there. On Monday, it appeared more construction along the street at the entrance was keeping people from using it.  The Ritz Carlton and its lot share the remainder of the block. Within 2 blocks of this lot is a Border's, Tower Records (though I'm in no way endorsing them), the Prince Music Theater and Liberty Place (another mall with it's own parking lot). Other possibilities for this site are endless. Maybe a mixed-use office, retail and housing building. Even a library branch focusing of government would make sense - though that requires an overhaul to the Free Library system in Philadelphia, something needed as well.  Mixed use structures would thrive on the 9-5 business clientele by day and the residents and visitors by evenings and weekends.  If parking is really needed it can be hidden beneath the building or used to separate the ground floor businesses from the upper residential space. But, as with the lot across from The Gallery, making a case for parking is tough. Why? Because the lot is 1 block away from the largest transit hub in Center City. So what is the need for more parking to get people here?   OK, lunch break is over. I have more about this and a better edited version will show up later tonight ...  Back on my Mac...  With the Ritz filling up the remainder of the block, the average Philadelphian has no need to use this block, which doesn’t do much to feed the business surrounding it. About the only use I’ve seen so far is for Philadelphia’s biggest enemy, the skateboarders (you’d think the way they make everything so not skater friendly). Some of the construction site tools and junk even make for ramps and other objects for tricks, or moves or whatever they are called.  The second new lot sits between  The Inquirer  building and a parking garage. What a brilliant idea. The garage supports Hahnemann Hospital.  The Inky  has its own lot behind the building. Across from  The Inky  is a half empty warehouse/factory/office space with its own parking. Also in this area is a Roman Catholic high school and a pricey apartment building with its own parking. Now let me state what you can already assume. I walked by Sunday and it was empty.  But it’s Sunday you say? Just a few blocks walk from here is the tourist trap and local haven: Philly’s Chinatown (apparently better than New York’s), the Convention Center, Reading Terminal Market and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. This lot also sits between two major subway stops: Spring Garden and Race-Vine. Once again, a void along Broad Street that gives the area an air of vacancy and desolation; I don’t care how new the paint job is.  I have yet to actually check if either of these spots have futures beyond the parking lot. It wouldn’t seem so. The first lot sat empty for nearly 2 years before its recent transformation and it wouldn’t make sense to blacktop a quarter of a block just to have to dig it out again someday later. It doesn’t make sense, but for the sake of revitalizing Philadelphia, I hope this is the case. The second lot was a vacant building for years before demolition started several months ago. Once again, why fill it in if it needs to be torn out again for building? Let’s hope that will be what happens.

       Hmm, Snappy Headline, Think Fast   I'm walking along Broad Street today to head to work and who is that walking towards me but Gov. Ed Rendell. I had my iPod on, but made a point to say "hello." He seemed a bit gruff, the jerk, I voted for him. He was in town to discuss the future of Pennsylvania. Not sure what all that entails, maybe getting rid of Sen. Rick Santorum.  This is my 2nd meeting with the big man in Pennsylvania. My first was in 1999 as an employee at the Tower Records on Broad & Chestnuts streets. That time was equally disappointing, he came in and special ordered LeAnn Rimes on cassette.  Thankfully he did a better of job of cleaning up Philly and will do a better job with Pennsylvania. *** I've also come to the realization that because the internship is essentially over and the inconveniences there just pile up, I only look forward to the midday nap on the train. *** Madonna's new CD is a strange mix. Picking out the reviewers who hate her is always pretty easy. Her rapping does needs to go, but she continues flexing her ability to sing. Lyrically it's not a high point for her, but it is dance music and how much of that actually has substance anyway?  OK, those were all jumbled but came to me throughout the day. It should be noted I only slept 3 hours last night.

         Much to Say, Not Much Time   OK, so I'm in the news room, waiting on stories. It's nearly 11 p.m. and we're still waiting for a major story apparently.  So how about a digest of my current thoughts and posting-hopefuls?  1.) Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., has made the news over his comments on gay sex. Certainly narrow-minded and hardly representatives of Pennsylvania's or U.S. population trends, yet these are people who end up representing. It's only part of the government overhaul needed.  Beyond his stance on the gay issue, his overall mindset is very disturbing. In his world, the two-parent family is king, but where he gets this concept is beyond me.  It's not that I don't support the two-parent system. Hell, I most likely would have been a different person had my parents stayed together (thank god they didn't though), but my experience and Census data finds the trend is going away from that.  The destruction of the family in the United States is also far more complicated than being wrecked by "homosexuality, feminism and liberalism."  A look at a  urlLink report from the Census  finds just 52.8% of U.S. households were headed by a married couple, 16% by a single parent and 31.2% by a non-family person(s).  I can hardly begin to explain why, but it's a changing world and women wanting to be out of bad relationships or doing it for themselves doesn't make them feminists. Should we deduce from Santorum that no married parents are both liberals. And let's be real, what percentage of broken marriages could have resulted from late-blooming homosexuals?  2). Questionable sick days. A  San Francisco Chronicle  technology reporter was recently fired from his job for falsifying his time sheet. The newspaper new in advance he was taking off to join an anti-war protest. He asked for a sick day and his reasoning:   "I was sick. I was heartsick. I was nauseated and I was depressed by the lies, arrogance and manipulation," he said.  Yes, strange.  Policy at the newspaper changed after the protest and to prohibit journalists from joining in public political activity with regards to the war. This I can completely understand. The catch is that the journalist was a technology reporter. I doubt his political activism would lead to biased articles on computer, phones and mp3 players.  While a line must be drawn, newspaper journalist have the added security of being faceless. Editors and news reporter must refrain, but photographers, copy editors, sports writers? I think the possibility of being active and not compromising their post is possible, not that I fully condone the idea, but if someone is "nauseated" by the Bush administration, copy editing isn't exactly an outlet.   Oh, and only the Rick Santorum post was written in the news room. The rest was after I got home. Do you think I even read a story after my 10:39 p.m. train left... ***  Good Citizens Eat Meat ... Plenty of It (From  The Good Citizen's Handbook , a collection of U.S. government pamphlets, civics texts, citizenship manuals and scouting manuals from the 1920s to 60s.)

       Waiting Still?   Once again, I'm not dead. I just spent the last week with 4 (four) attempts at socializing, 3 outside my usual circle of friends. That certainly takes me far from the computer world, which means no updates. It’s also been a usual busy week, but that is most definitely ending.   Sometime around May 31, I will be set free from the newspaper industry. I’ll enjoy some brief down time, but then it’s back to scraping my way into the media.  During the downtime I will probably not be able to consider myself a cynic journalist because I won’t have the same access to the myriad of stories run, edited or forgotten about on the wires. To get the same amount of access would require much time at my computer, which is not easy to do when the weather beckons me out and I sleep normal hours again.  I’ll probably post an unnecessary amount of gripes, maybe some applause, for Philadelphia and other bizarre encounters I pass. Such as Superman, who made his way around town apparently. I stumbled across him Thursday at Pine and Broad. James Brown was nowhere to be heard.  But a real post is coming... And yes, it’ll be about Philly, though very briefly I must applaud  The Los Angeles Times  this weekend for the first major story I’ve come across reporting on the failure of U.S. troops to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  A more recent story reports on another “chemical” find. We may just have to dig around for the results of any tests if it turns out to be another false alarm. Apparently the United States has gained an understanding of the “crying wolf” problem they may create.  So let us sit back and wait to find out if our war in Iraq will be legitimate or not.  Pour me another drink bartender, before I head home for some fun with Jimi Hendrix.  Purple Haze.

       Spring Time in Philly   For some, Spring hits with allergies. For others it's Cancun, Mexico. For reporters in New Jersey, it's school elections and budget votes, which I got to deal with this year. (Far easier than state and federal elections, I'm sure).   What really ushered in Spring for me this year: Superman. I kid you not, on 17th & Sansom streets in actual get-up, his cape an American flag handkerchief, running down the sidewalk. Earlier in the day we had a 'drummer boy' drumming to the music in his head, which to the people on the street sounded like a bad James Brown.  One year, Spring started with a trek to South Street where I saw a biker type strolling down the street with a live snake around him.  And my family thinks I'll voluntarily leave this city for Lancaster.  Of course, Spring also comes with taxes. I finished mine months ago and spent my puny return on a futon. I could have gotten more, but I spend my year lying to the IRS claiming I have a dependent at home so they take out less taxes. In the end, I get less back, but I need it most throughout the rest of the year.  Speaking of taxes, George W. Bush has signaled he's ready to worsen the U.S. debt and play voodoo economics only 3/4 of what he had originally planned. And what is really in the tax break? Not much for me. Supposedly it will create jobs, but former President Ronald Reagan tried tax cuts as a way to stimulate job growth and he called it "trickle-down," which it didn't. George W. Bush's father, who was running for the presidency in the early '80s, before settling on vice president first, called the plan "voodoo economics."  You give tax breaks to the upper class to spend and business to fund employment pushes and spending increases, all which helps the little guy. But with Corporate America carrying the debt load it does, more money has more important purposes, like funding a pay down on that debt to prevent bankruptcy fears.   Also, what do the rich, famous and CEOs do with their money? Buy yachts, Porsches and planes? Consume fine wine, caviar and filet mignon? Wear Gucci, Prada and Armani? How does their spending money on that help the average American citizen? Give the lower and middle class money and they'll do the economy a better deed with (pardon the stereotypes) bikes, Chevys and Fords. They'll go the grocery store to buy soda, OJ and fish sticks. They'll dress in Express, Polo and Abercrombie.  This at least has a better chance of putting the cash where the cash will do the most. Will $100,000 for a single car have the same impact as $100,000 spent in local mall?  Of course, for me, a tax break wouldn't up my spending much at all. The only thing I need is an air conditioner. The rest of any money would go to pay off my $43,000 in student loans and the $3,000 remainder of $10,000 in credit debt I racked up in college.  So there’s my rant for the day after tax day.   Philly is coming.  Was the fourth to last paragraph a subtle sales pitch of the charity type sweeping the Internet these days? I always accept donations and I promise to thank you graciously in my posts :)

       WMD False Alarms, Again!   Is the media burying the real news about the war?  Only a little bit. Last week U.S. forces uncovered barrels of "chemical agents," and the news reported preliminary findings that it was possibly a nerve gas. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wouldn't confirm the preliminary tests, but said more thorough testing would take a few days and then they would know.  The contents of the barrel were nothing more than strong pesticides.  How did I learn this? The false alarm news makes an appearance at the end of an article  urlLink reporting on a new potential find  in today's newspapers. Will any newspapers' editorial pages take up issue with the war entering Week 4 and still no justification for the disarming of Iraq? None that I can tell.   One other blunder (the list is getting hard to keep track of) on U.S. television news: Last week when U.S. forces began raiding and occupying Saddam's many palaces, a British reporter for CNN took viewers through a tour of one of Saddam's rather elaborate homes. As the camera went up the stairs and focused on the embellishments, the reporter noted that it supposedly was built with smuggled oil money that was denied to the Iraqi people. Oh, the horror!  MSNBC (ugh, Microsoft) later had a report on location and that story claimed the palace was built around 1990, prior to an embargoes or oil-for-supplies trading.  So what was with the false alarm report to tug on your heart strings? If only I knew.  I believe this if officially a Tuesday morning musing. My 2 days off from the newspaper are Wednesday and Thursday, so I'll post on Philly's parking then. Until then, just this bullshit on the Iraq conflict.

       Musings on a Sunday Night   Yes, these are random thoughts. This is just a steady stream of consciousness. Sort of like the psychological game of just writing down what comes to mind and analyzing it.  I checked the stats on the site here the other day and after much decline in the percentage of MacOS visitors, it's risen and stabilized on its own, and I don't have to visit my own site 10 times a day to hold it. Finally, I'm reaching out to other like beings. Now if only the IE percentage could drop. If I wanted to break up this steady stream of thought I could drop in pointless coding to take you to sites to download better alternatives to IE, but no one ever follows them anyway.  Also about Saddam Hussein. Yes, he's been a ruthless bad boy, but unlike Stalin and Hitler, doesn't he look awfully jovial and comical? Like maybe the Santa Clause at the King of Prussia mall?  And finally, leading into another post later this week on why Portland, Ore., has it right and Philly has it wrong: Another parking lot in between 2 parking garages and far from any place anyone would really want to go.

       Throw PC out the Window   Yes, your crappy Wintel junk, too.  As I've stated as many times as I've derided the war in Iraq, I am all about Portland, Ore. If only I got paid to sell that city to tourists.  A few things to note, which were rather different than in Philadelphia:  1.) The city is pasty white. Yes, there are blacks, Asians, Native Americans, Latinos ..., but in mostly smaller numbers. The easiest way to tell? A stand-alone Abercrombie & Fitch store in the City Center. The only one in Philly is on UPenn's campus. Need I say more?  2.) Punk, Goth, alternative, whatever is prevalent, but not better than Abercrombie white, though they might think so. The Goth scene there has is share of awkward wannabes, like the under 15 and over 28  crowd.  3.) To counter this, is the vocal Christian group. Many, many stores have the fish sign and are peddling respectable to gimmicky religious wares. The Holy Ghost also apparently filled a trolley full of people (except me), because they broke out into a competing song of "We love Jesus/Yes we do/We love Jesus/How about you?" Fortunately they didn't try saving people, like you get on  Philly's subways and sidewalks. My hostel also collected the Jesus guitar crowd. A very strange lot if you ask me, maybe because of the mix of hippie and all that isn't.  4.) To make up for the white is an abundance of Asian cultures and oddly, an Amish furniture store in Chinatown. I had some excellent Thai and Indian food, but it seems these restaurants outnumber the Chinese. In Philly, there's one of those on nearly every block (slight exaggeration, only slight). These places are so common in Portland, one food truck/roach coach was marketing itself as European fare: Polish sausage and pierogies.  These are only the little quirks I've stumbled upon. Real issues come later. It's a weekend morning, give me a break!

       Whose Side Is the Media On?   If only I could say nobody's side, but ...  For the week I was away from Philly, I kept up to date on the war with  The Oregonian , the  Williamette Weekly  and CNN. The first is the biggest daily in the Northwest and part of the same company as  The Times of Trenton . The  Weekly  is an alternative paper similar to the  City Paper  in Philadelphia. Obviously the last is the better  TV news source.  The very liberal  Weekly  had the first article I saw reporting the initial chemical plant find in Iraq as being untrue. Because it had died from the news, I had already deduced that the first reports were incorrect. But it is always nice to have confirmation in print. TV news doesn't count. The Pentagon has become more careful about their reports. Several other chemical finds have been noted, but, over the days, nothing has been said about them again.  As this war progresses, my respect for the international media has grown. Not that it was ever in ill repute, but they continue to ask the questions most of the U.S. media doesn’t.   An Associated Press war roundup story last week really killed the stature of the U.S. media. And I do mean story, it was hardly reporting. The writer (not reporter) claimed the U.S. Marines had "vanquished" Iraqi forces in Najaf. Vanquished? Is this the Dark Ages? Were the Marines rescuing a maiden from a dragon?  Regrettably the U.S. media has succumbed to zealous patriotism. Bastions of respectability still exist, such as the sarcastic reporter at Central Command in the Middle East. He wryly wondered aloud when the "press conferences" from the multi-million-dollar state-of-the-art center would be the center of groundbreaking news. It doesn't yet seem to have accomplished that.  Of late, the media  has balanced itself out, but required the loss of a growing number of journalists.  Part of the mistake on the U.S. media's part is their focus on the technology and not the human element. That has changed some with the POW rescue and destruction of Saddam's statues, but when the maps, planes and bomb graphics come up, the war takes on a sterile, video game feel, which has probably led to increasing support for the war.  Also, among the "support our troops" movement are some who feel the soldiers are fighting for our freedom. Huh?? Correct me if I'm wrong, but we are on the offensive in another country, and that country's military capabilities were thrown into confusion almost from the beginning. How were they infringing on the freedom of Americans?   The United States lost nothing after September 11 but its fantasy and basic citizens’ rights. Those citizens' rights were taken away by the Bush administration, not terrorists or Iraq. In case people have forgotten, the economy and stock markets came to a screeching halt months before the attacks. The administration is also pushing to further infringe on basic American rights with its proposed Patriot Act II.  OK, that’s a lot, so I’ll stop there and let it settle. Barring any more stupidity with the Middle East, I have plenty of raving to do for Portland, Ore., lamenting for Philly and complete dislike for Los Angeles.  I witnessed a most frightening sight at the new Borders in Philly. There beside Dan Savage's "Skipping Towards Gomorrah" was Michael Savage's "The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture." I bought Dan's book.

       Return of the Cynic   I'm back in Philly. I didn't realize how much I love this city. I still want Portland, Ore., but Los Angeles is a horrible city.  Not that I didn't enjoy my time there, but I wouldn't recommend a visit unless you have a driver. The Getty Musuem was amazing, and I didn't even get much to the collection. The building itself was fascinating.  I'll have plenty more on that and, of course, the war in Iraq.   Yes, I'm happy the people are free. As I've been saying, it'd have been better if the people did it themselves or had a larger part.   A CNN story this morning noted U.S. forces were working to expel Kurds (a native Iraqi group) from a city they had taken control of.  It should also be noted that without WMDs, this war is still illegitimate. Resolution 1441 and all the others did not give the United States or any nation the power to wage war to liberate the Iraqi citizenry.  Citizens are held to the law, and the United States should be held up to the law equally.  I only mention this because support for the war has grown, even as it failed at its objective and could end up being illegal.  Unfortunately, the Bush administration and media are playing a bit much to emotions and less to intelligence.  Believe me, I've got plenty to go on about the media as well.  But until then, it's already back to work in the drearier city of Philadelphia.

       Is It Possible   Portland is great. I'm staying at hostel, taking a load off after walking for 4 hours.  This city might have pulled off the impossible: taken me from Philadelphia.  It's at least a year away, but still possible. Small city, but clean. Multiple eclectic neighbors and a waterfront. Pedestrian friendly and better public transit system.  More about the transit system of Philadelphia later, only because a funding shortfall is leading to massive cuts. Exactly how is a city to survive?  Also, through conversations with the male parental unit on the plane (4 hours and no regard to my headphone on and playing) more reasons for war. Actually, I've come across this in a few stories of late and that was going to be my big sign off. Apparently people now feel our soldiers are fighting for our freedom.  Huh???  More from Los Angeles.

I really had stuff planned to say here as a little send off for my weeklong vacation in Portland, Ore., and Hollywood.  But alas, it's 5:50 and I'm about out the door.  Non-war stuff when I get back.

       I Have No Idea What to Say   After being away for a bit, I'm back. The keyboard and mouse came in Tuesday, but I worked that night and last night I didn't spend much time online. I was supposed to go out and have a life, but that fell through. Hardly amazing.  So this morning, I'm at the AIA and killing time. What better than to post bullshit on my blog?  I'm supposed to have a life again tonight. A friend is coming in from dreaded suburbia. Not that we'll go out. Probably chill. Maybe Checkers, a movie and weed. Yes, nothing too crazy; Friday I'm working both jobs. Ugh.  But then I'm off on Saturday as my new hours kick in. The Weather Channel claims it will be nice out, so I'll get around, see my city, visit Chinatown and enjoy a day off.  I also need to get my plans together for South Caroline and Georgia. Purchase train tickets, hostel reservations and beach things, which I don't own because I've not been to a beach or pool in 3 years.  I did get trunks already. God, forgive me, I went to J. Crew to get them. First time I ever bought anything there and only the 2nd time I've been in the store.  What a year! I was forced into vocally supporting the Dixie Chicks and then voluntarily went to J. Crew. Could my end be in sight?  Speaking of... Part of my reason for being so pissed last night about plans falling through is my new outlook on life, thanks to Tanitha. Her death is probably only the 2nd or 3rd life-altering event I've had.  But in the wake of it all, I've decided I can't put off visiting friends and doing new things. Last night would have been the first time I saw my DJ friend perform, and I really wanted to, but I don't go to bars and lounges (never to clubs) alone. So I didn't. Now I work every Wednesday night, so I hope to catch him at other times.  But I have to go out. I have to see people. I can't put off what doesn't need to be.  And I have to go downstairs to the AIA Bookstore to learn how to work on the Web site, because, let's face reality, it has issues.

       Reprieve   Doing well. Getting more sleep. Working at the AIA. Working at  The Times of Trenton  for a few hours tonight.  I can hardly get a new post together, so let me just point you to some stories regarding the USA Patriot Act; that counter-terrorism measure passed with so much zeal following the Sept. 11 attacks.  While this may make me one of those bleeding liberals who will certainly destroy the country, let me direct you to a techie Web site's story regarding  urlLink non-counter-terrorism measures the Patriot Act has been used for . Yes, it's still catching criminals, but the problem with the Patriot Act is that it lowers the standards necessary to begin and follow through with investigations. And simply for principle sake, hackers and thieves are not terrorists, so these new measures should not be used against them.  Alaska has joined Hawaii and dozens of towns and cities across the United States in  urlLink opposing the Patriot Act  because of its questionable nature and ability to infringe on people's civil liberties. It's a growing movement. The measure came up in Philadelphia, but never went anywhere.   An Alaska state congressman has ripped off a stance I had made earlier, that there is a price for freedom: Risk. This congressman noted that the United States sends its troops to fight across the globe for the rights upheld by its Constitution and Declaration of Independence, so it is the citizens' job to fight infringements on their freedoms as well. This is just one step.  A third story reports on the  urlLink actions by bookstores and libraries across the nation in opposing the Patriot Act . Federal law now allows investigators to march into a library or bookstore and demand to know who is signing out or purchasing particular books. Almost like in  Seven . In response, some libraries are regularly destroying their records.  And finally, a fourth story written by Brian White, who wrote for the  Temple News  when I was running the show. This was published in the  City Paper  and deals with the next Patriot Act being worked on by our friend and defender of freedom through the judicial system, John Ashcroft.  OK, so that's it for now. My keyboard and mouse are dead at home, so I'm awaiting new ones from Apple. This post comes from work at the AIA. I'll be quiet for a few days and might actually read while I'm at my apartment. Probably sleep more, too. *** Snapple Fact: Los Angeles has 3 times more automobiles than people. See why I hate that city?

       Closure   Services for Tanitha are being held Sat., May 24. Several family members have flown in from Thailand. I'll be going with some people from the  Temple News .   I was asked if wanted to say anything at the service, but I don't know what to say. I've said what I've needed to, what I can say. The rest I guess I am just keeping to myself. It'll come out over time in my private journal, the one thing that helps me sort through my life the most. Rather than take advice from people, I just need someone to hear it, without comment, without criticism, and my journal does just that.  I've spend a lot of time sorting things out over the years in that method, and I think I've come along way, rather successfully, with bumps and bruises that heal.  Going to the service and just listening to others will probably be difficult enough, but I'll be around people that knew her, that understand. So I'll make it through.  I napped on my lunch break today at the AIA. I've gotten sleep these past few days, but each morning waking up, it feels like I've not slept much at all. The distractions throughout the day are helpful in getting through. When they stop, and I'm preparing for bed, she creeps in mind and is still there when I wake up, before something else requires my attention.  Hopefully, during my nights of sleep (but not), I am working myself through all of this. What needs to come up outside of sleep, will come up and that's why it's good to have friends.

       What to Say?   Today was a bit easier, following a brief night of sleep, calling out from the newspaper and another small nap back home this evening. I did go to work at the Bookstore, I just had to have some routine, but I preferred it not be routine until 1 a.m. I also voted today. God only knows who I voted for and what issues were at stake, but I did it anyway. Hardly a highlight, but Checkers Chicken Strips Meal and  Ocean's Eleven  did wonders as well.  I found out late yesterday afternoon that Tanitha passed away at 6:58 a.m. I had been asleep. Through the fog of Monday night I missed out on exactly where Tanitha was. She had been moved to the University City UPenn hospital. Not as far as I thought. I could have gone and left when I needed to, rather than being stranded in Phoenixville, unable to run.  Rather disturbingly, while going through my Inbox as I was e-mailing several friends and others who needed to know, I found two recent e-mails from her, a cartoon and a card. *** Some more sleep and another day at the Bookstore tomorrow.   Goodnight.

         Sobering Night, Personal Post   I have a best friend named Tanitha Kulsiri and she's going to die today.  I believe officially she already is, brain dead I'm told, but I cannot go and see her. I was offered a ride from Philly to the hospital, but already in Trenton and in between trains, it was so far away. I also don't think I could really visit her. I don't know if it would have brought closure or drove me mad from missed opportunities and knowing that she really wasn't there. I do plan on attending the service, that should bring me closure without the dangerous side effects.  Tanitha was in a coma last week from dialysis complications, but pulled through. She  woke up as herself, trying to remove the food tube, pushing out visitors and demanding to go home.  She was expected to recover and was going to get a phone call from me berating her for almost leaving me without me getting her a present (inside joke) and saying "goodbye." Other complications followed, and while trying to move her to another hospital she went into cardiac arrest. That was when it ended.  I knew that she had had complications before. She was hospitalized for a little more than month while she was my managing editor at the  Temple News .  Tanitha is one of very few friends I have from Temple, and the longest from there. She's 22 and this isn't supposed to happen. We first met over alcohol and parties in Temple Towers Apt. 109E. It led to revelations such as: "I sit behind you in Newswriting I!" From there it was work on the  Temple News , more classes and faulty group projects over the summer, into Apt. 409E. Finally culminating as my No. 2 at the  News   We'd fallen out of each other's light following my graduation and only kept in contact through IM and on rare face-to-face occasions, because the two of us were working, and she still in school. But every time we talked again, it was as if the time away hadn't happened. We had recently started talking again daily and had planned on meeting. I guess this is how it goes when you put things off and don't seize the opportunity.  I'd missed more than one opportunity with her. I really cared for her and she's one of the few girls I'd wanted to date. Feisty, witty, intelligent and beautiful. Plus she could actually stand being around me. And Tanitha, regardless of what you say, I'm bi, not gay. There's a difference, obviously. It’s been 8 years, I know how it goes.  She'd been my partner in crime at Temple. From skipping classes, to causing havoc for our newspaper adviser and probably a professor or two. There was also the underage drinking, and I still have that shot glass she left at my place, and I never returned; a source of contention through all the years.  There were the regular trips to the Chinese roach coach for dumplings, dinners at the Cheesecake Factory and god help me, trips to Abercrombie.  We also regularly called off outings, something I'm bound to regret, because that was always the beginning of our little falling outs, but that was just how we worked.  Tanitha was a big part of my formative years, personally, that is. At Textile I was a mess, but I started getting my act together at Temple. So much of that involved the  News  (probably something to lament) and the people I met there (not something to lament) and the few relationships I’ve carried beyond that time.  I talked to a long-lost friend Lauren, photo editor for me at the  News  and it felt good to talk about this with someone else who knew her. An earlier conversation with a friend didn't help, but I also hadn't yet had the train ride home to process everything.  Early morning discussions with Dev and Jigsha helped close out the day, and I might actually close my eyes tonight before a new day.  A different day.  I lost a friend today and the best I can do for myself is write about it, rather than closing myself off.

       Ignoring Customers   I'm at work at the AIA Bookstore and completely ignoring customers. But for good reason, I'm updating the world on a toy gone awry we have here at the store. It's called "Fun with Your Dog Science Kit" or "Fun with Your Cat Science Kit."  Doesn't that just sounds like the making of a small disaster - possibly fire, death or mutilation?  Leave it to me to see the cheery side to all of this.  ***  I thought I was going to leave work early yesterday; we actually had 3 (THREE) people reading copy. It was unprecedented. It was almost enough to get me home early. Almost, as in 5 minutes too long for the 2nd to last train leaving Trenton.  So it was me and my iPod. I saw 3 other ones yesterday at 30th Street Station and on the R7.  We're taking over the world!  I should probably get back to work.

       Saying "Hi" from CHAD   To get this off my chest first - this post is from a bloody Wintel using IE something or other. I apologize for my dip in standards.  But it's not like I have a choice. I'm currently manning a continuing education conference for Philadelphia architects, thanks to my job at the AIA. CHAD is the  urlLink Charter High School for Architecture and Design  (don't ask me where the "S" got to), which was founded by the AIA. So I'm spending my Saturday in high school. And these types of computers are all that's available to me.  I think my high school graduating class was to have a 5-year reunion last year, but it didn't happen. Or they didn't contact me, which is fine by me; I moved to the other side of the state for a reason.  Architects are a funny lot. So special and individual; each requiring special care, or with my attitude, refined from Tower Records employment, is to just disrespect nearly every one of them. They think they can just show up without preregistering and step into any class regardless of if it's full or not. On particular gentleman today is rather good at talking down to non-architects, such as myself and the actual Continuing Education director(?). I want to remind him, just once, that I've not seen a design of his garner any kind of accolades or such.  I should probably save my mean-spiritedness for people who understand me and can either join in or just enjoy it. Such as Jenn. Ah, the two of us are trouble. Bad, horrible trouble to each other and the surrounding populace. When we are in public, people must seriously wonder if we are married and going through counseling.  OK, classes changing soon. I need to escort people along to the classroom one door down.  Speaking of which, for some god-awful reason my sister attended a 3 Doors Down concert on her day off. Attempts at instilling good music are lost on her.

       I Just Knew It   Of course,  The Matrix Reloaded  would have to turn out how it did. I was expecting this. I'm not going to say it sucks. I need to watch it a second time because of some annoying f**ks who felt the need to talk and comment on EVERYTHING. And he answered his phone, argh the bitch.  Aside from the movie's different feel, completely new mythology - which you would think would have shown up in the first - and new enemies, this movie is so overtly sexual that it shocks me none of the reviews I read mentioned it. From a bizarre orgy scene to a female 'hot flash' and kissing with spit, it's all very attention getting but not for the same reason.  But I guess my trip to the movie theater today was bound to disappoint. As a way to bypass all the insanity and lines, I went with a friend to the new theater on UPenn's campus. Pretentious as anything. The area where you pay tickets looked more like a hotel check-in. The bathroom had what appeared to be hardwood floors.  And believe me, it's not envy. Pretentious just gets on my nerves. Ah, those Ivy Leaguers.  At my newspaper we apparently have reporters from Princeton University. I love editing those stories. Not sure what they were taught at the big name university. I'm sure the same could be said about half the people whom I graduated with from Temple University, but we don't bank on the university name to get us places.

       Back to Normal   OK, I'm alive again. That last bizarre post is a distant memory, and I spent the first half of yesterday sick as a dog; probably from realizing I was in ever-so-slight agreement with George W. Bush.  No, but seriously, I called out at the AIA Bookstore and slept in, took Tylenol and blocked out the world for awhile. Well as long as I could with the telemarketers. I once thought I didn't have a problem with them, but because I'm only usually home between 2 a.m. and 9 a.m., I guess I miss most of their calls.  Aside from credit cards and long-distance telephone service, I've been getting hit up for newspaper and magazine subscriptions on a regular basis. Usually they scoff when I tell them I work in the news industry and read most of the stories they print and more before it actually hits the stands in the morning.  Yesterday I went out to run some errands after feeling better. I also got to hang with a friend at my place and prepare for the new "Matrix" movie on Friday, when I'm also off both jobs.  I was going to go out, but it's been a hard week in terms of money, so maybe next week on my days off. The point is, I got out of my apartment and enjoyed the almost decent weather. It's going to be shit tomorrow though. Ugh.  Where did May go?  Hmm, that's about it. Can't really do a serious post; I'm at the AIA "working" now.  Ah, but something to read. We all know about Sen. Rick Santorum from my favorite backwards state. Well our other senator,  urlLink Sen. Arlen Specter is equally unnerving , as reported and prodded by the humor columnist Dave Barry.  Ciao.

       OK, This Is Really Out There   I want to climb a tree. I've not climbed a tree in probably 3 years and that was in Western Pennsylvania in my climbing tree, probably 6 or 7 stories up.  Philly has its share of trees, but it's different. Such as finding time to go climb one. It'd probably be more exciting in Philly than at my mom's on 17 acres of field and forest. Certainly that area is greener, but here it'd have a voyeuristic side to it, but enough about that ...  It's just spring and I still feel tied down. Fall and winter are fine for being indoors, but I want the outdoors now. I want to swim. To walk around in shorts. To sweat. All of this has been difficult with the job at the newspaper, but in 2 weeks that will change. Then I'll have 4 nights free each week for trouble and fun. Or sitting at home wishing I would get off my ass and go out.  I'm a social retard. I don't work well in large scenes. If I have another person with me, I'll go, but then I don't leave their side and mingle.  Here's how observant I am: The news editor and assistant news editor's (the A1 man and the assistant) names are Ted and Bill, respectively. Today it hit me that it's Bill and Ted's not so excellent adventures at  The Times of Trenton .  God, I need help.

       More Bad Things, Such As Supporting Bush   OK, you've returned to consciousness, that's good.  This hit me like a windshield in a car crash, too. A story that I was reading off the wires this weekend dealt with Bush and tax cuts. Not just the new ones he'd like to have, but his last ones and the next ones. Yes, I said next ones. Apparently the Bush administration is going to push for tax cuts each year. One can only hope that none of them do anything for the economy and it helps him lose the election in 2004.  But I digress.  It seems the larger goal of these tax cuts is to simplify the U.S. tax code, which in its current form, probably confuses the IRS.  I’m all for that, if I could believe it. The only reason major problems, such as tax holes, loops and “Pass Go and Collect $200” for corporations, are being closed now is because moderate Republicans want to trim losses from Bush’s latest cuts. If the larger goal was tax reform, why weren’t reforms such as this included in his plan?  More importantly, how much more cutting can the government afford? At this point the United States is cutting services in its bid to cut cost and trim the bureaucracy. It is not cutting entities. It is also beefing up the military.  While I do support cuts to the military, allow me to explain why. Probably the only way to do so without weakening the country is through better use of NATO and the United Nations. It’s become apparent the current administration is not looking to do this, and I lament such attitude. The $80 billion price tag for the Iraq conflict could have been halved, I’m sure. Allowing U.N. weapons inspectors back into Iraq, rather than doing it (sloppily) ourselves would save resources, money and would add legitimacy to the U.S. cause.  I say sloppy inspections and mean it. Stories coming across my desk this weekend noted the lack of translators and fully equipped search teams. It’s a rather shabby show and former U.N. weapons inspectors are saying evidence is probably being lost each day to looting and inexperience.  While states, municipalities and Europe are strengthening through sharing, the United States is doing the opposite and it’s costing you and me more than just money.  So, while I hate paying taxes, there's a reason it is one of two certain things in life. Government can't run without them. And government should exist to provide services not deemed profitably by corporations. It's why the Postal Service and Amtrak should remain federally subsidized and not shed, and why health care should simply be reined in to allow larger portions of the population to take advantage of it. Let's not handicap our government.  Ah, ass backwards.  OK, I digressed some more. It's 1 a.m. I'm working both jobs tomorrow; why am I up?

       Let Me Apologize, Profusely   If you visited this site yesterday, please allow me to apologize for the piece of shit post. While none of my posts may shine, the following one was a piece of shit. I have no clue where my head was. It has since been cleaned up and is partly readable.  Incorrect tenses, missing articles, missing punctuation and homophones. It read like a college senior term paper.  OK, so I've kicked myself in the ass and I can head to bed. I agreed to help the AIA set up the 2003 Home Showcase in 30th Street Station's North Lobby at 8 a.m.   Apparently, I was on something yesterday.

       "Living In Fear" - Lenny Kravitz   I'm sitting here Saturday morning after, gasp, a full 7 hours of sleep. It's probably a record amount over the last 2 weeks. I'm looking forward to my first real vacation in some time. Yes, there was Portland, Ore., (I need to get back there), but that included Hollywood with the male parental unit, and any vacation with him cuts the 'vacation' aspect out of a trip. Such as the Hollywood trip when he decided to change plans on picking me up (without telling me) and leaving me stranded at the airport. That was just the beginning of 'fun.' And the trip to visit my mom doesn't count as vacation, it's Western Pennsylvania for Christ's sake.  Sometime this summer I'll be visiting a good friend, April, in Charleston, S.C. Ah, by the beach. Ah, our zaniness, which will surely get us into trouble. And yes, I would consider a night in jail interesting. Up to this point in my life, I've only been cited for breaking curfew and the officer drove us home and only gave us a warning.  The male parental unit (Jeff) is making a big showing in this post. I met him in King of Prussia last weekend so he could transport my air conditioner from there to Philly. Our lunch discussion at Dick Clark's American Bandstand restaurant included, surprise, Iraq. From here you can deduce something: we did not agree. It turns out male parental unit is afraid of terrorists. He’s let them win, the bastard. Jeff supported the war effort and now that Saddam Hussein is ousted, he feels safer. I don't know why, but he does.  He didn't fully explain his fear of Saddam Hussein beyond his 'knowing' Iraq has banned weapons and is supporting al-Qaida. A second plane attack by the terrorist group against the United States seems far more likely than banned weapons or Iraqi suicide bombers getting out of the country and into ours.  Jeff also believes the price of freedom is war. God I hope this isn't a shared idea in the entire Republican Party. Jeff sees nothing wrong with pre-emptive attacks and fully supports U.S. action against every terrorist, country with terrorists in it and so on. He doesn't understand that those actions are what led to the rise of al-Qaida. That U.S. self-righteousness helps feed Islamic extremism. Rather than solve the problem, U.S. action is mimicking the fatal downward spiral in Israel. Rather than halt the forward front, Israel pushes against Palestinians after each attack. And after Israel pushes forward, Palestinians increase their attacks rather than drop them.  The biggest fault I see in Jeff is his inability to relate to other cultures. You can't impose American democracy on a culture that doesn't grasp it, on a culture that doesn't really allow it. Doing so is nation building, which is a degree of imperialism, something the United States has denied it is doing.  But it seems the downward spiral has begun. It's not possible to root out every enemy. Let's be realistic, OK?

       Brian Did a Bad, Bad Thing   OK, it didn't lead to a nuclear disaster or anything, but after some  urlLink bitching and griping about Verizon , I've switched to it. I'm still a big proponent of Cavalier Telephone, but I'm looking to cut costs and they need more revenue. I've now got the "bare bones" service and DSL. My Verizon bill will probably still be less then their average target bill, so I can consider myself working against them.  My cell phone bill was a different story last month. Why did I have to talk SO much last month when I was on vacation?  This week I also spent $6.94 (or something like that) at the iTunes music store. Ah, I love it. Too bad I couldn't wait an extra month before buying my iPod, but that's Murphy's Law right?  I don't know if Apple really expects consumers to switch computers for this new service or the iPod, but it does raise Apple's profile and hopefully that leads to some gains down the road.  This is sort of an in betweeen post because I'm at work and, ugh, on a Wintel Dell that needs reformatted every month. I'm trying to con the AIA into letting me purchase a Powerbook through them and use it at work and for subverting the population. We'll see where that goes.

       It Was Cinco de Mayo and I'm Not Drunk   I'm also not Mexican, but since when did that stop Americans from celebrating other culture's holidays? Hell, we'd be much more pro-Muslim if drinking wasn't an Islamic no-no and their holidays gave college kids reasons to go out, get smashed and vomit on the sidewalk by my building.  I'm very tired. It's 2:30 a.m. I have no idea. I feel tired, but I never go to bed when I'm tired. I'm still in college mode. This and it's nearing the one year anniversary of my graduation.   God, what have I accomplished? Actually a decent amount. Still holding down 2 jobs through the rough times. Probably someone much needier is without a job because of me. I've also paid off all of my canceled credit. Believe me, that's feat in itself.  Just a little update to go with my parking lot lamentation. I passed by the one by City Hall on Sunday and counted 8 cars. This was around 2 in the afternoon and the Equality Forum had some kind of event going on.   In case no one knows, the "gayborhood" is a few blocks from this lot and the Equality Forum brings people in from around the world. Obviously some would come by car, but this lot was not even at 10% capacity, and, once again, the streets were rather crowded.  Maybe they were in church?  I  had an actual post that is half written, but I'm not awake enough to present an argument.

       Pointless Banter   It's Friday night and I'm not out. The newspaper kept me a little too late tonight for it be a small edition. Otherwise I'd not be here.  I'd also have missed Amtrak's signals in Philly dying, which put the SEPTA trains at a crawl. I also would have missed a compliment on my "shell top Adidas" shoes. I've never been complimented on shoes before. Always watches, but this is the second time someone has noticed them. The first was a coworker, the second was a girl with a baby on the C Bus heading into the city.  It also appears I'll be taking this bus for awhile longer, unless SEPTA cut threat isn't just political, because the newspaper gave me the option of extending my internship through the end of the summer. I have misgivings, but I'm cutting my hours back significantly. How can I drop a job in my field when the unemployment rate just bumped up?  I'm getting A/C in my hot-as-hell apartment. I've lived here 2 summers and dealt with it, but no more. And while I'm not a fan of A/C - they pump it up at work so that in the dead of summer, sweaters, jackets and space heaters come out of the closet early - I'll keep it set well above the recommended summer setting of 72 degrees Fahrenheit. Just enough so I can stand it my apartment motionless and not sweat.  OK, it's late. I have to meet the male parental unit to pick up this monster and get a free meal early tomorrow.

       First Post on My PowerBook   I won't bore you with the details of how great this little notebook is. If you've not considered switching by now, nothing will get through your thick head. *** Here's the story I'm going to complain about.  urlLink Going bananas for the new year . You can read it before my rant, but you have to promise to return.  Urban living. Supposedly more diverse, more cultured and, in some cases, more intelligent.  All of these ideas came crashing down on Thursday while I was editing a story dealing with monkey sculptures. Mount Holly, a large town in New Jersey - in our coverage area from Trenton, a city, hence the beginning sentence - is already planning New Year's Day festivities. They call it First Night. To help market the event this year, they are using monkey sculptures. And why, you ask for the 2nd time? Because according to the Chinese New Year, 2004 is the Year of the Monkey.  This is where my rant comes in. New Year's Day is Jan. 1, 2004. The Chinese New Year's Day, according to the lunar calendar, is Jan. 22, 2004. The problem is that the reporter failed to note this. Did the reporter know? I don't know. This small oversight also got through 2 editors before coming to the copy desk where the concensus was to inform the public. No mention of even the time difference in non-specific terms, so does the town even know this?  Besides the obvious cultural faux pas, the ever changing Chinese New Year's Day is not common knowledge to a vast majority of United States citizens; probably even a large part of the cultural Chinese American population. It was additional information to educate the readers and it could have served as an excellent cultural exchange, something seriously needed in a woefully isolationist country.  While the story focused mainly on the monkeys, the extra information could have changed a mediocre non-news story into something more. God knows the Princeton reporter includes 15" of bullshit into most all stories from that area, much to the annoyance of the copydesk, which ... a) is usually stretched and would rather not ready 30" "stories;" and b) can't cut much of the fluff because our job is correcting grammar and obvious factual errors.  OK, done. Welcome to the real world of news.  It's Saturday night and I'm going out and having a life!!

       Quiet, No More    Not much has been going on here. Just enough to keep me from posting. I have to get used to the effects of fewer hours in the news room. I could probably have written super-pointless posts, but instead I've opted for just a pointless one following my submersion into the news.  This one is fairly scrambled.  I was reading the Associated Press story on how U.S. troops in Baghdad are handling the heat. The story was slightly humorous, but apparently the heat had gotten to the reporter as well.  While describing the sweating and how U.S. troops manage, the reporter stumbled across and shared TMI - not Three Mile Island, the nuclear power plant that nearly melted down, while I was in the womb and in the worst-case-scenario danger area, but too much information.  In attempts to stay cool, U.S. troops don just a t-shirt under their gear and no underwear, "a state known as 'going commando.'" This was in a news story! Come on now. For starters, this is rather pointless information, regardless of the stories tone, but this is also fairly common fact. "Friends" featured it in a episode. Why not mention that the common folk in the streets of Baghdad are Iraqis.  I might be overreacting to it, but it's the stupidest thing to read. I just paused and  mentioned it to a coworker so we could both express shock and awe that AP editors allowed it.  Needless to say, I axed that line of story.  Another story that I was fortunate enough to edit (did you catch the sarcasm) dealt with an attempt by the New Jersey Legislature to offer greater freedom to citizens who want to display American flags and other "symbols of patriotism," while restricting towns from banning it.  Is this honestly necessary? The Senate unanimously approved it, now it's going through the Assembly, much to my chagrin, though I can hardly do anything to stop it.  The legislators sponsoring the bill note that with all the United States has been through, we should all be patriotic and be unimpeded in our effort to plaster flags and other symbols of patriotism on our hats, lapels, cars, front lawn, back lawn and wherever else we choose on our property.  Why is this a requirement of patriotism? I got a Discover Platinum card in the mail the other day and, most disturbingly, the design was a waving American flag. I tucked it away until I had time to call Discover and tell them I want a different design, anything but a god damn flag. I told them I can't use a card with that on it. They probably directed me account to the FBI (Oh my God, he's bought porn, what a dirty, bad American! Add that to his file ... that we don't have because we're not really supposed to spy on the U.S. citizenry.)  And I'm plenty patriotic. I use my freedom of speech and right to the press. I pay my taxes and I've voted in every election since I made Philadelphia my permanent address (I didn't give a shit who was running the show in Western Pennsylvania).  And here comes the tirade...  And yet, some of these examples are being infringed upon by the the U.S. government. Freedom of speech can suddenly land you in much hotter water than before the Bush Administration took over. In fact, it can lead to boycotts. Those boycotts also leave the victims alone, because people are afraid to stand up and be seen as "unpatriotic," just like the victims. Hollywood associations were screaming that the black lists of the Red Scare must not return. Isn't this the 21st century? Isn't this America, land of the free?  Why was anti-war suddenly anti-American? That line was used from government officials, to media celebrities to the common folk on the street. Such rhetoric was so far from patriotic, you'd have to be an idiot to use it.  When will I pay my taxes and get a tax break, rather than the millionaires (not all of them are bad), who use loopholes to already pay far less in taxes than their share?  Why am I living in an era when Big Brother gets bigger because a nearly rubber-stamping Congress gave Attorney General John Ashcroft his USA Patriot Act and it's soon to be attempted Part 2, even though a growing number of municipalities across the nation are passing resolutions shooting it down because it blatantly infringes on the basic rights given to Americans more than 200 years ago.  If our Founding Fathers gave us the freedom of the press, why is the current leadership making it harder to get in? Consolidation means layoffs, not mass hiring. More outlets mean more jobs, precisely what a) I need; and b) the economy needs. Whether consolidation happens or not, you can be sure in the shrinking environment, some smaller outlets will be forced to close up shop or sell, offering less opportunity for voices  OK, catch my breath...  My G4 laptop is here with the rest of my gadgets. Ah, to have free time...  That'll be Friday, when the nice weather is supposed to succumb to rain and ugly nonsense, ruining my opportunities for a night on the town.

       It's the Little Things   I went to Checkers tonight for supper, or whatever the meal is called around midnight and ordered the usual, #5 - chicken fingers meal - and to my surprise they gave me 4 chicken fingers rather than 3.  OK, how was that for pointless banter?  My PowerBook should show up Monday or Tuesday. Maybe I should call out of the newspaper on Wednesday so I can get to know it.  I'm considering giving my Mac G4 to my grandma. I passed off my last laptop to her and it's about dead.  All of this means a trip to rural Lancaster County. Should be decent. Haven't made my way there in several months. Some home-cooked meals would be nice. I attempted that tonight, but obviously gave up if I ate at Checkers.  Remember in May I decided to switch back to Verizon for phone and DSL because it was cheaper, and how I couldn't believe I was going back after beating them up in a post? Well, it's been a month and the service isn't on yet. Installation has been delayed twice. They're fucking with me. So far I managed to get a free month of phone service. I guess I have to complain to the DSL side and get that for free as well. It would certainly weaken my next scathing review or non-recommendation.  I'll get back to my old disagreeable self soon enough. Until then, enjoy the pointless tidbits. Then when I'm a star reporter, making rounds on TV (to lift up the shit news they have), you can say you know me.

       Can the U.S. Possibly F*** with Me Anymore?   First it was the American citizens - peers, unfortunately, in that regard - who forced me to openly support and root for the Dixie Chicks because of their overzealous patriotism (i.e. communist nature pushing for censorship).  Now, I'm supporting Martha Stewart. Believe me, the woman makes my skin crawl, just as it does for every other straight male on the planet, but could her crime be any less trivial, her punishment any more over the top?   Possible prison sentences range to 30 years, for what? Her actions did not send the stock market crashing. Her actions did not lead to bankruptcies, suicides and layoffs. Those results followed the Enron and WorldCom scandals, and what has happened to them? Slaps on the wrist so far.  In fact, WorldCom is asking that billions of dollars in debt essentially be erased, allowing it to emerge from near liquidation to a position better than almost every major telcom in the United States. So far, it doesn't seem the courts are balking at the proposal.  Can the United States be anymore ass backwards? Could the media be as well? Outlets ranging from newspaper to TV are splashing it across the front page and lead-in with horribly written articles.   For instance, last night, the wire story run by  The Times of Trenton  originally stated that Martha "...shielded herself from the light rain with an off-white umbrella. She swept past reporters..."  Hello? While it's easy to make those comments because of her line of work, it's expected and therefore low and exactly why it shouldn't have been written. Thankfully the copy desk deleted those sentences.  I can only find solace in knowing my new G4 Powerbook, when it arrives next week, will distract me from the mass stupidity afflicting this country. Ah, inanimate objects...

       Letter to My Congressmen   Dear Rep. Chaka Fattah and Sens. Rick Santorum and Arlen Specter,  It seems gay marriage has become the political issue of the summer, after George W. Bush's sputtering war in Iraq and reasoning behind it.  While I do not support gay marriage I do not feel a Constitutional amendment should be used to end it. The fact that such an amendment is working its way in the House and has yet to be killed speaks volumes about misused power, when far more pressing matters are at hand.  What it reminds me of is the Prohibition Amendment - pushed through not for the benefit of the U.S. citizenry, but for a few overly self-righteous Congressmen.  Marriage exists only because of religion. Government provides benefits to the married and in some instances provides marriage services through the Justice of the Peace. Who can marry who should be left to the Church. It’s quite apparent the Church is not supporting homosexual marriage, which it shouldn't. I agree with the Church both as a born and raised Methodist and as a current agnostic (for lack of a better term).  What the U.S. government should be worrying about is how best to represent its citizens. I believe that exists in the realm of what has become known as “unions.”  What such a thing would provide is government benefits equal to those of marriage. It would not undermine family. It would provide same-sex couples the ability to file taxes as a single household. It would allow a person to visit his/her significant other in the hospital. In the event of a death, it would give a significant other the right to the deceased’s property. And so on.  What I am talking about is equality before the law, not God, which is not the government’s jurisdiction. What I am talking about is fairness.  I am asking that should gay marriage move along any further in Congress that it be stopped before it becomes the embarrassment that is.  Regardless of your religious beliefs, you were voted into office to represent the people of Pennsylvania. The only way you could possibly do that would be to provide an alternative that satisfies the majority of the people you represent.  It’s obvious the Bush Administration has special interests in mind. Don’t let this so thoroughly taint Congress as well.  I invite you to read some additional thoughts on these matters and similar issues that I have posted on my Internet blog.   urlLink Santorum and gays   urlLink Same-sex benefits   Sincerely, Brian Swope

       If Only the Citizenry Were Blameless   The media are always the bad guys. It’s easy to point a finger and say “You’re biased” or “Why didn’t you report that,” or any other number of lines.  For example,  The Philadelphia Inquirer  has come under attack over the past 34 months from interest groups for both favoring Israel and the Palestinians in its coverage of the fighting in the Middle East.  Now how is that possible?  Or how can  The Daily News  of Philadelphia be a racist paper when its readership base is largely black?  Now certainly there is some bias in the media, but is its purpose to deceive? Not in a respectable news outlet.  NPR radio is considered left of center. Newspapers in general are the same, while TV is all over the place. Allow me to very truthfully state that of the three TV is the worst with bias. Then radio follows with alternative weeklies and finally newspapers at the bottom.  Part of newspaper’s bias comes from it’s decline. Magazines became niche players after radio and then TV served a one-two punch. Newspapers are doing the same thing. It’s unfortunate, but that seems to be the case.  And what is to blame for the decline? Television, the Internet and that growing sense of apathy in the U.S. citizenry.   The only one I don’t have a problem with is the Internet because it provides far more information than what any newspaper or TV could provide in their coverage.  The television also provides some form of news, but these 2 media options have also killed the one thing the newspaper need. An attention span.  Newspapers had responded with pictures, color, and expanded sections, but that hasn’t saved them as much as hoped. Gains have only mostly come at the expense of other newspapers.  So what has now popped up is this “newspaper” called  The Metro . It’s for the short-attention-span citizen.  I’d not gripe about it so much, I mean at least it’s some news, but how can people scream bias when this extremely and unfortunately popular global newspaper devotes 10" or less of a story to something that  The Times of Trenton  ran as 20" and  The New York Times  ran as 70"?  Something is getting lost in the editing here. Could it be facts and other such things that round out a story and give both sides equal time? Probably.  The problem with all forms of media is that financing must come from somewhere. Newspaper ads fill editorial space and commercials cut into news clips.   Of course, this all works for the short-attention-span citizen, but they need to understand something is missing. Then there are the people who already know this, but being passive readers, they let it go.  Then there are psycho news people such as me who avidly readers local, regional, national and international news sources, both independent and mainstream.  If more people picked up  The Metro  as a supplement and still read  The Inquirer  or whatever major newspaper covered the area, there would be a great balance. Certainly each of the different media requires the others to be successful. The effect could be far better if people were active.  How do I know most people are passive and not helping the situation? An  urlLink  Inquirer  poll in June  found that 1/3 of American believed U.S. forces had found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  Err. Wrong.  Silly readers. I guess they missed this story.

       Beating a Dead Horse   This is an interim post. It is basically lamenting the 3rd military operation taken on by the United States in the 2.5 years George W. Bush has been squatting a president.  It also fits nicely with 2 posts ago,  urlLink O Canada, That Liberal Bastion . In that post I lamented the the lack of active voters in the United States and blamed them for our problems (someone has to be blamed).  Amazingly enough, I've stumbled across this quote from an American journalist, Bill Vaughn (1915-1977). Journalists usually have such intelligent things to say. They might not all be intelligent, but they've at least observed a lot and doesn't that count as wisdom?    "America is a land where a citizen will cross the ocean to fight for democracy - and won't cross the street to vote in a national election"    Coming to a computer near you will be a nice pro-media, anti-media, anti-citizen post. Sounds confusing? I agree.

       It's Hotter Than a MoFo Up in Here   Yes. Very hot. Nudity has never been such a requirement.  The apartment building did not uninstall my air conditioner this week, so when Sears calls me at 10 tomorrow morning, I'll have to turn the repairman away. Because I'm up 10 stories, I'm not allowed to, nor is the Sears man, put in or take out the a/c. That's fine and dandy, but it's getting to be a famous hot and humid Philly summer and I was determined not to sweat away my weight this summer. Yes, this is how my luck works.  So I've obviously been vacating my apartment, but options are dwindling as Jenn has company, Damon is leaving for a West Coast club tour, Jigsha lives in Knoxville,  Tenn., and Chris lives in Atlanta.  An odd thing happened in Rittenhouse Square the other day...Damon and I were talking, minding our business when some guy walks over with business cards asking if either of us was interested in modeling. It was difficult to not laugh in his face. But, admirably, I didn't.  I also have re-placed an order with Verizon for phone service. You may remember that I swallowed my pride and ordered service from them in May, but it's now mid-July and I'm still without any service. The phone service side of the company has no record of it, while the DSL side kept saying my order with them was on hold until the phone side got service installed. It was a vicious cycle. But maybe on Aug. 4 the vicious cycle will end?  I'm obviously not going to hold my breath. That would kill me and I'm rather enjoying life currently. Plus, I've got this heat to cook my head and fuck me up without the aid of asphyxiation.

       O   Canada, That Liberal Bastion   So the liberals are fleeing this "increasingly conservative" United States of America.  So says an Associated Press story. It ran in  The Times , but didn’t get posted to the site, so as usual, here’s the story on  urlLink CNN .  Funny, the conservatives think this country is getting a bit too liberal.  But the liberal types are fleeing and I’m not in tow. Going to the land of milk and honey, while nice, would leave me with far less to gripe about. Without that, I’d have no reason to live. I prefer to point out the stupidities and circular logic all while remaining faceless and almost placeless and being the passive activist.  I’ve actually never been drawn to Canada. I’ve always had my eyes set on south of the border - Mexico or somewhere in the Caribbean. I’m cold-blooded, so I need to the sun. I’ve also go this penchant for spicier foods, not French cuisine or buffalo.  Yes, the more liberal gun control laws and the decriminalization of marijuana means safer streets and more laid back mornings, afternoons, evenings and nights, but why just give up here.  Sorry for the delayed warning, but idyllic banter follows.  The story notes that people feel Canada better represents the ideals of the United States - set in parchment and blood so long ago - but that’s all the more reason to stay and vote.  According to the  urlLink Federal Election Commission  about 51% of voting-age U.S. citizens actually did the deed in the 2000 elections. Pretty depressing number, don’t you think?  That number improves to a whopping 67% of registered voters actually doing the deed in the 2000 elections.  Is it not possible for more people to take part? Hell, 1/3 of the registered U.S. citizenry didn’t vote. Couldn’t that have made a difference?  It’s not really asking much, just for people to smarten up. I think it’s happening now; better late than never. Approval for George W. Bush continues to fall, as some people realize they were just caught up in the borderline  urlLink fascist  frenzy following Sept. 11, 2001. Others are just tired of the war they once supported. Maybe they aren’t doves, but maybe they are espousing the dovish cry: “Support Our Troop, Bring Them Home.”  See, things just take time.  I’m sure the United States could include some liberalism and corrections to itself, but that would require the Green, Reform and what ever other parties there are, to get some people into office. In most every other democratic society, many parties make up the government, but not here. We’re stuck with 2 choices, and, as has been the case, the lines blur between them a little too often.  Rather than flee the country in pursuit of good weed and gay marriage, stay here, curse the president and get active. Oh, and smoke a bowl in your backyard. Decriminalizing weed can take away some of the fun to it.

       Balls: 2, Strikes: 2, Outs: 2; for SEPTA   It’s a bit fatalistic, but all public transit, not just SEPTA, needs help.  I’ve been meaning to get this post up for God knows how long. Anyone who has been reading this blog devoutly knows that I’m not afraid to correct myself or attack myself worse than most critics could. It’s part of my self-depreciating manner.  The following correction wouldn’t need to happen if Philly just got its act together. But I have a better chance of being reincarnated as someone important.  I’ve spent 2 lengthy posts dealing with Philadelphia and its bad habit. No, weed isn’t so bad. I mean the proliferation of parking lots.  The  urlLink first  dealt with the parking lot at the failed DisneyQuest next to the Gallery.  The  urlLink second  dealt with other lots on prime real estate property.  I’m not opposed to parking lots when you sink them several levels underground and put a building on top. I’m completely against them otherwise.  There are 3 main reasons for this:    They are a waste of space for more than half the day and a waste of revenue for their entire life   Heat islands in the summer and in suburbia they prevent water from reaching the soil   The ability to attract drivers hurts public transit     While SEPTA’s budget disaster is currently on hold, its proposed fixes allow it to almost operate unscathed for most of this fiscal year. But to what end?  Another standoff next year?  Pennsylvania’s funding to SEPTA hasn’t matched inflation each year, so funding has actually taken a cut throughout the high-flying ‘90s when the state was recording surpluses. The state is considering fixes, including using highway funds for public transit.   Good idea, the last thing this state needs is more roads.  Philadelphia needs SEPTA (any city needs public transit), but SEPTA needs riders. So why does the Parking Authority compete with SEPTA by adding lots to every empty piece of land in the city?  The lots that I complained about in previous posts now enjoy being filled with cars for 8 hours a day. (That’s my correction)  All the while Philadelphia’s life blood is languishing. The car culture has been killing cities much slower and much longer than the government’s push for suburbia after WWII.   Two examples: the horrible cities of Atlanta and Los Angeles. The sprawl there is ungodly. Philadelphia stands as one of the few remaining large walkable cities in this country and unless the city and state get with the program, it’ll be destroyed.  Each year public transit is forced into a showdown it loses riders. Every time there is a fare hike, ridership dips. Every time frequency takes a hit, ridership takes a dip. Fewer riders means people are using other means to get to work. A vast majority will turn to the trusty automobile, but the trusty automobile worsens the lives of city dwellers with it fumes. The more cars, the more parking lots and the more parking the lots the more sprawl, which required more cars to get around.  Do you see the vicious cycle?  I support public transit all I can with my bus/subway/trolley/el/regional rail pass each month, but I can’t do it alone.  So if you’re a city dweller and your reading this put down your car keys and pick up a token and do something good for your city. Obviously having a car is a necessity for some, even in the city, but while you in it, you don’t need it, so don’t waste it.  ***  Hmm, some cheese there at the ending. That’s what I get for putting this down for a day to go out and hang with friends.  I lost the vibe, but hopefully you didn’t suffer too badly.

       I'm an Idiot, I Know   So I've been inviting people in my last post to jump to another page of this exciting blog to read more rants. But, unbeknownst to me, the link was broken. Why? Because even though this site has been revamped, it doesn't understand all "quote" marks in all word processing programs. So now it's been fixed.  I have a new post coming up soon. Tonight is shaping up to be the first Friday night in after several weeks of jaunting up and down the East Coast and all over Philadelphia. Maybe before midnight it'll be up.  So after alienating readers by not posting for a long period, then alienating readers because of sheer stupidity for not checking links, I'm begging people to return.  Read on, dude!

       Have Amtrak Rewards, Will Travel   Last weekend I went to Washington, D.C. to visit my friend Chris who was up from Atlanta on a preliminary interview about jobs. It was my third time through D.C. in 3 weeks. Very well traveled. Very short on money.  But I had a great time. Friday night I got trashed. I mean college party trashed. Thanks in part to a generous bartender who got nothing in return.  But while I was away, the uproar over the conservative White House’s VERY LIBERAL reading of “facts” continued to catch attention.  And I was thinking to myself. Either I am a government insider, a cold, heartless objective person or an idiot.  Why? Because I vented about this months ago. If George W. Bush would have just listened to my reasoning, we could have skipped the already and ever more expensive war in Iraq, plus he wouldn’t have these credibility issues. And might I add the very mature White House has turned to finger pointing and blame games to cover it’s stance.  I spent the entire month of  urlLink March  espousing my stance and I urge you to read it, if only to boost my Page View numbers.  I would have shared this with everyone sooner, but I vacated my apartment last night after this city gave a permit to some group to preach God and fight violence. It wouldn’t have been so bad, but the gathering must have been barely funded because the main voice was not good at speaking and he has a thing for soul screaming. I’m sorry, but that should be reserved for James Brown and James Brown only.  It’s insanely hot in my apartment because as my luck would go, my air conditioner broke. This partly fueled my trip to Washington D.C., me vacating the apartment last night and re-vacating the apartment tonight.  I’m acting like it’s Hurricane Claudette up in here.

       Today’s Top Story...   Yes, there was that shooting at the Lockheed Martin site, but that’s not the big news. Murder is all too common.  Yes, George W. Bush’s State of the Union address was flawed, but what intelligent U.S. citizen didn’t already know that?  Today’s big news was that Britney Spears isn’t a virgin. CNN.com had that as the lead entertainment story.  Apparently during this slow summer, no one was able to come up with a story on CD piracy, whether Madonna still has ‘it,’ or if Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore have yet broken up.  They found time to report on something terribly obvious. Probably more so than the White House gaffe about Iraq. At least that had forged documents.  Incidently I was talking with my friend Damon just the other day about infotainment and the no-balls media. What should appear the following day but the most pointless story in America?  Also, you may be wondering how is it that this is a slow summer? All summers are slow in the news media. People are out traveling, ad dollars don’t flow as well ... The war in Iraq would have played out differently in the news had it taken place over the summer. The Britney story probably wouldn’t have happened. (Hmm, was I earlier saying I didn’t support the war in Iraq. Maybe I’m changing my mind...)  But what about all the kidnappings last summer? The number of children abducted last summer was  urlLink fewer than in 2001 , which was fewer than in 2000, which was fewer than in ... You get my drift.  God knows the pages and airwaves have to be filled with news, so during the summer it’s much easier for something to catch on and become blown out of proportion.  The year prior, 2001, had been the “Year of the Shark,” but guess what, there were  urlLink fewer shark attacks that year than last...   Now before you decide to lower your respect for the media, don’t forget that heightened awareness most likely saved at least 2 children from being abducted last summer. The shark attack hype probably saved one person from death.  There is always a little bit of good to go with the bad.  So now I’m off to bed. I think I’ll sleep better knowing Britney’s not-so-secret secret.

       For the Love of Jesus Christ and His 12 Disciples   Yes, quite an interjection. Lots of emotion behind that one. That was my exasperated reply to the end of the 9th inning of the Phillies v. Marlins game on July 4th. You guessed it, the Phillies lost another game I paid to see.  Also, that game was still vacation time, yet I'm 100% certain I saw the one metro editor at the game. Later I saw and idiot reporter. He always writes these long stories that are 90% background material from other reporters' previously published stories. Don't get me started.  But, even after that and the $11.50 for coke, chicken fingers and fries, I enjoyed myself. So did my sister and her boyfriend. It was strange that way. Usually it’s just Veronica and I, but suddenly there’s this third. Thankfully, he wasn’t a third wheel. It was a day of fun in Philly. Mostly because he’s never been here, so I got to play tour guide again, for the non-tourist sights of Philly.  I also had a first for July 4th. I’ve never seen the fireworks on the Parkway. We were quite a bit away from them, but easy to see. Only problem was the delay between the bangs and the actual explosion of light.  But anyway.  I’m making my way back to work. I picked up a few hours at the Bookstore and spent most of the day doing nothing. It was slow because of the heat and humidity, then the afternoon shower. So I spent part of the day working on the Web site, checking e-mail and chatting on IM. I have this strange addiction to it that comes and goes.  Today I’m back at the newspaper. I’ve been away for 1.5 weeks. Somewhat glad, somewhat not. My first day of vacation was former Sen. Strom Thurmond’s death, which most likely threw off my newspaper's deadlines. He passed about half an hour before the 1st edition was to be finished and heading to the presses. I was stuck in D.C. and had no idea.  In fact, for most of my trip I was in the dark about what was happening in the world. Probably good and bad.  This post is really all over and I apologize, but I had my share of distractions today, so this is my way of sharing them with you.

       Back in Philly, Posting Regularly   Yes, I’m back in Philly. Atlanta was just a short stay because of Fourth of July plans with my sister and her boyfriend. Nothing patriotic, just a Phillies game. I’ve not yet been to a Phillies game where they win, so maybe something new?  Or maybe not.  I apologize wholeheartedly for the previous post. Not because it was shit, that’s to be expected, but because it was posted from a Starbucks in Atlanta. Most likely no one knows, but I’m anti-Starbucks. My friend Jenn - she never wanted her name posted here, but alas - worked for the Coffee Beanery, a much finer establishment prior to the dirty tricks the company did to the Philly store. Needless to say, I won’t be drinking coffee anymore. (I had tea and banana bread at Starbucks.)  The extent of my approval for Starbucks was its admission to being an evil empire in  Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me” .  But enough about what I hate. I’m feeling realistic, rather than pessimistic today.  As I’m actually writing this, I’m still on the train to Phillly out of Atlanta. So far only a minor delay and a place to sit for everyone.  I’m Mac-ed out with my iPod playing and my PowerBook, but prior to this I was reading an excellent book by Dan Savage. It’s not a sex column book, but one on the seven deadly sins. The book focuses on the pleasures of the seven deadly sins - yeah hedonism! - and is sprinkled with right-wing bashing - yeah liberalism! It’s called  Skipping Towards Gomorrah   I finished my second Kurt Vonnegut book on this trip, so I’m moving on for a little while. This is my summer of reading and I still have a book or two at home that needs read before I can go on another buying binge.  I’m also ever-so-slowly working on revamping this Web site. I’ve wanted to do this since February when I was first to be a single-job person - the horror. My desire has been renewed following the worst constructive criticism ever, from my friend Jenn. (Yes, that’s 2 references). Jenn thinks blogging is pointless. Who cares, she asks. Who reads these anyway, she asks.  I read them and at least 700 people have read mine. Yes, the number of visitors is larger, but I figure I visit the site on occasion and I have at least one repeat reader. Go Jigsha. Also, much love to Jigsha who had her wisdom teeth pulled yesterday and is actually planning on working today.  But, back to Jenn. Yes, my site is horrible and not exciting, but I like to think I have said at least 2 valid things. OK, 1.5. I’ll try to keep my exaggeration less than Dan Savage’s.  OK, so that’s this post and I might still be in Georgia. Two hours after departing?? Not sure, but who cares, I can’t see much outside the windows and I have some HTML to learn.

       So Where the F**K Have I Been?   Everywhere but on the Internet, that’s where. I recently read an article dealing with blogging and it claimed posting regularly was a great way to build a ‘fan’ base. So what do I do? I disappear 2.5 weeks, thereby alienating my ‘fans.’  Alienating people is something I’ve gotten good at over the years, but I’d like to stop. I’ve not talked to anyone in from my high school since my freshman year at Textile. I’ve also mostly left behind my friends from Textile, except one, whom I run into on IM every few months or so. She lives just outside Philly. She’s an architect in the city. What is wrong with this picture?  Some of you less scrupulous types might think my PowerBook died. Err, wrong.  Honestly, I’ve been going out and enjoying Philadelphia. Without revealing much more, my libido has also been sky high. TMI yes, but it could a lot more TMI.  I went to a friend’s CD release party, had a few beers, went to Checkers in North Philly with 2 friends, then back to the girl’s place to eat and watch Bollywood movies. My friend, Neal, plays for the Snow Fairies and with bias aside, I think they deserve to be checked out. Their live shows are very energetic and full of random trivia and interjections. Their CDs are more muted in that regard, but it ain’t bad, because the lead singer voice gets a chance to shine and enchant.  Skip forward to June 26. I’m still 23 and getting on the train to D.C. to pick up another train to Charleston. The beginning of this journey is OK. but, I’m still in D.C. when I turn 24 and the train is delayed an hour. Understandable. The trains were running slower because the tracks expand in the heat and who wants to be on a train derailing at 90 miles an hour?  Once it’s time to board, it comes to Amtrak’s attention that the 30 of us don’t have seats because the train is overbooked. Allow me to add that the train was reserved. They found a few seats for us and I got a few zzzs. By 10 a.m., 2 hours late, I arrive in Charleston. By noon I’m with April on Folly Beach and by 1 p.m. I’m burnt in the most uneven of ways.  Skip over the days of fun, sun and Southern eating and it’s June 30. I’m on my way to Greyhound to pick up the bus to Atlanta. It’s 12:30 p.m. The bus is supposed to leave at 1 p.m. It actually leaves at 1:30 and a little after 7 the bus blows a tire. I was to be in Atlanta by 9:30. I was to be checked in at my hostel before midnight, but I didn’t arrive in Atlanta until almost 1 a.m. and at my hostel by 1:30 where they were kind enough to give me the door code and leave my room assignment.  So now I’m typing this July 1 and waiting for my friend to come and pick me up. Do not ask why I’m not staying with my friend. Long story. I’ve officially checked in for a the night prior and tonight. It’s raining so there won’t be any Six Flags fun, but there’s still stuff to see in Atlanta, like the Coca Cola plant, an AIA bookstore and any other number of things that we happen across and catches my fancy.  Once I return to Philly and return to the newspaper job and settle my libido and social life, I’ll work on regular posts for the ‘fans.’ I know, I’m deluding myself. How do you think I’ve made it through 24 years??

        Times  to Say ‘Goodbye’ to Trenton   Before I make my big sign off to  The Trenton Times  let me pose 3 questions: 1. Does Madonna have no taste? How can she kiss those skanks, Britney & Christina? 2. Why do news stories and headlines still refer to Bobby Brown as a singer? 3. Is the fling between Janet Jackson and Jermaine Dupri going to result in an album? I can’t take much torture. Her work with P. Diddy, Puff Daddy or whatever was too much.  ***   A Few Things I Won’t Miss at  The Times      The air conditioning system which forced employees to wear pants and jackets and use heating units from May to August.    Any story written by Michael Jennings. His metaphors actually detract from his stories. For instance, the budget crisis coverage was compared to a tumor. Why not use that metaphor with a medical malpractice legislation story? Metaphors aren’t the best writing technique to start with, but if you’re going to use it, make it match the topic!    Having to constantly edit out “in which,” “of which,” “during which,” “with which,” etc. Don’t waste time saying: The Civil War was the war during which brothers fought brothers, when: The Civil War was the war when brothers fought brothers is much more succinct and not awkward.  Or: This is the hand with which I am going to edit the hell out of your bad story, when: This is the hand that will edit the hell out of your bad story packs more punch.     *** So the final night went really well. The copy desk bought pizzas to celebrate my last day. For the past 1 year and 3 months, ordering delivery for the copy desk meant pizza for me. My favoritest of them all: Buffalo wings pizza, which was the main attraction tonight. They even had the cafeteria lady in on this. She was ordered to serve me nothing should I attempt to order anything.  Fortunately for them I was broke today and I ate a very late lunch with Damon, so I wasn’t hungry around the time I normally hit up the cafeteria.  Of course the managing editor had no clue what was going on and said nothing to me today.  In the end, it was weird saying all of the goodbyes, no tears, just awkward. And, yes, as I walked down the street to the train station I looked back on the building where I've worked for so long.  The AIA Bookstore and Chapter have already vied for additional days from me, and I need to get on the ball with my GRE, otherwise the move to Portland, Ore. is going to be much harder.

       Dork: Get the Sensation   My DSL is up today. A day early. Or you could say 2 months late if we go by the date I originally place my order for with Verizon. Ditto with my Airport and both Macs, so I've got my own little network in here. I'm transferring things from one to the other. I can play songs from the PowerMac on the PowerBook without copying them. I can burn things from my laptop using the burner on the tower. I'm stealing music, I'm doing work for the AIA and I'm chatting.  Isn't the title today so fitting? It's a Monday, cut me some slack!  Oh how I miss the Internet. But before I drop back into the addiction, I'm cutting myself off this evening. The Web site is coming along great. It'll be up shortly. Have no fear.  But before that, I'll probably post my complaints from  The Times . It seems fitting to get that in goes up under the old system, then I can end the job and the old way all at once. This is my psychological assessment of it all. Like I know for real?  Guten Nacht!

       Excuses   The weather is spectacular here in Philadelphia. So nice that I've been out and about, drinking with people from the newspaper, hanging with friends in the city and walking all over. Today it was from the Gray's Ferry section of Philly to my Superfresh on South Street. For anyone who doesn't know, we're talking 3 miles, at least. Of course after all of that walking, I stuffed my face with with tacos, beans and rice and Krispy Kreme donuts. Yes, I cooked a meal and ate it at my dining room table. Wow, to have free time. Crazy. Later it was Checker's. Who'd have thought?  Things are progressing here with the grand opening of my new Web site. Quite the opposite with the job hunt. Supposedly DSL will be up and running tomorrow. Right now I'm stealing from someone in the building, as usual. Hell, I don't know why I even paid for DSL.  But I have to keep this all short, because I have no idea when the mystery person will shut if off.  So, lots more posts later. Ignore any glaring errors.

       Recall the Recall   OK, so how old is this issue? I’m slow getting around. My excuses are in the previous post.  While more than one reason exists for the backlash against Governor Gray Davis, the one issue fueling the debate and recall is the budget crisis.  For some reason, the most populous state seems to have a much higher percentage of people without a clue. Nearly every state in the union is facing some sort of shortfall. New Jersey was facing a shortfall of about $5 billion earlier this year before estimates changed to slightly less and then painful cuts and accounting tricks closed it. My state, Pennsylvania, was facing a deficit of about half that.  But California was facing a $38 billion ($8 billion still after the budget passed) deficit you say? California is also the most populous state and the largest economy within the union, so of course it’s problems are going to be larger to match.  The budget woes in that state can be blamed on a lot of factors, the least being the person in office. He may share blame, but he shares it with the Legislature as well, and that is made up of his supporters and critics. No one’s hands are clean.  And honestly, blame can go the whole way up the Bush Administration in Washington, D.C., and even prior to him, with the Clinton Administration.  The general trend in the federal government over the past decade has been to push services, agencies, etc. onto the states.  Welfare is probably the biggest. Education has been straining the states following Bush’s initiatives. Then came all the needs, monetary and more, for protecting against terrorism. Medicare may soon be unloaded onto the states and if Bush has his way, so will Amtrak.  No one wants to raise taxes, but the federal government pushes these services to the states so it can cut spending, which means the difference has to come from someone’s pockets.  More importantly, Bush’s tax cut proposal did not call for budget crisis aid. That came from the Democrats, and the funding has been helpful, on some level.  Back to the recall:  What about the candidates? It’s a discombobulated mess that makes the 2000 national election look like horseplay.  How are we supposed to take this seriously, this theatric mess in the most powerful - politically and economically - state in the union?  What does it say about the state of government in the United States of America? Yes, elections should be open to all, but how about all who actually have a purpose and a real agenda?  How many actual politicos are running? It should be noted that the legislator who funded the recall and announced his candidacy has since dropped out. More importantly, a midterm election costs money, something the state doesn’t have right now.  In general, governors from across the country are supportive of Davis, if only because the thought of a recall election shakes them to their bones.  At first the thought of the Terminator running for governor didn’t sound like such a bad idea. Sonny Bono was successful, as was Jesse Ventura. But after seeing one of his political ads, I’ve decided the idea of it is laughable, and I mean that sporadic awkward laugh not at the bombed joke, but the suffering comedian.  Gray Davis is in his second term and that so many citizens have apparently turned against him so suddenly says to me that it’s a “heat of the moment” response and emotions rarely play out successfully for the long term without a fair helping of rationality. If rationality had played any part in the proceedings so far, there wouldn’t be porn stars, 100-year-old ladies and Hollywood types filling the ballot. There would be politicians with an agenda and a history to them. The ratio is very out of whack.  California is out of whack.  I can only hope that by October sensibility will return and the recall will fail.

       Plenty to Say, but No Time   This no Internet at home thing has me all screwed up. I'm reading more and going out and about more, too. That's screwed up because I'm very certain that I'm a social reject.  I will have DSL by the end of the month, about the same time my internship concludes at  The Times of Trenton . One week from this date, to be exact.   My being away had nothing to do with e-mail viruses or worms, and do you know why? I'm a Mac freak and they can't touch me. If the past week isn't a good example as to why one OS platform is a bad thing, then 95% of the computer world is a lost cause. Why the government has allowed Microsoft to continue to expand, mostly unchecked is beyond me.  Of course 30% of you visiting this site don't fall into the "hopelessly lost" category." As my site stats show, Macs make up a significant portion of readers/skimmers stopping by here. Somehow I've tapped into a more intelligent base of Web users...  The job hunt isn't going so well, but then I'm only trying half-assed, thanks to the job security provided by the AIA. I better not be here for life! I do have to get some information on the GRE tests, then take them and apply to Portland State University. So I still have goals, they just aren't as pressing.  I'll probably post something tomorrow. Maybe a farewell to  The Times . I've had something cooking up slowlyl over time, but I've not done anything with it. There's also that pesky recall, which as Conan O'Brien describes it is "crazy {with his head shaking in a seizure impression}."  Yes, lots to say, but all to come later.

       Of Sears and Lounges   Allow me to ramble while I am tapping into someone else's wireless connection in my building...  I returned the broken air conditioner to Sears. It only required me to explain the situation to 4 people before everything went through as planned. And I still have to return; I forgot to box the remote control, so they kept $35 of my refund. When I came home, went out with Damon and came back to my place to watch movies, I quickly learned that my 4-year-old TV/VCR from Sears is on the blink. Who'd thought?  Earlier it tried eating  Stars Wars: A New Hope , the original, not fucked up, glitzy one. It also tried taking  Traffic  away from me, but I managed to pry it out with screwdrivers. I felt rather masculine and all. Hmm, yes, this is rambling. Do check out  Traffic  when you get a chance. Great performances and a peek into upperclass drug use.  I went to a lounge last night with Damon. He was meeting with people to discuss a running "party." The venue is called Goosebumps and it's nothing like the children's book series that my sister read as a very young teenager. I'm hardly the club or lounge type, but it was very chill. Vaguely reminiscent of one the  Temple News  stumbled on in the Village in NYC when we were up a year ago in April.  It's rainy and blah here today. Perfect time for working on my Web site and finishing up my summer of reading. I've read 4 or 5 books so far and a recent trip to Borders brought home 5 more.  I have to contact Verizon on Monday about getting DSL, then I'll be back up and running. Until then, enjoy the sporadic posts and peek into my life...  If you dare.

       Of Thunder and Parking Fees   I return from Central Pennsylvania almost reeking of chocolate and a little bit like dog. My sister and her betrothed have a 6-month-old pit bull. She's a bit hyperactive and very much gnawing on shoes, hands, stuffed animals, books, glasses, etc. Now I want a dog even more. Nothing like a pit bull; I'm thinking Weimaraner.  But I digress, as usual.  As can be expected, my sister and I became 6-year-olds within the vicinity of 1 mile of each other. The shenanigans continued until Thursday morning as I boarded the 7:07 train to Philadelphia. I'm not usually up until an hour after that. Unfortunately, that was my double shift day and the blackout was big news. It was also a big mess because SEPTA was delayed so all NJ Transit trains could connect.  Veronica and I rode most of the good rides at Hershey Park until thunder and lightning forced the rides to shut down. We opted for Chocolate World and food rather than hanging around. We didn't pay, so we weren't getting ripped off. We did get ripped off in the parking lot.  As a Dutch Wonderland employee, Veronica is supposed to get free parking at Hershey Park. We parked in Chocolate World, which is all the same entity, yet not. What did the bill come to after just 6 hours in the parking lot? $15!  You can find parking for less than that in Philadelphia! The parking in Philly is usually in a garage so your car is protected from the elements and most times you don't even park you car, someone else does, which in the end helps prevent theft. None of this was case at Hershey Park. The parking lot is just a vast wasteland of heat in the summer sun. No protection to your car and the walking to get to the entrance!  $15. is almost half the price of admission to the actual park.  Obviously, Veronica and I were pissed. But the parking attendant was an idiot. He could have just let us go through and told us not to do it again. But no, he let the cars pile up behind while he demanded $15. While we produced $14 between the two of us, he asked about any change we might have.  I could understand if Veronica was a lowly ride attendant, but she’s “human resource coordinator,” whatever that means. Show some respect people.  *** I have no idea how to end that rant. It could just go on and on. We still had a good time, it’s practically tradition for us. We’ve been going at least once a year for as long as I can remember.  *** One final thought. Why the hell did Bush make any comment on the blackout? How was it a “national crisis.” Why did he have to swagger in and try to control the situation?  That man honestly annoys me every time he breaths.  But alas....  I’m back and in the habit.

       {Sound of Crickets in the Background}   I'm only partially dead. Haven't made it around to any wireless spots of late so I can't post. Right now I'm at the AIA eating Indian - kadhi, mmm - and just dropping a quick thing for all the worry warts.  The job hunt has officially begun. I e-mailed my resume and cover letter today to a newspaper along the R7 line, the same that takes me to the current job. Change is slow with me, I guess.  I'm going to Hershey Park on Wednesday with my sister, who, by the way, is now engaged. She's 21. I'm 24 and just starting to see someone. What's wrong with this picture? Nothing for me, but I'm sure the family is waiting to here my reasoning.  Lunch break is ending...

       The Media: It’s Own Worst Enemy   The  urlLink Associated Press reported  yesterday that even as Congress is pushing to undo the Federal Communications Commission’s loosening of media regulations, the National Association of Broadcasters is suing because it doesn’t feel the FCC went far enough. NAB doesn’t represent your local ABC, NBC or CBS affiliate, it represents the larger entities.  To complicate matters, the smaller local affiliates are fighting their parents and siding with Congress.  The larger media want the regulations slackened so they can grow and compete. What this amounts to is more money. The larger television networks have mostly matured and, naturally, there is a desire to expand. Unfortunately, 3 or 4 major networks cannot all expand.  I can imagine that NBC would love to have 45% of the market across the United States, but does it do anyone any good if all NBC is broadcasting is crap?  I know I’d love to be able to watch essentially the same reality TV show on even more stations. “Last Comic Standing” is already broadcast on two stations (NBC & Comedy Central) as is “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” (NBC and NBC-owned Bravo). I’ve only seen each of these shows once and not in my own home, but I know of the dual showings through stories at work.  Now isn’t the growing number of stations supposed to mean more variety? If the networks already are failing with caps in place, what can we expect when they have more stations? Most likely it’ll be a lot of the same stunt, it just won’t be so obvious.  Maybe the focus should be on quality of programming, not quantity of ownership.  I wish I could comment further on that, but I really don’t know what’s on anymore. When “Seinfeld” ended (horribly) my TV viewing took a hit. When “X-Files” called it quits (thankfully), my TV viewing took a hit. Now I can’t even remember what day to watch “That 70s Show” or “Law & Order.” And most of the time I’m working.  Obviously other shows must fit the ‘quality programming’ bill, but I’m pretty certain there’s more crap. That’s at least what I can tell from the reviews and the death toll articles that abound one month into the new programming season.  So rather than empower corporate America, how about power to the people?  Congress is certainly  urlLink trying to push back  some of the FCC’s loosened regulation, but not all of it. A bid to do” that failed in the House, but a bill reconciled with the Senate version still has to pass and Congressmen can be swayed if they hear enough backlash. It’s the only thing more influential than money.  *** 	I’ve somehow tapped into a wireless network in my building, but it’s dial-up, so it’s slow and whoever the person is with it doesn’t leave it on all the time, so this is coming to you from the AIA. 	This downtime is probably good. I fear Internet addiction on occasion, but my withdrawal hasn’t been difficult at all. Plus, I’ve been reading, writing, cleaning up, job hunting and pushing for a move to Portland, so it’s been a productive week so far.

       At Long Last   I called Verizon today and supposedly they have my phones connected through them. I was expecting the worse. How fitting that Verizon workers could possibly strike one day before my service was to be connected? But something came through for me.  Unfortunately, I'm without DSL for the next 2 weeks so I will be spotted in Borders and, through gritting teeth, Starbucks. I just can't go back to regular dial-up. How can I possible steal the music that the Apple Music Store doesn't have? It was difficult enough dropping from T1 at Temple to DSL. I have to have standards.  Also, good news for people who care. The Web site production is coming along just swell and it might be up sooner than I had though. Or maybe I'll just wait for DSL and test it out because there'll be quite a bit to upload.  I'm on lunch break at the AIA. It's raining like hell out and I don't feel like venturing out for a Wawa hoagie and Arizona green tea.

       The Fat Lady Sings   I now have 100% confirmation that my internship concludes August 30, 2003. It will have been a year and two months of learning, torture, stress and fun as an intern. It started off as one month of training/testing which was without the torture and stress.  I'm blaming George W. Bush and his handling of the economy.  I was always a little ready to leave  The Times of Trenton  and yet not. I had a nagging fear that if I fell out of the business now I'd never get back in. That's how it's looking. My job hunt begins next week. I've been saying that for God only knows how long, but I've updated the resume. I'm working on cover letters ... It's coming together.  I'm going to try to get into some writing, though my managing editor was adamant I stick with editing. More marketable he says. I hoping that means he the and copy desk saw vast improvement and potential for me.  So I'm looking into editing, but I won't pass up the opportunity to freelance or string or whatnot. Sorry for all the jargon.  Rather than suddenly feeling stressed, I'm reveling in the need for change. I have a chance to relocate my work and skip out on the 45 minute train ride. But no naps. Damn. The AIA is more than willing to load me up with some work. As the holidays near, the Bookstore will require me and as the Design awards near, the Chapter will need me.  I also received an application in the mail from Portland State University. I'm very seriously considering graduate school for urban studies or urban/regional planning. It'd also take me to my 2nd favoritest city. Not to mention a Newhouse paper,  The Oregonian . If you've not been paying attention to this blog since April,  The Times  is owned by the same larger company, so hopefully a foot in the door.  But that is at least as far away as May, so obviously, things could change. This is my goal as of now.  I have no idea what this means will happen with this blog. Suddenly my vast news resources have been cut to what makes it in print or online. That's a lot missing. I'll have to boost my active news digestion (read: dork).  But it also means that revamp I've been talking about for God only knows how long. It's started. It needs some tweaking (read: help). But it'll be up and suddenly there will be a lot more to me than blue and orange.

       Conspiracy Theory Collision   So the last post was debunking one, now I’m supporting one.  On Sept. 2, it was reported that a major asteroid was on a collision course with Earth. It would hit on March 21, 2014 and lead to chaos and death, according U.S. stories. The BBC was a bit tamer.  The next day, it was reported that “sorry, we were wrong and overzealous” because the odds were a long shot and getting less likely each day.  The story has become a yearly event since 1998, but to what purpose, when each time the actual doomsday scenario is immediately blown off? why not notice it, study it for a few days, recalculate and skip the trouble? They latest collision would have been 11 years away, giving them ample time to correct themselves before going public.  But the current method has a “crying wolf” effect. People react to the doomsday story, but then are reassured. A few more of these and fewer and fewer people will notice each time the story is reported, until finally the story is reported, but there isn’t a follow-up stating the collision won’t happen.  Does this sound a little crazy? Yes. Did the BBC ask this question several days after the last doomsday revelation?  urlLink Yes.  Do I think an asteroid is heading straight for Earth in the near future? No.  But if it were, if March 21, 2014 was going to be doomsday, how would the world react if people were told about it?  Would people stop paying their bills, stop worrying about getting ahead? I think so. I know I’d stop paying my bills. At least my student loans. I’d need to keep a line of credit open for my 11 years of  partying.  Maybe if the story would break, a contingency plan would be offered up, as a way to save the human race. By this time, there might be a much more substantial space station. There might be a moon base, but nothing that would support a large portion of the world’s population. Surely some would stay and accept their fate. Armageddon is built into all the major religions, but not everyone who wanted a chance to get off could or would.  The effects of a real threat of collision could certainly lead to serious complications for governments around the globe.  Of course, the U.S. could pull an  Armageddon  style trick out of its sleeve, if only they hadn’t starved NASA for as long as they did.  **  Well there’s a refreshing “over breakfast and before work” read.

       I’ve Contracted a Conspiracy Theory   This is not the post I’ve been promising for days, but this is a little more intriguing, so the other will wait.  It’s not often I delve into science and what’s possible or not, but recent debate among my friends and on the subway has fueled my interest in the matter.  After rather substantial research into the topic, I’ve found a disturbing amount of literature and people who support and believe HIV is a U.S. manufactured virus designed to kill off gays and minority racial groups.  As is the case with all conspiracy theories, both sides have just enough strengths and weaknesses to fuel the theory.  For instance,  urlLink David Gilbert , who writes a very strong case shooting down the theory, is considered a political prisoner and is serving a prison term of 75 years for the murder of several law enforcement officers. His writings also bring to light several facts that were left out of writings by those supporting the theory.  The pro-theory side has history on its side; the U.S. has tested and infected minority populations - it was U.S. policy to eradicate the Native Americans, and the Health Department did purposely infect scores of black men with syphilis, only to later call the test meritless. This is just the tip of the iceberg.  I’m not about to repeat all the facts and "facts," but here are a few links.   Debunking the Theory:  David Gilbert’s story is in a format difficult to read, but  urlLink Tracking the Real Genocide  offers some facts to debunk the conspiracy theory, plus the ramifications of believing it.   urlLink CNN  also devotes a story to both sides, which includes links to more information.   Feeding the Theory:  I could provide links from now until next year, but  urlLink totse.com  provides all the basics and presents them in a factual manner, unlike 90% of the sites you’ll stumble across using Google.  **  I first heard this theory while riding the Broad Street Line in the early morning on my way to work at the Bookstore. A young black man was hawking an underground monthly newspaper detailing the oppression of blacks in the United States. I was completely shocked when I heard the man reading the headline accusing the U.S. of creating HIV to wipe out the black population.  I asked my friend Jenn, who took life sciences classes in college, if she thought this was possible and true. She did. Damon and I recently debated the theory and he agrees with it.  Even without the fudged facts used to hold up the theory, the desire for wanting to wipe out a race and then accomplishing it so successfully is difficult to believe. It has been tried, but it has always failed.   To do this successfully in America would require a conspiracy of daunting proportions. It would have to hold up through each of the administrations in the White House. If some of the theorists’ thinking is to be followed, this conspiracy would also require the United Nations and the governments of scores of countries. It would require the acceptance of the scientific community, of the medical community.  More importantly, it has never been the policy of the United States to wipe out the black population. As colonists, Americans were bringing Africans to this country by the hundreds of thousands. Once the government outlawed the importation of slaves, slave masters turned to breeding to increase the black population.  Skip ahead a few hundred years and blacks and other minorities still represent a form a cheap labor. It’s rude to say, but the facts support it. Whites are the highest paid workers.   If it is the purpose of HIV to kill off minorities, who is suddenly going to fill the gap? Is Senator Rick Santorum’s son going to serve me the Chicken Fingers Meal at Checker’s? Someone has to do it.  So the U.S. spreads HIV to Africa to kill off that population. Now who is going to dig up the diamonds and emeralds for the rich white people to wear? Vice President Dick Cheney’s granddaughters? I don’t think so.  The United States is a capitalist society and for capitalism to succeed, there must be this tiered society. You can’t chop off the bottom and expect the upper levels to hold steady.  Yes, HIV is many times more prevalent in the gay and minority community, but there is a laundry list of reasons why. From health care to education opportunities, from money to belief in these conspiracy theories. From hedonism to apathy.  Never mind that creation of HIV means that in a decade (theorists point to its roots as circa 1967), the U.S. military started research into an immunodeficiency virus; a separate group of scientists coincidentally created gene splicing (1973); and the military then successfully created HIV using this cutting edge biotechnology, which then gained a foothold in the population in 1978.  It took the United States nearly a decade to get to the moon and that is far less complicated than unraveling, understanding and controlling the building blocks of life.  It should also be pointed out that the original theory of the U.S. creation of HIV started in East Germany in 1987. For anyone who doesn’t remember, that was still during the Cold War, when propaganda between the Communist Bloc and the West was designed to instill hatred and fear in the other.  While not all propaganda is incorrect, theories and ideas during this time must be viewed with a certain amount of skepticism.  What the United States can be blamed for is the institutionalized disenfranchisement, and at times racism, which has both fueled the conspiracy theory and the epidemic. But to claim HIV was created by the U.S. government to decimate and kill off minorities and other groups is to give the government too much credit.   NOTE: All facts and “facts” - dates, places, etc. - have been culled from the sites I link to.   NOTE, as well: HIV virus is redundant, so I didn't use it that way. Neither should you.

       Nuclear Carrots   My AT&T homepage ran a story today dealing with Iran's disputed nuclear weapons program. It's a Reuters story, so I'm not sure who wrote the hed, either Reuters or AT&T. Either way, it's idiotic. The headline:  EU Big Three Defy U.S. to Offer Iran Nuclear Carrot  Of course the "carrot" is metaphorical, very much like getting your mule to move along faster, but that's not what the headline says. It could be more incorrect, grammatically, than any hed I've written.  The headline makes it sound like biotech food crops gone wrong.  **  Yesterday I got this very strange spam. It makes me wonder about the stupidity of the human race. While a lot of things point out the obvious lack of intelligence among many people, this one takes the cake.  At times I wish the Federal Trade Commission would just let marketing lies slide, because, seriously, if you fall for some of the marketing that's been going on through e-mail, you should be ripped off.  The e-mail claimed that this company had the exclusive rights to sell this miracle potion that would kill every dangerous virus and bacteria in the human body.  At first I thought the e-mail was a virus, but the network at the AIA, a problem-riddled Wintel, didn't get infected, nor did my e-mail account alert me to a virus. So it must have been as legit as spam can be.  If such a product existed, you would have to live in a cage to not know about it. Suddenly a cure for HIV and every other epidemic disease in the world.  Of course, some nincompoops followed the link thinking it was true. Others might have followed it out of curiosity, which probably backfired and opened up window after window of porn or downloaded a virus onto their computer. Still others probably attempted the link to take them off the spam, which was most likely broken, or took them to the same porn/virus riddled site.  Sorry schmucks. **  This wasn't the post I had been referring to earlier, but that is still happening. Never did find the damn thing. I finished up a week in the basement at the Bookstore preparing for Christmas, and still so much to do. Hopefully I won't be doing it. The damn a/c there has me sick for the weekend - stuffy nose, headache and all that shit that comes with having subzero temperature air blasted in your face for several hours.  Christmas is still so far away, but I've about had it already. When is the Christmas party and free drinks?

       Such an Idiot   I've lost the post I had nearly finished. I'm in the process of recovering files so I can salvage it. Or I can just start over again.  Either way, we're talking about a delay.  Jigsha pointed out the incorrect link to her site, which I fixed, but I won't apologize for. I've already explained to her the problems with her site opening up all proud that it was test/designed with Windows and IE. So why would I really send anyone there? I don't know. But it's fixed now.  I've also republished the site so the color changes and whatnot include the archives.  Back to recovery.

       Version 2.0 is here   So I promised a different post, but screw that. I've managed to put redo this, shoddy, yes, but it goes much better with version 1.0 of my larger Web site, which is this just a small part of.  It's called  urlLink Rounding Out the Cynic Journalist . It's nothing fancy, but I'll refrain from explaining. The site proves my elementary HTML skills. It'll improve. And maybe so will my cynicism.  I'm told that maybe I'm not so much of a cynic anymore. It's true. The blog has delved into my personal life and what I'm experiencing in the real world and less of a reaction to such newsworthiness happenings as Jen & Ben's split. We can all thank the economy for that, otherwise that internship I had would have landed me a real job, rather than ending.  But I digress.  It's also been chock full of my thoughts on urban planning and development issues - my intended major for grad school in Fall 2004. Fingers crossed.  I'm also working on cleaning up the broken links. I've made it through the first month. It'll be awhile, so take my word for it whenever the link doesn't work.  Guten Nacht.  More sooner rather than later. This just got exciting all over again.

       Bad Habits   So I've been quiet for a whole week. Not that there hasn't been anything to say, I'm just adjusting to no longer being single. Suddenly I have stuff to do, where before I could find other reasons to not clean the apartment or write in my personal journal.  But it's all coming along. Adjustment and change is part of no longer being single.  I do have part of a post put together at my computer at home, yes this is coming from a Wintel at the Bookstore. So I'll finish that tonight. It didn't go up last night, because I'm still putting my Photoshop skills to use for DJ Damon Burns' new house party, appropriated called Clean after his record label, Clean Recordings. He's without a site just yet, so I can't jump you to it for the scoop.  But soon enough. Soon enough.  I'm on lunch break now from building the Christmas Shop. It's to open Oct. 1. Somehow we will fill our little basement - reached via stairs not to fire code - with tens of thousands of ornaments, cards, calendars and anything else Christmas. This is my 3rd Christmas here and the longest I've held a single job.  It's all grunt work now, which is why Leslie put me down there. Oh, and because I don't have to work with customers, I'm in jeans and a t-shirt; she knows how much I hate dressing up.  And for all of my trouble I get a free 2004 calendar at the end of the year. Bless their hearts. Yeah, there's that Christmas party, but last year I took to the liquor rather hard, enough said. I knew I was going to get trashed. I needed it. I'd just spent the last 6 months working 65 hours a week. So it wasn't exactly enjoyable. This year, yes, it will be.  That's all for now.  Let's see if I can keep my promise and drop this bad habit.

       The First Anniversary   It was one year ago when this blog started.   Wouldn’t it have been nice to throw the redesign up? Yes, for some, but I generally ignore important dates and holidays. So it’s still coming.  I’m not sure if anyone can tell, but I think my writing has improved immensely since that first post and the Sept. 11 anniversary lamentations that followed. I won’t be lamenting so much this year. I  am without a news job, and while the memory or effects of Sept. 11 haven’t worn off, the very open awareness and expression of that day does seem to have died down - only more so for me now that I’m not paid to read the stories.  I’ve covered many topics, some with more tenacity, others with less knowledge.  While not a lot has changed, much has happened over the past year.    We started and ended a war,  which we were never in a rush to start anyway - so the Bush Administration said. Bush’s ratings have tumbled because of it. He asked for another $87 billion, on top of the $79 billion he initially called for, all while cutting government revenue.    We finally have Osama bin Laden’s whereabouts narrowed down to 40 square miles, whatever that means.    Fighting ended between Israel and the Palestinians following a new peace plan, which subsequently faded into fighting and resignations.    The government’s tenacity with attacking white collar crime seems to have faded.     Skateboarding has become the “hot button” issue in Philadelphia politics, even as thousands leave the city each year for other destinations.    I’ve lost my job in my major at Temple University, and my friend Chris has yet to land one. Jigsha very successfully moved from an internship to a newspaper job, and Jenn had her store closed down, only to move onto something better.    My rent went up at the Philadelphia Regency, while the building’s condition continued to justify the amount even less.    A very close friend of mine passed away, at age 22.    My sister started a relationship and is now engaged. I’ve started my first relationship in 2 years.    And so it goes. The next year holds many changes. From graduate school to my big move to the West Coast. Veronica is applying to college and Damon is starting a new party for the Philadelphia area.  Oh, and the world will get to see if “The Matrix” trilogy is truly a mess or if the 3rd movie will save it.

       Making Ends Meet   So this one-job thing is catching up to me. It's crunch more than usual. I actually asked my mom for to help me with my outrageous college loan payments for next month. I wouldn't have, but I've signed up for the GRE test, which costs $115. If I get to grad school, I can defer payments on my loan and just pay interest, so grad school is providing me with several things.   In the mean time I've been working revamping the Cynic Journalist and putting my Photoshop skills to good use by making flyers for Damon's upcoming Sunday T Dance. Don't ask me exactly what it is. It's a late afternoon/early evening house party with food and other things at a nice lounge on South Street. Why "T"? That's the part I don't know exactly what it is. But it's something new to Philadelphia, so it should do modestly well.   I'm told the Philly music scene isn't exactly happening. There was a pick up recently, with Jill Scott, the Roots, Beanie Sigel, Musiq Soulchild, but their fame and drawing power doesn't seem much more than cult status, unfortunately. It's even worse with the DJ scene here. So I'm told as well. This is all hearsay.  I got a response the other day from a new visitor to my site. This is probably the first in God only knows how long. That's not including the editing and general debate with Jigsha, Jenn or Damon, who are obviously good friends, so their visiting my site is practically a prerequisite.  I've been going through the site as I'm working on the redo, and I've noticed some broken links at the  The Trenton Times , my old paper. Not much I can do, you'll just have to trust me. It's asking a lot in this great big thing called the Internet, but someday when you see my name on the front-page story at large regional papers across the country, you can think back about what I've said before and give me my props.

       Ketchup   I stumble out of bed this morning, pour a bowl of Cocoa Pebbles and beginning my morning routine of catching all the news, what's fit to print and not. What should I find, but a story of delayed tactics in the CD industry.  According to  urlLink  The Register  , Universal Music Group is slashing CD prices by 31% in a bid to boost sales. Is it too late for the industry to save itself?  Maybe, maybe not. If it does, it'll be a wake-up call to the rest of the industry, and I'll certainly purchase a few CDs I've been holding out for. More importantly, it actually offers competition to iTunes and its rip-offs.  One of my last nights at the newspaper involved some serious talk about the evolution of music media: from vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track, cassette, CD to mp3. There will be CD buyers for time to come because there's just something about holding the CD in your hand. Something about the cover art, lyrics and whatever else comes packaged.  The pricing had been getting quite insane. I worked at Tower Records when the industry moved CD prices from $17.99 to $18.99. The across the board change didn't make sense. The Beatles, while worth every dollar ever spent on them, shouldn't cost $20, 30 years after they broke up. It’s  all royalties at this point. There are no advertising costs anymore; no more studio time fees to recoup.  What baffled me more is how a Beatles CD, 40 minutes of music that changed the world, cost the same as the latest pop star wannabe who would be forgotten before a second song was released.  That whole fiasco, and the T1 line at Temple, led to a major Napster addiction. Better than 600 songs later, it all came crashing down. Napster died and I moved off campus and dealt with dial-up. Now it's iTunes and the addiction to that would be stronger if more artists and labels would just stop fighting the movement.  You lost. Rather than fade away by your own actions, stick around for awhile. I'll pay $9.99 for that mediocre to good CD and $.99 for that one really good song. You'll get your money in the end.

       Withdrawal   So tonight would have been a night to work at  The Times . Same goes with Sunday. I'd not have noticed much except it came up in an e-mail with Jigsha. I'm noticing it much more in the way of my wallet. It's time to roll some pennies and visit the bank, maybe.  I was making my big supper this evening, macaroni and cheese and fish sticks, when I noticed something odd on the ketchup pack. It said "tomato ketchup." Now I'm wondering what other kind of ketchup there is and what I've been putting on my fries at Burger King and Flamers.  Ain't this quite the itty bitty post? Damn this social life thing.

       GRE-at   I began waking up this morning at 6 a.m. Until I was fully functional, it was after 6:30. Why did I put myself through this? Because this morning I took the GRE.  I’ve spent the past 2 weeks (on again, off again) studying for the damn thing. As I complained about earlier, I was forced to use Wintel.  After much dismay over the math sessions and much delight over the verbal sessions, I took the 2 practice tests.  The GRE uses the same scale as the SAT. You can top out at 1600. When I took the SAT, I scored 1110.  On the first GRE practice test I scored 1120 (560, 560), without finishing the math section. Odd, I thought, I prefer writing, I dropped the math-focused major years ago. On the second practice test I scored 1200 (560, 640). That really freaked me out. I completed the math section and did much better on it   Both times I started the test after 10 p.m. I’m a night owl, how can I take the test with the early birds?  Christ, did I do my undergraduate major in the wrong subject? But because I did better I can assume I learned something, or probably I learned how to better take standardized tests. It $43,000 well spent, believe me!  So this morning I left with the initial score of 1170, and I honestly don’t remember the breakdown, besides that I did better on the quantitative part, again.  I guess I get my final grade soon enough, after the writing sections are graded by whomever will read them.  So the graduate school plan is now in motion. I have information coming from University of Illinois Chicago and now I can fill out my Portland State University application.  I’ve taken the rest of the day off. Not sure why, but I have.  Maybe I’ll take a nap. *** Oh, and another thing.  The environmental bill I was pushing for in the Senate,  urlLink it flopped  by a relatively close margin, seeing as how it had bipartisan support. Neither Senator from my state  supported it. But, both of the 2 states I'm considering a move to had Senators who voted for it.   Maybe it's a good thing I'm leaving Pennsylvania. I can head somewhere with like-minded people. I can only handle so much of what Santorum stands for.  You can check and see how your Senators voted. It's a pop-up window from the story I linked to above.

       Bush Is a Little Slow, His E-mail is Slower   Earlier this week, after watching a TV ad regarding the Climate Stewardship Act (information available at  urlLink Undo It , I signed a petition, which was forwarded, through cyberspace, to my elected members of Congress and the White House.  Below is the e-mail header for the version forwarded to the White House:   From:  bswope@att.net   Date:  Tue Oct 21, 2003  20:17:35 US/Eastern   To:  president@Whitehouse.GOV  Subject:  Please Support Climate Stewardship Act   Now here is the e-mail header of the response:   From:  Autoresponder@WhiteHouse.GOV   Date:  Tue Oct 21, 2003  21:25:26 US/Eastern   To:  bswope@att.net   Subject:  RE: Please Support Climate Stewardship Act   It took more than hour to auto-reply to my message.  It also went on to state that my ideas and comments are very important to Bush. I somehow doubt that, seeing as how I’m actually placing my bets with one of the long-shot Democrats.  It wouldn’t be so long a shot, but I wonder when these candidates and the even the Congressmen will stop sounding like broken records.  For instance, last Sunday on “Meet the Press,” Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) was pitted against Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Tim Russert asked several questions about the new free $87 billion for Iraq.   I’m usually a McCain supporter, but his Republican side really showed. All he could go on about is the United States’ place as a world superpower and how the $87 billion was justified.  World superpower? 2003? The Cold War ended more than a decade ago and the United Nations, started so long ago, should be the only body even attempting that title.  The idea of “world superpower” is why we have so many enemies. Its idea is why this country elected a brash, uncouth uneducated, jackass into office.  It’s time to cut the world superpower title.  But I digress...  Graham’s response to each question of money was only about how the U.S. needs to pull troops from Iraq and get the United Nations involved.   Hmm, maybe we should repeat the question Sen. Graham?  I could now go into the need for third parties in the U.S., but I’ll leave that for further along the election trail.  I only wish the White House had asked my party affiliation prior to the fake e-mail response. That way I could have gotten a response with the feelings Bush made so obvious following Sept. 11 and the Republican response:  As someone who doesn’t support his and his party’s measures, I’m un-American.

       My Personal and Political Dichotomy   Who do I vote for if I don’t think either mayoral candidate is what Philadelphia needs? It’s not something I ever expected to have to ask.  Ever since I’ve had the power to vote, I’ve taken to it with quite a bit of zeal. But Philadelphia is working to snuff it.  The race in Philadelphia is very much like what would have happened, had Al Gore opted to run for president again.  I’m very supportive of Al Gore; I think he was robbed, and I think he could have done a lot of good for the United States.  But a repeat match up would not have been a good thing. Other issues suddenly come into play, issues that wouldn’t do anything for the political climate in America.  And that is my problem with Philadelphia. How can a city this size run the same two opponents from 4 years ago?  It makes for an awfully blah election year.  And here’s the real dilemma, the lack of political activism exhibited by my city is killing my political activism. It’s a vicious cycle.  In the end I’m going to vote for John Street because Sam Katz obviously hasn’t been good for Philly before, why would he be now. He lost last time by 9,400, a margin several times larger than what Gore and Bush saw in Florida.  My only problem with Street is that he is too political. He tries to shutdown skate boarding in the city, but as soon as the idea becomes too politically hot he wants the X-Games to return and promises a skateboarding park elsewhere in the city.  He bowed to the federal government and accepted the closing of Chestnut Street at Independence Hall, even as city businesses attacked the idea, but once it became obvious how much the closing was a problem, he backed off and pushed for its opening.  I don’t mean to say only bad things. Philadelphia schools are making some headway after the state and city worked to revamp the district. Better education means better lives for Philadelphia children.  I have 2 less abandoned rowhouses I can see from my apartment window because of his Neighborhood Transformation Initiative. Fewer abandoned rowhouses means fewer places for drugs and whatever else goes on behind those decaying walls.  His abandoned car initiative helped clean up the streets of Philadelphia’s neighborhoods, making more room for cars with owners and less room for what an abandoned car can hold.  Mayor Street has gotten much started, he’s carried on some of what former Mayor Rendell started, and all of this feeds the future. These initiatives must continue to bring people back to Philadelphia. New initiatives need to be made. Such as completing Penn’s Landing and fighting sprawl. The city needs to work more with the state to get college students to come to and stay here.  Can Street do this? I think so. I think that the growing chorus of complaints against him will have to force him to change his tune; not turn it around completely, but adjust and make it more better for Philadelphia, rather than better for those connected to him.  And for all the doubters, I’ve debated some with friends and after all the GOP stealing another election rumors, it comes down to a few things.   Philadelphia didn’t get worse after Street took office, it just got better slower. All of Street’s major initiatives started before Sept. 11, 2001, except for Operation Safe Streets. That was the year the economy collapsed, that was the year cities and states were forced to pick up the tab on security.  These 2 problems take a bite out of growth. I figure that once things get started again economically, improvement in Philadelphia will pick up.  I’m leaving Philadelphia next year for graduate school. That will be 2 years away, and hopefully 2 years in a much more progressive city planning environment. After those 2 years are up, where will I go? I would like it to be Philadelphia, I can only hope the coming election results will convince me to return.

       An Apple a Day Keeps Tech Support at Bay   As anyone who’s read this blog and/or visited my personal site even once knows, I’m an Apple freak. Not quite like those crazy people who fill the Mac chatrooms and are in love only with their Apple computer - I split my love with a few other people.  I’m gladly forced to love Apple more and more every day. My jobs strictly use Wintel junk.  It’s to be expected; AIA Philadelphia is a nonprofit with some strained cash flow, as I understand it, and the Bookstore is a little independent shop that helps fund the Chapter, as I understand it.  But recently, the Wintels have been extra evil. Such as during the August worm/virus attack, when I spent 4 hours downloading updates. Or every other month for the past 6 months when the Dell Precision Workstation doesn’t work - to be precise.  We supposedly have next day, onsite maintenance, but only after filling out an impossibly long set of criteria that was e-mailed to us. So today I spent an hour doing all the troubleshooting I could, only to come up with a system no less broken then before. So I replied with my responses; when they’ll get it, read it and give “next day, onsite maintenance,” I have no clue.  Meanwhile, I’m using my G4 laptop each day to do my work at the Chapter. When I first brought it to the Chapter, it immediately found the network and worked, to be precise.  I connected the Epson scanner and the Apple scanning software recognized it immediately, even after several failed attempts at installing drivers for Photoshop 5, running in OS9.  Why can’t more people be about Mac? I’m guessing it’s the human desire for abuse. I remember reading about that when “Weakest Link” debuted in America. There was something about the leather-clad British dominatrix that viewers loved.  My Dell is a black plastic piece of junk trying to dominate me, but alas, I have a sleek Titanium friend at my side. Troubleshooting my laptop doesn’t require a hammer or a wrecking ball to satisfy me.  So I’m joining forces with the only other Mac user at the Chapter, our Communications Director, to beef up Mac support here. She’s been left with an original G3 tower to run the department. I say department, but it’s really her and I that do all the communications work.  If she can get the Chapter to buy her a last generation G4, it would also mean her getting Office and Photoshop 7 for OSX. I could put them on my laptop and suddenly dropping this Imprecise Non-WorkStation Dell from the 24th Floor wouldn’t prevent me from staring idly at the dead thing, which prevents me from working.

       More Desperate Than Madonna   This past week, the Bush Administration went on a very desperate PR campaign to beef up opinion of the war in Iraq and the aftermath. It goes far behind lesbian kisses at the MTV Music Video Awards.  The Bush push seemed like such a ploy, but unfortunately other people saw it differently; Bush’s approval ratings went up last week.  Why it’s not so obvious to others that the PR campaign is a front for an administration on the run, I’ll never know.  But I’m not here to berate my silly American peers today. I’m trying to get a little bit of information out that didn’t catch on in the major media. CNN and  The New York Times  failed to pick it up.  The story concerns  urlLink  a botched letter writing campaign , which  The Olympian  [Wash.] uncovered.  The newspaper received identical letters from 2 hometown soldiers serving in Iraq. The letters touted progress and much the soldiers enjoyed lifting up the Iraqis. Gannett News Service eventually uncovered 7 such letters, some which the soldiers, whose signatures appear on the letter, don’t recall signing or even knowing about.   None of the letters were written by the soldiers who signed them. It’s unclear if any of the soldiers took part in any of the events described or visited any of the places mentioned.  Of course, when asked, all agreed with what was written, but not all were comfortable with the tactic.   urlLink  Yahoo  has a similar story, which notes  USA Today  did report the news.  Of course the Department of Defense has no idea what the letters are about.   Right. If my memory and Hollywood serves me well, letters from soldiers don’t get delivered until after being approved by the military.  I don’t have a problem with that type of censorship, but this fact hurts the DoD stance.  So I guess in some way this is the Vietnam War of my generation. No disrespect to those who took part in the events of that era; Americans today never stood against the war like those who protested Vietnam, but it’s the most similar thing I can come up with now.

       Degrees to the Famous   Today I helped out with the regional architecture conference hosted by AIA Philadelphia.   I’ve been with the AIA for nearly 3 years. In that time I’ve met a few random famous people: members of Incubus, Judith Light, lil’ Bow Wow and Andre Braugher. I’ve seen Nappy Roots and a few others who I’ve pretty much forgotten about.   Bjork has been through our Holiday Shop and I’ve met and talked with Kevin Bacon’s dad, Edmund Bacon, several times; he was city planner of Philadelphia for awhile and has a book published, which we sell, and he comes by to sign it on occasion.  But today my link to a famous person is very much like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon (I’m 2 degrees away, for anyone reading this who plays the game).  After the conference breakfast broke and classes started, local architect Gerald Cope came through. He was running late, but stopped to talk to the chapter director and the guest speaker. Cope is British, his accent lingers after all these years.  He’s an architect I’ve not heard of outside of my work with the chapter. The most famous still-living Philadelphia architect is Robert Venturi. He never shows up at the bookstore - he has go-fers for that - but I’ve seen his work and my Design III class studied a house he did for his mother.   My sophomore year at Textile, I saw him on a class trip to Manayunk. We were to design a cafe along Main Street, which is also where Venturi’s offices are. The class stood on one side of the street, while the professor pointed to Venturi on the other side.  Also, I feel I should note, the Philadelphia AIA member firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson designed the SoHo Apple Store. The firm also did Pixar Studio headquarters, the Steve Jobs-run animation studio. I’ve met one of the partners and another person from the firm.  But I digress...  Cope is an older man, one with stories. He studied architecture in London after W.W.II. While there he met Le Corbusier. He met him several times after this. Le Corbusier is a major force in architecture. He helped form the international style. More than one of his built projects shows up in architectural history books. More than one of his homes was studied in my Design III class. I’ve heard about his work, but today I got to hear a personal story about the man.  So even though these past 2 days I’ve been up since 5:30 a.m. to help out with the conference, even though it was mostly boring working the registration table, I thoroughly enjoyed 15 minutes of my day today.

       ”Do Not Call” It Free Speech   The last time I heard something as ridiculous as the telemarketers’ “free speech” stance against the national “Do Not Call” list, it was coming from the same government now trying to enforce it.  I’d be more specific, but the White House says something stupid at least twice a day.  But let’s say for just a second that the line does hold up. I don’t see how that suddenly means Joe Blow in Arizona can call me in Philadelphia and try and sell me cheaper phone service, when I’m already paying rock bottom prices.  So a judge says that’s free speech. Well so is the 6 p.m. news. So is Playboy magazine. So is that bland Top 40 radio station that sounds like every other one in every other city.  Guess what all this has in common?  If I don’t want to watch the news, I turn off the TV and suddenly it’s not coming into my house. If I don’t want to read the articles in Playboy, I don’t subscribe or I cancel my subscription and it no longer comes to my house. If I don’t want to listen to bland radio, then I turn it off and it’s not in my house.  Why can’t I do something about preventing telemarketers from essentially coming into my house?  As with all the above mentioned examples I can stop it after it’s already come into my house, but I can also preventing from getting to me.  I don’t want MCI hassling me to switch phone companies when I’m already a loss to that viled Verizon. I don’t want a new credit card. I’ve spent the last 3 years paying off my canceled credit card debt and I’ve finally done that. Why throw myself back into near bankruptcy?  I don’t have a house, so don’t call asking if I want to take out a mortgage. Do your damn homework, you stupid telemarketer. I don’t want scammed over the phone, so con artists, don’t call my number.  Guess what telemarketers, Regina Unger doesn’t live here. This has been my number for 2 years, stop calling for her.  The only voices I want coming through my phone are those of friends and family, or of some business with my permission to call me, such as my current creditors, or a pollster.  The free speech claim telemarketers are making undermines free speech, much like the Bush administration is undermining democracy.  Finally the government is doing something for the individual citizen - and not business - and what does the judicial branch do? Stick up for business.  I wonder how many people have read about the ironic twist to this story. The Denver judge who ruled against the “Do Not Call” registry submitted his name and phone number to the list.  As of now, the number of people who submitted their telephone number to the national register rival the number of votes for either George W. Bush or Al Gore in the 2000 election. Nearly 51 million people were wrong when they voted for Bush, but the list has nearly 51 million Americans (and is growing), it has the backing of both houses and both parties in Congress and the “do not call” list already exists in states from sea to shining sea.  Something must be a little bit right about it, don’t you think?

       The Best Party No One Attended   So Clean imploded. It sucked up a lot of preparation, hopes, plans, money and people. Damon promoted endlessly for 2 weeks; I had it listed in the weekly calendars in the  City Paper  and, yes God forgive me, the  Philadelphia Weekly .  By 6:30 p.m., only 7 people had showed, and 2 got in for free. The day didn’t start off well; at noon the bar owner was to have opened up for us to get the place ready. He showed up half an hour before the party was to start, and how the place was trashed! (You know I mean it when I use an exclamation mark, the most viled - by the news industry - punctuation mark.)  But the people who did showed up stayed until we shut down at 7 p.m. We kept their attention, so that says something.  Philly is a difficult town like that. It’s still very blue collar, still barbaric in a sense. It’s part of its allure, but is also to blame for its decline.  I’m hanging around as publicist for Damon. It gives me a little bit of journalism work.  ***  So I was to take my practice GRE test tonight. Obviously that isn’t the case. Stupid ETS sent me the program, but - surprise - it’s formatted for people with no taste. That’s right, Windows only. So not only is Microsoft to blame for the the information and millions of dollars lost in cyber attacks, it’s also responsible for any problems I have with passing the GRE.  And this isn’t a problem I need.   I’m still very much about Portland, but I’m opening my choices to a few other cities for a number of reasons. One being, what if I’m not accepted? Others include a person who’ll be moving with me and considerations for what the city has to offer for people other than me.  So a better GRE score could lead to me having to choose a school, rather than being forced into one I don’t want.  **  Anyway, Armeggedon continues**  Anyway, Armageddon continues outside my cozy 10th floor apartment.   Not surprisingly, mum is the word in the White House over the CIA operative leak.   Israel is now taking up preventive attacks thanks in part to George W. Bush’s legitimizing such action.   Californians are in the process of either holding up democracy (by voting “no” in the recall) or undermining it by voting “yes” and putting Ah-nuld in office. I can only hope Davis-sympathizers get a new recall petition going.  And my choice for Mayor of Philadelphia discovered his office is being tapped.  And why exactly can I not find work in the news field??

       Mass Insanity Has Set In   Never try to put on something with a minimalist budget.  My little printer at home is now spitting out teaser flyers for the next 'clean' party. The premiere party is happening in less than an hour. This is like running a non-profit organization. Each person has too many jobs for too little money. I'm now printer, designer, publicist and door person - I'll refrain from saying bouncer because a child could push me over and entire the bar if he/she so desired.  All of this is partly to blame for my absence. But during the down time I did manage to clean up my "Links" page. I've barely managed to clean up my apartment. This week had a few other bumps and my job push is about to get into high gear.  Come Monday, things should clear up a little bit for me and it'll be back to shiny, happy Brian. Ha!

       Thankful for Something   I think this year was probably the best Thanksgiving I've had in awhile. Generally I go to my grandparents, my mom comes down, Veronica and I are bored out of our minds, and the stepfather is on some pointless rampage.  But oddly enough, none of that surfaced.  What did come about was the largest gathering of the Weirs in 3 years, and not a single argument. We went to Good & Plenty, an Amish-style eatery, all 17 or 18 of us. That's the mom and dad, 4 of their children, 3 who married into this crazy family,  2 in-laws, 6 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.  It lasted just an hour and half. But afterward Veronica and I went joy riding to see each place we've called home in Lancaster County. That trip included loud music, bad singing lots of reminiscing and a pee break.  I also saw  A Christmas Story  for the first time, from beginning to end, if you consider the butcher job TBS did to fit it into the 2-hour time slot with too many commercials and an obnoxious duo talking pointlessly before and after each commercial break.  But this is all ending in less than 12 hours when Black Friday madness will certainly bring me down from this high.

       Bad Taste   Bartender: What’ll it be?  "Beer" Drinker: How about a low-carb, low calorie Miller?  Bartender: Oh, piss. Bottle or tap? **  It wasn't enough that I was forced to sit through Miller Lite ads while watching my favorite shows. It wasn't enough that Coors Lite tried to make me believe that banging parties with hot chicks happen when I drink it.  I guess the advertisers might have almost had me, had every frat party I ever attended (3) not been lame and serving it.  Before getting too much further into this I must say I'm an alcohol snob. Parties in Apt. 109E always featured Nattie Ice or The Beast for guests, while the roommates and an elite few enjoyed White Russians or Yuengling.  Yuengling is a regional beer from eastern Pennsylvania. It, Guinness, Corona and Amstel Light (those ads are cool) make my cut of excellent beers. I usually take to the local beers when I’m traveling, but these 4 will always be the returning champions.  What is it about these beers? They deliver every time. And they’re respectable beers to drink in public, in front of the ladies.  Just like women supposedly don’t respect a man who eats salads, there's nothing attractive in ordering low-carb Michelob or a low-cal whatever just came out.  And it’s not just about respect. If you’re going to drink and if you’re going to enjoy your beer, then it’s OK to put your diet on hold. Or order some water. But don't make the watered-down beer more popular than the real stuff. American beer is already watered down to meet stringent alcohol content rules here in this free country.  Let's halt this consumer-driven encroachment on beer drinkers' one passion.  Why someone who is trying to be healthy would even go to a bar is beyond me. There’s the beer-gut inducing drinks to be ordered, the secondhand smoke to be inhaled; the sprained ankle from that drunken fall...  I’ll refrain from getting more graphic.  Let’s break this down.  Go out once or twice a week, have a few real beers, do your healthy thing - if you must - the rest of the week and there’s nothing to worry about.  ** Beer drinker: Bartender, another Yuengling, and pass the pretzel and the astray.  [Women enters from the side] Women: [To the bartender]: I’ll have the same. [To beer drinker]: Hi, my name is ...  [Scene fades]

       Marketing Promotions Gone Awry   I am rather alive, and rather busy. I’ve recently lost my personal space. This sounds much worse than the situation really is. My most personal relationship jumped ahead several steps over the past month, and we’ve decided living together is best for us. It also helps because we are moving together when I leave for graduate school, and we might as well work out the kinks before the situation gets dire.  So far so good.  My apartment was rather sparse, even after 2.5 years, but no more. It feels like home, but that doesn’t mean I like living here. It’s become impossible for me to keep my cool, so I’ve turned to reporting the building to Licenses & Inspections here in Philadelphia. I’ve taken to writing letters to the building management, seeing as how it takes DAYS to get response, if I get one. Soon I may get my councilman involved.  But, enough about me, let’s get on with the show...  I am black.  So says AOL.  The only thing going in AOL's favor is it’s not MSN, otherwise, I'd be much meaner.  AOL’s latest niche/blanket promotion is called “Black Focus.” I live in North Philadelphia, a predominantly black section of Philadelphia, so I received this promotion. The packaging is in deep earthy tones. This version of AOL gives me exclusive access to “new music releases from artists like 50 Cent, Missy Elliot and R. Kelly.  It also provides “the latest take on news and events that impact” my community.  I so very much dislike the term “community.” Blacks have community. Gays have communities. Whites don’t have communities. Is everyone else supposed to predictable and alike?  More importantly, if community, in the true sense of the word existed, would black on black crime exist as much as it does? Would the rate of HIV transmissions still have gone up as drastically as it did if gays treated each other as a community?  Community, I bet.  But I digress.  Aside from that, I don’t know why the company is still so strongly pushing for AOL dial-up, when the future is in DSL.  The company continues to lose dial-up subscribers. And let me be stereotypical for a second. If they are going to blanket North Philadelphia with an ISP option, why not do something to take on al the cheaper alternatives.  Free service for 45 days really isn’t anything if the price is going to be jacked up to one of the highest prices in the industry beginning on day 46.  ***  I'm working on getting back to regular communications with the larger world. We'll see how well that goes.

       Academic Blooper   OK, maybe academic is being too kind. I am talking about Temple, the jock school of Philadelphia, quite possibly.  [Note: Prospective Students: Don’t get me wrong, I got a lot out of Temple.] [Note: Alumni, current students, dropouts: Why should a blunder on Temple’s part even phase me?]  I graduated in May of 2002. I somehow missed the exit interview. I continued to miss it for a year and a half, until upon needing transcripts for grad school, Temple informed me of this. What this did was put a hold on my account, which prevented me from getting transcripts, my grades and, apparently, call backs from University staff regarding this issue.  So today I went to visit my alma mater - still just 4 or 5 blocks from my apartment - to clear it all up, only to stumble on another problem.  I couldn’t even start the exit interview because my login contained incorrect information. Not because I entered it incorrectly; I think I have my social security number and birthday memorized. It was wrong because, all through my years at Temple, the University file on me was wrong.  They had my birthday as 1980, not 1979. How do you mess that up when you are entering information? Even with my sloppiest handwriting “79” does not look like “80.”  So to login, I had to lie about my birthday; the office I was doing all of this from, Academic Records, couldn’t change it, that’s to be done in financial aid, or some other office that doesn’t seem like it should have that power.  After nearly 1.5 hours, it was all done with. I paid the money to get copies of my transcripts; it should take 5 days, but could be as many as 10.  ***  So what have I been up to of late, which has prevented me from posting regularly? I’m doing a lot more work with Damon, my DJ friend for anyone who is reading this for the first time.  We’ve written a business plan for  urlLink Clean Recordings , I’m working on his bio, and I’ve put up a rather shabby Web site for the record label. In the works is a press packet to drum up some noise for a forthcoming CD, simply awaiting capital investment, and more gigs on the East Coast.  Not to mention it’s now Christmastime at the  urlLink AIA Bookstore & Design Center . This week all 7 of our windows will change/are changing to ornaments, gifts and whatever else we need to sell but haven’t so we’re throwing into the window with high hopes of clearing the inventory.  We’re short 2 people this year, as the slow economy didn’t hit our independent, niche bookstore until after last holiday, so now we’re paying for a bad year. Already I’ve gone out for drinks with the buyer and manager, and the windows haven’t been completed.   Oh, what a year this will end up being.

       Election Day, Almost Over!   I voted this morning. Big surprise. I've been waiting for this day for weeks now.  I've about had it with the political ads on TV. If you're reading this in the center of some state, you don't understand what I'm going through.   I can throw a stone at New Jersey, which means I have to deal with political ads for both states and each municipality in the Philadelphia TV coverage area.  The political ads for Mayor John Street and Sam Katz are nothing compared to the crap for New Jersey's Assembly candidates. I honestly don't know what the issues are, aside from everyone trashing the other for their voting record before this election. How about what their voting record might be like after Nov. 4?  But anyway.  I voted for Street. I actually got to tell an idiot Katz supporter that today. She asked if I voted and I replied, "Yes." She asked if it was for Katz, and I snickered, "No."  I'll leave it at that so I don't jinx the election.

Oh wait, Saddam wasn't the reason for war, it was those deadly, and still missing, weapons of mass destruction.  Maybe Saddam will tell us where they are.  My guess is they were all in his happy place, somewhere far from reality, which also isn't so far from where the Bush Administration must be.

       New York City, Bite Me   Generally I ignore the stupid remarks reporters and New Yorkers make about their world class, one of a kind, center of the universe city that can pull together like no other.  Yeah, right.  This morning I was watching CNN and their coverage of the first major storm of the season. Oh, look, footage from Baltimore. Oh, look footage from Philadelphia. Oh look, a live report from Central Park.   “Blah blah blah...It’s amazing how the city can pull together in these times. blah blah blah.”  Yes, the rest of the Northeast is falling to pieces. Lootings, power outages, gunfire...  Guess what, it looks like Philadelphia is pulling together and holding up. I don’t hear any reports about Boston falling apart and sinking in the Atlantic Ocean.  What the hell does that mean, the city is pulling together? It’s a snowstorm. It’s packing a punch far less than the blizzard that hit the Northeast last February.  Oh, but the CNN reporter just had to go on and on. She even made mention about “all the city has been through over the past few years.”  Yes, because this little whimper of a snowstorm is comparable to 9/11. Oh, the little whimper of a snowstorm is comparable to the massive blackout this past summer.  Give me a break. Go back and get your journalism degree from a real school, reporter. And please, don’t try newsprint journalism, the copy desk will leave half your lame story on the newsroom floor.  Yes, I’ve visited the city and had a decent time, but I still have no desire to live anywhere near it. I have a problem dealing with big egos.  Meanwhile, I’m rather enjoying seeing the snowfall from my window. I worked yesterday and despite the weather, the AIA Bookstore nearly made its goal for the day. Today I’m off, obviously and I’ve reconnected with my love of Tetris.   Yes, I’ve dusted off the N64 and put some time in with an old friend. I’ve not played Tetris in years, but it was fun going back and seeing all the old players and records from my time in Apt. 109E. Christ, that was 4 years ago.

       Shock & Awe   I'm in agreement with the Vatican. I honestly can't think of a time this last happened. Yeah, I was about the Pope standing against war, but that was a given.  But I digress. This post will most certainly induce self-retaliation, so I should just keep focused.  This post also has the high honor of being the first I've made with a  urlLink BBC story . I'm not sure how long the story will stay online, but above is a link to check it out for as long as you can. The Vatican has taken a stance against pharmaceuticals that manufacture anti-AIDS (Aids according to the BBC) drugs for putting money before goodwill.  Amen!  OK, enough of that.   Yeah for the PR! But what about all the others with AIDS in this world, the ones who are too poor to buy the drugs as well. Is it OK for pharmaceuticals to charge such high prices when the disease ravages the poor?   Personally I have problems with the pharmaceutical industry for essentially being an industry for those who can afford it. I can't go into it all, but the way the brand names stall their drugs from generic issue is problematic. And yes, studying and creating these drugs is expensive, but the federal government provides money and incentives to cut those costs, at least in the area of AIDS.  But this is about the Vatican and their conflicting policies. The Vatican does not support birth control and that means condoms. Condoms prevents the spread of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  Does this seem just a little hypocritical? Certainly the Catholic Church doesn't have the sway it once did, but it's archaic and harmful policy can be found in the policy of our Methodist "President" George W. Bush.  Please, does any of this make sense to any real people? If more people were using condoms, had access to condoms, there wouldn't be orphaned children from HIV. There might not even be children, which honestly can't be that bad, seeing as how famine is regularly ravaging Africa where AIDS is a serious pandemic on a scale not seen elsewhere in the world.  And here is a summarized quote from a Jesuit priest in agreement with the Pope:   It was a moral issue which showed lack of social conscience on the part of the international drug manufacturing companies, he [Father Angelo D'Agostino] added.   Doesn't the stance of the Vatican show a lack of social conscience?  I think so.

       Hell Again   So I'm on my annual pilgramage to my mom's house in western Pennsylvania. As usual it's snowing.  As usual I'm bored. So far I've gotten my haircut, had 2 cups of tea and spend more than 2 hours defragmenting, de-virusing and de-porning their subpar computer.  I'm working on a post to go here, but rather than get into heavy writing and reading, I'm helping my mom with her taxes, as usual.  So here's to another great trip.  The usual dentist visit is Monday morning before Veronica, her fiance and I head back to civilization.

       The Spin Machine in D.C.   Just last week I was talking to my friend Jigsha online. We've been talking fairly regularly, but on this day, there was news to discuss. George Bush had been in her state and the newspaper had her put in some extra hours to get all the coverage up on their Web site.  After his time in Tennessee Bush took off for more fundraising in Florida. The story I'd like to quote from deals with the Florida leg of his trip. When Jigsha sent me the link to the story, I didn't have to read long before a very suspect line got my attention.  It couldn't have gotten my attention anymore if it were bold and danced around the screen thanks to Javascript.   The following quote is from a Jan. 8, 2004 article in the TCPalm.com News:   "We carried it once and we're going to carry it again," Bush said at a fund-raiser that brought in $1 million for his re-election.   Carried Florida?  Doesn't this seems like artistic license to the extreme? He only "carried" Florida 36 days after the polls closed an in one of the closest, if not the closest, elections in the history of the United States. And, only after the Supreme Court weighed in on the matter.  This is the sort of artistic license that got the United States into a nearly unilateral war in Iraq. This sort of artistic license forced a vote of confidence onto Tony Blair, prime minister of our most vocal ally, England.  Bush could certainly use some help with his word choice. Hell, he could use some help getting his facts straight.   One can only hope this type of swagger will be his undoing. *** So yes, I'm writing regularly now. It's been political of late, but I'm about to make the dreaded annual trip to my mom's in western Pennsylvania. This means that for a whole weekend I get to teach my mom how to use the computer she's now had for more than a year. Fortunately they've got Internet this time, so I shall escape to the digital realm and vent about that backwards place I couldn't wait to leave.  I'm going to end this post as I've started it: Talking about Jigsha. She checks up with my site regularly and recently noticed apostrophes and quotation marks appearing as questions marks. That's a problem with Netscape reading what I've pasted in from my word processing program, so now I'm doing this differently and that problem should end.  Also, if you've been going over older pages, I've not been able to keep all of my links up to date, but I'm working on that. so for now, just visit active links, like those featuring my friends and sites about them and their lives. It'll be like we're a big happy family!

       For Pete's Sake   It's not very often I take on the subject of baseball, or any sport for that matter.  Should I have to make the post, then baseball it would be.  Of course, this just has all sorts of relevance for me. My family has always been Phillies fans. It's the baseball team closest to where the family grew up. The subject of this post played for the Phillies...  Is there now any doubt in your mind as to whom I'm writing about? Yes, Pete Rose.  Pete Rose is trying to get into the Hall of the Fame. He's not just a man with ego, he holds records and for one of those records he had to out-hit someone already in the Hall of Fame.  There's one small snag, Rose bet on baseball, which led to his ouster from the sport. If he's reinstated, he's got a shot at his Hall of Fame dreams. A shot, and that's about it.   He'll have to pass dreaded Rule 5, which tests integrity; not something ranking high for Rose, as he's lied about betting since his ouster. Of course, he could just be throwing in the towel to be given a shot, but that's not much for integrity either.  But, as I've learned through my limited research for this post, the Baseball Hall of Fame has  urlLink some hitters who strike out in that area .  Now I don't want to just have certain rules thrown out. They stand for a reason. Something needs to hold back the floodgate of unscrupulous characters, but we're talking record setters here. We're not just talking about good players. We're talking about players who helped make the sport America's past time. Those people need to be recognized. In an era of charging for signatures and over-priced food and players, we need to recognize what baseball was.   More importantly, Rose had a passion for baseball. All these years banned from the sport is pretty disheartening for someone like that.  Rose has been punished, let's not punish the sport or the fans.  Some people don't want Rose in the sport anymore, as a coach or anything. Honestly, I'm not sure what team is going to hire him as head coach. If no team picks him up, then lots of people get their way. Pete gets into the Hall of Fame, but his past transgressions will always follow him, holding him back.  Sounds fair enough, as far as being a criminal goes.

       Truth. Fair Drug Law.   Parents. The Anti-Drug.  Have you seen these commercials? I can handle some of them: The Interrogator & the Punisher aren?t so horrible. It?d be nice if these ads focused on more problematic drugs, but you?ve got to start somewhere, and while I use marijuana, I don?t push for it?s use.  But there are two ads that really irk me.  The first ad features a little girl playing precariously by the pool. The voice of God takes the story further: some pothead teen is supposed to be watching her, but the pothead isn?t because the pothead is smoking, so the girl falls in the pool and drowns.  Uh huh. Let?s take things to the extreme. Could someone please provide me with the statistics on child - pool deaths related to pothead baby-sitters?  More importantly, why have the parents allowed their pothead teen to baby-sit? If this teen is so high as to not be able to watch the younger sibling, how do the parents not know? We?re not talking about a recreational user here, we?re talking about a hardcore user. And if we?re to believe all the studies, this teen is using a lot more than pot.  Maybe we should take this commercial and focus on bad parents.  The second ad features a high school basketball team practicing in the gym. The coach enters to dismiss a player. The voice of God takes the story further: this pothead player, apparently the star player, has been kicked off the team for being a pothead. What are the consequences? The team won?t make it to the playoffs.  Uh huh. Let?s take things to an impossible extreme. The reason the team isn?t going to the playoff isn?t because of the pot, per se. In fact, this pothead player has taken the team to the brink. It doesn?t seem to be hurting his abilities - so much for that dope image. It?s the outdated drug laws that have ended this star player?s career and the team?s chances at the playoffs.  Maybe we should take this commercial and focus on bad laws.  More importantly, it should be noted that this ad campaign was started in 1998 and is part of the White House Office of Nation Drug Control Policy. Quick note: Bill Clinton was president in 1998 and, even though he denied how far he went with the drug, we can infer that he smoked pot. It?s now 2004 and our latest president is an admitted crackhead and drunk.  Doesn?t this all just smack of something hypocritical?  I?m hardly expecting progressive drug laws out of the current administration. Christ, the Bush Administration was waving its pointer finger at Canada for freeing up prison space by making marijuana possession a ?do not go directly to jail? offense.  I also don?t expect it, because ads like this give the wrong impression. If voters are to believe these ads present common instances of drug use gone wrong, how will fairer laws ever come to pass?  Would I fight this if it had been a heroin addict who let the younger sibling drown in the pool? No.   Would I have complained if the basketball player was kicked off the team for steroid use? No.   But as an organization created by Congress and associated with the White House, how about a little more fairness. I mean, this isn?t war with Iraq.

       Power of Mac   So I’m a little bit of a conspiracy theorist. If you’re a regular reader whom I haven’t  lost through my irregularity, you know this.  You also know that the AIA provides me with a piece of shit Wintel. A Dell to be exact, and do not listen to the ads claiming an "A" for customer service; I spent 1.5 hours on hold with them and didn’t get a pick up.  But anyway. I have administrator access on this computer and just to stick it to everyone, I have the jumping text as the screensaver. It says “To Be a Mac...”  Still with me?  The other day I went up to my office for my lunch break and the computer was frozen. No big surprise for a Wintel, right? Well it’s the “much more stable” NT version, yet it still froze while running the screensaver.  Yes, the word “Mac” is too difficult for this computer to handle. Of course, it might not be difficult, it might just hurt Windows feelings, so it freezes up.  So now it’s been frozen on that for days and I’ll leave that way for as long as I can. I’ve gotta stick it these people!  Just thought I’d share.

       Silence Was Golden   He’s alive!!! Muah haha haha!!!  Yes. I have a New Year’s resolution, and that is to write more. Write on this damn blog, write in my journal, write stories and poems. Just write.  And so far so good. I’ve made 2 entries into my personal journal, and now this post. It’s taken quite a bit of pushing and shoving to get me this far. Thank you very much Jigsha.  The most insane month ever at the AIA Bookstore just ended, and as I’m typing this the staff is entering Day 3 of inventory. Usually we go 2 days, but this one was particularly exciting (sprinkles of sarcasm).  So I haven’t taken much to writing, because it would be a lot of banter, more so than most posts. The average retail customer is just so...so...incompetent (note: this is said through teeth so clenched I’m about to undo 2.5 years of orthodontic work.).  That and the extreme living situation change has turned my world upside down. I asked for it, and I don’t mind it. But the truth of the matter is that this apartment is too small for 2 people, especially for someone who produces music and someone who usually requires complete silence for all reading and writing endeavors.  When we move together it has to be into a 2-bedroom apartment, one for us, the other for the studio, and, of course, the living room for my space.  What else have I been up to of late? I’ve been working out the kinks with my friends as well. A relationship usually means more time for one person and less for others. That’s exaggerated in my situation because I’m such a hermit. Oh, and 90% of friends do not live in this city.  I’ve also taken to the bottle much more consistently, harder and longer. Does that seem slightly sexual? We’ve gone through 3 fifths of liquor and 1.75 liters of another liquor in just over a week. And for anyone who doesn’t know me, I’m a liquor snob and an alcoholic’s alcoholic. Southern Comfort. Captain Morgan’s. Jack Daniels.  That’s now dropped off considerably; I’m most definitely not an alcoholic. I know I know, denial is the first sign, but I seriously won’t have another drink for a few weeks.  It accomplished what I needed: killing off stress and tension. This time next week I’m getting a massage to help ease that without the liquor. It’s from a gift certificate I got last Christmas from the Bookstore. I’m looking forward to this. I’ve never had a massage before. I’m told that afterwards I’m to just come home. No operating heavy machines or electronics that fit in your pocket. So I’m planning on coming home and getting pampered. Hint to the significant other reading this...  So as you can see, I can still write. I just have to refocus this as 2004 is going to be a big year. Grad school, moving and charging elephants.  Come back and read regularly again.

       Unlikely Activist   I've made my stance on gay marriages quite clear multiple times on my blog and through conversation with my friends, but now I've become an activist supporting it, or, more truthfully, an activist on equality and dropping the term "marriage" for all legal purposes.  I'm not one to be so vocal about something so personal. I'm a Cancer, and I like my protective shell, so this is all very new for me. I only just came out at work this past December. I also don't make it a point to advertise it, not because of shame, but because I want to keep things to myself.  But following President George W. Bush's stance on a marriage amendment to the Constitution, I wrote an 800 and some odd word piece against the amendment, which I'm trying to get printed.  So far I've tried  The City Paper ,  The Philadelphia Inquirer , and  The New York Times . Oh that I could be printed in  The Times !  You'll have to be on the lookout for my name in the editorial section, or you could just check back here, because I will most definitely be making a deal about it. Or, if I can't find anyone to print it in a reasonable amount of time, I'll post it here, and send it as a letter to every elected representative in Congress.  I am creating a very awkward situation for myself, putting, or trying to put, myself out there so publicly. The audience to my blog will never rival  The New York Times , and this allows me to take up issues in a very behind-the-scenes manner.  But I have prepared for increase in visitors to my site, by updating a lot of crap and adding a lot of  urlLink links  useful for would-be environmental and political activists. Obviously the environmental position is pretty biased, but I've made sure my political links aren't. *** This is my 3rd write-thru of this and it still sounds jumpy. I'm really out of it today. Must be the very nice weather here, which will end my cabin fever.

       I Support 3rd Parties, Just Not This Year   I'm a 3rd party fanatic. Any political debate I get into, I bring it all back to the lack of a poly-party government. Israel, Germany, England, etc. etc., all have several political parties that require alliances be formed to fulfill the tasks at hand.   But not in the United States. No, here you have a party, which can easily take majority of either House of Congress and force their will, with little that can be done by the only other party.   *** Side note: And when we get around to codifying all of this, could we please include an amendment banning LaRouche from politics. His party, his workers, he himself aren't left or right, they're somewhere over the rainbow with those posters and slogans and beliefs. I really don't like dismissing people, but there are always exceptions to the rule. ***   So it's my belief that true campaign reform won't happen until our government creates a level playing field for Republicans, Democrats, Greens, etc. etc.   Unfortunately, all of my 3rd party banter can't convince me to vote 3rd party this election year. I would have voted for Ralph Nader in 2000, had I been registered. But I wasn't.    I'm not pissed off at Nader over the 2000 election outcome. I think Gore was an OK candidate, but I think Sen. Joe Lieberman hurt him. I was so glad when Lieberman dropped out of the presidential race this year. He's so centrist, he's on the right.   But I am so pissed at President George W. Bush that I feel only a single viable alternative to him should be on the ballot to ensure his demise.   I've probably said this once already, but I'll say it again. If Bush is to win and rule for another 4 years, it is my very strong belief that nothing short of a revolution can get this country back on track.   And not my track, but the track laid down by the Founding Fathers.   After the Democratic candidate takes the White House, after some fixes are made, then I can get my principles back. But to allow Bush in the White House again would go against my principles even more than putting them on hold. Plus, honestly, Sens. John Kerry and John Edwards are shaping up to be pretty decent contenders.

       Friday Night Musings   So rather than comment on the news, and I'm actually without much to say this time around, I'm going to comment on myself.   So egotistical, I know. Blame it on my horoscope today.   That actually reminds me of a skit from  Kentucky Fried Movie . If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it to those who are against PC in the name of humor.   I'm in the process of going over a minor update to my Web site and I've noticed some out of date items. For instance, in my blog tag I claim to be someone who spends my days being objective. Hell, I've not had an objective day since my last day at the newspaper, which was in August.   All attempts at finding a job requiring my objectivity have failed, thanks to the stars, George W. Bush and the pervasive climate within the media industry that hires people through contacts rather than what they can do.   But I'm not bitter.   Oh, let me backtrack; here is a comment on George W. Bush. I caught a little thing on CNN about a book titled "Bush Country." The person being interviewed was either the author, who was for Bush or a commentator for Bush, because he claimed that Bush is probably the best speaker in the White House since FDR.   I went off after I heard this. Bush could be a good speaker if he could grasp the English language. Hell, not even that much; if he could just grasp language. Bush could be a good speaker if his delivery wasn't drier than a  Saturday Night Live  skit.   While I'm on the subject of CNN, I want to be Jack Cafferty from  American Morning . If only to be beside Soledad O'Brien every morning. I'm not sure how long he's been the way he is, but he's so opinionated and sharp. So refreshing each morning as I'm waking up.   I'm so tempted to respond to his daily question, but I can never bring myself to do it. It's not like I'd have a problem getting what I say on the air. A disproportionate amount of the e-mails read come from Pennsylvania.   OK, so enough is enough. I'm managing to mesh too many different things into a single train of thought.   How's that for insight into how my noggin works.   Frightening, believe me.

       The Non-Apology Apology   Sounds very Seinfeldian, doesn't it?   I'm going to pick on the man-of-the-moment who is guilty of this, though it can be applied to most anybody.   I'm talking about the University of Colorado football coach who is now on paid leave for comments he made about a former female kicker who is accusing at least one male player on the team of rape and assault.   After Katie Hnida made the allegations in  Sports Illustrated , her former coach at UC, Gary Barnett, in a statement to the press, said as a kicker, Hnida sucked. His exact words: she was an "awful player."   Uh, huh.   Why was she a kicker on his team then? More importantly, if she sucked so bad, how did she transfer to the University of New Mexico, where she played in a Division I football game?   And I haven't even gotten to the juicy part yet. Following his remarks, the University decided to put Barnett on leave, prompting him to make another stupid statement:    "I sincerely regret that yesterday, a portion of my remarks were either misinterpreted or taken, aired out of context."    I watched the news conference and I have no idea how any statement he made could have been taken out of context. He spent that conference grabbing at straws and not even addressing the issue at hand. Who wrote this man's prepared speech? He was absolutely not apologetic, in fact, he came across as a pompous asshole.   I sometimes wish I had gone into PR or advertising, because there is so much mess out there that needs cleaned up. Not that I'd want to help Barnett, but either he needs a PR person, or he needs a new one.   Barnett's performance should garner him much more than paid leave; the University should fully distance itself from that man by letting him go. Actually, if the man had any honor at all, and his non-apology apology shows he is lacking in that considerably, he should leave by his own volition.   As for the validity of Hnida's allegations, which Barnett seems keen to brush aside, I'd say they seem very valid, seeing as how she left CU, apparently not over grades, because she easily moved on to another school, another team.

       Pick a Candidate, Any Candidate   Let me just start off by saying that I have always been a big fan of presidential candidates Sens. John Kerry and John Edwards since the race started. I always thought Gov. Howard Dean was a little too, eh, what's the word? Strange? Too far left of center, I'd say.   One thing missing from the current primary election focus is debate on the issues. There certainly are issues, at  urlLink John Kerry's Web site  you can read his stance on nearly 30 issues. But they're not really be debated out in the open.   What is being discussed is Kerry's "electability."   How has U.S. government and politics fallen so far? It's an election year and the issues seem to be an aside to getting President Bush out of office. I want Bush out of office as much as or more than the next person, but if you have someone with a strong stance on issues, that should be enough to unseat the bumbling puppet who sits in the Oval Office.   Honestly, if there are so many people who are against Bush, who want him out of office, then how did the man ever get into office? Could it be a lot of people were slacking the last time around?   I don't know honestly, but I like to be accusatory.   Maybe the only positive thing to come out of the Bush Administration is a renewed interest in politics by the younger generation. And this younger generation, is by virtue more progressive.   Maybe, just maybe, because we had to fall back 8 years with this Administration, our next one will be several years advanced, as will the next and the next... It's about the only thing that keeps me so controlled during these years of no tax relief (for me and the rest of the lower middle class and further down the scale), Constitutional infringements, and special interest give-aways.   Unfortunately, if people are basing their votes only on "electability," this means a lot of people might be biting the bullet on issues they don't agree with.   Oh, how I long for a United States with a more-party system, with at least 3 parties, with choices!   I'm such a romantic about this type of thing.   But I digress...   I'm simply asking you, America, to take more into consideration this election year. In the 2000 election no one could separate Bush from Al Gore on most of the issues, and it cost the United States dearly.

       Strong, Not Wrong, Marriage   I've made my stance on gay marriage very clear back in  urlLink July.   I'm not about to amend it, much to Damon's chagrin, but recent comments by the self-righteous Right is really starting to irk me.  First, in a CNN story covering Ohio's gay marriage ban, that state's Republican governor had to this to say about marriage:    "Marriage is an essential building block of our society, an institution we must reaffirm."    If it's an essential building block of our society, why deny it to a segment of the population?  Second, in another CNN story covering a gay marriage protest in Massachusetts, the Boston Archbishop Sean P. O'Malley said:    "Good strong marriage and family are good for our country, for society."    Who is to say that homosexual love is any less binding, any less strong? Marriage is on the decline in the heterosexual world; maybe the Archbishop should take on that.  I honestly feel the gay marriage issue is simply being slowed by the less progressive aspects of U.S. society. I would love to see any state, hell, even the United States, put forth an amendment banning gay marriage. In no time there would be lawsuits, and I do not believe any of the amendments would hold up in the court of law because of the inequality inherent in them.  ***  Oh, and just to mention:  Andy Rooney, who must be older than both my grandparents, found Janet Jackson's stunt at the Super Bowl to be far less offensive than Nelly or Kid Rock.  And Prince was such a weak opening for the Grammy's. Honestly, when did he last have a new album to garner any attention? Why did he only sing songs from the '80s?  Janet would have done much better. And Justin's apology during his acceptance was just lame. Thankfully Janet didn't give in to the apology stunt just to be on the award show.

       Closer to Alive   I've been sick since Wednesday morning when I left the bookstore early. I don't know what it was, but the nicer things I can say is that it included a headache, fever and the chills.  The fever fell off rather quickly, though it seems to hit me for a bit in the middle of the night still. I'm usually very much against medications, but I've had Ibuprofin, Immodium and Pepto in my system at some point, most of the time overlapping. So this is my drug binge week.  I thought I'd get some serious writing done this week, but I haven't. I did catch up with almost a month of my life in my journal, and now I'm turning to the blog.  Unfortunately, I have bad news about me. Grad school is getting the axe. It was probably the most painful decision I've made in years, oddly enough. I had so set myself up for moving and continuing on. That started fading with the Uncle Sam payment, rather than refund. Then came a rejection to a job I had applied to online. I've not heard from the others, which, after a week, doesn't shine so well for me. I had 6 applications out, and it seems none of them will do much for me; and I'm still living paycheck to paycheck.  Instead I'll be moving to a most disliked city, New York City, in case you've not kept up with my blog, with Damon, who is much more excited about it than I am. I just know that I have to leave Philly for a time, and depending on where life takes me, maybe forever.  I could certainly settle in London, Athens or Marrakesh, but I'm getting way ahead of myself. NYC is the most affordable place when talking about moving costs, plus I may have a good friend move along.  I'm hoping for better luck in the publishing/media world of NYC, because I've gotten pretty much nothing to go on here in Philly. How sad. Hell, I could probably even find better paying nonprofit work in NYC, which may be my ticket up there, if the NYC AIA is in need of an experienced and able person. I'll have to look into that.  *** The Janet Jackson peep show fallout is getting a little crazy. Pulling her from performing at the Grammy's is just disappointing. The award show is such a different venue, anyone would have to be insane to even attempt such a stunt. Seeing as how Nelly got to grab his crotch the entire time and Kid Rock was wearing a flag poncho (how American), I think less could be made of her falling out.  Hopefully things work out for her. CNN reported on the effects of her peep show in TiVO replay and  urlLink Web site hits and search engine results , where she went from way down on the list to far beyond the No. 2 slot.  Oh, and let's not forget that all of Europe gave a collective yawn while everyone took offense to 1 second of tit on TV; sort of like they're confusion over our up-in-arms shenanigans during the Monica Lewinsky/Bill Clinton scandal.  Did anyone see the previews for the CNN special showing a rising incidence of adultery in marriages? Guess what it happens.  Breasts aren't offensive and I'm more than willing to assert that by age 14, most boys have seen a boob and girls are getting them. Grow up America.  But I digress...  If you want to call it that; I didn't really start out with anything in mind. I've come across a topic or 2 I want to cover, but this is getting long already, plus it'll help me pick up my writing on here.

       Hooray for Boobies   Originally I was not going to join in the growing chorus of complaints about the MTV Half Time Show, but I feel there's an angle being overlooked.  Did anyone else think it sucked? The music would have been OK if the year was 1997. The show would have been better if anyone had actually sung. The show would have been better if Janet had decided to give us a taste of her upcoming CD. The show would have been better if Kid Rock, Nelly and Puff Daddy were absent.  But no, all I hear about is Janet's tit on TV. Hello, I've been waiting to see some more of her body since the  Rolling Stone  cover from 1992, 1993, whenever the hell it was.  I wasn't going to say anything, but then every story I read and every idiot CNN interviewed on the street said she had on a pastie.  IT WAS NOT A PASTIE! Did anyone see her interview with Oprah when her  Velvet Rope  CD came out? It's a piercing. Has anyone seen the photos floating around the Internet? There is oh, so obviously, a pin piercing the nipple, which is holding the sun piece to her tit.  So, OK, the Federal Communications Commission has decided to open an investigation. Into what?  They should look into how and why MTV is billing itself as a music video channel. It's not just that they rarely play music, but they couldn't even put together a show with music from the last 9 months.  But no, the FCC is going to investigate the exposed nipple. Who is to blame, I ask? CBS ran the show, MTV produced it, Justin Timberlake pulled off the bodice cup. What did Janet do? She looked shocked. Have you seen the incident in slow motion?  Now Janet, I'm bout you bout you, but you can't act. You can not convince me the shock on your face was acting. I'm sorry, I won't believe. If, by the grace of whichever god is good, you were acting, I say demand an Emmy, Oscar and a Tony right now.

       Taxing Times   Today started off with no sleep and dreams of a tax refund directly deposited into my checking account in 12 days.  It's now nearly 4 p.m., still not much sleep, and certainly no dreams of tax refunds. Why? Because the government still wants a $331 tax payment from me after the $1,900 already deducted from my paychecks.  Boo-hoo you might say, but I only made $19,000 after taxes and adjustments.  After years of paying down my debts, I'm falling behind again and living paycheck to paycheck. This is going to make my move for graduate school SOO easy.  This will be the first year I've had to pay taxes. I knew that paying Uncle Sam would happen eventually; I just hadn't expected it in one of my worst financial years. I also wouldn't expect to do that in the first tax year following Bush's 2nd tax cut. OK, that last part was sarcastic.  I need to somehow adopt a child and make it legitimate back to last year. (Note to IRS employees: that's sarcastic as well).  What the Bush Administration has managed to do with the support of the people of the United States of America is simply astonishing. Yes, a tax cut that failed to lower the tax rate of the poorest, while the richest are reaping thousands of dollars in savings initiated by the Bush Administration, passed in Congress and signed by the Bush Administration.  Bush would now like to have the tax cuts made permanent, and probably a few new things to boot, all while pouring more money in Iraq, the military and a now ballooning non-fix fix to the senior prescription drug program.  I am beginning to feel the same as the Quaker woman in New Jersey who refused to pay taxes because the money was being spent on programs and policies that conflicted with her religion.  While my religious beliefs are jumbled, my political beliefs are certainly not.  Seeing as how I've not supported the war in Iraq, the Department of Homeland Security, tax breaks for energy companies, the new prescription drug plan, etc. etc., it makes it much harder to pay this sum with no benefit to myself.  Yes, it sounds a little egotistical, but I'm not alone here. My mom will have made less money that I did last year, and she will have to pay taxes as well. All while the house is 3 months behind on rent, etc. etc. etc. I'll refrain from beating this point home with countless actual examples.  Hello IRS, close up those loopholes and let's get some tax relief rather than tax breaks. Let's not put the burden of running the United States on the people who are barely surviving.

       Fueling Controversy   Let me finish my rant on Condi Rice. Not sure if it's even relevant now, seeing as how she will testify publicly now, but...  One of my other problems with the Bush Administration classifying EVERYTHING, and Rice not testifying also because of the possibility that classified material could be brought out into the public, is that the events of Sept. 11, 2001 are going to be 3 years old.  To me, that means a lot can be said without blowing national security or jeopardizing the current war on terror.  I had the above thought yesterday, but Damon was working on music. And when music is being made in this apartment, my mind becomes discombobulated. I require silence. It's partly to blame for my irregular posting.  But now a more current topic.  So the Bush Administration and the Kerry campaign want to make rising gas prices a political issue. Could this be anything less political?  Part of the reason gas prices have gone up is the new, more environmentally friendly additive being added. There's also demand. Demand-supply is not political. There's also the open market style of buying oil. It's economics.  As an environmentalist and public transit user with an interest in urban studies and planning, I am very happy gas prices are going up in today's dollars. It's still dirt cheap compared to gas prices in the United States during the early '80s, when adjusted for inflation. But our gas prices are about the cheapest in the world.  I think higher gas prices are what we need to start breaking this wasteful mentality in the United States. Maybe people will think twice before buying a Hummer or any SUV. Maybe hybrid vehicle sales will skyrocket. Maybe public transit ridership will rise. Oh the positive possibilities.  Unfortunately another maybe could be greater acceptance to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. People don't understand that opening that up to drilling isn't going to cut prices now. It probably wouldn't bring much relief at all, and if it does, we're not talking about next week or this summer.  The extent to which this is political is the energy policy the U.S. Government is putting together. Fortunately key parts, such as drilling in ANWR, have failed every time.  I've said it once, and I'll say it again. What we need is energy conservation. It serves 2 purposes. First, it breaks the so-called hold people say OPEC and the Middle East have over the United States, and second, it's good for the environment. Oh, and it keeps the wallet a little more full for longer.

       Where's the Rice?   So Condeleeza Rice loves to testify, just not in a public forum. She's already given some 4 hours of testimony to the 9/11 Commission. But the public wants to hear what she has to say. The Commission wants the public to hear what she has to say.   But no.   Her reason? The "long-standing principle that sitting National Security Advisers do not testify before the Congress."   It sounds legit, at first. But give it a second thought. No sitting national security adviser has ever testified before Congress. Also, never in the history of the United States have we had a day like Sept. 11, 2001.   I think what happened that day justifies an exception to the long-standing rule she hides behind.   This administration has been claiming since Day One that they have nothing to hide, yet they've been rather "seal-happy." There's the energy task force for starters. Then the Patriot Act, which keeps more government actions away from public scrutiny. Etc., etc.   Rice says she has nothing to hide, butthe pattern has already taken shape.

       Inappropriate Humor   I'm a witty guy. I love comedy. I love un-PC comedy even more. David Chappelle, Chris Rock, Robin Williams; these are the people who make me laugh.   At last night's Radio and Television Correspondents' Association dinner, Bush made an attempt at humor. Let me say it was shock and awe.   Aside from his dry delivery of the jokes, which he didn't seem to get, because he just stared blankly at the crowd, waiting for the laughter to subside so he could drop another funny written by someone else, the topic was insensitive to the max.   His big subject to poke fun at? The missing weapons of mass destruction. He made the nonexistence of these weapons the big joke of the evening and somehow the crowd was just eating it up!   Why am I offended at this? Because the existence of these weapons was the state reason for going invading Iraq. The existence of these weapons was why the United States spent billions of dollars and separated thousands of families. The supposed existence of these weapons is why nearly 600 U.S. servicemen are dead.   The nonexistence of these WMDs is becoming a stumbling block for the Bush Administration and all Bush can do is make jokes about it?   The audacity and insensitivity of some people!

       The Blame Game   I'm at the AIA right now, but not doing much with work. The Dell Workstation, which didn't, is gone. In its place is a P3 Dell from the '90s, which requires more updates then I can possible download and install in a single day.   But all is right in the world.    The Real World  is coming back to Philadelphia, and yet another person from the Bush Administration is criticizing its actions and inactions.   The 9/11 Commission is interviewing people from the Clinton and Bush years, and it seems everyone is giving the same response: We did all we could. Of course there is some blaming being done.   So who is to blame? Somewhere things went wrong. To be fair, the answer isn't so clear cut. It also doesn't help spending every breath attacking everyone's credibility. So rather than getting answers, we can listen to dirt about the other side. And people blame the media for infotainment!   Personally, I saw the White House's retaliation as a sign of fear. Maybe worry is a better word.   I can hardly wait to hear how the report turns out. I hope it's different from the report  on the jail riot from Season 2 of  Oz    More importantly, I have some things on the horizon for me personally. I actually have a lead for an editing job, and I'm working with Damon to get a  urlLink weekend party  started at the Mercury Lounge in Philadelphia.   Such a position drastically changes plans for a move, as does a regular party in Philadelphia, if it's a hit.   What a difference a week makes!   In other news I've been sending off my gay marriage post Congress. I have contacted about half of the Senate. I'll probably end up calling it quits with that. I don't have enough free time to hit up all 465 (or however many there are) members of the House of Representatives. I also did get my point across to my state legislator and governor, so this is activism enough for me right now.

       Unions Against Philadelphia   As a liberal-minded, independent, stand-up-against-big-business kind of guy, you'd think I'm pro-union. Somehow I'm not on at least my 2nd anti-union post.   Maybe "anti-union" isn't the correct word for it. I just think that sometimes they're very short-sighted and hurt both the business and the benefactors of their work.   The most recent example involves MTV's  The Real World  of all things. I'm not a fan of the show -  Road Rules  was always superior  - but it coming to tape in Philadelphia meant a lot for Philadelphia, in terms of publicity and so much more.   Oh, and my friend, who works in the business across the street from where the house was to be, was going to give me free coffee while sitting and complaining about the pretentious cast.   So what if the show wasn't hiring Philadelphia union members to do the construction work. The residual effects the show was capable of bringing to the area would mean far more work.   And it's more than that. If the unions gave a damn about the city, they would understand what bringing the show to Philadelphia says about the city. It says there's something here to be shown. There's some excitement here.   A show like this introduces to a captive audience, life in Philadelphia that you don't see on any other channel.   That captive audience also happens to be the age group that Philadelphia needs to sustain itself as a viable and exciting city.   But don't tell that to the unions. It's not like they really have a reason to complain so much. There's so much construction going on in the city right now, with so much waiting in the wing, such protesting over one house seems a bit unnecessary.   Oh, and to say selfish. How am I going to get my found on TV if Mayor John Street can't salvage the Philly show?

       A   Deadly Sin in the White House   To start things off, I'd like to thanks to everyone who responded to my last post, who shared my last post, who didn't want to read my last post, etc. etc. Again, thank you!  ** Texas Governor George W. Bush was elected president of the United States in 2000 or 2001, your pick. He secured  urlLink 48% of the popular vote . Vice President Al Gore lost the election with 48% of the popular vote.   The difference between the two candidates in the popular vote was 540,000 voters, with Gore the winner. It was the electoral college and U.S. Supreme Court that put Bush into office.   It's now time for election 2004. These past 4 years have offered much opportunity for Bush to secure a better shot in this election. He's blown most every chance given him.   He took us to the war with Iraq, essentially alone, amid worldwide protest and, as is now clearly obvious even to his supporters, for a trumped up reason. Each of his tax cuts focused solely on businesses and the wealthiest citizens. His environmental policies fly in the face of solid science and worldwide policy.   States, counties, cities and towns,  urlLink more than 150 so far , have passed resolutions against the Bush Administration's Patriot Act. The Bill of Rights Defense Committee puts the number at  urlLink 3 states and 258 cities, towns and counties , but I thought I'd first offer a less biased news article before I back my standing with an activist group.   All this, and obviously more, yet the White House refuses to back down on its policies. For a "compassionate conservative" who barely won the election, he's far more divisive than seems prudent.   And I'm not simply talking about pissing off the Democrats and others. His recent announcement of legislation to give illegal immigrants temporary citizenship is pissing off Republican Senators and Representatives in Congress.   His support for a Constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is pissing off the so-called "Log Cabin Republicans," the gays and lesbians who supported him in his first election.   It was also revealed today in  The Philadelphia Inquirer  that the Bush Administration withheld costs for the Medicare overhaul bill to prevent 13 Republican Senators from voting it down; some of them want to take back their votes now. (I'd post a link, but I'm having trouble finding the story on a site with free archives.)   Is his political goal to win the national election by an even slimmer margin than election 2000? Shouldn't an administration that won in the closest election in U.S. history be doing more to reach out rather than close itself off to the voters?   I say the Administration is a little too self-assured, too blinded by its early successes, too arrogant.   Break out your thesaurus and look up arrogance. You'll find pride listed as a synonym.

         Quiet Riot   I had my friend Jigsha look over this, my opus on the protests against and push for gay marriage in the United States. I have heard nothing from any of the newspapers I submitted it to, so this will be my medium.   I call this Quiet Riot because Jigsha's critique, aside from a few corrections, was that I was making this argument, but doing so without being harsh or offensive. I like to think this is my personality.   At the end of my piece I have included the the links necessary to contact your Senators and Representatives in Congress. If you are in agreement with my stance in any way, I ask that you e-mail this peice to them or voice your own concerns. I ask that you be proactive and get this piece, or your own letter to your elected representatives at the state level, because Constitutional amendments can also be passed if enough of the state legislatures approve of it.   ***   All men are created equal. So says the Declaration of Independence, the document that first stated, loud and clear, the existence of the United States of America. The document that followed it, The Constitution, was flawed, and this nation has tried 27 times to improve upon it.   There is now a push for a 28th Amendment to prevent gay marriages. This may be Amendment 28, but it is the first of its kind.   It is the first Amendment to explicitly discriminate against a human being. In this case it discriminates against a human being who is a citizen of the United States of America; people who are eligible to vote; people who pay their taxes; people in pursuit of happiness.   I believe this makes it the first amendment, which can, right now without the position of the Supreme Court, be deemed unconstitutional.   It should also be noted that this Amendment destroys the "separation of Church and State" barrier so much a part of the founding documents of this country. Our Founding Fathers were all Christian, but they understood that in this country there would be non-Christians who must be treated equally.   How does the amendment undo the intentions of our Founding Fathers? The makeup of the gay marriage protesters in San Francisco have been largely Christian; the protesters waving their Bibles high, condemning people to hell. Also present were Muslims. What I have not heard about are atheists or agnostics protesting.   The people protesting say it is an abomination before God. I say to them: your God is not mine. I say to them, my country says you and I are equal.   You have the right to marry the one you love. You have the right to file taxes as a couple; the right to adopt a child as a couple; the right to be with your lover in the hospital; the right to collect your lover's belongings upon passing.   But I/we do not; not without complicated paperwork requiring a lawyer, and even that fails to guarantee me everything you have.   For the first time in U.S. history, a religious doctrine - one espoused by Christianity, Islam and Judaism - will be codified in the founding document of a country that offered a life away from religious persecution.   But this is what the amendment will do: persecute me and others for our beliefs. Christians are doing it, Muslims are doing it, the president of the United States is doing it and so are the elected representatives.   For those against gay marriage, but not so extreme as the religious fanatics condemning me, us, to hell, is the argument that gay marriage will dilute and destroy the very foundation of marriage.   I say you are crazy. Follow the coverage of the gay marriages in San Francisco. What have I read, heard and saw? I read about couples, who have been together for years. For five, 10, 15, 25 years or more. How is such a bond going to destroy marriage? This bond, this relationship, this love should be seen as only validating marriage even more.   I haven't seen, heard or read about 22-year-old gay men getting married in San Francisco. But I have seen, heard and read about Britney Spears getting married in Las Vegas, a marriage that lasted just two days. If anything is being held up as destroying the idea of marriage, it should be this type, which unfortunately is all too common. That and marriage because the couple is pregnant, marriage for green cards, marriage forcibly arranged by parents.   Because the idea of marriage - straight marriage - is held so dearly by the major Western religions, I say that it is unconstitutional for an amendment to the Constitution to codify what religion can and cannot do. Let the Church, the mosque, the synagogue decide who they can and will marry.   This is why, for all intents and purposes of law, marriage should be stricken from government. Let marriage be the term for unions consecrated by a religious leader. Let those who take part in it use the term among friends and family, on wedding invitations, etc. etc.   Let civil union, or some other word, be the term used by government, in the court room, on paperwork, etc. etc.   Let the religious, persecuting extremists have their word. Because that's all it is. At the end of the day I just want to be held up as equal before the law, with rights equal to my peers.   At the end of the day, I say let the religions have their protests and their beliefs, because even though I am not in agreement, this is a free country, and if they can protest, I want to give them something to protest. I do not want to take away or hinder their right.   In closing, President George W. Bush said this of the gay marriage issue:    "After more than two centuries of American jurisprudence and millennia of human experience, a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization."    If it were not for the few "activist judges" where would the antislavery, women’s suffrage or civil rights movements be?

       Dell Computers, It'll Put You in a Pickle   This is probably the fastest turn around I've had for posting something on my blog. It's 7:30 a.m. and I have no idea why I'm up, but I've already had breakfast and I'm watching CNN.   Because Damon is working on his music, the TV is on mute, which means closed captioning is on.   I wonder who does the closed captioning for CNN, because it's never right. Today was no exception. In some discussion about Gateway cutting jobs (now that's what I call job growth, Mr. Bush), the  American Morning  staff started talking about Dell Computers and the competitiveness in the tech sector.   The closed captioning typist, either by mistake, or the person shares my feelings about Dell, transcribed it as Dill.   Something like this could never get by me, as anyone who's read my blog knows. It's not even that I'm a Mac head, but the Dill Computer at my AIA Philadelphia desk should be hurled from the top of the water tower on the roof of the 24-story office building I work in.   But only if the eternally broken elevators (they've been modernizing them for at least 2 years) could get me and the Dill to the 24th floor.    I bet when the Dill hit the ground, it'd make that crunch sound trademark of Vlassic.   I always laugh openly when Dill claim to get an "A" for customer support. AIA Philadelphia purchased "fast pass"-like response for tech support on our Dill, and I still spent 1.5 hours on hold when the black box from hell refused to load Windows. I thought it had something to do with the Dill, only 2 years old, sounding like a space shuttle launching when I start it up.   I finally gave up, then played e-mail tag for a week. It still sounds like Discovery at lift-off, but it loads "secure" Windows when I need to download a new security hole patch each week.   So remember, when you buy a Dell, that lemon will surely put you in a pickle when you don't want it.

       Primary. What Primary?   Today was the first time since I registered 2 year ago that I did not vote. I honestly heard little about it, until this morning. A quick glance at what this primary was about and I decided against voting at all. There wasn't much of a contest on the Democratic side.   The big race here is for a Republican Senator. If only I could be Republican for a day! It was incumbent Arlen Specter, a moderate with support from Bush, vs. Pat Toomey, a super conservative with support from no one who means anything to me. Not that Bush does either, but the last thing this state needs is 2 super conservative senators. Who's the other? In case you didn't know, it's Rick Santorum.  While I was a work today, the voting issue came up. I hadn't said but a few words to my boss before this lady starts nodding her head in agreement and joins the conversation. She wanted to be a Republican for a day, too, just to vote down Pat Toomey.  First vote down Toomey, then Bush, she said. As I'm typing this the votes are beginning and with just 3 of 9,416 precincts reporting, Specter has the early lead with 10 percentage points. I bigger margin would have been nice for the start, but we'll see where this goes.  The lady who jumped into conversation at work has taken up a dirty cause. She feared for my generation's job outlook. Had this not been an election year, the whole outsourcing issue probably would have never gotten further that Lou Dobbs on CNN. Hell, he might not have been able to make a case of it.  While it adversely affects me, I expect such. Plus, it's not like outsourcing is something new. The American economy has done a spectacular job of creating new jobs and new types of jobs. Taking a protectionist stance does nothing for us as a nation. Plus, it was the protectionist stance that worsened the Great Depression.  The lady also was "woe is me" over my inactive generation. I think that my generation is improving. Not long ago, B.B. (before Bush), I didn't care who was what on which issue. That has certainly changed in the A.B. years, and I think that for as much as I dislike Bush, his positions, his use of the English language and his attitude, he certainly has done a great job of rallying his voter base (i.e. the crazy Christian conservatives), the opposition (i.e. the crazy, "all other religious options" liberals), including the others (i.e. sane, rational moderates).  As I'm wrapping this up, with 33 of 9,416 precincts reporting, the margin has widened by 2 percentage points, but the percent of reporting precincts has yet to break 1.  God, let this primary be a sign that Pennsylvania (OK, just the portions west of Philadelphia) has come to its senses. It looks like I'll be here another year, and I need to have hope in my home state of 24 years.

       Eskew Not Eschewing Views Askew   As a member of blogger, I was invited to GMail. I've heard the concerns, and I mostly think they're bogus. I'll never need 1GB, even with all the junk mail I get. Plus, my e-mail conversations rarely amount to anything so groundbreaking or illegal. I hardly use my  e-mail anyway, so this won't get much use. I had 5 or 6 e-mail addresses at one point, but now they only exist for the Web space that comes with them.  My favorite feature is Quick Keys. It might not seem so amazing, but to have quick keys built into a Web-based e-mail program is the coolest thing about GMail. Oh that AT&T Worldnet offered that. *** On the copy desk, one of the most common things noted were people's names and their jobs. For example, maybe a bomb squad member's initials are TNT. Notable examples exist in politics, but I can think of none that received more coverage than former President Richard M. Nixon's aide Robert L. Ehrlichman. Why such coverage? Because Ehrlichman was involved with Watergate and in his last name is the German word for "honesty," "ehrlich."  Oops.  Today, I was watching Tucker Eskew get interviewed on CNN. Have you seen those word games where you have a word and with 1 letter change each step, you must transform that word into another. For example:    meal seal sean seen    Usually the first and last word are somehow connected. In just one move, Tucker Eskew, Deputy Assistant to the President [George W. Bush] for Communications, becomes Tucker Askew.    askew adj : turned or twisted toward one side    Things that make you go, hmm.

       Selling Out for Cinnamon Rolls   I can't remember the last time I was so worked up about an ad campaign like I am with the Holiday Inn Express Cinnamon Roll commercials.  I've only seen them run during CNN's "American Morning," though because I watch that news show religiously, I couldn't say if it runs anywhere else or not.  So Holiday Inn Express has launched this ad campaign focusing solely on the cinnamon rolls available at breakfast. I don't know anything about the rooms, rates, number of Inns or anything else.  But I want to stay at a Holiday Inn Express for the free breakfast cinnamon roll. I was in one once for a little while, but I really can't go into that. And this was before the cinnamon roll.  This is how much I love the commercials. The other day, after it seemed the ad campaign was playing less frequently, I visited the Web site in hopes of viewing them endlessly online.  It wasn't to be so.  In an effort to rectify the situation, I wrote an e-mail to Holiday Inn Express:   I truly love your Cinnamon roll commercials. you should really put them online, as they aren't played enough on CNN American Morning to satisfy my funny bone. After all of the crappy ads out there, I look forward to cinnamon roll ads.    I felt a little dorky sending it, but how could I resist. These ads made me want to stay at the Holiday Inn, regardless of any rats, high rates or inept check-in clerks. To my surprise I got a response!    Thank you for taking the time to contact us.  We are happy to hear your comments about the Cinnamon Roll commercials.  I have forwarded your comment to our marketing department to let them know how you feel about the ads.  If you need further assistance, please feel free to contact us.  Best Regards,  Xxxx Xxx Internet Response Team     The response from the marketing department was not so stellar as the Internet Response Team:    Dear Brian Swope It is always a pleasure to hear enthusiasm from our guests, and we want to thank you for your feedback on our commercials. We are very proud of the commercials, and feel that they truly represent our personality. Stay Tuned! Holiday Inn Express Marketing    Yawn.  To continue my surprise, the morning after all of this, I saw 2 of the ads played during the hour I was watching TV. Yes, the news can be depressing, but God, those commercials just do me right. It doesn't hurt that CNN "American Morning" has such a great crew. I am all about Soledad O'Brien. Yeah, she's hot. She's funny. And the whole crew meshes well. Plus, they're "The Most Trusted Name in News."  I'm done my plug kick. CNN, you can reach me at ... I'll be staying at the Holiday Inn Express on ... Let's do the job interview after breakfast.

       Me and LaRouche   Don't know who LaRouche is? I don't really know him either. I do know he is endlessly running for the U.S. presidency on a platform of conspiracy theories and that he doesn't get interviewed, nor do his fanatic street team members.  It used to be that the LaRouche fanatics would set up their table at a high-traffic spot on the sidewalk. Recently, they've stepped up their measures to spread the insanity.  In just the past week I've had three encounters with the "LaRouchies," and each was more unpleasant than the one before..  It started off with one of the "LaRouchies" leaving behind a flyer and brochure at the AIA bookstore. If they wanted to hand it to me or an employee, that's fine. But don't leave it at the door where we keep architecture & design related postings. Don't cover up the Chapter newsletter and flyers on a book signing next month.  As soon as I saw the flyers, I quit helping a customer at the register, so I could pull them from sight ASAP.  Not many days after, a "LaRouchie" was passing out more brochures, but this time it was at Broad & Girard. I don't know what possessed this kid to do such. The only other people on the block are hacks, and I'm not talking about that lame Philadelphia-based TV show hacks.  As I passed the "LaRouchie" to cross the street and head to work, he approached me with his brochure of theories. I, with my iPod, politely said, "No, thank you." He apparently didn't hear, because he still held out the brochure, and well above where I would reach out and grab it with my hand. No, this brochure was being held out to be somewhere around my upper chest and neck area.  Later that day, during rush hour, downtown traffic came the "LaRouche-mobile." With a bumper sticker claiming him to be "The Real Democrat," the "LaRouchies" in their minivan wasted gas and clogged traffic to drive up and down the streets with speakers blaring the voice of LaRouche stating his theories.  A lot of this is to be expected from candidates in an election year, but it's only April! He's campaigning in Pennsylvania, but no one can vote for him because 3rd party candidates don't get in the primaries. At least John Kerry can be voted for come whatever day the primaries are here.  Isn't it a bit early for the insanity? Yes, I know the same can be said of the Democrats and Republicans, but there's a chance with those candidates. Hell, Ralph Nader has a better shot than LaRouche. Can we lessen the insanity? Please, LaRouche?

       A Nice Ending to a Hell of a Week   It's Saturday night and the weekend couldn't have come quick enough. But now that it's here, I'm reveling in it.  Went out with the boyfriend today to take in some rays (I'm less pale now); take in the sights and smells of Philadelphia and head to University City (God, the UPenn brats) to see "Kill Bill, Vol. 2" at the Bridge.  Yes, that uptight movie theater that ruined my "Matrix Reloaded" viewing. I shouldn't blame it all on the theater, the movie was lacking.  But this time around, the experience was better. It helped that I had a Lee's Hoagie chicken wrap prior to entering.  This week I also paid taxes. Why couldn't the certainty of death come first? This is the first year I've had to pay taxes, which is strange because apparently we've had 3 tax cuts since President George W. Bush took office. I wonder why it hasn't affected my taxes yet?  Why am I complaining about paying taxes? Because I'm living paycheck to paycheck. Because I don't have health care. Because I can't find a job in my field. Because I don't want my money sending another  urlLink cappuccino machine  to Iraq.  I also got yelled a lot this week and last week at work. I was coming in late 5, maybe 10 minutes late. The one boss was getting catty about it, and in the end I did get written up, which hasn't deterred me from changing my ways.   Maybe I deserved it all, I don't know. I used to be late regularly for weeks on end. These past two weeks were anomalies, as I've not been late since early fall 2003 when my newspaper job ended.  The bosses do know about my renewed job hunt and the few rewards it's starting to show, so I think that plays into their change, which is why I'm ignoring it all. I don't want to leave there on a bad note.  So yes, I am going to clean up my act, but I'm expecting something in return, dammit!  I'm going to stop this post now, as it's still very beautiful out, and who the hell is inside reading this anyway?

       Easter Passions   How did I spend my Easter? I watched part of a bootleg copy of "The Passion" and indulged in Cadbury creme eggs.  I've been meaning to watch the movie, but with varying degrees of interest. I've now decided to wait until it hits video. Larger-than-life lashings really don't do it for me. I'm a hedonist to the end.  I did watch enough the of the movie to question the anti-Semitism people are complaining about. If there is anything to complain about, I'd say let's attack the selectivity of the facts. Though that really doesn't stick in the face of artistic license.  My understanding of the truth is that Jesus had to die to fulfill the prophecy and truly become the Messiah. I don't think Christianity would have taken off without the crucifixion, ascension and reappearing to the Disciples.  So the Jews wanted Jesus put to death. Doesn't that fit perfectly with what was expected to happen?  Didn't God harden the heart of Pharaoh while Moses tried to free the Jews? Didn't this put them through more suffering? Isn't is possible that God hardened the hearts of the Jews so Jesus could return to God's side?  Someone, something had to be responsible for the death of Jesus. Maybe it was God's plan that was so inhumane. Maybe it was the Romans, who so obviously enjoyed whipping the flesh from Jesus' back. Maybe it was the Jews who chose Barrabas to be freed, over Jesus.  It seems that if none of the aforementioned groups had performed the acts they did, Christianity wouldn't be here today.  Things that make you go, hmmm.

       Making the Presidential Administration   Damon is watching MTV's "Making the Band," featuring one of my least favorite people in the world, Puff Daddy. Or is it P. Diddy? I prefer nobody.  Never have I seen a less functional group of people, going through so much drama to still be nobodies at the end of the show. I honestly think the only reason people actually show up to the mall appearances and wherever else the "band" "performs" is because the MTV cameras are there.  Oh my God and are these people ugly! Christ, the ego!   But it's given me an idea. Maybe we should put the next presidential administration together in much the same way.  It's not completely unheard of. When the United States first started out, it was always the loser presidential nominee who took the vice president's job. How's that for putting incompatible people together to accomplish something?  Imagine Al Gore as the vice president now. You can't get drama near that on "Apprentice" or "Real World 37."  Maybe we could get people excited about politics and government again. And AT&T Wireless can do text message voting. It seems nearly fraud proof and far less scandalous than the botched, GOP-headed Florida election fiasco.  *** Disclaimer: This is a very jumbled post. Every time I type another sentence dealing with my political take, I have another issue with the episode, which forces me to quit my train of thought and back up 4 paragraphs to add another gripe. ***

       Mac 'n' Cheese 'n' Gas   ** Before going into my personal life this week, I have to comment on something I  happened upon this week while promoting for a party I'm doing with Damon. Side note:  urlLink  Spice on Friday nights and Sugar on Saturday nights.   I went to the Mean Bean to see about dropping off some flyers, and on the counter there sits a tip jar. The sign attached to it reads: Funds for Counter Inteligence [sic]. It was an attempt at humor with the FBI and CIA. I need to give the people behind the counter a tip on spelling.  Also, I just read this story on CNN, which, to me, takes a slap at the recent Bush ad regarding Kerry, taxes and gas prices.   urlLink Ford's CEO has said he would support a 50-cent gas tax , even during these trying times of "high" gas prices. The purpose:  to push consumers to take up fuel-efficient vehicles. Now the Bush ads attack John Kerry for his proposal for a 50-cent gas tax, saying that's all wrong. Hmm, maybe Bush has it wrong, unless we're talking about the viewpoint of the energy industry, which the Bush Administration is so involved in. ** My very good friend Jigsha made a brief return to Philadelphia. It was brief only because most of it was spent with her family. I'm not complaining about that. Her return was marked with a major Temple News reunion.  We're talking about about 3 years worth of staff taking up what we have always done best: drinking. It's practically a requirement to be employed by the  Temple News .  This was the first major gathering since Tanitha passed away nearly a year ago.  We went from the Nodding Head - excellent food, but I couldn't say anything about the beer, as I ordered Grog, the house brew, 3 times to no avail - to McGlinchy's - Mac 'n' Cheese, or so Jigsha thought - the epitome of a "dive bar" and then to the Pen and Pencil, an after hours journalist hang out.   Most of us only went until the end of McGlinchy's, but 3 shifts of TN staffers lasted nearly 12 hours. Now that's a party!  What I enjoyed the most was the return to journalistic debate. Very little of the discussion focused on the past, it was all now and later.  As usual, all the good-byes turned to discussions of doing this more often. Not sure where that will go. This reunion was long overdue. Over the past few weeks I've had random sightings of Neal, Michael and Caitlin, but we probably had 20 former TN staffers at Tuesday's event.  We're an odd lot of people. All varying degrees of success in the field. It was a time of transition for the paper. But now, things are looking up for the current staff. Our adviser recently sent out an e-mail, bragging like a proud father, of the internships and job offerings coming to the current staff.  Meanwhile, the job hunt goes on for me...

       My Worst Move Yet   So I moved. It took 10 hours to move Damon and I. It could have  been less, but the U-Haul truck I got was smaller than expected. Then there was the killer headache I had, which took me out of the action for about an hour. I really thought I was going to puke out nothing the whole time.  Was it postpartum depression? I don't know. Maybe it was the small dinner the night before and no breakfast on moving day?  But it's done. I'm at work, Damon's doing some unpacking that we didn't get done yesterday. Tonight is our party and tomorrow will be rearranging, and then the party again.  Then Sunday. My day of rest. Then Monday, another day of rest. Then Tuesday, back to the bookstore.  When Damon and I finally closed the door on Apt. 916, it looked nothing like how Monica's and Chandler's when they moved out of their apartment. We left a lot behind because we didn't want it, because we couldn't take it, because there was a dust Tyrannosaurus Rex guarding it.  I feel bad about leaving it the shape I did, but the building has just been impossible to deal with. The freight elevator was down, so we were loading up passenger elevators with our wares, much to the chagrin of every other tenant in the building.  But, it's done. I've got some pictures to put on my photojournal soon. I won't have DSL for about 8 days, so Verizon says. Until then, it's text posts while at work.  More later!

       Postpartum Depression   I move on Thursday, after 3 years at Apartment 916. No more view of West Philadelphia, the thunderstorms rolling in or every firework show 10 miles west of my place.  It'll be hard, but I'm certainly about done with this place. The situation has gotten so bad at my building, the Philadelphia Regency, that they're offering $100 to any current tenant who refers someone who actually signs a lease.  Verizon has yet to shut off my phone, even though the shut-off date was Monday.   After canceling my cable service for June 1, I got a bill for June service. In case anyone is wondering, it's Viking Cable, and I'd certainly watch out with them.  I have a feeling the company resells Direct TV, as Direct TV commercials litter every station - "for the latest in sports, check station 218"; I only get 50 channels. Also, the storm rolling in is making TNT stutter.  I have nothing in boxes, nothing unplugged, nothing even sorted for trash and Salvation Army donations.  This week is going to be insane because of the move, work and the party at the Mercury Lounge. But this is how I work.  But enough about me. I've been rather personal on here of late, and I need to rein myself in. *** What's been happening of late outside of my life?  The prisoner abuse scandal in Iraq is getting out hand. So out of hand that President George W. Bush has been forced to get his speechwriters and Cabinet together to get everyone on the same page. It was the usual "blameless, emotionless, apology-less" speech we've come to expect from our compassionate conservative president.  I invite you to read a previous post on the  urlLink Bush Administration's ego .  "American Morning" was a riot early Tuesday. The question of the day was something along the lines of "what would you like to hear the President say during his speech tonight." The Top 2 overwhelming responses: "I resign" and "I'm not running in 2004." Oh, if only. After reading the above post, this little bit is just all the more interesting.  Whether you think the speech was banter, a good start or right on target, a lot of people didn't see it because the broadcast networks didn't carry the speech. Could it be because the (right, left or unbiased) media didn't want to (hurt, help or uncover) President Bush?  I don't have an answer to it; I just think it was wrong. Whether I like or dislike the president, it doesn't matter. If the president is giving a speech to the general citizenry, the broadcast networks need to be there covering it. God knows news is all over the scandal.  Front-page news for the print media usually translates into coverage by every media outlet. *** I am imploring people to visit the  urlLink Free Press activists' Web site . The group has started a petition, which, I'm not sure when it started, but the sign up in Pennsylvania is pretty despicable.  The petition is pushing for FCC Chairman Michael Powell to attend the public hearings being held on the topic of media consolidation, something he supports. It's no surprise that he makes it to all of the broadcast media's "pat on the back" and "look at us" galas, but can't make it out to hear the public's thoughts on the FCC's positions.  With the recent slip up by the broadcast media and the push for less media regulation, I'd say getting the FCC chairman to hear the public's view is ranks pretty high.

       One Year Later, Part 2   This time last year I met Damon. We had talked and done the online thing for a few months. The reason for the delay? Those damn nearly full-time jobs.  But anyway. We met on this night last year. It's our accepted anniversary because neither of us remember when the actual question was popped, and the picture he took of me on our first meeting has the date stamped on the file.  Isn't this all very romantic? I'm not exactly that type, as you can tell. I'm not trying to put anything down. This marks my longest and most serious relationship to date.  Part of the conversation I had with myself about Tanitha's death included its affects on the relationships I have. Could this, my most serious relationship have come about because of her?    *** This week my posts may be discombobulated as I'm moving on Thursday as not much of the process has begun.  Supposedly comments have been turned on, but I don't know if they're working. Maybe this damn template doesn't work with the feature. Wouldn't that be my luck! I'm always looking for responses of some sort.

       One Year Later   It was one year ago today that my friend  urlLink Tanitha  passed away.  I made promises to myself; some which have been kept, others broken.  Since that time I've opened up more. My circle of friends has expanded by 1 or 2, to some sucess. I feel stretched by it all, but I'm making due. Prior to my expanded social circle, including a dj boyfriend and his party, I had myself, Jenn and Chris. No one else.  Also on this sad anniversary, I interviewed for an architectural writer position with a Philadelphia-based architectural firm. It's not news work, but it's both of my interests combined. Oh, and because it's corporate work, it pays better.  Today also marks my last free day for the next week or so. I have  urlLink Sugar & Spice  this weekend, cleaning up at our new home to prepare for our move on Thursday, Sugar & Spice again next weekend and settling into the new place.  This move has also made me rather nostalgic. Probably the next 2  urlLink Photojournals  will feature the sights I see everyday on walk to and from work.  I can only imagine how I'll react when it's time for me to leave Philly. It's a lot to leave behind.  Look at me going off topic.  Somehow I can't seem to write that much regarding Tanitha. Maybe it's more fitting. I've certainly remembered, but anything I'm feeling, I'm not communicating well. I can't even get a decent addition to my journal today.  So I guess I'll leave it at that.  Good night.

       Pop Culture Minutes   Dell has been taking the brunt of my PC anger for quite sometime now. It shouldn't be surprising, what with their inferior product and annoying ad campaigns.  And another one landed on TV this week.  It features 2 college roommates, each working on their term paper. The first man, who is working on a Dell computer, saves his term paper as the sun comes up. The second man's computer crashes as he is saving his term paper.  Cut forward 5 years and the man whose computer crashed is cleaning the windows of the skyscraper where the first man is working at an apparently good desk job.  The moral? If only the window washer had bought a Dell all those year ago.  When was the last time your PC hardware died, preventing you from completing your term paper, essay, book, financial reports, etc. etc.? I bet never.  But when was the last time your Windows operating system put you in a pickle? The Dell ad is actually incriminating Windows; the hardware has nothing to do with it.  Regardless of whether your computer is a Dell, Gateway for Compaq (I'm leaving out IBM because they make the new G5 PowerPC processors for Apple), it's all Windows OS, which is what crashes and leaves you open to hackers, viruses, worms, etc. etc.  Oh, and to add my experience to it: The Dell hardware will someday leave you in bind while you're on the job. Actually, it's not just a bind, it'll die on you and prevent you from getting your job done for the whole day. The problem will get "fixed" only to do it regularly every 2 months.  And to make the experience all the more pleasant, try wasting an hour with Dell Technical Support. The first time the Dell at my job died, I was on hold for an hour. And that was after using our "Customer Preferred" number, or whatever it's called that is supposed to get you expedited service.  Dell, drop your bad ad agency. And stop taking credit for that which you have no control over. *** My second golden nugget for today is an indictment of my favorite news channel, CNN. Well, to clarify, I live for "American Morning" and not much else. Last evening as the channel surfing was underway, I noticed that Anderson Cooper's "360" show was brought to you by Bud Light.   This was the second time I saw this. The first time I caught it only in passing, and I had hoped it was just for the one news segment. You know, like how Delta and Coca-Cola brings you the weather each morning on CNN.  Why does a news segment require a sponsor? This isn't a sports game. Isn't this a little too similar to integrity questions that come up with NBC being owned by a global conglomerate, with ABC being owned by Disney... The list goes on.  CNN, drop the sponsorship from you show. Enough with stuffing as many ads into the shows, how about less repeating of stories or less commentary?

       My Thoughts Through the Lens   I've started using my digital camera for more than just the occasional gathering of friends and Web design for  urlLink Clean Recordings . Maybe some of it is my growing political bias, some my love of my new camera, and some just because.  So I guess along with this blog, I'm starting a  urlLink photojournal  of some kind. This is way out of my league, so we'll see how long this lasts. I should have taken a photojournalism class or two. It's just Version 1.0 for now, but it'll change about as regularly as I post to my blog.  This also means some new design ideas for me. Flash will be making an appearance on my site, which, as I get better at it, will allow a complete redesign of the site for the record label.  Again, I should have taken more Web design classes.  This seems to be some kind of an escape for me. Two years out of Temple University and I'm still in a dead-end retail job. Thankfully, it's a bearable one, but it's wearing on me nonetheless.  My writing, designing and promoting all use skills and know-how I picked up at Temple, so even though I'm not in a journalism job, I'm doing some kind of journalism work. This is why it's practically become a 2nd job for me.  Now to make it work so the AIA job can slowly slip away.

       Yes, I Am 21, Now Let Me Enjoy the Liquor Sites   The extent of my work for  urlLink Sugar & Spice  has been relegated to finding sponsors to help pay for flyers and allow us to offer drink specials.  As I'm going through these sites, I find they use Flash in ways that would induce vomiting in anyone drinking the advertised beverage.  The other thing I notice is the bogus attempt at keeping out minors who want to view these crazy Flash movies and get dizzy, a feeling similar to drunkeness.  Enter your date of birth to enter. Uh, let's see. It says I need to be 21 years of age to view this site...I'm 16 and born on Feb. 29, 1988. Damn, I can't get in. How do I make myself 21...[twiddling thumbs]. Oh, yeah, I'll lie about it.  [Moon blots out the Sun]  The above story is totally fictitious, as I'm 24, going on 25. Though my first incidence of drunkenness occurred 6 months before my 16th birthday.  Seriously, I don't understand why our country attempts to shield teenagers and young adults from alcohol. I can honestly say that my drinking in college was at times heavy, but rarely was i so out of control. And why? Because I had some exposure to it. I'd already been drunk; I already understood what it did to my body; and I already knew when it was time to cut myself off.   Rarely did drinking interfere with my school work, and when I wanted to let loose, I did when I knew the next day offered time for recovery. On only one occasion did things get out of a hand, and that had less to do with alcohol and more to do with tension and aggression between roommates; we did have 6 of us.  Too many people have their first experience with drinking during their freshman year, and oh, what a disaster that can be. If alcohol ads can make it onto TV screens everywhere, how can a Web site, which can be so much more informational, require a minimum age?  How has American gotten to be so backwards? Where is the progress?

       Blogger's Gone Bubbl-y   So I sign on to Blogger today after a few days away, and what the hell! It's all bubbl-y, and different in other ways. A profile? Stats? I feel like I moved to the pay version of this site. If only!  I'm not sure how integrated with Google Blogger is, but I wonder if this major update is something to beef up value as the larger company prepares to sell itself on Wall Street. While on that thought, I think that as a regular blogger, I should be entitled to part of this company already.  Do you hear that, Mr. CEO(s)? How much is maybe 10 shares going to really cost the company? *** Where have I been through the recent media storm giving me and everyone else plenty to say? I've been slaving away for  urlLink Sugar & Spice , the party I do with my boyfriend, Damon Burns.   The link takes you to some spiffy new pages, which were easy to do, but I've been cranking out flyer designs a, b & c, print ads and Web ads like there's no tomorrow.  Why do I call this slave labor, when I enjoy it all, and it's the closest thing to a media job that I have right now? Because it's paying me diddly squat and Damon diddly squat until we can pack the Mercury Lounge. So stop on by! Until then, my pay is all-I-can-drink, which might eventually bankrupt this Lounge. I hope not.  So why else have I been quiet through the media storm? Because I don't think Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld needs fired. If the orders to abuse the prisoners came from him, then yes, fire him. But that's not what I've been hearing, and I seriously doubt I'll ever here that.  Also, Bush's ratings are dropping. This is a Godsend, without the creepy clone gone wrong.  So I'll be back to posting on whatever I fancy, but until then, I need to add some sponsorship logos and get this Web splash sent off for someone to post!

       Wedding Bells for a Southern Belle   I watched the final episode of "Friends" tonight. It was probably the first time I watched the show in 2 years. It lost my interest way back, but I can't say why. I had a big falling out with TV after "Seinfeld," "X-Files" and "Futurama" disappeared. Plus, my work week at the time didn't allow for much prime time TV.  Was the ending heartfelt? Yeah, some. Did I guess Chandler's remarks before he said them? Yes. Did I guess Rachel left a message and got off the plane before she did it? Yes. So it ended. Nothing earth shattering. The only thing that irked me was the ad for "Fraser" while the credits were rolling. I wanted to see the final bow. Oh, plus I never cared for "Fraser."  But, as you can tell, none of this has anything to do with the title to my post tonight.  My very good friend April Navy is now engaged to be married to her boyfriend Adam Berry. Now as I'm writing this I see they will have the same initials. I  have yet to meet this charming young man who swept April off her feet, but that should change. I need a vacation this summer. Adam needs to finally see Philadelphia, and they have a house now, so they can host a friend for a few days.  I'm not being presumptive, the offer has already been made.  So congratulations to April and her fiance, Adam. I had more information on the plans, but I seem to have deleted that voicemail. I haven't had a chance to call and deliver my congratulations in person, but we've done the text & voicemail message thing a few times.  I'm actually off all day tomorrow - I work Saturday instead - so she'll get a harassing phone call from me for sure. Oh, days off. I love them.

       Filling the Void   Where have I been? I've been keeping entirely too busy for my own good. I honestly don't know how I worked 65 to 70 hour weeks this time last year. Burn out sucks.  Part of the reason for this burnout is the party I'm throwing with Damon at the  urlLink Mercury Lounge . I'm making an attempt at doing much of the footwork (i.e. flyers, ads, press contact) needed to get the party going, and it's not going successfully.  It seems Philly's gay men aren't about leaving the gayborhood or the same tired dj at the same tired Shampoo. It seems the latest repetitious Britney Spears remix is bigger in Philly than something more soulful, more original and full of talent.  I know the bartenders at Mercury Lounge are thankful each week for something new and decent to listen to. Damon's also received far more compliments on his djing and music selection than not.  So here I am talking up House music like I'm a clubber. Ha! Not the case, but when I do go out, give me something I can get into. Actually, these past 2 months I've taken more to rock than I have in a long time.   A few weeks ago I had a 3-hour Led Zeppelin session; I bought the Jet album from the iTunes Music Store (pretty good, but nothing spectacular: the ending is too soft compared to the rocking beginning) and some nice people shared their Maroon 5 and 2 White Stripes albums via a P2P network.  I'm very much about the last 3 CDs. I listen to them regularly while taking my 25 minute walk to work each day. I've always been intrigued by the White Stripes duo: I've seen them perform at the MTV Music Video Awards and on Conan O'Brien, but it wasn't until the video for "Seven Nation Army" last week that I took the plunge.   I always pick up on these things too late, but the last time I really listened to the radio was years ago, and why waste my time with MTV when I have TNT for "Law & Order," Comedy Central for "Futurama," and a plethora of other channels for history, science and space. Oh, and my guiltiest of pleasures: E! Entertainment.  How's the for a little bit of insight into my life? Such an abrupt ending I know, but back to slave labor for the weekend party.

       Less News Headlines Today, More Celebration   June 30. It was to be the day Iraq regained sovereignty. But, the Bush Administration has apparently cleared up the day so my friend Devalina won't have to share her birthday with puppet regimes and false hopes for an entire nation. Now she just has to share it with the Cassini-Huygens satellite entering orbit around Saturn. Oh, and that little movie  Spiderman 2 .   urlLink NASA  (Nasa, if you're in Britain), has a great site dedicated to the Saturn mission, 7 years in the making. I visited the Flash version, which I highly recommend. My only disappointment was the elementary nature of the information provided, but seeing as how a disturbingly high number of Americans think Saddam Hussein was involved with the Sept. 11 terrorists attacks or that weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq, we need to start simple with the American citizenry.  For proof of my Iraq & WMD claims, I point you to a Knight Ridder article from  urlLink April 22 . The numbers have improved, but until less than 5% of the public stops taking President George W. Bush's assertions as fact, I won't be happy.  But let's not let this get discussion get mired in politics.  Behind Iraq and the military, NASA has managed to seriously increase its profile over the past year. Have they made space interesting again?  First it was the Mars rovers. Then it was  urlLink Save Hubble!  Now it's Saturn. Within a year, the shuttles will launch again to continue piecing together that already doomed International Space Station, thanks to President Bush's new space vision.  Of course the ISS isn't going to last forever, but it is a stepping stone to a Moon base. Why just write it off? Why work towards canning it after so much has been put into it? Hell, the space station is far better for studying what astronauts will have to go through to get to Mars, which is the 2nd phase of Bush's mission.  Astronauts traveling to Mars will be living with no gravity for the duration of the trip. The space station provides zero gravity living. The Moon doesn't do that; it's gravity is about 1/6 that of Earth's.  Of course, none of this matters right now. As I'm writing this, Cassini is closing in on Saturn's rings, soon to actually pass through them and beginning a several year mission around the only planet in our solar system that could actually float in a lake, if there were a lake so big.  The 2 headline missions for NASA right now are both unmanned, and many an unmanned mission will continue before a human passes beyond the Moon's orbit.  In the meantime, I look forward to something far more academic on Saturn coming from NASA.  And to Devalina: Salgirah Mubarak, or Happy Birthday in Urdu, the language of Pakistan.

       Happy Birthday to Me   I turn a quarter-century on June 27. I can hardly believe it at times. At others, I feel older than that.  This birthday is extra special because Marlboro sent me a free lighter. It showed up in the mail today. The lighter is far cooler than the cheap Zippo they gave me when I first signed up with the company one drunken night at Shampoo. I think I also got a pack of cigarettes for free, which I quickly passed on to a friend who had gotten his own pack for free for doing the same thing.  I figured that night that I'd sign up for it so I can be a loss for the company for as long as they send me stuff. How noble of me, right?  I also started getting a weeklong free subscription to  The New York Post  today. All I had to do was answer 3 questions about the Yellow Pages to get it.   First question: "Do you have a copy of the Yellow Pages at my house?"  Yes.   Second question: "How often do you use the Yellow Pages?"  Less than twice a month.   Third question: "How often do you purchase a service or product through a Yellow Pages listing?"  Never.   This is the 21st Century, right?  The Yellow Pages reads like one of those "decide your fate" fiction books, jumping from one heading to another because, even though the Yellow Pages knows you're going to look up the listing under Heading A1, they see fit to list your needs under Heading G5.  It's much easier just calling Directory Assistance, for those with spare change, or using Yellow Pages online, for those without spare change.  Well seeing as how this is the late afternoon before my birthday, I have other things to do.  As you can see, the blog has undergone some significant cosmetic changes, and people can now leave comments!  I really don't know how the comments work, what with me not getting any yet, but I promise not to edit them, if I even can. I also won't delete any comments that express views not my own. I will, however, delete ignorant rants and tirades.

       The Importance of Impotence   Impotence. It happens. I tend to think it plays an important role in keeping the gene pool from muddying up. I guess the same could be said of homosexuality.  Why am I bringing up this topic? Because I'm sick of the Viagra commercial. I'm sick of it for 2 reasons.  1. Why are they using that Queen song? Freddy Mercury must be going all epileptic in his grave.  2. Where did they find the cast for the commercial? The cast perfectly fits my thoughts on the importance of impotence. And more importantly, don't they have anything better to do besides run and jump up and down the street? Shouldn't these people be in the bedroom?  My complaint with impotence drugs doesn't end there. There's Cialis, with a list of side effects that complicate sex, such as a headache, upset stomach and back pains.  Let's not forget the eternal erection, which requires medical attention.  I understand these side effects don't happen in everyone, but any drug with a list of side-effects longer than the list of good things it does is pretty much a waste in my eyes.  Oh, Enzyte, the cheesiest of the impotence drugs. Natural male enhancement? How exactly is it natural if it's enhancement? Isn't that an oxymoron?  I meant to go on and on and on about these commercial ages ago. But the newer "7th dose free" campaign is too much.  I don't understand how impotence, menstrual cycle and diarrhea ads make it on the air. I find them more awkward than anything else out there. I'll take breast-baring Janet and the f-word over these commercials any day.  Of course, I wouldn't have to deal with any of these ads, except that my TV viewing somehow fits the target audience for them. CNN's  American Morning  and  Law & Order  be damned.

       "Be Label Conscious This Summer"   "Or an Ode to Michael Myers" is probably an apt subtitle for this post.  I saw the title of this post on a billboard ad for Heineken I passed this afternoon on a walk in my Nike shoes, Abercrombie shorts and Tower Records t-shirt to the park for a picnic with storebrand PB&J sandwiches and Arizona Iced Tea, reading a Star Wars novel and soaking up some sun.  It was such a nice day, I was glad to be out of the house. My Apple G4 laptop probably needed the rest after crunching its processors doing some graphics work on Adobe Photoshop for Clean Recordings.  Upon my return from the park, my Nokia did its annoying polyphonic ring to inform me my friend Jenn was calling. She's on my AT&T Wireless GSM America Family Plan. Such an odd thing. My best friend Jenn and my boyfriend Damon are on my Family Plan. Family. What a word. I'm sure neo-Conservatives everywhere are clutching their hearts and staggering away from their computers right now.  Speaking of computer, my self-installed, Apple Airport wireless, in-home network isn't work. And Why? Verizon.  Who'd have thought Verizon would have thoroughly messed up my DSL order, yet again?  No, I do have it and its allowing me to view porn, "borrow" music and post to my blog at half the blazing speed I had at my old address; it's just that my old e-mail account with them didn't make the transfer to the new number or new account. I never use Verizon e-mail, but the Mail program in OS X does need to connect to that account so I can send e-mails from my att.net account.  For now I have to use the Web-based e-mail program, which isn't too bad, except that AT&T is in cahoots with Microsoft. All the bells and whistles for the program only work with IE; I'm a Netscape user, quite possibly one of the last. Such a bummer. No color, italics or backgrounds for the few e-mails I send.  After unsuccessfully dealing with the aforementioned problem, I watched  Austin Powers in Goldmember  on my Panasonic TV with DirecTV. I was rather disappointed because I missed the opening sequence, probably the best part of the movie.  That's pretty much up-to-the-minute as I'm writing this.  This weekend wasn't all that exciting. It was our off week for Sugar & Spice, which we've cut because Philadelphia doesn't have much of a House music scene. I couldn't even get our party listed in the  City Paper  or  Philadelphia Weekly . Damon spun at a drag show at the Mercury Lounge Friday, which I mostly missed because I visited Jenn at Starbucks across the street from the "Real World Philadelphia" house.   I finally got to see 2 of the cast members. It was hardly a life-changing moment. And the media is all over them, creating more drama. A "Making of Real World Philadelphia" is definitely in order.  This liberal is over and out.  10-4

       Brian Swope In Effect   I'm back. Verizon DSL is on. The whole world is at my fingertips, at half the speed, yet the same price, as the service at 1220 N. Broad St. Apparently download speed is inconsequential, in terms of hardware laid down by Verizon.  Today has been such a big day.   Apple's stock jumped more than $2. as the iTunes Music Store spreads to Europe. I own stock in the company, so this is big news for me. ** The 9/11 Commission concurs with the rest of the world and disagrees with the Bush Administration over the relationship between Iraq & al Qaida. As the rest of the world knows, it was nonexistent.  Why? Because Iraq was essentially a secular state, whereas al Qaida is an Islamic extremist group. They didn't like each other. Attempts were made, but Iraq rebuffed al Qaida. It should be noted that this finding invalidates a 2nd Bush Administration reason for our Iraq attack. Do I see the man's political future dim? Please let it be that, and not me blacking out from the conservative Christian movement's encroachment on my lifestyle (and I'm not just talking about between me and my boyfriend). **  Fahrenheit 9/11  will finally see the light of day in the United States, but to how many people? The film is now battling the movie ratings board over the "R" rating it received. Some want it to be PG-13 to allow more people to view it.  Personally, I'm fine with the "R" rating for 2 reasons.   First, what 13 year old could comprehend what 9/11 is all about (or even want to)? I don't want to write people off, but at 13, some are still dealing with coodies, boys and sleepovers.   Second, the movie does feature dead Iraqi babies, prisoner abuse and children burned by napalm - not exactly your normal movie fare for the young teen crowd. Hell, I'm sure parts of it will be a bit much for some adults. ** Britney Spears' knee injury has led to the complete cancellation of her summer tour, and one can only hope the same can be said about the video she was taping while injuring herself and her career in general. ** Jeez, what does tomorrow have in store for me?

       PECO Is Captain Planet   It's a bit excessive, and I'm sure I've induced seizures in environmentalists everywhere. Why do I make such an outrageous correlation? Well, thanks to my friend Jenn, I've been informed of PECO's  urlLink wind energy initiative  . She received information about it in her last PECO bill, and she's going ahead with it.   It's costing her just $5 more a month, for her energy consumption, which is affordable. She's taken the wind power initiative into her own hands, spreading the Gospel of wind energy to coworkers and friends.  The power company names itself the largest provider of wind-generated energy East of the Mississippi River, thanks to wind farms in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. I remember reading several stories regarding wind farms in Pennsylvania, and how the environmentalists here were decrying them because of the danger they pose to birds. You can't win for losing, now can you?  I believe in the end, the people running the wind farms, agreed to cut back on the wind mills during heavy migration periods.  So now I'm spreading the Gospel. Actually, that's about all the Gospel I'm going to spread. My focus is the  urlLink FAQ section , otherwise know as the Asinine Questions page. I would like to specifically point out questions 5 and 8.    5. If the wind is not blowing, will my lights go out?  8. Will there be a windmill in my backyard?    I really don't even know how to tackle these questions. I'm stumped. I'm dumbfounded.  The following day, I did my own part for the environment. I went to Kinko's to get some flyers printed for the party Damon and I do.   While I waited to place my order, I breezed through a pamphlet outlining the company's own green initiative. It included energy efficient lighting and machinery, recycled papers and printer cartridges, just to name a few.   One way the consumer can help is by having copies printed on either side. I had already done that, it wouldn't make sense to print flyers with a blank back, now would it?  Kinko's recent mingling with FedEx has also garnered green news, as FedEx is testing a fleet of green delivery vans/trucks in California, which is to be expanded nationwide at some point.  So while I'm generally for the small guy, sometimes the economy of scale is just too much to be against. Needless to say, I'm doing more business with Kinko's.

       Europe One-Ups the USA, Again   I've been against the war in Iraq since before it started. So has nearly all of Europe.  I've been against SUVs in Philadelphia, in any city for that matter, for years, and now the Europeans are doing something about it.  CNN reports that Paris is looking to  urlLink ban SUVs  for all the reasons I have: They're gas hogs, they're dangerous to other cars and pedestrians, they're too big for city streets, etc.  Paris has traffic nightmares far worse than most people find in America, which is why the city has been switching more lanes to buses and bicycle lanes. I've lamented the lack of bicycle lanes and dismal public transit use since before I started this blog.  More importantly, a study in London, where SUVs and 4x4s are thought of just as a highly by the city mayor, found that just 1 in 8 4x4 drivers had taken they're vehicle off-road, and 6 in 10 never left the city with theirs. How pointless?  Now how to get a similar movement going so strongly in the United States?

       Little Interest for a Deceased President   The first news I heard this morning was of the passing of former president Ronald Reagan. During his presidency I grew up from a very young 1 year old to a very young 9 years old.  His 8 years in office went over my head. Most of it still does. There were obviously other people out there (people did put him into office) who he affected, who liked and disliked him. Today, I heard 2 people say "Yes! Ronald Reagan is dead!"  I say some pretty ignorant things at times, but this will not be something you will ever here me say. For as much as I dislike the current President Bush, I seriously doubt I'll ever utter those words after his last breath.  My one friend was pleased about his last breath because he was not pro-women's rights. Another said those words, I assume, because of the racism, the drugs in the ghetto, the anti-gay platform, etc. etc.  I'm pro-women's rights. I'm pro-choice. I'm pro-gay rights. I'm anti-racism and anti-drug. So why don't I hate the man as much as these 2 people in my life?  Because for all the downfalls in Reagan's politics, he was put into office because a majority of the United States voted him into office. Reagan shouldn't be damned his beliefs, the U.S. citizenry should be. President Reagan was simply a reflection of the times.  Of late it doesn't seem like things are so different. Yet things couldn't be more different.  So while I'm not sad, I'm not happy. Somber is probably the best word to describe my thoughts on the passing of a president whose 2 terms will probably have some effect on the rest of my life.

       Cheap Gas for Iraq   I have said more than once in my posts that I'm all for high gas prices. It's the one thing we have going for us to help break the car culture of America.   Too many people hop in their car to drive 2 blocks to the post office, grocery store, etc. etc. Not enough people have taken to bicycles and public transit.  Breaking the car culture in America would be several steps in the right direction to cutting or ending sprawl. Breaking the car culture would mean more money for public transit (with token and pass purchases), which would in turn improve public transit.  So I'm with Bill Maher about high gas prices. The rest of the world is paying up to twice what we pay (compared in dollars).  Part of the reason for liberating Iraq dealt with cheap oil for the world oil market. That has obviously not been the case.   About the only thing it has done is to overinflate the price at the pump. Watch for the next round of quarterly earnings reports. The oil companies are going to report billions in profits, at your expense.  Something else you didn't know was happening at your expense? U.S. taxpayer dollars are subsiding 5-cent a gallon gas in Iraq. Iraqis are filling up their tanks for just $1.10 according to an  urlLink AP story .  What's the cost to you, the U.S. taxpayer? About $500 million for a 3-month supply of 5-cent per gallon gas. Also add in the cost of military escorts for moving all the oil around.  Doesn't the gallon of gas you just purchased seem a lot more expensive now?

       I'm Not Dead   But thankfully the Creed, as a band, is. God, I disliked them to no end. And the lead singers attempt to equate the band with Led Zepplin! Blasphemy. Though, looking at it now, maybe there is a God. On 895 quadrillionth day, God killed Creed and saw it was good.  I'm not dead. I feel happy. Note that that isn't great or superb, just happy. I've settled into the new locale, and while it's not to Damon's or my liking, we're getting by. We've made it cozy for now.  I'm without DSL for a little while, which hampers my online presence, hence the sporadic posting this past week.  According to Verizon, that could change as soon as Tuesday, but that depends on which customer service rep I talked to. I'm seriously considering just up and dropping them for good.  Oh, that a move to Chicago could change that and so much more. That's the plan now because the city has a larger house scene for Damon and newspapers for me.  The question is how soon until the move happens? It seems the journalism field is picking up here in the Philadelphia area, as I recently submitted my resume to a newspaper that actually had an opening.  So any job I'm going through here will be financing the move to Chicago. This is brief, as the dial-up experience drives me nutty.  That and  urlLink Clean Recordings  has officially relaunched, with product showing in several Philly area retailers...  Now that might be what finances the move!  It's been keeping me pretty busy, with a slight revamp of the site, promoting, invoicing, designing, etc. etc.  Ciao until Tuesday!

        Christ Over Easy       Is there no end to religion being forced upon everyone? I opened a carton of Westfield eggs a few days ago to make breakfast, only to find Scriptures printed under the lid beside the nutritional information.  The egg carton lid asked where I was going to spend eternity. Well, if Dante's  Inferno  is correct, I'll be in the 7th Ring of Hell, thank you very much.      I half expected that I'd choke and die eating the eggs, seeing as how every religious layman and clergy is condemning me to hell. But no. Maybe God doesn't have it in for me. Maybe my "sin," if it must be one, isn't any worse than Newt Gingrich's affair or Rush Limbaugh's 3rd marriage.      So I have to wonder exactly how this can be allowed. Usually people on the street try to push pamphlets of doom (sometimes not), and I can easily create a collection of doomsday pamphlets, or I can pass them up.      But this dozen eggs was bought, and I don't know what religious group was behind the message. If it was Methodist or something similar, then fine. But what if this was a Pentacostal or Catholic group?      I could be funding the ultra-conservatives behind the Bush administration! Suddenly choking on one of those eggs seems it could be a Godsend.

        Guiliani, the Republican Lapdog   ATTENTION. WHAT FOLLOWS IS SOMEWHAT OF A RANT. I WOKE UP THIS MORNING TO THE VOICE OF RUDY GUILIANI TALKING OUT HIS ASS.    ***    Rudy Guiliani, former mayor of New York, and current Republican lapdog spoke on CNN this morning. Bill Hemmer was interviewing him from the Fleet Center floor. I'm not sure what he was doing there, and I wish he hadn't been there.      I'm really getting tired of the Republican spin machine. These people twist the facts in a way that should be illegal.      The most recent offensive "fact"?       John Kerry is the most liberal voting member of the Senate. That is correct, according to  The National Register  for 2003, but Kerry's long-term voting record ranks him as No. 11.       The GOP has also tried highlighting vice presidential candidate John Edwards as the No. 4 most liberal Senator, but he's only No. 25 when you look at the long term.       I read this additional information in a  urlLink CNN story  on a GOP slap at Kerry.      Of course you won't have an easy time finding these facts because the publication that tracks voting records is subscription-based and not available to the public for viewing. That's annoying enough in its own right, but to find more on this information I had to visit  urlLink  The Washington Times  , the Republican lapdog publication, not the respectable  Washington Post .      Doesn't it suck, that to find information from a "non-partisan publication" (as per the "About Us" page for the National Register), one must read partisan publications?      Why is the GOP spinning these skewered facts, among the many others? Because the only 2 attacks they have on the Democratic contenders are the "liberal" position and the "flip flops" John Kerry has made.      As far as flip flops go, hasn't the Bush Administration made the biggest of them all with the changing reasons for war with Iraq? There were the WMD (unfounded and as yet untrue), then Iraq's links with al Qaida (uncorroborated and untrue, according to the 9/11 Commission) and then the human rights violations of Saddam Hussein (even though he had U.S. support when he was gassing his citizens in the 1980s).      And, as far as flip flopping, if the facts of the case change, if the position of the constituents change, than so must the policy and the politician. Bush is stubborn, his steady position had better lead him right out of the White House.      When I originally wrote this, it extended on and on, but it was getting to be too much for me. So I cut it.      So I'm ending it with this little bit:      This election seems to be about balance. Populist Edwards with "liberal" Kerry and an intelligent Cheney with a stupid Bush.      As I'm finishing this, the convention and all of its nonsense continues.

       O-BAM-a  So the Democratic Party has found the black who will be the party's future in Barack Obama. I didn't listen to his speech, nor have I really listened to anyone's speech yet. I don't think I will either.    I'm just not too big on the political convention. I think there's been a few too many flops for this year already who were given prominence at the convention.    There was the Dean machine with the loose nut who garnered Al Gore's support too early. At this point, I'm not paying much attention to anyone Gore supports, with the exception of John Kerry because I was about him long before the Iowa primary.    And the Reverend Al Sharpton really had a lot of good things to say each and every time he spoke, but no one was taking him seriously. As   The Daily Show with Jon Stewart   reported, he was good, but he was black.    I'm not really sure how the Democratic Illinois Senator candidate rose so quickly. He's running an as yet uncontested race. But after I heard and read segments of his speech, I couldn't agree more with the media laying such a lofty position on the man.    Nary a decisive word came from his mouth that I heard or read, and his position is a compassionate one. Hmm, all the things Bush claims to be but isn't.    "Well, I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of America.  "There is not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America -- there is the United States of America," Obama said.  "We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America."    Give this man the presidential ticket! He's got my vote!    I just hope Obama can keep up this outlook and this personality after going through the dirty politics of the U.S. Senate.    How I yearn for a more-party system. Hmm, does this also explain my lack of interest in the Democratic (or Republican, for that matter) convention?    I certainly don't expect this to come easily. People don't give up power and influence so easily. Unfortunately, state and federal laws all but make a third party candidate as a true contender something relegated to dreams of utopia or 1992 with Ross Perot.    But I digress. Maybe this Obama can make a full-blooded Democrat out of me yet.

        Fuzzy Fascination     Exactly 25% (as of Tues., July 27, 21:49) of the last 100 entry pages to my Web site were visits to my pets page. I have no clue why the hell this would be the case. I did a quick scan of the coding in the page to see if "pussy" (as in cat) is amongst the picture names or alternative texts. Porn searches would definitely explain it. But that word or any other sexual word was nowhere to be found.    Why the hell is my pets page ranked so high? I almost feel like paying the $59. annual fee for full tracking on my site. Why do I even have a pets page?    These are all very pressing questions, but my head is killing me. A very shitty day started at 6 a.m., improved by 10 a.m., but the residual effects have yet to fade. Vast improvement is on the horizon.    I have an interview with a Philadelphia-area newspaper on Friday. Even if I don't get the job, this is the first interview I've had since March. Yes, President Bush, I can see the vast improvement in the economy!  ***  The bookstore recently started carrying product from  urlLink The Unemployed Philosophers Guild . The humor is right up my alley.    My favorite product (besides the Bush Administration being turned into a doll set titled The Axis of Evil II)?     The Saint Sebastien pin cushion!!! Who is this saint? He was a Christian martyr who survived being shot up with arrows by the Roman army, only to be beaten to death later.    I love this company!

        Back to Work     I haven't been in the bookstore in 12 days. I've not even been by the bookstore since before Boston. The downtime was good, but put me back to work!    Of course, it'd be nice if that work were journalism related, but I'm willing to wait some more. I've sent my cover letter and resume to at least 4 or 5 newspapers, media outlets or publishers, so I should hear something back!    When I wasn't in another state or applying for work, I spent my time reworking the  urlLink Clean Recordings Web site , as well as the rest of my Web site, which I've now designated 3.0. There wasn't much of a change to my site, just updating information and cleaning a shitload of code. The site still looks simplistic, but now the code is equally simplistic.    As for the Clean Web site, just take a look! The changes follow the label's relaunch, which means Damon is preparing music for demos to be sent out.    So I guess this vacation was pretty productive for everyone involved.    My God, this vacation did for me what vacations are supposed to do! I'm revitalized.

        Lame Games       Woe is me. Not so long ago, I upgraded my cell phone to AT&T Wireless (soon to be Cingular) GSM America plan. It required a new phone, which I was willing to take. I've only ever taken the "bottom of the barrel" free phone, but I wanted to splurge.      I purchased a Nokia phone, as I always do, and which I highly recommend to everyone and anyone who wants to help me out indirectly (through stock gains). I was sorely disappointed before purchasing the phone, because one of the classic computer games of all time, Snake, was oddly missing from the phone. Instead backgammon (?), bowling (?), Air Glide (?) and Sky Diver (?) were my only options.      I even went to AT&amp;T Wireless to see if I could download Snake, but no. How is this classic favorite game of mine not available?      Snake, for me, falls into the same category as Tetris. These games are the ultimate in computer games. Many a company has attempted to successfully redo or update the games, but 99% of them have failed.      Nintendo made up with me with the N64 version, after failing miserably on SuperNintendo. Many a morning, noon and night was spent in tournaments with college roommates and friends. The game is probably one of the few things I'm competitive about.      Something so trivial can only mean that I've been on vacation (12 days including my usual days off).      It was a good vacation, spent largely looking for work. I responded to 5 or 6 journalism jobs, with nary a response so far. I fear for my work. I'm a member of the copy editor association's Yahoo! job listings group and, of late, the job listings haven't been coming through as much.      But my friend Jenn has faith in me.          IM conversation:    Jenn: oh, brian, you'll find a job    Brian: what is this? you're an optimist now? jenn, i'm very disappointed in you    Jenn: no, i'm speaking statistically          So here's to hoping!

        Philadelphia Story       As with every time I leave this city, always much needed, I look forward to the return. This time the return from Boston was dampened by a small disaster at the house we live in. Thankfully, the trip to Boston was the easiest ever.      Previous vacation transportation involved an oversold Amtrak train, a Greyhound breakdown and being stranded at the airport. Apparently low costs equal high quality in American travel. Damon and I took the Chinese bus from Chinatown Philly to Chinatown New York to Chinatown Boston for $40 each, roundtrip.      I read through half of  Bluebeard , another good Vonnegut book, and nearly made it home before my iPod battery gave out.      Damon and I mostly enjoyed ourselves. Boston isn't exactly our kind of city. I don't think New England is a part of the country that works well with me. We were a little bit out of town and short on cash, so that certainly figured into it.       Then there was our desire to eat at a Quizno's, thanks to the crazy singing gerbil things, but the downtown store was apparently the scene of a Hepatitis A outbreak.      We also had trouble with getting directions from people.     Us to the cop: How do we get to the South End?     Cop to us: Where do you want to go?    Us: We heard it's a nice part of town with cafes and shops.    Cop: How about Newbury Street? It's ...        We later found out we needed to go just 5 blocks west to get to our desired location, which was the city's gayborhood. Apparently, the cop wasn't about us going there.      Our 2nd day, we did make it to the South End, but we somehow lost Tremont Street on the way to the movie theater to see  Spiderman 2 . So we asked a street cop.     Us: What happened to Tremont Street?     Cop: What are you looking for?    Us: The Loew's movie theater.    Cop: Take this street up to the Commons...          When we weren't out and about, we watched the 25 most outrageous episodes of  South Park , some  MadTV  and the movie  28 Days .      I did get some nice pics, so I'll put them on  urlLink my photoblog , which I've not updated in almost a month.      Gotta finish with the cleanup here at home and get some zzzs!

        Goodbye to Philly...for Now       I'm leaving for Boston very early tomorrow morning via the Chinese bus. It's $10 to NYC, then on to  another bus to Boston for $10. I'm traveling cheap this year, you can tell.    It's been about 6 years since I was last in Boston. I've got a different outlook, I'm going with a different person...  ***  I actually planned my day today around the Martha Stewart sentencing. Breakfast had to be done in time for me to catch the news. I'm not a fan of hers, but I don't think she should have gone through the investigation, the trial and now the sentencing.    Why? Because she was found guilty of lying about a crime she couldn't be convicted on. Doesn't that sound like something crazy. Doesn't this sound like Iraq, like the Soviet Union?    In my walks today through the city, I passed the Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia. The side of the building exclaimed something like "Justice Is the Protector of Liberty." I don't think Justice was served today. It was a twisted case, and the feds were in the wrong.    They just needed the appearance of being tough on white collar crimes, what with the endlessly ongoing Enron investigation and the Tyco fiasco of a trial.    I need to get my "Free Martha" shirt and take my stand, I guess.    Here's to a successful appeal for Martha Stewart!

       The Best a Human Can Be   I've fretted and fretted over America's inability to reason, a problem worsened since the 2000 campaign. Well today, that (your choice of higher power)-given trait made a brief reappearance on the U.S. Senate floor.  Today, the U.S. Senate was to take up debate on the gay marriage ban amendment, and thankfully, the Republican Party, which has made this a major agenda, couldn't muster enough votes in their party to get the matter beyond a procedural vote.  As expected, one Sen. Rick Santorum of my home state, voted against the measure, but not before making a fool of himself. To paraphrase him:  I'm not a hater; I'm a lover. A lover of traditional family with a mother and a father ... the right  of a child to have a mother and a father ... blah blah blah.   This amendment has nothing to do with children. Gay couples, gay singles even, already can, have and will adopt children regardless of the future of the amendment. For a co-sponsor of the bill to create the amendment, he surely isn't very knowledgeable on it.  I tried finding the actual vote statistics, but alas, it's not yet posted. I received an e-mail with my Senators' names and phone numbers so I could call them and tell them to vote against the measure. I didn't, what with the letters and e-mails I've sent over the past several months. The e-mail did note that Sen. Arlen Specter wasn't for or against it, unlike his small-minded counterpart. Specter may have a congratulatory e-mail from me coming his way.  On to a vote I did come across: CNN.com's quick vote (as of 20:06, July 13) recorded 65% of those who participated did not support a gay marriage ban amendment.  I made my  urlLink very reasonable stance  against this amendment months ago.  ***  In my attempts to unearth today's gay marriage ban amendment vote, I came across one good thing he's done for the Philadephia area.  Specter and Santorum, through their power in Congress, managed a $589,999 grant approval to SEPTA to purchase 13 new hybrid electric buses. Of course SEPTA's Web site mentions nothing of this grant approval, nor can I find how many hybrid electric buses they already have.  The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, in January 2004 meeting notes does mention a test program by SEPTA using "2 low floor Hybrid buses," but if there are any other type of Hybrid buses, I have no idea.  Because I'm all for public transit and alternative energy sources, I find Santorum can be reasonable about some issues, just not enough of them.  ***  Oh, and following political conversation at work (it's so cool of late) regarding Fox News (fair and balanced, my ass!), I read about a documentary showing a pattern of Republican opinion reporting rather than news reporting. It's called  urlLink  Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism   and MoveOn.org is helping to set up  urlLink house parties  around the country for viewing it.

       Bush Administration at Odds with Science     The Register   not so shockingly reports that the Bush Administration regularly pushes aside science when it comes to policy making. What replaces science? Well, religion, politics and party donors, of course!  You could easily push this aside except that the latest report, or complaint, from the Union of Concerned Scientists has 4,000 signatures attached to it. What's 4,000 signatures in a country with nearly 200 million people? Included in those 4,000 signatures are "48 Nobel laureates, 62 National Medal of Science recipients and 127 members of the National Academy of Sciences."  The report documents specifics with Appalachian mining (Bush OK'd, science didn't), the "Plan B" pregnancy preventative (Bush nixed, science OK'd) and endangered species policy. Of course, this trend expands to watershed requirements, oil drilling and the allowed pollution content in the water you swim, drink and fish in and the air you breath.  Something more jarring than the aforementioned is the policy of the Bush Administration in terms of sex education and AIDS. The U.N. is holding its AIDS conference this week in Bangkok, Thailand, and the World Health Organization reported that a record number of HIV infections (5 million) were reported last year.  What does the Bush Administration and his super conservative base think should be done to fight the disease? Abstinence of course. Abstinence, even though abstinence is the most arcane and short-sighted solution.  Yes, people not having sex would certainly end the spread of HIV, herpes, not to mention the human race. Yes, it's a fine idea, except that humans are sexual. Priests even have trouble with their vow of celibacy.  urlLink Ever since the 1800s, the rate of illegitimate children and those born out of wedlock has been rising.  Just how long has the liberal left been destroying this country?!?  Listen, my family is Republican and has voted that way for as long as they could. They were raised with church, and some continue to attend. But my grandmother and grandfather had their first child out of wedlock, as did their 3rd child, as did two of their grandchildren.  Abstinence is a great idea in utopia. But, like the administration shooting down the Plan B pregnancy preventative, what's left when abstinence breaks down? A complete ignorance of sex, that's what.   How do you use a condom? What's the difference between these different styles? What size fits me? If sex is treated as a taboo, how many times will a teenager play Russian Roulette with sex before they have the gumption to ask about it? The adult thing to say is that if someone isn't ready to talk about sex, they shouldn't be doing it. But shouldn't isn't couldn't or wouldn't.  A  urlLink study  of black high school girls found that real sex ed led to improved sexual health and smarter choices.  So much for sex ed leading to sex and pregnancy. But you wouldn't expect the Bush Administration to follow real science, would you?

       Media, err, Kerry, err, Bush Gone Wild   I meant to get to this post on the day of the crime, but I'm doing some freelance architectural writing, and because that pays, that comes first.  What "crime" am I talking about? It's the scoop on Sen. John Kerry's vice presidential pick. By now you must know that  The New York Post  incorrectly scooped everyone when they printed John Kerry choosing Dick Gephardt the night previous to the announcement.  For some reason (media manipulation, maybe) the Kerry campaign prematurely announced to his  urlLink election Web site  listserv members whom he had chosen for his vice presidential running mate.   That who was John Edwards. Well before Kerry was set to officially announce his decision to the world, CNN and every other news channel in America, possibly the world, was covering the empty podium where Kerry was set to announce "John Edwards as his vice presidential pick in 'x' minutes."  When they weren't showing the empty podium TV screens were filled with political commentators and the latest poll numbers on who Kerry should choose.  Before I got all the news on how the media found out early, I was appalled by the breaking news. Why can't the man just announce it himself. But it seems he didn't want to.  So rather than bash the media, I'll bash the Bush campaign, which is a much easier target.  On the front page of the Bush re-election  urlLink Web site  (I can't believe I'm linking to Satan), the Bush camp attacks Kerry for choosing Edwards. Why? Because Kerry attacked Edwards for being too inexperienced to be president during the primaries.  Uh, maybe the Bush camp doesn't understand, but Edwards isn't running for president, he's been picked to be vice president. The Web site also claims Edwards is Kerry's 2nd choice, but they fail to mention who his first choice was.  We can guess that John McCain was the "first" choice they speak of, but I haven't read a report putting him in that spot. I've read that Kerry had asked him to consider it, but Kerry had a short list of several possible vice presidential candidates.  The site also complains of Edwards' pessimism, but his strong point is and has been his optimism. He was banking on that during the primaries, and he became the biggest threat to Kerry because of this. And anyway, no pessimist can smile like Edwards can smile.  I'm not really sure how Kerry picking Edwards is a flop simply because they were opponents during the Democratic primaries. They had a common goal and that was to unseat Bush from the White House.   And more importantly, the Bush Web site picks out several votes that make Kerry and Edwards anti-family, anti-military support, anti-anything and everything. And guess what? The two had similar votes on most of the topics mentioned. Flip flop? Maybe strengthening of a platform.  Let's look at another example of paired opposites that work...  Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, when they are on their own, are not friends. The media has covered more than one spat between the two, but when it comes down to winning the game, they're a team and they accomplish the goal.  I can pin another example on Bush. Bush and McCain were opponents in the 2000 presidential race, but guess what? McCain recently introduced Bush during a speech. His manner was very respectful and he praised the current president.   Former opponents now friends? Who'd have thunk it?  To close this out, Bush's re-election Web site is a horrible mish-mash of moving ads, banners and I don't know what else. Kerry's Web site is much calmer, easier to read and follow, and doesn't leave you dizzy after visiting it for a just a few minutes.

       Survivor? I Think Not   I just finished  Survivor  by Chuck Palahniuk. He's the author of  Fight Club , which was made into one of my Top 3 favorite movies of all time. I first saw it when I was still a Temple student, so it's taken me quite a number of years to finally get to the books. Probably only because I had no idea how to spell this guy's name, and I'm not one for asking for assistance at the bookstore, or anywhere.  Oh, and more importantly, the Center City Border's is not known for staffing its Information Desk, on the off chance I ever did ask for help.  This is probably the quickest I have ever read a book. It's not written too complex, but the dark humor, the bizarre facts, I couldn't  put the book down. And it's not like this book is a cliffhanger or anything.  But why do I question the title? Because, like  Fight Club  Palahniuk is subverting societal norms, etiquette and morals. This time it's religion and celebrity. I'm already cynical, but this book just takes it to the max. If you're not already, it's a little difficult to finish this book unscathed.  I've done nothing but talk about this book since I got it from Overstock.com, which comes highly recommended as well. It's cheaper than Amazon.com!  I wanted to read this book at work today, which wouldn't have been a problem, because 75% of Philadelphia was closed. Coffee shops, Wawa Express, Liberty Place, the many lunch trucks, etc. etc. So now one was out.  It was amazing I survived the day in retail. We sent one employee home earlier and we could have sent a second home without understaffing the store. For the record that would leave 2 people running the store.  Why else am I amazed I survived the day? Because it was 87 degrees Fahrenheit, high humidity and the air conditioning was broken. Not that it ever really works right, but usually it's at least pumping air.  Why else am I amazed I survived the day? I should rephrase that and thank whichever god is truly running things that I'm still alive after ever walking into that store. See, the building is a rather old building and it's gone through many an owner.  Recently, the store has exuded a certain smell of death. It's coming in through the vents. The main lobby area reeks of it to as well. The building covers it up with some foul smelling cleaner, with the fumes also being circulated through the building via the air ducts. It wasn't noticeable today, but in another week, it'll be back, I'm sure.  I was a good citizen the other week and sent a "tip" to the regional EPA office, complaining of the smells and the dry throats and headaches resulting from the building maintenance cover up.  What response did I get from the EPA?  Hi, We dont have any legal athority to come into your building and that is what you need - a site visit. Since you are nearby, If the owner of the building  sends us a letter then EPA management  may honor that request.   Hmm, yeah, the owner of the building, which could be in violation of God knows what, is going to let you come in and maybe fine him.  Someone was paid with my tax dollars to write that stupid response to me.  Another day to survive, I guess.  In other news, this is my 200th post. If this were a sitcom, I'd be doing a retrospective, but maybe another day.

       I'm Surrounded by Cancers   It's yet another birthday among my circle of friends, this one belonging to my closest friend in Philadelphia, Jenn. So to you I say, alles Gute zum Geburtstag!  In other news, the new World Trade Center's corner stone has been laid to rest today. Over the next few years the skyline of New York City is going to change dramatically. Like the first world trade center towers, this one isn't without its share of controversy. I guess there is something in common between the two.  Some of it is political, some of it is historical and some of it is emotional. It seems fitting that it commemorates a date in American history that has so split the American people and taken down paths never thought possible.  Happy Birthday to America as well. It's time I sign off here today and get on with the July 4th tradition of too much food and later on the fireworks, minus the Isley Brothers. I can't say I'm fans of them, but of fireworks, yes indeed!  I haven't much cared for the musical selection at Welcome America! in Philadelphia over the past couple of years. Hell, I've seen better fireworks as well. Or at least more moving ones.  I remember Long's Park in Lancaster, Pa., with the city orchestra playing "The 1812 Overture" as cannons fired to open the fireworks display. I'm not sure if they're even that spectacular anymore. The Bon-Ton used to sponsor the event, but that's since been passsed on to Wachovia Bank, or Walk All Over Ya, as my friend Chris calls it.

       Always Room for Activism   Has Bill Cosby thrown comedy out the window? His last 2 headline grabbing endeavors have been stances against how black people live each day. Blaming the white man, listening to foul rap music and bad parenting, among other things.  His first coming out as an activist garnered a lot of negative press; it seems more because this was an unexpected move and less because what he said was racist or wrong.  Cosby's second foray into activism seemed better received. Though the word "tirade" is still used in the AP story making the rounds.   "Dogs, water hoses that tear the bark off trees, Emmett Till," he [Bill Cosby] said, naming the black youth who was tortured and murdered in Mississippi in 1955, allegedly for whistling at a white woman. "And you're going to tell me you're going to drop out of school? You're going to tell me you're going to steal from a store?"   So maybe tirade is the right word to use. Regardless of tirade, the man has a point.  It's always good to see someone with the clout of Cosby take up a cause for the better. God knows with all the offensive and subpar hip hop artists and their music, we need more positive positions.  I take a strong stance against hip hop, though you'll find quite a bit in my iTunes Library. Artists like The Roots, Outkast and Missy Elliot, they aren't bring people down. But others are, and the rap lifestyle is ever pervasive in the black communities where I have lived and do live now.  Cosby also took up my favorite thing to be against: double standards.  "When you put on a record and that record is yelling 'n----- this and n----- that' and you've got your little 6-year-old, 7-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car, those children hear that," he said.   White people are also ignorant when it comes to the English language. White people also beat on their kids and wives. White people also get stuck in minimum wage jobs. But one thing white people don't have is a derogatory word with accepted usage only by other white people.  The use of n****r is the worst example of double standards, when it comes to issues of race. How is this word interchangeable with friend from one black person to another?  But beyond these small parts to the larger tirade, I'm always interested in activists who don't push religious views. Not because I'm so against religion, but because religions have their own oppressive ideals.  As of noon, Friday, July 2, 98% of the people responding to CNN's online poll felt Cosby's tirade was justified.  The real question shouldn't be weather Cosby's comments are justified, but rather do his recent actions point to a political future? Could his name show up on the ballot for governor, senator or representative in the near future? And what chance does he have?

        Greetings from Lancaster       I haven't been in Lancaster County since January, and that was for a very brief period. I'm helping an aunt move out of her house. It's an old house that my grandfather's parents had lived in for some time. The original house is from the 1800s and had only a bathroom, kitchen and bedroom. In the early 1900s it expanded to a living room, dining room, 2 new bedrooms and a larger bathroom.      After more than a century of standing, it's ready to come down. I took a couple of pictures that might end up on my photojournal, I don't know yet.      The moving was ungodly stressful. I was expecting everything to be ready for moving, but no, it hadn't even been gone through yet. We found phone books from the '80s, TeenBeat magazines from the '70s. Anything and everything!       My grandfather has a bad knee, but he's always got to be working, so his limited work was aggravating him. Honestly, he'll be working his own funeral.      But now that is done, and I'm returning to Philadelphia, refreshed, buffed and stuffed with food.      My trip home did have some political charge to it. I'm Democrat/Independent and the grandparents are Republican, about everything and everyone. One thing that did shock me was my grandpa stating that Condeleeza Rice should be vice president. My grandma things she'll get Colin Powell's Secretary of State gig when he's done (presumably after this election). Their thoughts on Condi took me by surprise.      My family hasn't been the accepting of people, but Condi has obviously made an impression on them. What also took me by surprise is there apparent dislike of the current vice president, Dick Cheney, who has quite a bit of support from his Republican constituency, even after all the problems he's been involved with.      ***    In a pointless sidenote to the past week, I've not been emptying the bulk bin of my yahoo account. The filters managed to capture 901 bulk e-mails by this Sunday at midnight. I don't even use the account, I don't know how my address has made the rounds. I probably reported as spam another 20 e-mails over this time.      My att.net account gets hit pretty hard, but I have that e-mail posted on my Web site, so that's to be expected, unfortunately. I've been getting bombarded by e-mails (duplicates usually) from this one company, which I've been unsubscribing to each and every time. The link says that within 10 business days I'll have my address wiped from there mass mailings, but after 5 or 6 days, there's been no change. I'm sure they'll bombard me until Day 10.      More when I return and settle in.

        Transition       I'm single again. I've not been single in more than a year. I feel both welcome and uneasy about this change. I've always been insanely independent, and me dating Damon came as a surprise to everyone, including the two of us. But I must admit, having someone can be very uplifting and comforting.      As far as feeling uneasy, it comes with us still living together and being close. At times it's awkward, and other times jealousy comes into play. We also aren't planning on moving away from each other. There has been discussion of still moving to Chicago or somewhere together.      I do know that this break up is a 180-degree turn from the last I went through. The events of that implosion/explosion made my single life all the more enjoyable and desirable.      I just hope that being friends works out for Damon and I. We put too much into the last 14 months for it to crumble. That we both feel the same way bodes well. In the end, we've split more because we needed to, not because we wanted to.      Needless to say, I've been thrown for a loop of late. For the purpose of being quick and simple, what follows are two things to note in the political spotlight.      There was  urlLink Arizona Senator John McCain attacking a pro-Bush ad that slammed presidential candidate John Kerry . Why did John McCain do this? Because the ad was unfair and similar to the sleight the Bush camp dealt McCain when they were opponents in the 2000 presidential election.  Sometimes I really like McCain, and other times, not at all! This, obviously, being a time I'm on his side. But that seems to be part of the charm McCain has. I considered voting for him in the 2000 election, but he didn't make it to the general election. Oh, independent-minded politicians! We need more of you.  Pennsylvania has one of those. His name is Arlen Specter, and someone is trying to get him out of office. Shame on that person! The opponent isn't memorable, so I'm not even going to mention his name. All I know is Specter's opponent in the primary election had a lot of Democrats wishing they could have voted Republican to help Specter. In the end, we Democrats and independents didn't need to. We may be needed come November's General Election.      And my 2nd point:  More recently, Bush stated that "we," as in him and his administration  urlLink "never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people."       Tell me about it!      I didn't see this comment live, but I wonder if he catches what he says, or if he reads about it later and says to himself, "did I really say that?" Hell, maybe he hears about it later, and it still doesn't faze him.

        Rich Oil Companies/Struggling America   ChevronTexaco Corp. last week  urlLink reported record quarterly profits  of $4.1 billion.    You heard it. The company made four point one billion dollars in 3 months. The company had $37 billion in sales. With record profits, I don't know how these oil companies can justify hiking the price of gasoline so much. How American that these companies are fattening their balances sheets and executive paychecks, while fueling oil speculation and dependency fears.    What turned this story into a post was additional information in  The Wall Street Journal  (which requires membership and is a hassle for a lot of people):     But the real key to the future is finding new oil at a time when most of the energy-rich Middle East is closed off to foreign oil companies, and major oil deposits must be found in more remote and unstable regions of the world. All of which makes exploration an increasingly expensive enterprise.    With the help of recent windfall profits, "We have the financial strength to make these big investments," says Dave O'Reilly, ChevronTexaco's chairman and chief executive. "These are multibillion commitments. This is not for the fainthearted."       In an  urlLink ABCNews science column , Lee Dye points out that companies rolling in cash don't have an incentive to look at alternative fuel sources. How true!  They were built on oil and they will be oil until there isn't anymore oil left. Very short-sighted wouldn't you say?    The column very interestingly points out the faults of government subsidy and taxing the wrong types of fuels.    Unfortunately, U.S. energy policy (including that made behind closed doors with Vice President Cheney), seeks to boost oil output and feed current energy consumption. It does little to boost alternative energy production or research or work towards conserving energy.    The energy bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate (go Democrats!), sought $23.5 billion in tax breaks for energy companies. The amount to go towards renewable resources pales in comparison to this amount.    When the No. 2 oil company in the world posts a 3-month profit of $4.1 billion, why are more tax breaks needed? Oh, that's right, the oil industries connection with the Bush administration.    For more information, the Freedom of Information Center at Missouri University provides a  urlLink report on oil giveaways  written by The Center for Public Integrity.
