      Yeah, this theme looks cool enough for the likes of me, WrathS, 0wn3r of all and maker of much money at Empire storage.  Here's the shimmy:  Every Monday/Wednesday/and Friday I will update and maybe biweekly I will put up a top 5 somesuch list.  Of, course, there will obviously be spontanity.  I will try to link to some comics later, for the unlightened.

      Haven't posted in a week.  But for a good reason!  Bad internet... but I fixed it.  All it took was a(n): AR-15. 5 Full .223 Magazines.  A map to my nearest DSL center.  And One (1) getaway vehicle.  Not mentioned:  Cleanup smock and gloves.  Lets see..... something funny... uh..... nope... that was it.    Started my hospital community service.  Damn, I hate being so Lawful Good.   Good way to meet chicks, though :D

      Oh, one more thing before I forget  WrathS' (*choir sounds out*) TOP FIVE REASONS I HATE CS FAGS:  Reason number 5: Awps.  The ultimate weapon of no skill.  At least with the auto shotty (lovingly dubbed the n00b stick) one had to actually move around to find and kill people.  With the AWP all you need to do is find a spot where you can't be seen or where people can't see you from far away and camp!  Weeeee, ain't that nifty??  Reason number 4: That one chatty bitch who always says you hack but you don't.  This is for the non-hacking half (all -skill) portion of CSers.  Reason number 3: Multiple AWP using team-stacking whores.  Reason number 2: Corrupt admins that fucking ban and TKPunish you even though you don't fucking hack.  AND REASON NUMBER ONE: Hackers.  I hate those fuckers.  They give us non-hacking all skill CS players a bad name.  I need to take my Rage-Away pills.  I think there's a vein about to pop in my neck.

      Oh SHIT!  Sorry, but I meant to post and say happy Halloween and shit, but I COULDN'T USE THE DAMN COMPUTER THE WHOLE FUCKING DAY.  My mom was fucking IM'ing FRENCH PEOPLE.  The whole day.    And then I went trick or treating with Alex.  Yeah he went as the guy from GTA3 and I went as a shade (a humanoid with a black countentance and robes and a barely visible face face) with a sword.  Needless to say, some people were impressed by my sword.  Like this one old guy... but.  I'm getting off topic; not really, as this thing is about me  I think I may have one of those date thingies if I ask this one girl out.  Providing she doesn't have a boyfriend yet.  Let's hope she doesnt have one and likes me.  And shut up Alex.

      Its not enough that once I'm done playing EQ at 2:00 AM, I have to get up and go to work at 9:00AM. So I grudgingly did... but the grudge was absolved once I ate some bannana/apple waffles with honey.  So to get to the point, I've had bad upper back pain for the last three days ( I think I was stretching and I sneezed while standing up and my muscles got all discombobulated). When I got to work I realized that my task of the day was to lift heavy boxes. But they were of drugs so I was like, "Hey, its not *all* bad, right?"  Once they were moved out of the unit, I was to sweep it out, clean its walls, and then put them all back in according to the name of the drug. It took me the whole day... well, not the WHOLE day, the end I spent looking for garbage to throw away.  But all that lifting really hurt my back. Ow. I get to go to the Ultimate Fights tonight, so I guess its looking up.

      Ok, time for a blog pizzost!  I had this incredible top 5 that would've made you all cream your pants, but I forgot it!  I'm trying to remember it.....  I think it was about what I like about EQ.  Speak of said game, it 0wnz.  It 0wnz b0n3z.  It r0x0rz my s0x0rz, b0x0rz, j0x0r, and c0x0r.  It is so open ended.  You can even fly around!  You can level up without killing a monster!  You can do quests and ally with a faction, or be a lone killing machine, fighting for your own cause and trying to score phat lewt.  Its all good.  My only beef is that the orcs look like green hairless gorillas.  Shouldn't they look more piggish, staying true to most FRPGS?

      So before school I told my mom I would need an extra half hour to tell my teachers that I'll be gone next week and she should get me at 3:30.  I was done telling them after school by 3:00. I caught the bus and went home. Too bad my mom thought I was still at school. She searched for me for two hours at the school and called home (which I was conveniently on the outside of at the time). But after those two hours she went home and found me on the doorstep with numb feet and hands, blue lips, and teeth chattering away. I am partly to blame, for I didn't bring a spare key; but after all, who searches a school for someone NOT there for two whole hours?? Come on!

      Eh, what the hell, I'm gonna post again. Thanksgiving was good, family was there, lots of food and we watched Willow afterwards Took a weeklong vacation to the Ozarks.  In Missouri.  Osage Beach.  Caught 8 fish.  Their nerves make them squirm even after you take their heads off.  I laughed my ass off.   I bought Icewind Dale 2.  I didn't play the first, I was busy with BG2.  You don't need to play the first, it comes a few years later and has a different plot.  I like the feature of creating a party.  Thats nice.  I like 3rd ed. AD&D.  Graphics are kinda antiquated, but , hey, it reminds me of BG2.  Soooo... yeah.  Nothing much else. Makin' movies, makin' songs, and foitin' round the woerld!!

      Wow, 3 posts today; I'm on a roll! I just saw Unbreakable on Starz (movies, movies, new hit movies, for new hit movies, I wanna see STAAAAARZ!).  It had a plotline which parallel's Baldur's Gate 2.  Allow me to elaborate. In BG2, you play a humble adventurer who is just realizing you are something a bit... grander.  Same with Bruce Willis in Unbreakable.  He is a plain old security guard that survives a deadly train wreck.  That event could be paralleled by being the "Hero of Baldur's Gate" by killing Sarevok.  Then you are confronted by an evil mage Irenicus who uses you to find out who he is (or just become immortal, whatever).  Like Sammy Jackson in Unbr.(eakable), both are evil, frail, and geniuses.  Both also murdered masses to get to you (Bruce Willis).  Over time, and with the fragments of Irenicus's knowlege (Jackson), you realize you are more than just a petty adventurer (security guard).  You are a hero!  You rescue Imoen in BG2 (the family in the movie) and also learn from flashbacks and dreams who you really are (in the movie, Willis flashes back to college when he survived a car wreck).  You finally can get to your enemy (Jackson) who says they needed you to find/help themselves.  You kill him (Jackson goes to jail). That plotline compares Willis to you, the Hero.  Now here's the fun part!  Both have themes!  Is it right to murder mass amounts of people for things to be the way they should be?  For you to find youself? What if it is in the name of "good"? Is it a hollow existence?  This question is brought up many times in Baldur's Gate 2:Throne of Bhaal and at the end of the movie.  It really isn't justified.  As an adventurer, you either fade into mediocrity ("good") or become a Lord of Murder ("evil" or as in the movie, Jackson could've been an insane super-villain).  Both are not anyone's desired fate.  Comparable to the game, Jackson fades into mediocrity (jail) for his mass murderings, but realizes, "Hey, I found who I am! I discovered this hero!".  That's like in the game you found you "had" to kill thousands to become evil or somewhat good. That plotline compares you the Hero to Jackson.  So I guess that in finding youself, there is always a good part, but can't always be justified.  And for this theme to be communicated in BOTH a movie AND a computer game made me realize that themes are communicated so openly, that you just have to look for them.  Also, I know I am NOT on the dot, but it really made me think.

Foundation should be required high school reading (in no particular order) 1.Asimov  creates good suspense. 2.It is a funny yet true replica of real-life.. a parody. 3.It is realistic (well if when advance 12,000 years). 4.It has a nice theme that a small group can accomplish a lot. 5.It also has a good theme that every society is doomed to crumble.  Happy reading.

      Ah... Well, I finished half of Foundation and Empire.... you know, the last half.  Funny story actually:  Since Christmas vacation, I couldn't find my book.... and with this book report but not a book sumamry thing due this Wednesday, I never really finished my book.  SHIT! So I naturally turned to the Net.  And it never steers me wrong; in fact, it helped me find the whole fucking book in a GIANT text document.  So I spent from 4 to 8 finishing half the book and then I wrote the assignment.  Yeah, I'm a speed reader.  What else.... nothing funny per se.  Geometry test tomorrow; I never study for jack shit, and anyway I'm better than the SENIORS in this class at this damn class, ha.  And, who all reads this thing?  Message me on AIM to tell me if you do.  I expect about 8.  WrathS01 is the name.  0wning n00bs is my gizzame!

      Here is a copy of an intelligent discussion between Alex and I that slowly degenerated.  It began with how I think the idea of "emo" music is moronic.  It ended with... well... take a gander.  mralexpants: you dont know who tim kasher is, so you dont know crap about music WrathS01: emo? mralexpants: yes mralexpants: sorta WrathS01: see there u go. WrathS01: i dont care to know about emo. WrathS01: all music is emotional mralexpants: emo isnt just "emotional" WrathS01: then what is it? describe it in another wrod mralexpants: emo cant really be described mralexpants: it's more of a way of life than just a type of music WrathS01: neither can most music without emotional WrathS01: and rock or rap isnt a way of life? mralexpants: no, you're not understanding mralexpants: and rap isnt music WrathS01: it is to 3/4 of the world. mralexpants: 3/4ths of the world doesnt know musioc the ory, though mralexpants: so they're just basing stuff off of things they dont know WrathS01: thats not even a complete sentence. WrathS01: oh.. theory WrathS01: count me as one of the majority. mralexpants: see? mralexpants: it's true mralexpants: i bet if i said dominant triad you'd be all "whozza whazza?!" WrathS01: yeah. mralexpants: see there you go WrathS01: what is it? mralexpants: hahahaha mralexpants: dominant triad is... mralexpants: it's a form of making musical chords mralexpants: 1-4-5 WrathS01: heh WrathS01: i dont play music. mralexpants: 1 is always going to the 4, and it can't be complete without the 5 WrathS01: adn it is a band i bet WrathS01: *and it is mralexpants: i bet not WrathS01: i bet so.

      Today: Woke up at 6:30 AM.  Took shower, dressed, ate, brushed up (teeth and hair), and got in Kyle's car.  He's a pretty decent driver and sincere about taking care of his car.  Eh, if I had a car, I probably wouldn't.  So at school, not much happened.  I'm the 2nd best in my Geometry class.  I just like saying that.  I mean, its an easy class, but these kids I'm surrounded with don't know jack fuck.  You gotta earn this "3vil l33t" shirt.  At lunch, I had like 3 books on me, and I was reaching for the pasta sauce for my pasta (gigighkjkkjhdhgi DUH!!) and the shit spilled all over my shirt and binders.  Fuck!  Good thing everyone in high skool is so fucking apathetic; no one looked.  So I just wiped up and declined the offer of a free lunch.    When I finally got my shit home, I watched TV, and about half an hour or an hour ago, I started perfecting my handheld crossbow.  Like, handheld mean that you can one-hand it, have the bolts (or in my case, handle-less knives with balanced ends)  on your belt and have shield in your off-hand.  Wow, that sounds like my D&D player's handbook.    Anyway, the idea of shooting the knives at (impressively) high speeds rather than throwing them (which I fancy myself decent at) is quite sound.  'Course it can't penetrate a breastplate, derr.  The pull is so weak, I can take both my fingers and pull/string the fucker.  Yeah.  So the speed at which the knives go really isn't much.  But is enough so that the knife makes a satisfying *Twang-g-g-g* noise upon striking a wooden surface.  Mayhaps now that I know what I'm doing, I can commission the building of a larger, more solid model that has greater pull.    You may be looking at the monitor with a strange look upon your face (most likely also furrowing your brows) in order to figure out "Why is he doing this?".  The greatest thing to hit my little Omaha off-shoot town, off course!  Hot Topic?  I think not, prissy-pants!  The Renaisannce Fair!  Huzzah!  I have swords, a shield or two, and have worked on some banded light-weight metal armor.  All I need is a cloak, and I will look cool as shit.  Or lame as fuck, if your opinion of me is shitty.  Heh heh heh, I will look so cool.    So thats my day so far.. now that officially have control of the 'puter and no homework, I can finally look at the comics that are conveniently located on your left.  Yes, that sidebar.  Lates.

      I went over to Iowa City this weekend.  Watched a little Scarface... ate some sushi and some cake.  Celebrated my sister's 23rd B-Day.  Got my Icewind Dale 2 CD back.  Took some pics with my new digital camera.  Oh, oh oh, my left arm hurts a lot.  I benched a lot during weightlifting and now I can't fully extend it.  And that was on Friday.  What else, what else.... I think I need to ask this chick out who I know.  She's cute and nerdy.  She plays video games and has a good sense of humor.  And no, Alex, she's not fat.  I think I have a good chance with her.... but if I get turned down for a date, then things'll be really awkward around her.  Cold is gone, woohoo.  I need to get together with my old friends.  Maybe make some funny movies.  I'm out, I need to ding 17 in EQ and then 18.  Or maybe I'll play some CS with "Rame Duckaru".  Maybe I should finish ID2.  Oh, fuck, I stopped watching the superbowl at 8 minutes left in the 4th.  Go Tampa Bay!  Or Tampa... yeah, it should be just Tampa, Tampa is the city.  Not like they need any cheering on... it was freaking 34/3 for a while, but then it was 34/15 last time I checked.  Ok, bye.

      Well, fux0r.  My new pocket pc is teh shitzor... but its new l337 Xscale processor runs only the newest games.  So its like, I can't play Quake or Doom on it.  Those only run on the gay StrongArm processors of computers past.  No worries... when new, better, FPSes for the PPC come out, my Xscale will be the best thing to play 'em on.  Shit, its got multimedia oompf.  Oompf, yo.  Only fags and fools don't understand or respect Latin.  It is the father of all languages.  So to you, fags and fools, I say this:  Ascendo tuum!

      Basically, I say: War is the only way to peace. But you can't always be at fucking war. Bush is a complete idiot. You really need to choose your fights wisely.   Kindness is just a way to get others to submit to you and make you seem better.   We are always striving through violence and "unkindness" to reach a nice little equilibrium of peace.   We do so by using ideas like communism, capitalism, democracy, and (please don't hate) religion. Frequently, such things use fear (like religion, which controls us by saying there is a hell and heaven... we don't know, so we seek answer, and religion has such an answer. Funny, ain't it?) to accomplish something.   And again, frequently, lots of people die in the process of defending their ideas (Iraqis, Islamic extremist, anyone?).   Before you argue against the theory of ideas and their power to control mass groups, think about cults/religions. How did/do they manage to kill off people so quickly? By creating the illusion that they control the afterlife.   People believe so much into their religion that they follow it 'til death, they believe it is right and all others are wrong. Same as Commies vs. Democracy and Capitalism. They liked there idea, and we like ours. FIGHT! Plus, we defend our own. What else in the world doesn't protect their own? That's why we will always find a reason to fight.

        Your Heart is Black    urlLink   What Color is Your Heart?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     First negative quiz result ever. Well, its true.  I am frequently described as serious, intense, distant, cruel, and arrogant.  If I ever had a chance, I would become Doctor Fucking Doom. Thats how much I frequently hate the world.  Sure, I know whats in stead for me, but sometimes I can't handle it.  Rumors.  Girls that don't accept.  Fucks that make threats.  My heart isn't black, its just that people don't understand and accept.      And anyway, I'd rather have  a sword than a metal bar (but I have both in my possesion)

      Latin Saying of The Day: "Fronti nulla fides" (No reliance can be placed on appearance)  Don't judge a book by its cover.  Thats a classic one.  Ha ha ha ha, I beat Kyle and tied with Dan in a game of 21.  OWNAGE.  But I'm not good enough at B-Ball to do much else than casual playing.  I need a new game, and I need a new graphics card.  When I look around wherever I am surrounded by people, it seems like I am the only normal, happy, uncomplicated, smart, person there. There are always people talking about pointless things (he said she said) and depressing things("oh my god, my life is so shitty"), people talking shit to each other("well, that guys a fag and she's a slut").  And then there's me.  The guy that has a decent look on life, looking down on those poor fools.  Now this may seem like I have an inflated ego; but no.  Its called a good attitude.  Compared with your anxieties, it really is quite fun.  And listening to all your whining is funny.  I really can't stress enough about sucking it up and being cool.  Not enough people do it.  "Oh, but Wes, you're doing it now!  You're making fun of us!"  Well, then that's because I am in a position to do so.  Maybe if you suck it up, stop complaining, and make a crack at me, then you'll be happy.  I'll probably be happy for you to.  You fucking lamer.  My plan for sadsacks to have a decent look on life: 1. Stop whining.  If you stop whining, people like me won't avoid you and your stupid shit like the plague.  And if you hang around people that think being sad a lot is fine, then you got some weird friends. 2. Stop being so goddamned mopey if life tosses you a bad turn.   3. Suck it up.  There's a silver lining in that cloud. 4. Be nice to other people.  I'm fucking serious here.  I may seem self-centered, but I'm a good person.  I volunteer.  I do all my work.  I am polite in public situations. 5. Don't be afraid to do more than you're asked.    Follow those steps and you'll be happy.

      Latin Saying of the day: "Exitus acta probat" (The outcome justifies the deed)   Ah, a good ol' saying that anyone can relate an experience to. Hmmm I feel like getting philisophical and blasphemous.  All to the  CURRENT MUSIC: MORTAL FUCKING KOMBAT MOVIE THEME.  Ok, meme: an idea (which covers grounds of religion and philosophy) that takes hold of a society/civilization like a plague.  Much like a gene, a meme reproduces itself (figurativley, you fucking dolt) and its plausibility and gusto catches many thousands/millions of people.  The idea can be as simple as Us (where "Us" is a naturally defined clan) versus Them ("Them" being another group of organisms that share different genes from "Us").  Ah, good ol' Us Versus Them.  Even in the smallest parts of the genetic world, that is played out.  Ever seen an ameoba eat another, smaller one?  Well, there you go.  Ever seen entire colonies of bacteria "go at it" in effort to take control of a dish full of ager?  I have a picture of that happening (http://www.gongoozler.com/cgi-bin/webcam.cgi, I'm Wes).  Ant colonies, ape families, and especially humans all fight because of such a simple meme.  Us versus Them.  And we have to protect our own, right?  So lets fight!  Its a perfectly natural thing.  More advanced is religion. Oh, *BOY* how I love this meme.  Religion in its simplest form uses what we fear most to make us do things that benefit it.  Death.  We all fear it.  Religion plays upon that fear by boasting it has an invisible power to give us power over such uncertainty.  Oh man, where do I sign up?!  The catch: die for us, give us your land and money, and steal/conquer that other guy's land/riches.  And don't forget to convert him!  And religion just sugar coats this message with words like "love, peace, equality, sharing, forgiveness...." WELL OF COURSE YOU'LL HAVE THESE FUCKING THINGS!!!  But ONLY when said religion/meme takes control of the world.  And, boy howdy, does that take a LOT of death.  And converts.  And money.  Which is what religion is.  Just a devious little idea that plays upon invisible fears like demons and hell with invisible rewards like heaven.  The only people getting rewarded are those that fervously follow the religion like blind fools.    Islamic extremists, anyone?  They even SAID they world conquer the world.  Such a rule by such a meme might bring a form of peace.  But after a few years, it would fall to corruption due to internal factors and faction breakoffs (barbarians.  Always there are barbarians and renegades).  Because of Us Vs. Them and Religion, world peace is not possible.  There can only be a finite ammout of "peace".  There will always be war and fighting.  The only way to have "peace" is to inform stupid religion followers that they are ignorant and open their eyes, cast down their arms, and chill.  But that would require a meme.  A meme of knowlege.  A meme of truth.    And too many people are scared of that.  So such a meme would just fail.  I DARE you to go up to a cultist or Shiite Muslim and tell him he's a fool.  No, sir, I wouldn't.  And politics like Democracy and Communsim?  Meme.  Both easily corruptable due to human nature.  But being humans, we tend to overlook such things and hope that there won't be any corruption or revolts.  And because of ignorance, those things fail.  Its lucky that some laws are just so logical to the modern man that we aren't in a state of constant anarchy.  Laws are actually good memes, that have evolved to benefit the modern man.  Now we don't have unnecessary bloodshed without penalties.  Or thieving.  But there are always renegades to fuck things up.  I mean, if we can do anything we can to keep memes from colliding or falling apart, things would be fine.  But Bush has to insist on war, and that gangster robbing your car just HAS to keep his life in control by disobeying the law.    I love how memes work... just like living organisms.    END RANT.  Tomorrow: The illusion of control and how it influences the world.  Questions?  Comments?  Well then FUCK YOU.  I'm RIGHT.  You're the blind fool.

Doesn't trust us teenage drivers, probably.  I don't blame him; we were gonna travel by interstate.  So I spent today at home playing videogames... for several hours no less.  Current PC Game(s): Case Closed (add-on for Half-Life, and best use of barnacles EVER) and Penultima ReRolled 4: Pastor of Muppets (mod for Neverwinter Nights) Current PPC Game(s): Quake, and Snails (argueably the best tactical snail-based shooter of all time)  Current Mood:  Anxious.

      Last night... 12 AM.. Dan Keesis and Kyle Vannier sneak into my house upon my request.  We three silently and skillfully take it to Vannier's house next door.  We play CS until 3AM. 8:00AM we wake up, unpack and unnetwork our computers.  We drive to Burger King, eat breakfast, and then go to Thunderbowl.  There we tell Logan Yard and Alex Franz that we ain't bowling, but going lanning.  We finally arrive at the LAN, network our shit, and Chris Parker comes in.  Woohoo!  So us four are in the corner for eight hours on CS amidst 40 other people paying Quake 3, Warcraft 3, Starcraft, and Halo.    Then 150 bucks worth of pizza comes, Zach wins the Halo tournament, and its finally on the CS tournament.  Since stats showed that Kyle, Chris, and I were in the top 10 (me being number 2) we were bumped up to automatic 2nd round.  We mauled our competitors and it was down to us and the college kids/organizers.  Of the 2 maps and 40 some rounds we play, we only won maybe 10.  And 3 from me.  So they won.  And we got no money prize.  But they told us that no one ever wins more than 5 against them, so I was really happy that Kyle, Chris, and I are the Best CSers in town.   And maybe of this region.   Well, maybe Kyle Bouerly could do better.....  Naaaaaaah.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm... 12 hours of CS-y goodness.

      Well, my grand uncle John passed away in the hospital tonight.  Two years ago, he fell and broke his hip.  In the hospital he developed pneumonia and became somewhat senile.  After a year of being in and out of the hospital for therapy, he seemed really well.  But recently he fell again, and was too weak to recover.    He was a somewhat slow person, both physically and mentally in his later life.  He was a very tall man and played basketball in his day.  I remember seeing a photo ad he towered over everyone else.  He was a god talker and listener.  Goodbye, Handsome John.

      I'm gonna miss going to LAN parties while I'm on my yearly Florida Vacation (4th thru the.... 18th.) in Marco Island.  Ah, sweet LAN parties...The stimulating scent of caffeine, the verbal jousting, the smell of pepperoni lingering in the air, the floor a tangled infestation of cat 5, the neon lights of case mods poking through the scene like lasers in fog. Nothing quite like it. And when the gaming starts, everybody becomes so intense. One frag leads to the next, emotions wax and wane as gibs amass and levels change, here an unnamed player, there an elite commando with uncanny aim. Over time, the LAN party itself, a single organism, breathing, hunting  Of course, I need to pump more iron and get my tan back.  And swim, oh God, I love swimming.    I'm serious... I used to have a tan... before I started to play Diablo 2.  Or was it after I played Half-Life that I lost it?  Oh well, it was overuse of computers.  I love Florida.  And I won't be so lonely with an RTS and techno MP3s on my Toshiba e330 PocketPC.  Ok, this'll be my last post for a while.

      Why?! *Whyyyyyy*?  Why did I sacrifice my hard drive space and an hour of my time to play the Unreal 2 demo?  WHYYYYY????  The whole experience lasted less than half an hour, not including saving and loading time to look at special gun effects and stuff. And to play through parts with the most health and ammo.  But anyway... its 282 megs and WAY to short.  Now this kickass dream I had.... nice and long and it had stunning visual effects, as well.  You know... because it was a dream.  It started off with me waking up after sleeping for... 18 hours straight or something.  I missed school and volunteering, so I felt it was time to party.  The next thing I can remember (there was something inbetween there) was that I was like watching this cool thing.  Like a movie.  But it was like Giants:Citizen Kabuto... with the sparkling blue ocean and high green moutains and all pretty like Giants ( god what a great game, btw).  Then there were these people and they started jumping out of the sky in a circular pattern.  It was cool looking.  Maybe this part of the dream was reminicing of Giants and all the 3dmark tests and stuff that look amazing.  Then I was on a plane.  And there was booze.  Then I was in the streets with an ar-15 like in GTA3.  I was killing gangstas and the cops came around.  I ducked under a fire escape behind a box and continued shooting.  The gang kids kept coming, so I ran to the cops and then I latched on the back of the cop truck thing.  Like a paddywagon.    Then I was like watching some fat, Hulk person on an operating table. And I heard this voice say  "He can only breathe through one nostril at a time" Which was weird when you think about it.   I cant remember what happened next.  Now I can safely assume such an intriguing dream can only be caused by the aspirin I took and taco salad I ate right before bed.  Messed up.  A few weeks ago I heard about this lucid-dream controller device that lets you control your dreams, rather than just sit back and watch.  It beeps when you're in REM and lets you know you're in a dream and so you can easily form things.  Like, I don't know.... owning a copy of PS and dreaming what its like to play it. lol.

So I am gonna charge 5 bucks to anyone wanting a copy of Ut2003... ill give you the discs, u install it and get a cd crack. i return the game when I'm done, and ill get a majority of my money back.   oh.... Half-Life 2?  SWEET.

      Wow, I own at UT2K3.... and not just like, casual ownage, but more like ravaging ownage. It looks like I haven't fallen off the Deathmatch game yet, eh?  Well, like I always say, once you deathmatch, you never forget how.  I was just playing a bombing run server and in like 15 minutes I'd gotten up to 75 points.  Man, I love how much I still own at UT.

      Gonna be a large lan like I thought there would be, on the 7th!  They will be playing CS, Halo, Starcraft:BW (but maybe WC3 if more than a few are interested instead) and Quake 3.  They are open for suggestions of game types.  So please suggest UT2K3 and WC3 in the forums at http://gocb.woggo.net  Or email southie@iastate.edu  Tell him you're in but need more info.

They emit light.... if you havent figured that out.  So... yeah.  My computer is getting a facelift.  It will have lights and be "cooler".  In both meanings.

      Its funny to hear my mom prattle on about how much she "knows" about computers and the information age.  Her take is that computers are intelligent.  Actually, having intelligence.  Working behind our backs.  Her take is that AOL IM direct connection physically connects wires between your computer and theirs.  Her take is that MCI is trying to steal our DSL away from us.  Her take is that she is a *hacker*.  And much, much more nonsense!  She seems to have misconstrued statements from Derek and I and "learned" a lot from AOL IM.  In the chat rooms.  Yes, apparently, she's getting quite good at it!  At what, chatting?  Or what I'm afraid *it* actually is.  Also, she claims to have worked with Linux, and Open Source Code!  It's sad.    ARGH.

      OK.  I AM BACK.  After 1 month.  Ok..... I'll tell you what happened.  Brad.... he got arrested for drunk drivng/child endangerment and lost his license.  He still is a major in the USAF and now Derek's gotta drive him to work in Bellevue almost every day.  Derek's getting an SKS out of it, though.  Derek.... still sux at soul calibur.  Me, I've been playing Jedi Knight 2 as I have never played it before (on the radeon) and I just beat Shadows of Undrentide (the perfect expansion pack!).  Did I mention that I hassled with Qwest for a month to get internet?  Christ!  Sonja's getting married next year.  Eleanor's art gallery (Akar in Iowa City) is getting to be well known in the states and other countries.... she also will be giving me her car.  Which reminds me that I need my permit... I'm so lazy.  I think people will just drive me places..... well... I need to drive myself places.      Like titty bars.

      Ok, so I had this weird dream.  It starts out that I'm in this building, all metallic and stuff.  I have this sword, which is my viking sword... but its sharpened and not rusty.  So I give it a few swings and it seems fine.  Suddenly, someone is with me and we both need to kill these goblins.  But they're the Everquest goblins.... yeah.    So as we're cleaving through the masses of goblins that wave their hands at us to attack, we realize there are more in the floors below us.  Which kinda reminds me of Zero Tolerance for the Sega Genesis.  Suddenly, as I'm screaming obscenities like the Colony Marines from Aliens (which I saw last night), a sword appears to my left... shiny and white/gray.  It has a guard like a sai (meant to catch other swords), a convenient hand guard, and what looks like a chain of some sort connecting it to another sword.  So I think to myself... SHIT YES, SWORD CHUCKS (a la Fighter from 8bit theater, which I read too much)!   Now I'm cleaving through goblins with ease and I look at the carnage I am sewing.  Blood and guts everywhere, like Bishop from Aliens.... I have the urge to vomit, but am told to move on.  Then, as we go through an elevator, I can't find my swords!  So I'm telling my partner I need them and I can't go with out my swords.  Well, the dream gets vague and I can't recall the other parts here.

      Well.  Being the quake 3 master that I am, no one dared start a Quake tournament.  And justly so!  UT?  Cancelled as well for so same reason, most likely!  CS?  Well, I cleaned up with the AK47 and the benelli m3 pumpo!  In all but one of the tournament matches, I had the high score of my team!  If you wanna see for yourself and make sure I don't lie, talk to WrathS 01 on AIM.  Oh, and I won a Dawn poster.  Yippie.  I mean I freakin own an ATI gfx card!  Get it right people!

      Allow me to tell you what I ate tonight:  Succulent morsels of shrimp cocktail, crabcakes, and es cargot were the appetizers. The salad was chopped with a Russian dressing. The main course was a succulent tray of king crab legs with lemon and hot butter (liquid). The tab: $333.34   I have never felt so rich in my life.

      As the week progresses, I find myself in a bit of a quandary...  Bridget seems to act like I'm the best thing since sliced bread.  Let me add perspective.... sliced bread is the king of the 'non-sweet' bakery.  So am I to her.  A king.  Or, more accurately, a really attractive king.  So here's the dilemma, she wants me to go to her place for dinner.  Sounds interesting, right?  Not to me, I barely know her and her phone doesn't even work.    So I really don't wanna go to her place.  So I won't.  Though I really don't want to crush her.  Well, eh.  Too bad.   =========== HUMOR ===========  WrathS 01: well im gonna go ahead and delete my c: replacement on d: WrathS 01: since im not gonna be reformatting mralexpants: lol mralexpants: good WrathS 01: CHRIS?!?!?! mralexpants: stfu mralexpants: lol WrathS 01: HAS:DGO"SU{U HP{IJ mralexpants: stfu you goon

      Time for Wes's obligatory firday night post.  Well, I ate at B on B tonight. I reinstalled Halflife (no button/mouse lag).  I watched an ATi demo, and a new HL2 bink video showing off directx9.  I got a working Quake 3 key. And I just swapped out my keyboard for a better one.

      Helping people find stuff purely on accident is great.  Logan came by to pick up a windows 2000 cd but it was jsut a burn and he needed the real deal of xp, 2000, or 98.  So he leaves and 3 minutes later I'm rummaging through Eleanor's old computer box.  And there's a fucking Windows 98SE CD.  How COOL IS THAT?!?  So he's on his way to pick it up now.

      Ok, someone needs to make an 'anti-woot'ing ordinance for people who have never played a modern day (1996-2003) computer game.  Its not right.  Just because I may wear a t-shirt, or you watch teen girl squad, doesn't mean you can say woot.  Its not right.  Its like cheerleader saying 'I want to paint my face white and wear chains and dark clothes'.  You're not goth!  Hence, here, you're not geek!  So don't act like it!

      Derek's baaack!  Well, as we were throwing the shuriken in the basement, he tells me why his face looks kinda fucked up.  He got a black eye and a split lip in a fight.  Apparently he was drinking and was wondering if he was too drunk to drive home (from a friends place, where the party was at).  So he assumed a leg balancing kung fu position.  All of the sudden,  "HEY KARATE KID, YOU PUSSY"  And Derek turned to me like he did a week ago at the party and said, "What, what was that?"  "Does that karate get you girls?" "Its kung fu, asshole, and she's with me. *points*"  Suddenly, he explains, he was sucker punched by one of a circle of five assholes.  Ok, are you with me here?  This is probably one of his ascensions from basic kung fu abilities to more advanced fighting.  Shenmue style 5 on 1 brawling.   He is hit 4 times in the face and head in ten seconds and all he can do is defend himself and do horse kicks (I've been horsed by Derek when we were sparring.  He kicked both my legs and I couldn't fucking stand).  Then , a punch comes in and he fucking grabs it.  Being drunk(ish) as he was, he never expected that to happen.    "He's FAST!"  The puncher was actually amazed.  Then another guy just sucker punches him again on his left eye.  Soon, after he continues to dodge multiple blows (he only got hit EIGHT TIMES IN THE HEAD) he is told to leave.  Being smart as he is, he complies.  Now he's walking into the street when the guys talk cool to him and he turns to face them, thinking its all over, they want to make peace.    The chode fucking punches him in the mouth, splitting his lip.    Derek eventually goes home, barely in pain (except for the headache from the drinking/blows to the head).  So, the parts I didn't describe here you can imagine he was Ryo Hazuki in Shenmue and was doing miscellaneous moves to defend from 5 other goons like in the game.  I really admire my bro.

      Well, since Derek got his steel toe boots, he went loco on a wooden chair.  Like, kicking the wood off it and splintering it.  So about an hour or so ago, I had the great idea of taking the chair and RIPPING IT TO SHREDS with my sword.  It worked out really well.  So, yeah.  It was in fragments when I was done with it.   RIP YA TAH SHREDS!  Aaaaah.... booze.  Can't a fool drink in peace?    Extra credit to whomever can flooble chat box the name of whoever said that.

      I never mentioned this, but I'm happy.  Amber really likes my gift and was wearing it on friday!  Also, Kill Bill is the best movie ever.  Well..... its a great movie that topples over others.  My dad is cool for liking Tarentino.  Also, I am going to be filling out a position for my underlings when Keith F. leaves. Thats right, guys (or girls, I mean, if you really want to get your hands dirty) YOU WILL BE GETTING A JOB AT EMPIRE STORAGE.  Advantages:  Flexible hours, Friendly boss, simple tasks that take hours to do.  Getting paid.  Disadvantages:  Gary when he ignores what you say, simple tasks that take hours to do, getting paid to little at times.  Yes, Gary pays you a little low, but its worth it for the hours.  Plus, here, you can do pretty much what you do on the weekends at work.... like... mowing... weeding/whacking... eating food... counting boxes...taking inventories.... and accounting (cept he only likes me to do that)!  Also, the obligatory killing small vermin and cleaning out units and picking up trash (one of the shittier jobs I'm gonna have you do).  Workers need to have little or no back pain, must have a some job experience, tolerance to physical exertion and dirty conditions,  and thats all I can think of.... maybe having a car.  Yeah, definitely a car.  Talk to me later, anyone.

Me: Don't bust MY nuts, I need those to impregnate girls! Dad: Be quiet. Me: *Points to Kirn* There.... thats where I impregnate girls. Dad: You're bad, Wes! *laughs*  When are you smartest, before, during, or after sex? Me: After? Dad: During, because you're plugging into the mainframe! *Laughter*

       urlLink alexp06's Xanga Site   I felt like zinging someone.  Soooooo.  I'm just gonna post the lyrics to Countdown to Extinction by Megadeth Since its a badass song.  Endangered species, caged in fright Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight The stage in set, now pay the price An ego boost don't think twice Technology, the battle's unfair You pull the hammer without a care Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man Pseudo-start, the hunt is canned ... The hunt is canned  All are gone, all but one No contest, nowhere to run No more left, only one This is it, this is the Countdown to Extinction  Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare The skin and thophy, oh so rare Silence speaks louder than words Ignore the guilt, and take your turn Liars anagram is "liars" Man you were never even there Killed a few feet from the cages Point blank, you're so courageous ... So courageous  Chorus  One hour from now Another species of life form Will disappear off the face of the planet Forever ... and the rate is accelerating   Ok, the lyrics may sound very green-peacey, but the sound is badass.

       urlLink Diabloii.net Guest Articles     "u have no life" or "you have no friends and just play d2 all day" He is mad because you are better than he is, and to boost his ego, he wants to prove that even though you beat him in the Diablo II part of life, he beats you in other parts.  Your reply: Even if what he says is true, you have to crush your opponent in every way possible. Your advantage here is that he cannot see you. Tell him you have plenty of friends, that you ar teh star footbal playa on ur skools team, that you excel in many school subjects and will make it further in life that he ever will, that you are a drug dealer and have tons of money . . . The possibilities are endless. Try to limit yourself to two of these real-life traits though. Oh, and do not tell them you are Batman, it will not work.

      Also, I think my mom is really pissy at my dad and she may leave when I'm out of highschool.  She actually said it, which makes me very sad/angry.  If she's gonna leave, leave.  What she's doing is just leeching money and shit if she really loves him no more.  I don't hate her, but her plans of leaving aren't thought out at all.  She knows not what she wants or where she will go.  Guh, I'm so confused.  Franz, I'm sorry for any and all shit I gave you when this happened to you.

      Derek:  I should make poison Wes: *laughter* Derek:  A honey based poison... honey, water, and tea based.  That stuffs toxic.  Derek's logic isn't unfounded... he was dabbling in potion making (energy potion) and put an energy pill, some coffee, some tea, some tablespoons of honey and sugar, some herbal stuff, ginseng, kavakava root, and feverfew into a mug.

      Well at around 8:30, I got a call from Vannier saying we're going to Scary Acres.  So... we picked up Beckman and went.   It was waaay the hell out there and it was like 9 or so when we got there.  We were waiting in lines for at least an hour in the cold and Beckman didn't have a jacket.  So, yeah, I was sorry for him and said I'd buy him a double quarter pounder because the haunted castle was sub-par.  On the plus side, I learned a lot about what Beckman was up to recently and stuff(he's 2 or so pieces away from winning a plasma TV in the Mcdonald's Monopoly).  So the three of us went to Mickey-D's and chowed down.  Mmmmmm...... heart-disease-y.  Then we dropped Beckman off.  Then as Kyle and I were in the car, I realized my zipper was undone.  And I don't know how long it was like that, heh.  Oh well.    DON'T FORGET TO SET YOUR CLOCKS BACK!

      So I was at work until a little while ago.   11 to 5.  Not baaaad.  It was cold as bittersweet fuck out there.  I did some mowing, and some cleaning of units.  I weed-whacked.  It turns out that I'm apparently a natural at it.  I wasn't surprised.    >:^O  Hahahaha, I love that face.  So then I got to use the big, riding mower.  Like you sit and drive it.  And then I put it away.  I was thinking about making a small weeks worth of comics called 'Grand Theft Mower' or 'Grand Theft Storage Units'.  I need a name for that.  It would be funny... get Alex to polish it  up a bit.  Whatever you guys want, really.    So as I was leaving... Gary was like, "You hungry?"  And of course I hadn't eaten yet.  So I was like "YEAH!"  So he hands me a chicken. Like.... A rotissorie chicken, whole, in like those plastic things you pick cooked chicken up at the store.  Just... hands it to me.  So I started eating it in the car, bare hands.   Now I'm still munching on this scrumptious chicken; with a fork, of course.  Hahaha, it rules.  Ok, I guess thats it.  Oh, do you really want a 'Driving Nazi' shirt?  I could probably make one or something.  That would be hilarious.

I have only started to listen to The Clash only because Derek put 'London Calling' in the hard drive (aah, good ole mp3'z folder).  I feel like I need to make use of all the 6 gigs of music I have.    Its just that.... I don't know.  Fear?  Maybe.  I noted in my Autobiographical writing (which is extremely gritty and true, If I get it back, if you want, you people can read it) that I am a very paranoid person.  I feel as though most of my recent friends are just there to have me as a foil (a person who is comically awkward compared to them).  When I say that, I mean, my 'popular' friends.  Are they just there to not be there when I'm down?  Just there to get away with saying things behind my back?  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just paranoid like I always was.  Its just... I'm not a popular person.  Look at me, for God's sakes.    Then I post here, hoping that someone reads it, someone comments on it. I notice that I have gotten 50 hits in 5 days. You see that flooble?  Thats where you comment.  Not to fucking (jokingly) quote John Romero.  I recently made a comic.  Please, tell me what you think!  I am posting daily, and very deep things.  I am greeted with silence.    Thanks a bunch   And now I get all these mixed signs from people... and I don't know what to do or what to say or this or that.  I think of certain people a lot and I don't know why. I think of that divorce thing and hatred literally CONSUMES ME.  I feel like doing something, but want to be tactful.  Then I realize I'm me, and then realize I have little tact.  And look, now I think I'm getting teary-eyed. Fucking Christ.  What should I do?  Quaenam voluntas ego effectus?

      I was gone in Des Moines today.  In the car I pencilled out GT:Empire Storage.  It should be pretty funy, if not violent.   Speaking of violence, I like it.  I'm sorry if any of you don't, but I guess that separates people in a way.  Also, that driving nazi idea is funny.  Probably not wearable in school.... but still funny.  Tell me if you need help making it.

      On another note, that was some darn good durian.  As my dad says.... its very hard to get a good one... to pick a winner, I would phrase.  Those 'canned ones' were extremely flavorful.  And oh man, its like nothing you've ever tasted, for my non-durian eating friends.  You probably wouldn't like it.  Mainly because of the smell.  I think it smells odd, but its also sweet in its odor.  It tastes like.... I don't know... nuts, rum, banana (wtf?  I don't know), pudding, and some weird other thing I can't put my finger on.  Its definitely an acquired taste.  Good thing I have acquired it.  Its such a good thing.

      So I wrote a prose poem.  I actually had the idea as I was walking home from school last Tuesday and "Countdown to Extinction" came on in my pda.  So yeah, I was listening to that song, Holy Wars, Peace Sells (all 3 by Megadeth), Fight Fire With Fire (by Metallica) and another when I wrote this:  Relentless  by  Wesley Smith 	 ~~~~~~~~~~  Man took up the club and hunted Man made fire to live easier Man built villages to share and live  Relentless to improve his live  Man took up the sword and killed his brother Man made steel to work his will Man built castles to hoard his wealth  Relentless to hold more power  Man took up the gun and warred in the name of Peace Man made homes to live in dreams Man built cities to enforce his rules  Relentless to stave off his fears  Man took up the machines and they did his bidding Man made himself arrogant to be strong Man built bombs to kill Himself... 							 Too late to relent, Man has gone too far.

      Either I'm really lazy, I don't say things right, or my mom doesn't listen.  I said I wanted a sandwich.  You know..... ham and cheese and maybe one braunschweiger.  Mistake Number 1:  Ordering people around.  Mistake Number 2: Asking for pickles, more specifically, dill pickles.  Because I get my sandwhiches as asked, but I get fucking sandwhich pickles.  The SWEET PICKLES.  WHY?!?!!?  Does god hate me??  Its like I specifically asked for dill, but I get the complete opposite.  WrathS 01: DONT YOU HATE SANDWICH PICKLES??!?! WrathS 01: they are dill pickles' bitch. SupraBoost89: yeah so annoying WrathS 01: pickles arent supposed to be sweet, get it right  But see, I'm lazy and ordered my mom around which is a bad habit.  Haven't done it in a while.  And plus, look, I'm whining about my freakin sandwhiches because my life is actually pretty good right now.  No bad things to whine about.

      Funny story, today.  I was in PE and the new weightroom has these bodyfat/weight mindicator dealies.  They look like an arcade machine with a big touch-screen display.  I was like the last one up and inputted my height, age, and sex.    After doing everything correctly on my part, the machine displayed that I was 150 lbs with 15% body fat (twice!) and 100 lbs with 9% body fat (also twice, hahah).  So its gotta be my chi internal energy, thats diverts the pulse the machine shoots through you.  Screwed up, eh?

      So I washed my face again for the third time today.  But I took a good look at my dripping wet face.  Its insane, really, how much more different I look when I stare at myself.  Its like looking at a wholly different person. I hardly recognized myself.   I guess we all grow up thinking that this is what we look like, and until we look at ourselves for a bit can we appreciate the change.  In other news, I had another bout with deja vu.  This time I was playing some Frag Ops.  I was on this arctic map (level) and here's what was deja vu, as I recall.  My teammate, a terrorist in a black ski mask walks up to a door with a glass window at the top.  He then turns around, looks directly at me, and walks right, to another door.  I eagerly look at the door he left to notice that nothing was there.  So then he walks away from the door on my right and I scan its window as well.  Then I come face to face with a Counter-Terrorist.  The door is between both of us and I hastily type 'Spec Ops guy HERE!'.  Thats pretty much what was deja vu.  Then I continued playing the game.  How lame.  It was understood, I am hungry now, therefore I eat and sleep, gonna what, is. I the healthy habit without of being have known thats, but me whom gonna it does what, am it corrects, is? I center be completed cripes.

The sun is hot the sun is not a  place where we could live.  But here on earth there'd be no life without the light it gives.  We need its light, we need its heat, the sunlight that we see, the sunlight comes from our own sun's atomic energy. The Sun is a mass of incandesant gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace, where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees.  The sun is hot (The sun is so hot that everything on it is a gas. Aluminum, copper, iron, and many others). The sun is large (if the sun were large, a million earths would fit inside.  And yet, it is only a middle-sized star).  The sun is far away (About 93 million miles away, and thats why it looks so small!)  But even when its out of sight, the sun shines night and day.  We need its light, we need its heat, the sunlight that we see, the sunlight comes from our own sun's atomic energy.  Scientist have found the sun is a huge atom-smashing machine.  The heat and light of it are caused by the nuclear reactions between Hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and helium.  The Sun is a mass of incandesant gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace, where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees.  SING IT, FOOLS!

      Wow, today started off kinda cold and got colder as I worked.  But things seriously picked up.  I played some Diablo 2 for a good few hours (Haven't done that in a while).  I got some good stuff, I got lucky.  Then I went to Cara's house.  People were 'ravaging' and such.  Haha, oh well.  And Nightmare Before Christmas was the movie from 9 to 11.  Yeah, I missed the rocky horror picture show.  Eh.  But Kim showed up and even more talking began.  People (luckily I knew everyone there and everyone we were talking about) got into funny stuff.  Ah.... good times.  It was best at the end with her and I.  She's on my mind so much....  I can't help but smile....

Also, my Latin has horrible sentence structure.  Its a 2000 year old dead language, cut me some slack.

      For some reason, when in public places, I think violent thoughts.  Maybe I need anger management, or something.  Its like, I'm paranoid that the next dude I see will start shit with me and I need to take a course of action.  Such as if he were to push me, pat my stomach or something, I would proceed to strike at his solar plexus with a palm hand.  Its like I'm overreacting, but then I continue to think, well, what if he dodges (unlikely) or somehow blocks it?  Well then I would proceed to pivot and smash his face into the brick wall.  If he would throw a taekwondo punch at me, then I would twist his arm.  By twisting his arm to a near breaking point, I would then manage to somehow walk up the ramp and toss him over the edge, breaking his legs.  Ah, so violent.  I think its from my brother's influence on my life.   Well, thats as far as you're going to see into my mind today.  Happy thoughts, happy thoughts.

      Am I doing something wrong?  I hope not.  When I hug you remember that it will mean something.  I have not had an actual relationship before so I cannot tell if I am doing things fast or slow.  But my signs of affection are there.  *sigh*

      Just remember that time can become a gaping hole of emptiness and lost hope.  Time can't heal all problems.  Sometimes it can only make them worse.  Think about a hungry dog, left out in the cold.  Leaving him to time, he'll get even hungrier, angrier, but then eventually die.  Is that what someone really wants?  A dead dog?  Sometimes to solve something, to get something, action is required.  At least an active interest in getting something.  But sure, time is a good thing.  Love and time is good, but thats too general.  Its about the slow advancements that happen during that time.  Just saying time isn't enough.  Nothing is implied.  Its all about what happens in that time and what you decide to do, what actions you take.  Sometimes actions are bad too.  But actions get things done.  It depends on what actually gets done can you determine if the action was beneficial.  A recent action in my case was telling Kim I wanted to be together with her.  To me it was beneficial, and I hope it was to her.  I believe that what happens between us during the time allowed between us will make a certain feeling blossom.  A good feeling.  So when I offer something, telling her things, those are my actions.  My ways of advancing the relationship in a simple way.  But if time is whats required, then I guess I might just have to ease up.  I just want the feeling to remain there.  I'm gonna keep moving on to talking about those ever present 'What Ifs'.  To me, your life is not bracketed with different possibilities.  Its a straight line.  I guess it is fate-like. Simple acceptance.  Only when you look back can you see the illusion of choice, like a pruned tree or fork of lightning.  By asking what if, you are trying to imagine being a different person, who would be asking a whole different set of questions.... or maybe the same.  Do you want to be a different person?  Change everything around?  I don't.  I'm going to accept my line.  Will you?  I like that you think highly of me, however you spoke of only my positives.  What about my arrogance?  My sarcasm?  My tendency to assume things?  And my 'not-a-Michalangelo's-David-Body' body?  I guess you don't mind.  The way I see it, I don't view your 'problems' as problems, but as quirks.  Our quirks also make us who we are, in addition to our positives.   You say you're moody and cranky?  Bah, I don't mind.  I like that sometimes.  You downplay yourself too much.  Its not a bad thing to be like that sometimes. What am I going to get in return?  I hope a meaningful relationship that doesn't break down.    Ah, we are different, yet the same, when you think about it.  I think that makes for a good catalyst.   Wow, that was a very meaningful post.

      I have been bed-ridden the whole day.  Blargh.    Well I have taken some drugs and am a lot better I guess, but I still am pretty ill.  Looks like I will have to do those transfers Sunday (like I said in my last post, heh).  On another note, I wish I could know what people were thinking, if they're lying to me, or putting on a mask just for me.  If I hang with you, can't you be yourself?    All my problems, my laziness, my anger, my paranoias, you all get it here, I'm not lying about anything.  I may omit some details or cover some stuff to protect certain parties, though.  Going into more detail into my life, I made peace with my mother, who stopped chatting and doing other bullshit.  She told me that she would never leave her family, and that meant a lot to me.  I'm not so paranoid or afraid now, and I feel much closer to her.  Moving on, yesterday was 3 weeks.  :)  I'm gonna go back to bed, maybe watch a little Mad TV/SNL.  G'night

      *smiles*  Thats pretty much all that I can say/do.  Aside from hacking up my lungs.  I worked desk tonight.  Then Kim came over and we worked unsuccessfully on those darn teeshirt transfers.  Eh, I'll do em right, tomorrow.    And then I went to her house, we finished a movie, took some smiley faced pictures and then ate some of the BEST FOOD I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE.  I hope that wasn't too specific.  Now to sleep.

      Yes to all.  Though I can try to say that I understand, and even I have been like that, I can't completely help.  Like last night I was thinking about death and dying and such.  I was thinking about if I were just to drop dead, or something, who would care?  I realized everyone I know well would.  The people behind me right now, they probably wouldn't (I'm in Web Page).    Life is fucked up.  These thoughts pass. Or, at least I hope.  Yeah I'm sorry, I can be such a dick.  Heh, you wanted to see my dark side, there you go.  Its a jerkface/self centered ass.  I didn't really mean all my 'fuck you's'.  It just its been a little while since I had felt like that.

      WELL FUCK ME EVEN MORE.  FUCK ME.  PERIOD.  GODDAMNIT.  I FUCKING LOST MY GIGANTIC FUCKING POST. FUCK THIS FUCK THAT, AND FUCK YOU.  I MEAN IT.  Ok, I am going to try and remember what I wrote.  Sorry about not posting Wednesday.  I decided I would rather play Alex's barbarian so he won't get deleted ever again.  I lost some gems in the process, but eh.  Ok, I repeal my 'fuck you' to Alex, since he fixed my links because I was too lazy to do hyperlinking in html.    Then I also decided to replay Max Payne 2 because there is a secret happy ending in Dead on Arrival mode.  But this makes me angry For those of you who don't know who Max Payne is, or what 'Noir' is, let me explain.  "Film Noir (literally 'black film or cinema') was coined by French film critics who noticed the trend of how dark and black the looks and themes were of many American crime and detective films released in France following the war. It is a style of American films that first evolved in the 1940s, became prominent in the post-war era, and lasted in a classic period until about 1960.   Film noir is a distinct branch, sub-genre or offshoot of the crime/gangster sagas from the 1930s (i.e., Little Caesar (1930), Public Enemy (1931) and Scarface (1932)), but different in tone and characterization. The criminal, violence or greed elements in film noir are a metaphoric symptom of society's evils, with a strong undercurrent of moral conflict. Strictly speaking, however, film noir is not a genre, but rather the mood, style or tone of a film."  For more info on film noir, or noir in general, go  urlLink Here   Max Payne started out living the American Dream, living in the suburbs of New York with a somewhat nice job of being a boy in blue (a cop).  One day he decides to stay a little longer at the precinct rather than go home to his wife and baby girl.  That was a life changing mistake.  He comes home to find his house has been 'redecorated' by Valkyr(an LSD/PCP type amphetamine drug) junkies under mafia guidance.  He sees his wife and baby girl dead and takes vengeance on the junkies in the form of 9mm bullets to their faces. From that day forward he works on the DEA to pursue Valkyr cases and mafia activity.  Soon, he is asked by his partner to go to a subway station to get some new undercover information.  However that subway is currently the seen of a bank robbery and his partner is subsequently murdered in front of Payne before they can speak about the new lead.  Payne is then the primary suspect in the murder, so he becomes a fugitive cop with nothing to lose.  It may sound corny, but is really moving.  Keeping true to noir, he speaks almost in all metaphors and some seriously messy stuff happens to him.  He goes on some bad Valkyr trips, he is betrayed several times by the mob and the force, and finally winds up in a government plot which he somehow escapes practically unscathed.  Unless you want to count his emotional scars and demons that haunt his spirit from the hundreds of people he was forced to kill.  Then he is pretty scathed.    Anyway, in the second one, his tale starts in a flashback, then another flashback to start from the real beginning.  He moved back to the NYPD and becomes involved in yet another murder/mafia scheme and meets a femme fatalle on the way.  In the end, hallucinations, falling 5 stories, kill people and all, Max loses the only other person he loved.  And finally he understands his pain the hard way.     Now HOW IN THE HOLY HELL ARE THEY GONNA TURN THAT INTO A HAPPY ENDING??  Its not true to noir!  Ok, the above paragraphs were really lame, but if they made a Max Payne movie, I would see it 56261236 times.  Ok now to me.  I have been feeling like utter shit for the past two days.  I got a cold from someone, but they are forgiven; its just a cold, right?  Well this one makes me feel as though Satan himself forced his clawed and gnarled hand down my throat and decided to give me a neck masage (*voice like Max Payne)  Then I decided to wash my face, which wasn't much of a decision at all.  It was more a choice like, "Hmm, I have to shit, should I?"  Of course I should. So anyway I washed my face and applied Tazorac. 3rd time in 24 hours or so.  Here's a point of future reference: ONLY APPLY TAZORAC IN 48 HOUR INTERVALS.  I could not sleep last night because my face felt like a thousand fire ants had decided to make war for control of "Wesley'sfacia".  My face is red, flaking, and cannot be touched.  Also I shaved last night before applying tazorac, dunno if that was good or bad.  Needless to say I stayed home.  So to make myself feel as though I had a little control over how much utter fecal matter was flung at me from above, I decided to take my permit test today.  Since yesterday my papers were missing, but today I have them.  But then as I walk over to where the DOT is located in the mall, I notice that the door is closed.  This fucking fat cop bitch tells me to come back monday, since it closed 3 minutes ago.  BITCH WHAT IN THE FUCK?!?!  THIS TEST WILL TAKE ME TEN FUCKING MINUTES.  LET ME THE FUCK IN, CAN'T YOU WAIT TEN MINUTES TO GO HOME AND EAT YOUR KRISPY KREME DONUTS??! HUH?! HUH??!  So now that I am in utter pain and my spirit is crushed because I can't get my permit I'm sitting here thinking about fate.  In fate, isn't every action justified?  As such, me getting sick?  Me getting my face fucking Acided off (new word.)?  Me getting denied the chance of getting my permit when I want (the picture would've sucked, I guess)?    The only person that could possibly benefit from that one is that fat cop bitch.  She probably enjoyed getting home to her vibrator and fucking donuts right on time. She probably derives pleasure from  1.  Letting herself get fat and hairy 2.  Vibrators 3.  And denying good people like me the chance to get a simple piece of plastic when I want  In a situation like this I would've lit up a bowl or two of weed.  But I'm not about to do that.  I changed an don't need it to make me feel better and grasp my situation better.  In short, the world has taken a shit on my that only one thing can probably make me feel better.  And it will be tomorrow.  Anyone want to talk about this?

(and alex is fixing this because he's too lazy to copy/paste but not too lazy to make it a link.)   urlLink choice 1    urlLink choice 2    Since apparently gold/gems are out, I guess simple stuff is in, and those remain simple but are still very nice.  I personally like both and need Kim to make up her mind lol.  Come on, I got 150 dollars burning a hole in my pocket.  Its crying to be used.  :)

What else, yeah, not much.  Maybe later I'll go out to the mall and get Kim those tee-shirts.  Maybe drop into Target, too. Not set in stone, though, since my dad's seeing a dying cancer partient today :(  Ok, bye.

      You know, some times, I feel like, "What the fuck.  What am I doing?  Why aren't I doing *that*?! "  This of course is my usual, "I feel as if I'm going to fail in life because I am not challenging myself in high school" rant.  Like, why am I not taking Drivers Ed?  Oh, right, I'm young and an idiot.  Thats why I can take it in summer, instead of Upward Bound (though it does sound cool).  Or why not the tag classes or AP?  I think TAG sponsors the idea that kids are really special.  News flash: kids aren't that special.  Its better just to offer the AP and college stuff rather than inflate their dreams.  TAG may even be a waste.  The only way it is good is that it offers slightly more challenging work, but with a crowd of smart kids so that they don't have to be with the 'normals'.  Think about this:  if you're gonna be working with normals the rest of your life, why not work with them now in normal classes and progress up the bars of classes?  Gah, the idea of tag, to me, is like HitlerYougen.  Bunch of 'elites'.  Pssh.  And which leads me to AP and college credit.  AP, good idea, I'm getting my preliminary classes out of the way so that I may take AP next year. College credit?  Bad idea!  YOU NEED CLASSES IN COLLEGE.  You can't just take the college credit now, its stupid!  In college, you may need English or PE to cushion your GPA for when you do alright in the hard classes (college biology and chemisty and calculus, for me).  Those classes that may seem to be a good idea to take as college credit will screw you later, since you will just be getting B's and maybe even C's in the hard classes you wanted.  Just my 2 cents.  Hmmmmm, there now I feel like I'm making good choices for the future.

      Ok, I may say some stuff like 'I have everything I need'.  Thats pretty much true.  But I don't have everything I *want*.  So here's my (somewhat) expensive Christmas wishlist of what would make me extremely happy.  1. SD cards.  I CAN NOT stress this enough.  Those little storage cards I use in my PDA are like 20 to 40 dollars for a 128 mb card.  With 128 mb I can put 2 albums of songs in my pda, which rules.  Or pictures for my digicam.  Or you can be even better and get a 256 mb one (not Sandisk!) for contiguous storage of large files.  2. AMD Athlon 3000+ Barton socket A CPU with a 333mhz frontside bus speed.  Come on, less than 200 dollars.  I'm asking for this from my parents.  3. A clear Antec case sidepanel.  Less than 30 dollars.  Come ON.  This is perfect.  GO out and order me one.. or buy it, or whatever.  This will definitely make me the happiest for however much it costs.  4. A dvd player.  It doesn't have to be expensive.  Seriously.  I just want to show my dad the magic that is the dvd.  And also have the grip of movies.  I can get my own dvds, don't worry.  5. Hats, gloves, scarfs, winter stuff.  As you may know, I work outside in the morning to 3 pm.  Thats the coldest time of day, pretty much.  Add windchill and hard manual labor and you can imagine how cold I get.  I already got a nice new coat, but the rest would be extremely nice of anyone to get me.  6. Maybe a new scanner?   urlLink Here    Those are pretty cheap flatbed scanners.  7. Cold.  Hard.  Cash.  If you don't want to go out and get me a 60 dollar gift (who would?) just chip me in like 10 to 20 bucks, I won't use it on drugs or anything like that, you can trust me.  I need stuff to spruce up my tech.  Thanks bunches, and if you don't get me anything, don't worry.  I'll be sure to get something for you to make you feel really guilty.  Muahahahah.

      Here's a little factoid: I have developed a tolerance for physical pain.  For instance, my Iron Hand training gave me stronger hands and arms while increasing my ability to feel less pain in my hands.  I want to try to bust a window or something... but that sounds stupid, doesn't it?  I like my showers scaldingly hot.  Well, thats an overstatement.  More like, on the highest setting.  I don't know why.  Maybe it kills more germs?     Either way, to me, if it stings, its probably good for you (EG, Iodine, ah, no better way to know that it works!)  I just slammed my knee into a metal door and made that snarrling noise I tend to make.  You know?  Maybe you don't.  Anyway, it sounds weird.  I won't bother hosting it on my files.  Since its weird.  But after I did that grunt/snarl I just laughed like a maniac.  I shrugged the pain off and walked off.  And it HURT for the first few seconds.  Anyway, I bet if I got into a fight that would definitely help.  Hmmmmm... I caught a moth with my hand.  That was kinda cool.    Less about me being a bad motherfucker, more about me being stressed out.  I had to freaking write 4 poems this week, and finished my story one today.  Goddamn my stress made me write.  I hope its good enough for Mrs. Ogre. I'm sorry I was really angry, time wasting Algebra makes me irritable.  I don't know.... maybe I'm naturally angry?  Or maybe thats yet another one of my psychological reactions to stress.  Excuses, right?  I still need to finish my Algebra 2.  It confounds me sometimes, but other times, when I understand the concept, I don't need practice, its so easy.  Right now with.. umm... exponential stuff, I know what the deal is, but I don't have the time (Hahahah I have the time to vent here, though) to do pointless crap.  Anyway. Stuff calls. Gotta pack my bags.

      Note to anyone:   I need posters.  Just FYI  Hmmm I am sooooooooooo out of ideas to write about, its not funny.  I mean, I could divulge the most secret recesses of my brain, but that would obviously scare you off.  I'm not even kidding.  Hmmmm thats why I don't really talk about the inner workings of my brain much.  The facial stinging stopped a day or two ago completely, so I'm gonna put some tazorac on, and shave.  Good stuff.  Spinning the subject, I don't know whether or not to buy the cell phone.  Do I really really need one?  Really?  It would be kinda nice. I could call people and stuff.  If I need rides.  If I wanna do stuff and I'm not on AIM.  And just to hear another voice.  Also, It would work wonders for work.  It would be 25 bucks a month.  Sure I could afford that, but it would put a damper on my total income.  Plus I would have to learn all this new cell phone lingo like 'roaming' and......stuff.  And the workings of the plan.  And other stuff.  Although it would be nice......  Moving on, I tried to install Call of Duty, but it wouldn't work!  DAMN YOU, CDS BURNT BY AZNS!  Eh, I got it from Derek, who left today with about 6 eggrolls.   Call of Duty is an extremely realistic WW2 game.  Its practically the only ww2 game I would ever enjoy playing ever.  Aside from battlefield 1942.  But in fact, I probably would enjoy playing against bots only, since people online in that game would totally kick my ass.  So anyway, Call of Duty = OWN!  Then I beat the Deus Ex 2 demo, not very long, if you take the 'Hey, theres a guard, I'm gonna stab you, get your shotgun, hack that terminal, mann the turret, kill the other guards with the minigun, kill the leader-chick, and talk to the guy that initially gave me the mission' approach.  Like maybe half an hour.  Its models are gorgeous, and so is the lighting.  On par with Max Payne 2.  Yeah. Even better maybe?  Its very interactive, much like the first Deus Ex, which I barely played.  I haven't played Diablo 2 in a while and am kind've fiending.  Some things have gotten in the way of my game playing.  I haven't played Counter-Strike for four weeks, can you guess why?  7|-|3 |2345()/\/ |2|-|'//\/\35 \/\/17|-| |_1/\/\|3 9()/\/3  Hahahahah I just spoke leet.  Havn't done that in a while.  Here:  llmztranll: when our fam was at the zoo, and we were speaking vietnamese among ourself and some guy just started joining in w/ our convo llmztranll: and we looked back.....and we were like whooooo WrathS 01: *IM ACTUALLY LAUGHING* llmztranll: but it was cool WrathS 01: THATS HILARIOUS llmztranll: but he also lives in San Franciso llmztranll: where there a lot of vietnamese llmztranll: and he also took classes in college  WrathS 01: still talk to him or something? llmztranll: no llmztranll: he was just a stranger we met on the street WrathS 01: what were you talking about? llmztranll: i don't know llmztranll: but its one of those encounterment that u can't ever forget in ur life WrathS 01: because thats like the equivalent of me and my family talking about, say, abortion, and some dude just jumping in and saying 'Well I think abortion is wrong and against God's scheme.  What'd you all eat for lunch?  Hi my names Bill.' llmztranll: something like that  I thought that was pretty funny.  Anyway, I'm out of ideas for todizzle.

      AC/DC - Back in Black  Back in black  I hit the sack  I've been too long I'm glad to be back [I bet you know I'm...]  Yes, I'm let loose  From the noose  That's kept me hanging about  I've been looking at the sky  'Cause it's gettin' me high  Forget the hearse 'cause I never die  I got nine lives  Cat's Eyes  Abusin' every one of them and running wild   CHORUS:  'Cause I'm back  Yes, I'm back  Well, I'm back  Yes, I'm back  Well, I'm back, back  (Well) I'm back in black  Yes, I'm back in black   Back in the back  Of a Cadillac  Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack  Yes, I'm in a bang  With a gang  They've got to catch me if they want me to hang  Cause I'm back on the track  And I'm beatin' the flack  Nobody's gonna get me on another rap  So look at me now  I'm just makin' my play  Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way   CHORUS   Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back  Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back  Well, I'm back, back  Well I'm back in black  Yes I'm back in black   hooo yeah  Ohh yeah  Yes I am  Oooh yeah, yeah Oh yeah  Back in now  Well I'm back, I'm back  Back, I'm back  Back, I'm back  Back, I'm back  Back, I'm back  Back  Back in black  Yes I'm back in black   Out of sight!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Yeah, I'm back.  Woohoo!  I missed you all, but   you  especially.  It was so sweet that you called, but everyone else started cracking jokes.  Like calling me Wesley-San (HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?!  Thats like calling an American a Limey!).  It was sweet though, and just what I needed, since Ryan/Sonja Jess/Eleanor were cuddling up and making me feel blah.  I got burnt on my arms and back and front.  Kinda bad.  Yeah, I'll make sure never to say that I don't burn (I don't when I have sun block!).  So I had to apply some ointment.  Hahah, ointment.  Thats always the answer.  Got a rash?  Ointment.  Cut?  Ointment.  Burn?  Ointment.  Infection?  Ointment.  My arms are killing me from all the lifting I did, not to mention my freaking bag.  It was too...... heavy.  Wow, this is turning into a whine-fest.  Sonja reminded me that I was a whiner when I was little one.  I remember........  Every 1/10 old couples were over tan.  Old.  Over.  Tan.  Just..... wrong...........  What really was nice was all the relaxation I got and all the nes I played, oh man, that ruled.    I was stuck doing a lot of homework at the end, which was lame and apparently I missed out on a nice everglades excursion.  Aw.  BUT I HAVE PICTURES OF THE CONDO!  TALK TO ME IF YOU WANT TO SEE!!!!!  Hmmm... but there were two things that totally fucked the vacation up at the end, and I had to lie kind've to say I was happy. 1. The breakage of the screen (its pretty much all better, cept for the cracks, damnit) 2. Although this may be my place to write, I can't write this one here.  Hm, ok, I thought about it and I am gonna get 2 towers on DVD.  Sometime this week maybe if I am not killed by homework.   Did I say that when I went on my lonesome walk I glanced up on a shooting star?  I was completely alone on that beach, and I made my little wish 20 minutes later, eh.  Ok, thats as much as I think I can recall.

      Well, hell, I am a tard.  I broke my pda's screen...the beutiful(sic) Toshiba screen has two cracks in it and has a nice purple tinge on both.  I am so freaking stupid.  I was buying myself a suit and in the changing room stepped on my pants.  With the pda in them.  CRA-CRACK.  Damn.  It still works perfect, sounds perfect (listening to some megadeth on it now, with my 'borrowed' Koss headphones) but I hate those two purple lines.  That is, hated.  Because over night and repeated playing of old NES roms, I think the lcd display may have filled up or reformed or whatever. One of the purple lines is gone, leaving a little thin crack (hardly visible) and the BIG purple tinge is fading, and will leave another crack.  Hmmmm.... I hope it will leave, that is.  Damn, though.  The stylus recognition is still as good as it ever was, though.  I think replacing the screen though, will cost too much, so I'm just gonna give you the pda, Franz, for 20 bucks.  Maybe just as your belated xmas gift.  Since its both inherantly cool and shitty.  Yes, no?  Back to the suit I bought, oh man is it nice.  Its black and some sort of thin and non-itching wool.  I think I just my wear the jacket religiously and jeans and a tshirt from now on because I look so freakin' good in it.  Oh, and I got heavy comments from my sisters and their boyfriends after that 2 hour call.  Yeah... Ryan is now calling me Wesley-San now.  I'm sorry I couldn't talk any longer last night, but they were being loud since they knew it was you.  That night I saw 2001:a space odyssey.  And let me tell you something. I DO NOT GET THE ENDING.  And HAL is EVIL.  And one letter behind IBM. Get it?  I was like... OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH when I realized that.  So I did bio/zoo today. Hmmm. gregor mendell is the coolest.  My family had an interesting conversation about our history of manic depression.  It made Sonja have psychotic episodes and threaten people and come up with weird big brother theories and got landed in the looney bin for a bit.  Same for my mother multiple times.  Ok, so what if this happened to Derek?  Honestly, think about it.  A guy who could take a beating from 5 other guys, with 2 years of kung fu, 5 of ninjitsu, knives upon knives in his room, some guns, and he goes manic.  He could be a certifiable public menace... he would *kill someone*.  I guess weed stops him from going whacked out, right?  I hope.  I could just imagine 9 orderlies surrounding him and a nurse with a huge syringe trying to overpower him.  He's in the center frothing at the mouth (as he tends to do when he's exasperated) and he's punching these people out, in fits of manic rage.  Its a scary thing... it may happen to me, too.  Sometimes our anger gets a hold of us.... scary.   Its a common occurance for my sisters to split under pressure, Sonja split in high school and when writing her Master's thesis.  Some crazy stuff happened in high school.......  The reason I try to keep a load of work is because of this history of snapping.  I can sometmes feel it may happen.  Thats why I don't get involved in 4 or so activities and all the other crap because I fear for my own safety and stability.  I'm fairly certain I can get by with my goals without overachieving like some people.    But I know I shouldn't let myself go into a spiral of laziness like Derek.  Sure he's in college, but the man takes few classes and such.  He doesn't realize thathe should've extended himself and his education to get a paying job to support himself.  Theres a reason for school.... he can't rely on my parents forever, he seems to think he can.  SO..... what else.   Haha, if tallness is a dominant trait... hmmmmm... ;)  I miss you, Kim.  I'm gonna go on a long lonesome walk now.

      Whoa, I'm here in Marco beach working on my tan, sippin' g&t's.  Yeah.  I have probably walked like 8 miles in these two days, the beach is gorgeous.  What else.... oh right, I've been workin' out and doing lapsin the pool, too, so I get enough workouts in.  Sonja, Ryan, Jess, Eleanor, and Lucy are all here, its nice.  But jesus, they can nit pick and fight, makes me sad.  It also makes me sad when all I can think about is you *ahem, you know*, and how much I already miss seeing you and talking to you. Hmmmm.  Its a crazy idea.. maybe I could get you to come down here some time.  Nah, thats crazy.  What else, I've been playing sooo much nes, its not funny.  In fact, after I was hammered, I had a huge discussion with my sisters and the guys about old nes games, hahahha.  We talked about how my cousin Godart was an nes freak (the dutch equivalent of your brother, haha, I'll tell you about that later...)  Yeah I got totally hammered last night, like 5 daquiris and 3 winesand 2 beers.  Woooooo.  I was just thinking bout those 6 signs of love.... ehehehhe.  More on that later... maybe.    Still thinking of you, maybe I should call?  Thats a good idea.  This next one's to pants: we should get 'hordes of underdark' and play nwn again, that would kick ass.  you know.. when i'm not so *whaaapsssh*  ok, later, maybe another post sometime.

      I can safely say that in my opinion, this Friday was the best.  Night.  Ever.  Ok, so I may have screwed up my pda even more, and I didn't see LOTR, and may have encoutered some awkward situations.  Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut everything else redeems those parts.  110%.  I am soooo lucky.  :)

      So I got payed a hefty ammount for that work stuff I do.  Its actually only stressful on the back, the job is.  So after that my parents and I went to the Mekong store on Q street and got some Asian food.  I can already smell the cooking.  I also ate this nice coconut 'dahn bao chi' stuff.  I'm sure it was "XXXX bao chi". It ruled.  And while I was in the store I saw this white guy and his asian wife and their kid; I couldn't help but think *aaaaaaaaw....maybe*. ~~~~~~~~~ I don't *know* either.  I don't ask for you, or anybody, to *know*.  I just want you to be happy.  I just want to be with you.  To talk...personal and private.  To hold...  :)

      SO.  Today I woke up and finished off leftovers from yesterday.  Fun.  Then I watched some of the Young and the Restless, which is the best soap opera in the history of.... soap... operas.  I decided against showering this morning, as is the custom when I had to leave the house quickly.  Me and my dad went out (we got some tacos, since he was hungry) and then went to Best Buy to see if my PDA could be repaired under warranty.  Nope!  So, Alex Apostol, you were right.    I guess it would be cheaper to get that sexy E405 in spring.  Hmmmmmm.  I tried testing stuff out, but Quake, GXmark, and FPSEce did not want to work.  Eh.  Whatever.  Then I waited around in the hospital for my dad to finish seeing some patient.  I played PocketEQ in the lounge.  Yeah, I said I was done with EQ for computer, but not PDAs!  Hee hee.  When I got home I decided to take a nap and I was asleep for about and hour when I was awoken by a call.  I'm kinda let down I couldn't come over, but I'll live.  Eh, thats what relationships are about, a little give, a little take, a little surprise.  I get my hopes up too much in my naivety.  I'm clingy.  Its the way I think; like I won't find someone who is better than you.  I don't want to let go, so I seize up the chance to be with you.  Is that a bad thing?  I could stand some room for improvement, heh.  Please tell me.  I guess I'll stay here.  And maybe play some NwN. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Love.  What is it?  I don't know.  I'd bet that no one  knows  what it is.  Oh, people can speculate, make little questionnaires, create hypothetical situations, analyze what you may do when you are around that certain someone, but its all just that: speculation.  I agree in the sense that love is made in the reaction.  How you think after something (or if you even change), or what you may do can make or break a relationship.  In the end, if there are differences, talking about them and working them out can lead to a stronger bond.  But again... love, who knows, right?  Its many things, and I believe that if someone tries to actually say what it IS, then they deserve to be chain punched in the face.  So thats why I may not say it..... I'm not sure what it is, or if I feel it, or if I am ready, or blah blah blah. Also I don't want to scare you.  Wow I'm being open.  Eh.

      Last night was great.  Heehheeh.  The Kim likes that, too, heh.  Jees her mom came an hour early so we kinda had to put some of *our* time on hold, which was alright, though, since I was looking forward to eating Godly ammounts of Godly food.  Kim's mom sure likes to make people eat.  No complaints here!  Heheheh the kitchen, that was fun.  But next time, make sure that she can't hear  X^O  Maybe I shouldn't reveal sensitive information......   Work today was almost non-existant.  Gary didn't pay me, but I was promised a large sum on saturday.  k'pasjfajpfasfpaj  time for NWN.

      So Gary called us this morning at 11.  Yelled at Derek and I.   Bollocks to him if he can't realize it takes 3 hours to wake Derek up!  Said: Not to come in.    Then he calls us later and says: come in at 1!    HA!  Shows him to mess with Derek's sleep schedule, right?  Well I was ready at 10.  Just needed a ride.  Then after work we went to the mall, got some tai chi and ba gua books, I got some bevvys, and tooled around a bit.  Then I decided we visit Kim in her torture at Target.  Didn't seem happy to see me?  I don't know.  Anyway, I got my haircut before Derek and I left for work.  What a relief!  Feel like a soldier, look like a thief.  Time to slay the dragon, or eat (depending on whether I'll be eating Buddha's food tonight), and then shower and shave n'stuff around 9.  You know what's cool?  When you recognize the han zi characters for "fire" and "jong" on kung fu books.

      Oh, that kicking thing is 'chi gurk' or something.  Thats how it sounds.    Hmmmm I woke up at 12 and went with Derek to Burgers on Broadway, then went to Millard Electronics to drop off the tv (man the guy that works there, is so much ME if I grew long hair and loved Star Trek)  Then we went to work, really late.  At 1:30.  Hahha, then we unloaded a truck of drugs, put them in the units, busted the boxes down, and shoveled some snow.  Fun.  Then we went to get Hyvee and Derek got more tea.  I was like "Get some green tea with han-zi (chinese characters) on it.  Then we look a bit and found 'Giesha type', 'Confucius type', 'Indian guy riding elephant type', and ' Mongol Warrior type'.  So Derek got Djaleen(?) Indian and Mongol type tea.  Then at the checkout I saw a kid in a Strong Bad shirt.   I told him to "rock on, Strong Bad".  Now is the time to play Hordes of the Underdark.... remember:   You can't spell 'manslaughter' without 'laughter.'

Even though I always win, I prefer to avoid fights if possible.  What Video Game Character Are You?       (If you were not Kung Fu Master you would be a Gauntlet Adventurer.)   OWNED.

      Kung Fu makes me very tired.  My legs and arms are covered in sweat and my chest has knots from practice.  Jeepers.  I did 10 minutes of solid chainpunches, then Derek and I rotated from pac tar to this one leg excercise, like tan chi sau, but for legs, kind've.  I wonder if I'm spelling this all correctly?  Hehhh.

      Its funny what one little phonecall can become, heh.  Well its nice to know stuff now, right?  Right.  I'll keep the little jokes to myself, since I have already changed a lot, why not change that, too?  Heh heh.  I *heart* talking to you.  Just don't scare me with that mismatch stuff.  Opposites attract, right?  Buuuuut before I go overboard into my completely odd feelings, I'll describe my current situation.  Well, I'm stripped to my boxer-briefs at the moment, doing a wash, overclocking my gfx card.  Typical nerd stuff since I've got the day free.  I don't know, maybe I'll boot up some Neverwinter Nights?  Sounds like a plan.  Haha, stripped.  You know I woke up 3 or so times this morning, at 10, 12, and 1 and then at 1 I got up and made a huge freaking tortilla and egg and cheese heart attack lunch.    I've been takin' it easy since.  I'm wondering about holding off on shaving till tuesday for obvious reasons.   Hmmm  hmmmmm dunno dunno, I eagerly await that day, since it feels like whatever I'm doing when I'm without is unimportant and boring.  gaaaaaaaaahh its seems like I'm some sort of clingy person.  In a way I am.  Later.

      So Derek left today.... he's gonna go get a job in Iowa City.... finally.  Volunteering went smoothe, lots of the patients were happy, which is amazing and good!  And many of them told me its so great people like me volunteer there, they really do appreciate us.  Its good to know..  Yeah, I'm really happy, I'd be happier if Kim answered the phone, but oh well.  Why am I listening to depressing music (Megadeth - A Secret Place)? Because its the best song ever.

      Happy New Years, everyone!  As you all may know, I'm not one to make resolutions, since I'm already perfect.  HA.  No, I'm not actually... I just like to think so.  Well, well, yet another year down, eh?  One more closer to death.  At least this year I can say I usher it in with a girl whom I care about deeply, I hope we stay together.  So I guess my resolution is just not to be so clingy, not to be such a jerk, and to continue to be a better person than everyone else.... well that kind've came out wrong.  I mean, to be a better person than you.  Wait, still wrong.  To better myself by devoting time to work, volunteering, charity, and my friends, even moreso than I do now!  OK WOOOOOOOOOOOT NEW YEAR!

      All right.  I had a super freaky dream last night.  The first part was me with some people in a supermarket.  But the market was HUGE and had all the wares the Mekong had.  So thats kinda interesting.  Anyway I got lost in it, but found my way out.  Ok, that part of my dream was lame, but it gets weirder.  Suddenly I'm on an airplane, right?  And I have this little.... dealie in my hand that when I push the button, its little helicopter blades make me float.  I also have a little yammucha.   Yes, thats right, a yammucha, the little Jewish hats. Don't ask me why, I do NOT know.  Anyway, I get a knife because I have to go to the rear of the airplane and slice open this IV Pump looking thing... for no reason.  The hard part is that the rear of the airplane is open.  And for some reason I only fall out when I get near it.  So after I get bored of looking where I'm supposed to hack away at this pump, I get sucked out of the plane.  I'm falling 55,000 feet.  So suddenly, I use my little helicopter thing in hopes I can safely land.  Well, I fall anyway.  All of the sudden, before I crash into the earth, I hit 'Esc' and quick load my game (??) and I'm back on the plane.  Well I fall out and load again, so now I'm scared shitless since I've fallen like 3 or 4 times now and then I fall again and I wake up in a cold sweat.  Freaky, that never happens.  I should look up on hyperdictionary what all that means, its got a nice little dream dictionary.

Ok, heres the deal, I want to do something for new years.  Possible people involved may include:  Kim - We could do something romantic, the two of us.... but if you're busy, let me know, ok?  I just want to see you a bit more this vacation.   Alex - If that falls through, maybe some fireworks, some friends, some Bavarian Boyos?  Just a thought, heh heh heh.  Ok, I'm out.

      Well, boys and girls, I have done the best thing ever.  I mean, in terms of computer modding.  I have Overclocked my graphics card by 50mhz on memory and core (338/331).  And doing so not only is SAFE, but has increased my Unreal Tournament 2003 framerates (highest detail, 1024x768 resolution) BY MORE THAN 50%.  Thats right, 50 mhz = 50+%.  From 25 - 40 average fps I get 40 to 65.  Un. Bel. Ievable.  And I don't think any melting will occur if I just Overclock when I play games.  I'm so happy I actually took the time to test this out!  I can play sooo much better now.  Dare I go to the max??  378/370???  Muahahhah, I rule.  In a geeky, nerdy, dork way.  TIME FOR SLEEP.  Oh, speaking of Unreal Tournament 2003:  "When you kill a man, you're a murderer. Kill many, and you're a conqueror. Kill them all... And you're a god!"   -From the lyrical genius of metal, Dave Mustaine.

      I had a weird assed dream last night, too.    The skin on my legs was peeling off.  And people were laughing, and I had to like, see Kim or something, and it was weird as hell.    Then I don't remember much else. I blame it on the alcohol.

      I lied.  I am becoming very emotional right now and I can only think of two possible intertwined explanations.  They need to make a smily who is crying and smiling at the same time. Do you know why?  "I'm sad..... but at the same time I'm really happy that something could make me feel that sad.  Its like, it makes me feel alive, you know?  It makes me feel human.  And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt something really good before.  So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feeling is like a...a beautiful sadness."  - Butters  Being with you is one of the greatest feelings known to humankind.  Not being with you is like that sadness, like that sort of sadness, where everything has no point, nothing is important.  But when I feel that, then I know that there is something there to be greatly happy for.  Being with you, I have experienced so many emotions I never felt before about anyone.    I know I've told you this before.............. and this is very open......... but thats how it is.  Am I alone in thinking this?  Am I alone in these...... emotions?  Its like I'm waiting for something...... waiting for a sign or something.  I can't assume things.  I can only hope.

      ~~~~~~~~ Darnit, I flat out miss being with you!!  I'm just selfish, though.... ehh. ~~~~~~~~ Ok, lets snap out of it, Wes, keep cool, no matter how much you may want to spend to with your sig. other, you have a blog to write....  and write I shall.  I saw The Last Samurai, which was a good movie, the Ninjas, however, made it good.  One day, I hope to attain such a level of badassity, where I can walk around, hiss-breathing (sooo coool) with a shirt around my head to emulate a ninja cowel.  Then it hits me, on a philosophical level, like the archdevil Mephistopheles himself had hurled his giant red fist into my face, I can't do that.    I know I may say that if I believe in something, I can do it.  Here's the catch..... do I want to become a fighter, one who is jing tao (way of the warrior) like my brother? He dropped out of formal education, and now pursues gung fu.  I'm happy that he is happy and can live on the minimum with that.  He centers his chi, and doesn't need a woman or much else as many others would.  He can live without distraction.  Its just... I don't think I want that for myself.  Although its his peace...... its.. not my own.  Although I have learned much of the East thanks to him (and *others* heheh) and even can recognize some han-zi (only the cool ones, but its Chinese, none the less!) and can fight well, and I can list so many advantages I have taken with this path.... its still not mine.  Fighting may have been a way of life for Miyamoto Musashi, but thats many centuries ago...... in Japan.  I want whats best for me.... here.... in this time, in this place.    That means I *MUST* get a formal education if I ever want a job that can pay well in terms of how *I* want to live.  I need distractions, I want a partner, I like the car and all the gadgets, call me a consumer whore.  I know I'm not as bad as many, and I surely know of the ways of going without.  I choose to live in the best way for me.  Not only is that job well paying, but noble.  Much like myself :)    Here's a hint..... it gladdens my heart to know that I really am smiling in the hospital and have the balls to be around all those sick people.... they need people like me... who care.. and are intelligent.   Hint over, I think I would make a great doctor.  Really.  Thats what I believe in.  Fighting is NOT a way of life in this western society.  Its merely defense and a hobby, and I will view it as such.  I wish Derek the best of luck in his endevours, because although he won't make much money doing god knows what his job will be, he'll be at peace.  I hope that one day I can achieve that peace with what I want.  I think I have conveyed my message with some point of clarity..... hold on, I'm trying to sift it out of there.. ah yes....  My destiny lies not with the old traditions, but with helping others in the new.  I choose new, because making a living in this part of the world is easier for me with all the consumerism and oppertunities... I am familiar with it.  You can't make much money and live well by teaching gung fu.  Its a fact.  But whatever, I think its cool and will continue practicing it as a martial skill, not life, as my life lies with knowledge, learning, helping others, and having distractions.  Have I said what I meant to??  So much stuff on my mind....  ~~~~~~~ thats why I want to talk to you in person......alone........ because, after all  '70% of communication is body language".  Its so much better than the phone or typing... hmm hmm hmm, I am suffering withdrawls of being with you. ~~~~~~~ If anyone can interperet what I am trying to say in this blog, cool, you understand what I mean.

      I drove around my section of town/AL section/hospitals section today.  Then I went with the parent's to meet the stock broker.  He's an alright guy, but he has a new girlfriend every 6 months, heh.  He's also a Vietnam war vet, and he's told me some stories.  Like, stories you don't go around telling people.  I saw Dan Keesis there, too.  He was bussing tables, and we talked a bit when he was free.  What a worker.  Funny, he asked 'Where's Kim?', much like everyone else.  Well, except the broker guy.  He asked 'wheres your girlfriend?'  and I hadn't even told him anything about having one.  Guh.  So I had to explain what was best:  "You guys are too lame for her." XP  It was good food.  Ummm... I didn't do much else today.  I wish armyops would let me log in!

      Well, no more vhs.  I got my DVD player working and got the big Sanyo TV hooked up.  I'm not going back.  What else, what else....  Nothing much more, except that I have an underlying feeling of uncertainty that clings to me.  I wonder why, why.  My throat is phlegmy.  Ugh.   I decided that what I would really really really enjoy having material-wise is a sword sharpener.... get a really nice edge on those swords.  Yup.

      Well as some of you may know, the family took Thursday night off and we went to Kansas City.  My mom had to get her Dutch citizenship renewed, so now she has dual citizenship (American/Dutch).  Cool.  Derek and I will do the same, in case something happens and we need to skip country.  Friday was good, actually I moped a bit, but thats good.  Derek and I practiced a lot of gung fu and then I played a lot of Final Fantasy 3.  Everyone told me things will be better, I'll bleed but not die, things like that, too.  Thats nice.... I drove around in Mt Moriah cemetary with my parents and grand..aunt.  All of us relatives ate out, and that was fun, I talked a lot with Derek, nice.  Annnnnd then we watched 'Open Range'.  I likes me some Western movies.  'Specially ones where lots of people get shot.  Hahah.  Annd then what else I slept.  This morning I saw my cousin Lindsey, whom is getting tall.  And thats what Hallbergs do, they get tall.  All my relatives, tall.  She's 12 and plays basketball at her junior high, she even has a boyfriend (ah, a little young, but who am I to say?).   We left (Derek, Me, and my parents) and I did my algebra.  After we passed St. Joseph, daddy-o let me take the wheel on the interstate and I drove us home.  Hee haa I rule.  I'd say I'm a good driver.  So thats what happened. *i am now re-doing this post, since i closed the window earlier*  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I guess I am like a tennis shoe, reliable in a tough situation, good protection, warm, big, sturdy, not so showy, practical, and I do tend to wear on you.  Or at least I hope.  I still have lots of that, hope.  I hope that this spectrum of emotions(sad) wont last much longer.  I appreciate what I had and have, and now am without, for I don't know how long.  I believe in you.  I have said that before, you know.    I have known 5 minutes of happiness (I know naught of how extreme it was), and I want it to happen again.  Me at my most selfish.    Selfish and uncertain.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I remember having a simple life, I call it last year.  I had a job, and still do, and its not stressful.  School isn't stressful either.  Junkies, bad businessmen, lazy brother, sister's wedding, and everything, none of those have made MY life more complicated.  But there was one factor I hadn't counted on that makes things a little more complicated.    Why wars are fought, why people are happy with each other, this is the root.  This is what people should get high on.

Lying in bed for hours...smell of flowers...Hot towels out of the dryer... Walking out of your last final... Finding the sweater you want is on sale for half price....a good conversation.....bubble tea....late night calls that lasts for hours....family and friends....hard times...happy times.....feeling lazy...having someone playing with your hair...getting a kiss on the nose....rubbing noses with a loved one...the wonderful feeling of christmas.....recieving a phone call from unexpected......hugs....smiles....   I remember those things...............   is 5 minutes of extreme happiness worth a lifetime of pain? I have known five minutes of happiness...I don't know how extreme it was...... but I want it to happen again.  I guess I am like tennis shoes, but in the sense that they are comfortable, offer protection, practical, not showy, comfortable in activity, but I do tend to chip a bit.  I have hope.  I have cried..... and now I am without..... is this forever?  No, it can't be, because I have hope.  I believe in you.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The past is a gaping hole....  the genius of the hole........... no matter how long you have been climbing out of it, you can be sent reeling back down in an instant.  -Payneism

      Blogger has a tendency to time me out when I get caught up in other things.  I would put up lyrics, but almost all of them carry the same "I'm sad that what we had is gone" message, which is true, but a bit played out, you know?  Its strange that such an emotion influences so many songs to be written, really.  Its hard to deal with, a situation where you care deeply about someone, and think odd things, and then it can't continue on.  Ah, its hard to explain, but its not hard to convey, whoever gets it, gets it.  Grin and bear it, I guess, because life likes to play these little things.  I know that everyone has a purpose, and I can only think of a few short term ones.  If, over time, I do realize what their's really is, I will be happy.  Until then I guess I will feel somewhat sad.    Moving on is a simple thing, but what it leaves behind is hard (-dave mustaine) One thing left behind in me is a serious doubt in myself, its probably unfounded, but I still feel it anyway, because I never can really know for sure, enough.  I need that reassurance that something good was there.  I know, it was, but its like I need to be reminded that without feeling wasted.  Why?  Its one of my little idiosyncrasies, I guess, and I don't know how I'll get such assurance now without sending off that it still irks me.  Oh, see I just said that it still irks me, but it does.  I've got to confess it does, things like that will irk me, because now I can't talk on that level with you without conveying a sense that I still want something.  I should just break off, but its as though I don't want to, underneath.  Thats painful, it is.  I've got to move on.  I can't be so attached and caring, even though they are good qualities at times.  Better than being distant and uncaring in a relationship, that is.  I let those things(caring, clingyness) blind me though.  Sad.  Odi et amo, quare id facere forasse requiris...Nescio, sed fieri sentio et excrucior. Forsan miseros meliora sequentur.  I hope thats true.  But I doubt some things can be better.  Maybe this is one of those things that will get noticeably better, though?  Maybe I should just stop before I go too far.  Yes, thats a good idea.    Why do I only find peace in sleep?  I guess its just that my imagination can run wild and can feel unfettered by normal bounds.  Its when I can only rest and not think about what has happened that day, or week, or ever.  I can just vaguely concentrate on a few unrelated thoughts without any consequences for a few hours.   Why, why anything?  Why this, why that, does anything have a reason that I can understand now?  Or is it just another time thing?  Didn't I say I should end this?

      I did my homework at the hospital while my dad visited patients.  Then I drove around from there around places and back to Super Saver.  And then we got some groceries.  We went home, got my mom (who was cleaning out those smelly fridges and such), and went to the Mekong market.  Good stuff there.    I just got done eating what my mom cooked up, it was really really good, like, soup of crab and spicy with noodles and OH GOD it was good.  With the sticks, o'course.    Now I'm reading blogs and stuff  Posting.  AGH my speakers are blowing out, that sucks.  I guess I'm under the misconception that both partners need to make each other happy in relationship.  Its about more than just one emotion.  Its about all and more.  Happiness can come in other forms.  I need to understand that and not feel like a failure.  I guess I am happy. Ok, I'm gonna close this post now.

Christie elieson, what is it tomorrow...... a B day?  Good, I don't want to do English, but I will, probably, out of fear.  I don't know about angels.   I'd say its fear, that gives men wings.

      I played the Far Cry demo today, nothing short of fantastic.  This game screams of quality, in both imagery and sound.    I wish I had a faster processor...... gah.  Thats the second material thing I would want.  Annnyway.  No school tomorrow, either, apparently.  This just makes my 'a or b day' sense go outta whack and I can't tell what from where.  I shoveled snow today and ate a lot of chili.  Now my bowels are paying the price as my body is adding 20% to my house's total methane saturation in the air.  I'm farting a lot.  HAHAHAHAH HE SAID FART!  Eh.  That was lame.  Derek and I  whooped  eachothers asses today, doing kung fu (I say kung fu and gung fu a lot, either or, really).  I hurt my foot by roundkicking his knee, my left forearm by blocking his kicks, and my knee by taking a kick to it.  My knuckles still hurt like a bitch, after doing bloody knuckles with the guy.  And that was... 3 days ago.  Yikes.  So he fashioned me some Thai Arm/Wrist wraps from gauss.  Haha, little known fact, the Thai boxers would used to make forearm wraps, stick them in glue, and attach broken glass to them, verrry painful/deadly when hit.    Anyway, I clocked him a good time RIGHT in the left eye.  A classic, vertical kung fu punch, right there.  He said he saw it coming, quick, but could do nothing.  Then he said his color and vision got distorted for a few moments.  Haha, owned.  Its not a black eye, thanks to the hand wraps, but it needed ice something bad.    Thank God for    otherwise I would still be in pain.  I'm getting better, and kung fu is probably my vent for my violent tendencies and current (somewhat) sadness...... that, and video games, loud metal, and eating half of what I used to.  Maybe I'll shed a little weight, that would be nice.  Nobody likes a fatty. *hahahaha, ow...... the truth hurts*  Anyways, this was overall a good day.  Oh, did ya know, they're allowing fireworks in Singapore again, thats cool.  If I ever go there, it'll be Chinese New Year, and I'll pick fights with random people.  Weed out the ones who don't know kung fu.  Or get killed by some student of Moy Yat.  Hahaha, I'm so stupid.

       urlLink Chinese New Year - 2004 is the Year of the Monkey. 2003 is the Year of the Goat   I'm a bit late on this, but happy Chinese new year!    Yes, yes, I know, Wes is white, but Wes also is somewhat multi-cultural.  So bear with me.  Any occasion that has fireworks is the shit.  Especially the Year of the Monkey.    My dad told me what he would do as a child in Singapore on Chinese New Year.  He would walk around to all the rich people's houses and get "lai see" (little red envelopes with 1 dollar bills) as lucky gifts.  The streets would be red with paper, so much paper, and fireworks abound.  Amazing.  I would love to see that sometime, or just visit Asia in general.  I go to Europe so much it loses its...... excitement.  Its beautiful, still, but very hum-drum.  I think I should go visit Berlin or Amsterdam (again) when I'm older.  Annyway, this morning I somehow found the energy to get out of bed, clean my room, do a wash, clean my coat, anf finish reading Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings.  Amazing, how did I do all that?  I am feeling a bit better, which is good to know.  Life can only be understood but must be moved forwards, I guess.  Speaking of the Five Rings, I would suggest to all of you to read it.  It's not just for martialists, but anyone who seeks Zen through their craft.  Its great advice for anyone in competition with anything, and Musashi simply states truths brilliantly.  I liked it.  There is no such thing as Yin-Yang.  That is not to say, Yin-Yang does not exist.  It took me some time to realize what that meant, but it suddenly hit me in understanding, such suttle words.  Wisdom.  Read the book though, its enlightening.  It makes me want to pick sword fights with people.   http://www.fanta.dk/showmovie.asp?mid=40841BBE-6DE8-4327-A31A-8EBBD8955B0B  Go there, I made it.   I'm driving later today, and then I'm gonna right my little English summaries, since I have little else to do.  Maybe sign up for the ACT.  Maybe write my English script.

      Your Existing Situation  Not only considers his demands minimal, but also regards them as imperative. Sticks to them stubbornly and will concede nothing.    Your Stress Sources  Eager to make a good impression, but worried and doubtful about the likelihood of succeeding. Feels that he has a right to anything he might hope for, and becomes helpless and distressed when circumstances go against him. Finds the mere possibility of failure most upsetting and this can even lead to nervous prostration. Sees himself as a 'victim' who has been misled and abused, mistakes this dramatization for reality and tries to convince himself that his failure to achieve standing and recognition is the fault of others.    Your Restrained Characteristics  Egocentric and therefore quick to take offense. An unadmitted lack of confidence makes him careful to avoid open conflict and he feels he must make the best of things as they are.  Egocentric and therefore quick to take offense. Able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity but tends to hold aloof emotionally.  Feels trapped in a distressing or uncomfortable situation and seeking some way of gaining relief. Able to achieve satisfaction through sexual activity providing no turmoil or emotional agitation is involved.    Your Desired Objective  Urgently in need of rest, relaxation, peace, and affectionate understanding. Feels he has been treated with a lack of consideration and is upset and agitated as a result. Regards his situation as intolerable as long as his requirements are not complied with.    Your Actual Problem  Disappointment at the non-fulfillment of his hopes and the fear that to formulate fresh goals will only lead to further setbacks have resulted in considerable anxiety. He is trying to escape from this into a peaceful and harmonious relationship, protecting him from dissatisfaction and lack of appreciation.   Your Actual Problem #2  Depleted vitality has created an intolerance for any further stimulation, or demands on his resources. A feeling of powerlessness subjects him to agitation and acute distress. Tries to escape from this by relinquishing the struggle, and by finding peaceful and restful conditions in which to recuperate in an atmosphere of affection and security.

      Well, Jessie came back at 2 this morning and slept all day.  They got the jeep cherokee, and he says it holds on the the road like arnold holds on to women's breasts.  They just left, and we can't find his cell phone.  Oh well, he was gonna switch his plan, anyway.   You know, I omit a LOT of things.  Some meaningless.  But when I just... introduce people, I feel as though I must explain.  Ooook, here we go.  Sonja:  My eldest sister.  Wesley + 10 in years, making her almost 26.    She did lab/research work in physiology and biophysics and got her masters a few months back in that field.  She now works in a genetics lab doing god knows what sort of managerial work/culture creations.  She lives with her fiance, Ryan and my brother Derek.  Sonja, in my opinion, is the embodiment of today's modern Western woman: paranoid, lippy, spends a lot, and overconcerned about her weight and fitness.  And money.  I don't know why she does kung fu.  She is also very, shall I say...... flirty?  Ryan:  Or should I say.... Poor Ryan.  He has ALmost finished med-school and is probably gonna go into pathology work (the discovery/treatment of disease, its isolated from people).  We call him Poor Ryan...... because he's with Sonja.  Jesus.  He has been under lots of school and private pressure now and deserves to sit in front of his new PS2.  Good for him, I like him.   He's the classic American Joe, hardworking, and loves sports and such and such, a classic guy.  Lets hope he can help Sonja not be a bitch.  He's been with her 7 years.  Oh, yeah, he's... 27.  Derek: My brother, you know him.  A pot smokin-kung fu doin-lazy-conspiracy spewing-mofo who likes to be violent.  I don't know what his problem is..... I guess its rooted at living with Sonja, hell, I'd be more violent too.  He's Wes + 4 years.  Also, he's dropped outta formal school and now pursues Eastern thought, and asskicking.  He's here in CB right now, because of the snow.  Eleanor:  My starving artist sister who got phi beta kappa a while ago.  She's a smart one, and knows how to handle money, which she learned from having a job.  She works at a known art gallery, Akar, in Iowa city.  She's got lots of art in her own gallery, as well.  I'm glad she's somewhat happy with Jessie.  Wes + 8 years.  Graduated college last year with honors.  Jessie: Eleanor's boyfriend of one year.  He is tall, skinny, and a workin-man.  He has been divorced once and is 28.  He was somewhat of a problem child but turned out ok.  He's a mechanic genius, and drives cabs (Lotsa money, 3 days = 600 bucks).  He hopes to take Eleanor to Florida sometime and get a degree in marine mechanics and build boats, which is really great.  He's got a great creative mind.    Gary:  My boss, whom I am close to hating.  Really, he is one of the two people I do NOT like at ALL.  I fake liking him and the storage unit job.  I'm just there for the 10 bucks an hour.  This man is a disgrace to be called 'business man'.  He is a schyster.  He lies, steals, and makes fraudulant plans.  The ONLY thing that he's EVER done well and honest are the storage units, and I am amazed.  Maybe he'll turn out decent, but for now, he's got like 10 schemes going on.  In addition to Hocking Pfizer.  Oh well, if you need to trust him, only trust the Units, you can trust me on that.  Steve/Lucy: My parents, you know, blah blah.  Mom's Dutch Born and my dad was a rich whitey in Indonesia/Singapore growing up.  Quite the non-average family, but then again, are there any average families?  And then there's me.  15, smart (I think), egotistical, paranoid (somewhat), and likes to make side frequent 'asides'(like this).  I'd say I write well when I want to, but thats not frequent.  I broke up with my girl, which is alright, we're cool.  I'm sticking it out in Martial training once again, and trying to stay cool with my buddies.  Every cowboy has a sad story, and I have some somewhat sad ones (as in, if I told them all, you would be 'tsk, aw, thats so sad!'), but I still consider myself a lucky man....  What else, guys?  Did I leave anyone out that wants some explaining?  I frequently ponder on the world's state.  We're fucked.  My generation is not good enough to keep stuff working, but I'm something of a pessimist.  And then I think about what it'll like to become old, enfeebled. Then death.  Wondering about wtf will happen, you know?  I bet you don't know. But I bet you do wonder.  More on this later, maybe.  I'm tired of writing now.  I'll explain myself a little later, since my blogging recently is lacking content.

      Well at work today I tripped and fell on the ice, which is doesn't go without pain.  And then on the way back I drove.    And crashed the Lincoln LS into a snow bank.  Like, snow, covering the windshield type of crash.  It took the kindness of three people to wedge us out.  I guess that its fairly common to crash into snow, since while we were digging the car out, a woman crashed 100 meters from us, and I helped push her car out.    Other than that stuff, Jessie is in Denver (Eleanor's boyfriend) picking up their new car, since they gave me MINE.  YEP.  Eleanor is cooking with my dad and Derek is doing kung fu.  Derek and I played some Army Ops today, training is tough, but fun.  I hope theres no school tomorrow, either.

      Well, I guess you hungry masses are entitled to a blog, eh?  Ok, here's whats up.  On thursday, I turned my speech cards in and also did some speech practice about Michael Jackson if he were normal.  And then when I got home I installed Kotor.  Nero 6 wouldn't make cd images, so Chris Parker gave me an ISO buster, and I opened and extracted the 4 bins.  And it worked, the install automatically found the data and everything.  Problem is, the cracked exe file doesnt work, and neither does the normal one.  SO fuck, I wanted to play KOTOR!  Oh well, Unreal Tournament 2004 rocks my socks with twin glocks.  Today I volunteered.  Yeah, and then picked up bruce almighty for tomorrow.  BTW, guys I'm probably gonna be home alone this weekend, so if you want to party, right here, motherfuckers.    Time to UT.

      About my feelings.......  I'm either really angry, stressed, depressed, contemplative, but most of all, things just remind me of her, which shouldn't be happening, should it?  I don't know......  I just know pain will make me stronger.  Every song I hear, for instance.......oh well, she's a great friend.  I feel so....... stupid...... when I'm confronted with these presenters, and the fact that I'm not in any AP yet or summer classes only heightens that feeling.  I will take a summer college course next summer, but this one will be devoted to Driver's Ed and working.  I know I can make a success of myself if I follow my plans:  take AP next year, summer courses, volunteer, become a supervisor, and get goooooooooooood grades. Also: take ACTs in June.  I can do all this and am striving for the best without snapping myself.  I'd say I'm doing a fairly good job.  I learned that I need to reduce my anger......... a lot.  Way more reducing than I have been.  More later.

      I'm back, Symposium was fun!  Minh was one of the top 5 presenters, and the only guy.  Heh.  There was this newspaper box and on the glass viewing part, it was covered in the word "LIES" which was hilarious.  I spent a lot of time with Derek, though, at the community center playing pool, and at this dinner potluck we went to.  Also talking to his hobo friends (Nostradamus).   I had some people visit Sonja's genetics lab, and it was a good learning experience.  Mr. Forsee was pleased to see how his teaching molded an excellent scientist.  I got a little S'd after I ate some funky Buddha brownies and cookies and stuff, and then I crashed at Sonja's and played virtua fighter 4 with Derek.  I also got punched by a drunk person.  I was S'd and couldn't really help it.    On the way back Mr. Whaley was thinking of the exact same thing I was at one point, describing the worlds most costly speeding ticket.  Weird.  And Minh advised me to re install kotor.  I'll try, he is fairly knowlegable. Ok, later guys, better post tomorrow.

      Yet again I am waiting to post stuff, but I got a good reason, HONEST!  Ok, ok, on monday night I went over to Nick Hartman's house, and man, I have made yet another friend this year.  The guy is real patient and friendly and stuff.  We talked about Metallica and other metal bands, and played PS2 and watched Kiss of the Dragon and talked about life and stuff.  And then we watched funny flash stuff, MGS stuff, slept, played Viewiful Joe, and the list goes on.  Yeah, we're seeing Metallica together, since he's cool.  Ok, then later today I went to school and took my law and legal test in advance.  Yeah, and then I went home and then went to work.  I'm gonna go ahead and say that this was the weirdest work day I've ever had.  I started shoveling the snow from the units and I was headed down B aisle and saw like 3 cop cars and 6 cops.  Apparently in one of the units some guy was making meth for about a week and was busted at his house.  They came here to find his lab.   And then later, I was still shoveling (what fun, eh??) and Thomas appears.  Thomas, none of you know.  He was an exchange student here two-three years ago and befriended Derek.  He's from Dresden.  ANYway, he's here to visit his sweetheart whom he may marry (aaw) and then work later this summer.  He'll be here till saturday, and it was a really nice surprise to see him!  Anyways, I am all packed for the Symposium Wednesday.  I'm ready......... aight, this is it, later guys.  Be back friday.

      Oh, so/so Valentine's day.  I kinda had expectations a while ago that I would have a girlfriend to share a different yesterday with.  "Several more weeks to come", eh?  Several isn't two or so weeks.  That sounds bitter, but I have every right to ponder things.  I miss her lips so.  Ah, I'm done with that though.

      So at work, I had to towel down a wet unit.  *subdued laughter*  And then I loaded up a truck with some stuff of Gary's and then unloaded it at his place and also helped get his Trailblazer un-stuck.  I got paid, too.  Not much else.  OH WAIT, Alex came over and we celebrated his birthday with much stuff to do.  Lots of stuff.  Not even gonna go into that here.  Mexican Hat!

      Goddamnit!  What happened to my BlogThis! button?  I want it back!  It made blogging quick and easy............. now I'm back to....... slow... and painful.  Without the pain.  So its just slow.  In the sense where I must click more than twice and start typing to blog.  Eh, oh well.  Next up.... what the fuck I did tuesday through.... is today thursday?  I'm lacking on posts.  Its kinder to the you guys, if you neglect to read, you can catch up faster.  Anyway! Tuesday.... that would be... not a whole lot happened Tuesday, except that I redid my speech tape that night.  Let me tell you, a radiostation like slashdot would rule.   Thats what I did. Shut up, I'm a geek.  Oh, I also worked, but you know how work is, cleaning, vacuuming, walking, coldness, manual stuff.  So then Wednesday night I revised my debate and wrote it out.  And wrote some Chinese kanji to put on a kung fu shirt (printed out the transfer earlier tonight, ready to iron on).  I wasn't all too busy.    Today I ran 2 miles in PE because I wanted to.  I wonder if I could get slight annorexia nervosa, and then get over it.  It would prolly suck, since I would lose my muscle mass.  Eh, yeah that was a dumb thought.  Then in English I lost my police brutality debate by ONE VOTE.  Darnit, can't people realize its a big problem?  Oh well.  I reviewed in BIO and was king of the class once again in Algebra 4.  I am pretty good at math, I would say.  And it looks as if many of the teachers at school are on my side.    When I say that, I mean, that they favor me in class and such and have lotsa good things to say, so I might get on NHS.  Hansen was reminding me that its alright if I don't make it this year, and encouraged me to try filling my application out with more info and also what to put on it.  First time in a while he's encouraged me.  Not only him, but Mr. Forsee my bio teacher probably wants me to be as good as Sonja.  So he also praises me and lets me know about extra little things scholastically.  Interesting stuff.  My chemisty teacher is also quite cool to me, so it helps if you're smart and motivated like me!  I'm motivated to transfer my kung fu stuff onto my shirt.  I also modded up UT.  I do this like every month, since the game is still gorgeous.   New models, maps, and even a new beginning logo (now a hell fiend breaks throguh a cool ruined ancient logo deally).  I like UT so much. I'm fairly certain Phil Harm can't beat me.  Did I mention today that all that stuff at school I did today made me dirt tired?  I called in work and decided not to go.  I napped until like 7 and have been on the compy 386 ever since.  Not much else, I guess I'll go now.  I think that my blogs are lacking though.  As in, most people talk about deep stuff.  Well, ok, lets get deep, since I prolly won't post till saturday night.  Nick and I were talking last week about politics and stuff.  How Bush believes he can never do wrong, like he's God's chosen president, which pisses us off.  Every one of his actions is like divine, and he feels he'll get re elected.  How evil.  How he attacks doubt (abortion), and rights (patriot act, gay marriages).  And then for some reason we talked for 3 hours on space and time, it was FUCKED UP.  My brain hurt hella bad.  Guys, think about it.  Say, time machines are available in the future.  So your future self takes a stealth suit back to this time and puts it on your bed.  He leaves.  Ok, guys, this is happening instantaneously.  As in, he goes and comes back like he was never gone.  So you find a stealth suit.  Now, herein lies the main quandary.  If this was all instantaneous, as if he never left... now that you have the suit, is your future self altered, or do you grow into him and take the suit back with you again (when you become him) so that the process can repeat itself and nothing happens awry.  The second idea of thought (my own) means that such use of a time machine negates itself, since you grow into that person, destiny, that you will take the same action, so nothing is changing at all, really.  This means that time machine use is really useLESS since your future self will remember that he found a stealth suit on his bed when we was a teen, so he as to make sure that happens in the past so he can remain the same and so you can grow into him and nothing changes.  Therefore, really, the use of time machines, in the idea of destiny, alters nothing, as it was meant to happen that you use the machine.  You guys get what I mean?   But if time machines don't exist in the future, thought is wasted on this.  Now tease your brain with the idea that you have 2 machines in the future and leave one with your teenage self.  OUCH does your brain hurt now?  Nicks idea of thought about the stealth suit is that destiny isn't really destiny, so that things will take unexpected turns.  So taking back the stealth suit creates an alternate timeline in which your teenage self has the suit,  grows up, and is different from the original future self that brought the suit.  Get it? Imagine a road.  Someone changes the road and makes it fork.  Get it?  He contuues his way, in the hopes that a (better?) alternate timeline was created for an alternate self.  Now get it?  Just imagine the Trunks saga in Dragonball Z.  This is what Nick used as his example.  This idea is not without its merits either.  See, time is some cooky fucking shit, people.  Later.

      Hmmm.  Yesterday was pretty mellow.  Ever notice how in dodgeball, when the last few people are still in against half of the other team (the good half), they always get out in a barrage of balls?  Its like, the people that are left have 2 balls in each hand and the fucking all throw at the same time, and the poor people that are left on my team just get owned like 3 or four times over.  Its great stuff.  Second hour, oh man, I think thats the most strenuous English hour I've ever had.  It was a good kind of strenuous.... very productive.  I read a fewa articles from Newsweek or something and then wrote four pages in pen answering an essay question.  My god, in an hour and ahalf, my hand was so cramped and covered at the bottom in ink.  Haha, it was kinda fun, in an over-achiever sort of way.  Today, after work, I think I'm gonna work on my Latin Teaching speech.  Should be fun.  Third hour, I was tired.  Biology, although innately interesting, makes me sleepy if we take notes.  Fourth hour was some good Algebra 4 testing.  I say I did pretty well, the test (to me) wasn't hard at all.  You know.... in all my internal turmoil, at least I'll have some good friends and good grades.  While I was volunteering, I think...... THINK..... I repeat..... THINK (I'm wrong, probably) that the girl I was around was flirting with me.  Yeah... hm.    Frankly, theres some pretty fine girls over there *devilish laugh*   aaaaaaah I'm a horrible person.  Then when I got back from that, I went to the store with daddy-o and then went home.  I watched Slayers Episodes 8, 9, and 10.  Its a good anime.  I like it.  After I finish Slayers, I'll probably go watch Lodoss War.  Since I've been single, I've been going back to the things I had lots of fun doing.  Not to say not being single doesn't have perks, eh?    Wow, if I ever want to get my mack on proper, I'll need a driver's license.  Mack on proper... hahahah.  I ate a freaking bag of Funnyuns last night.  A whole ones.  My god, my breath still smells.  I'm just gonna head off to work.  Now.

      I don't get it.  I don't get the point of life.  Its like the world as an entity is trying to fucking taunt me.  Really, I do.  Greg has a girlfriend now.  Thats great for him, I'm happy, Greg's always been there for me.  But  its just times like this where I question how the fuck some people get emotional security and I get none.  Well.... I guess relationships aren't security.  Hehh............. whats the point of a high school relationship?  I fell off the bus today at school and all the junior high kids started laughing.  I want to hurt them.  Whats the point, though?  It will turn around on me with consequences.  What a fucking world that people don't get theirs and I get bullshit.  I don't know whats worse.... being helpless against their jibes, or being completely capable of murdering them all and yet being bound by Man's laws, rendered helpless.  I'm the latter.  Goddamnit, whats the point.  The coat I had oil on from the Units on Saturday, and gave to the drycleaners that day.... that coat jacket I bought with Kim Son and Kim Anh after Thanksgiving, the wonderful night and day I spent with her (ahem I'm getting off topic, like a retard) the $130 columbia jacket.  They didn't bother to clean it.  For 5 days, they didn't do crap with it.  The inner jacket is ruined, since the oil stains had time to set.  God, their incompetance makes me so angry.  SO now I have to wash it by hand, and the whole premise makes me angry.  Gary's gonna get them to reimburce me a new jacket or 130 big ones.... but in the end... whats the point?  I also feel like I'm the last to get laid ever.  Whats the point?  Do I need to fuck to achieve Nirvana?  Goddamn, whats the point.  Whats the point of doing drugs if I'll just feel this way again?  So many reasons NOT to smoke, so many reasons TO smoke.  Damn........ whats the point?  Life's too goddamn short to waste talking like this.  If I was less...... I don't know... scared?  I would do what I actually wanted.  I want to maim, fuck, smoke, and have a good fucking night's rest, and be satisfied for once.  Really, I think that would satisfy me, and make me content.    The non-illegal option, however, is find another relationship, another girl, another someone (well I found her, but by cracky I must take the initiative and do something) who will make my brain release those 'high on life' endorphins that I had two months ago, just by thinking about her.  Boy that is 'love' thing is funny, I wonder what it is.....  But then of course, there's the possibility of being broken again.  That's not pleasant at all.  You know, 7 months ago, I never cried.  Now its like, I focus on an event and it ends up with tears, I must be a giant fucking pussy or something.  And these are happy memories!  I must be sad because they ain't gonna happen again.  Gaaah.   Yeah, I think what I need, rather than another relationship, is to find some form of inner peace.  Thats a pretty decent idea, I would say.  Where to start.... fuck.  I don't know.  I guess I need to figure out the point.  What is the point?  Life is pain, get over it?  Life is an adventure?  Life is a big joke?  Life goes by too fast... don't dwell?  Well, I best get cracking on that.  I bid you farewell....and this.      Your  Ultimate Purity Score  Is...

      Ok, I had the weirdest fucking dream last night.  I was driving, and stuff, and I had to go to the hospital to volunteer.  But then it became a skateboard race, right when I got off Simms avenue.  And then some people from school were there, like Franz, and Nick, and some Asian people, and some volunteer people. When we got to the hospital entrance, the place changed and suddenly we were in.. like.... Venice, or some European city with like a water channel and monuments and stone and stuff.  And anyway, I was like, looking at the water, and I exlaimed "LOOK AT THAT GREAT PIXEL SHADED WATER!  Thats shader 2.0!"  Because apparently, in my dreams as well, I'm a giant fucking nerd.  So then Alex was like, yeah!  And I looked at the ground and said "Wow, DOT3 bump mapping!"  And then I explained to Alex what it is, and shit.  And then the Asians started talking in broken Engrish and I started making fun of them with Alex, and we were having a grand time. Then I don't remember anything else of the dream.  I thought I would share that.

      I was reading someone's recent blog entries, and one stood out......  it made me remember....  and tears started to well in my eyes.  Life it seems, will fade away Drifting further every day Getting lost within myself Nothing matters no one else I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free  Things are not what they used to be Missing one inside of me Deathly lost, this can?t be real Cannot stand this hell I feel Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony Growing darkness taking dawn I was me, but now he?s gone  No one but me can save myself, but it?s too late Now I can?t think, think why I should even try  Yesterday seems as though it never existed Death greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye   Fade to Black, by Metallica, good song.  Why do I associate my tender feelings with metal bands?  Could it be because they're as good as any other music for expressing whatever you're feeling at the moment?  Yeah, I think so, too.  And in case you're wondering, the tears are gone, now.

      Whats up, dingus McFingus?  I was watching Slayers 1-7, an anime.  And now I got back from getting my ass handed to me in Legends.  Its exactly like Tribes, but better graphics.  And free.  You know, its been a little bit since I saw honest to goodness Anime.  I'm not counting the Animatrix.  Slayers is funny as hell, a lot like 8-bit theatre.  What WAS the last anime I saw?  Cowboy Bebop episodes, maybe?  Oh well, you know?  Anime isn't my life.  So eh.  Friday... I volunteered and trained Angela.  Some of you may know her.  I'll keep the last name confidential.  While we were up there we talked and stuff, it was pretty alright.  Right after school, though, some kid tried messing with me, so I pac'ed his hand out of the way and put my hand right to his throat, "Don't mess with a guy who has Kung FU written in Chinese on his shirt.  Worst mistake you could make in one day." So after volunteering, I forget what I did.  Today I worked and got oil all over my Columbia jacket.  I liked that jacket!  So I left it at the dry cleaners.  They can clean it, right?  It was windy as heck today.  I guess Gary's not a bad guy.  I make him out to be such a weirdo, but in fact, I guess I don't have a whole lot against him.. I guess I just associate him with work, and Wes no likey worky!  Unless I get paid.  After work I donned a headband and spiked my hair up, wore my kung fu shirt, and later went to an Indian store.  Hahah, I looked so Whapanese, it was hilarious.  So anyway, after that happened I watched Slayers and then played Legends(great game), and here I am now!  My dad is putting a lot of effort into my car.. waxing it, vacuuming it, cleaning it, sanding the rust spots off.  Tomorrow, we're gonna repaint parts of it.  I think he's using this work on the car as a way to indirectly spend time with me, and/or help me out.  You know?  I say 'you know' a little too much.  But thats my theory about him.  I love the guy, I wouldn't be here if not for him, eh?  My mom is doing great, she's not dying her hair anymore, so now its silver.  Really, I never expected that, even though before, thats what color she said her hair is, I never believed.  Wow.... makes me wonder.... my parents are old.  Agh.   Death.   AGH.  Not enough time?  Agh.  She does good tai chi and some kung fu, I'm impressed, I'm glad Derek taught her some stuff, its neato.  Wow, I never expected this entry to become long, but look, look, there it goes, getting long.  Hahaha.  Sexual innuendo.  Agh, yet another cliche.  Agh, randomness.    Condoms!  Where the fuck did that come from?  Am I putting in enough emotional content?    Its not like I have a whole bunch of problems, mainly one or two.  Or three.   School, work, money, and girls.  Ok, thats four, but every guy has those problems.  Eh.

      Woo.  Yeah, hey, yeah yeah woo!  I'm wild in a totally and completely rehearsed way!  Well well, people from Kirn *scratches head* keep messaging me, for little reasons.   I got about 3 hours of sleep last night, but was completely energized, somehow.  I guess tea in the morning is really good.  Tea is good!  Stop drinking coffee and start drinking green tea, people!  Not much else today.  Except for the whole girl thing.  Yeah, I like her.  But who is it?  *spooky noise* yeah I'm not sayin here.  HA!  Dagz: but yeah I don't know what to do about this theft thing. I have no idea who it was now, becuase I only had two suspects and both have been pretty much been proven not guilty Dagz: so we have nobody to wreak vigilante justice on WrathS 01: oh WrathS 01: come ON WrathS 01: youre kidding me WrathS 01: than instead of vigilante justice, lets wreak vigilante revenge WrathS 01: its pretty much the same thing Dagz: hahaha WrathS 01: except works much better. Dagz: because we can attack random people instead of having a reason? Dagz: hahaha WrathS 01: yeah, dereks and my world, you dont need a reason to fight WrathS 01: you start foaming at the mouth and then beat the holy shit outta them kung fu style WrathS 01: well thats mainly dereks world. Dagz: hahaha

      I always have something new to post.  I remember a time when that was not the case!  Hahaaaaaaaa, I certainly don't wanna go back to that time.  Or times.  Whatever.    First off. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ITS ELECTRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIC! Damn you Metallica, for having such a catchy song!  Second: Lets do a little talkin', baby.  On Sunday (i think), I... uh........ hm.. OH YEAH!  I met this really nice girl and we both like each other a lot, so thats some great stuff. I donno why i omitted that last post.  Hm.  She and I talk every chance I'm not sleeping or working or being busy out of my brain.  Then I did 5 hours of homework on Monday.  I finished my speecha and Biology, but have been sick for a while.  A cold or somesuch.  I don't know how I do it, but when I do something I DO it!  I'm a dedicated person, I've realized.  Heheh, that makes me feel good about myself.  I threw up this morning and couldn't sleep at all during the night.  Still, I went to school, did PE, did my Speech, took a biology test, and didn't die again in Algebra, thanks to Jake Stark.  That guy knows his Rock and plays guitar pretty well.  But the main reason for thanking him here, is that he is really friendly (ever since I befriended him last semester PE) and he is really freaking cool.  Also today he gave me these caffeine mints that perked me up the moment I took em.  I have GOT to go to compusa and get me some Bawls.  I talked to a speech partner and was really angry at myself for letting her down today, I said I would get her a camcorder, but every thing I tried didn't work.  Darn.    Alex and I worked today!  Boy I sure am glad we are working now, man!  You're gonna dig this gig.  I just hope you're fit enough.... if anything ever happens to you on the job... I would never forgive myself.  We picked up stuff, moved stuff, and cleaned stuff, same old for me.  After work, I took a MUCH NEEDED 2 hour nap.  Then I got up and apparently my mom, who was napping as well, didn't notice I came back from work and she was worried about me.   I'm glad my parents care.  She was really scared.    I'm really scared about her gall bladder trouble.  I hope nothing bad happens......  And of course I've veen here eating my food, and talking to people and writing and looking at pages I missed earlier.  Ah, I feel good that I have posted yet again.

      "Imagine how it feels to be a doctor! If you make one mistake (and who here has NEVER made a mistake at work? Especially ER doc who can get called in a 4am) you can be personally sued, ruining your life and your entire family's life, stopping you from ever working again, and thus not being able to get a chance to save more lives. Oops, your bankrupt because you just lost a suit for $2billion while your malpractice only covered you up to $500million. Now your kids can't go to college, you have to sell all of your posessions, no insurance company will cover you so you can't work now--all because, after dedicating your life to saving lives, there is one thing you didn't think of while trying to save another life. And AFTER THE FACT, some lawyer makes a very emotional argument to a jury of weak-mided suckers. I am sure if a doc in the emergency room had as much time to waste analyzing everything as the lawyer took, there would be far fewer mistakes. But when someone is wheeled in bleeding, you have to think FAST. You can't always be perfect."  -by Lord Ender (156273) on Sunday March 07, @09:49PM  "Things like this exist because jobless wonders with no skills and no future see an easy out and sue the doctor for some assinine bullshit, then ignorant juries award this sinister behavior when crooked lawyers trump things up around the "poor, suffering victim". If you didn't have as many assholes out there pulling bullshit cases and getting exhorbitant "awards", the people with legitimate claims wouldn't be more than an afterthought to professionals who know what they're doing.  It's just another example of how the "legal" profession makes its money by ruining everyone else. Legalized thugs."  -by the_mad_poster (640772)   on Sunday March 07, @09:09PM     I hate people that abuse the system.  They are one of the few people I hate, since they ruin society.

      AH I feel better!  I don't know why I was so pissed.  Anyway.   My coat is better, and I got paid yesterday.  I got my tuxedo sizes in for my sister's wedding and got a cd player for my 94 ford escort LX.  WOOOO!  I even got some of my Latin done!  Yeah!  While going to best buy my dad said something like this:  "I AM AZN!  I honor my ancestors by ricing out my Civic and painting HONDA on the sides!  I also ate rice once!  I put a huge wing on it!  AZN PRYDE!"  AND I FUCKING LAUGHED MY ASS OFF.  Now I don't know, I have a few hours to do stuff.

      Dawn of the Dead, new one, so good.  It succeeded at freaking me the fuck out, making me laugh my ass off, and then some.  If you like zombies, watch it.  I worked and now am 110 dollars richer, muahahahah. At one point, Alex helped me tie metal bands around a large piece of insulation.  It was like I was the Hulk, ahah.  We moved lots of heavy things like that and stoves today.  Yesterday, volunteering was pretty simple stuff.  And I watched Dawn of the Dead, but I already said that.  Maybe today I'll be with Ashley.  :)

      Tuesday, I was late to First Hour, and Mr Wilder caught up to me at my locker and said (hahahah)  "Hey, Wes, been staying in North Omaha recently?" If you know what I mean, then you know what he meant, and that COMPLETELY SURPISED ME.  And apparently Alex offers his explanation: mralexpants: LOL mralexpants: yeah, i told the getting lost story WrathS 01: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH WrathS 01: WTF WrathS 01: AHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHA  I remember on monday I posted about getting lost in the ghettoes, yeah.  It snowed tuesday, too!  Crazy....  and Andrea and Alex came over and hung out, too.  Great stuff, mmmmm ice cream.  I installed Knights of the Old Republic, too.  I worked yesterday.  And stuff.  Yeah.  Today I worked yet again and met up with Ashley :)  Ash, if you're reading this, you're why I think I'm so lucky.   I plan on KOTOR tonight.

      I owe you a post.  I'm sorry baby, its just great things are happening.  Like the girl thing, she's so so so so so amazingly everything. Thats really really sappy and dumb, but shut up, this is my blog.    Charlie pissed me off today, which is no surprise, I treat them as I do all my friends, but Charles had to borrow my phone and didn't even tell me who they were calling.  Its my goddamned phone, Victor!  Hahaha.  I dissected a worm today! Yeah, it was crazy fun, I like biology.  I need to work on my Law and Legal stuff.

      On thursday, apparently I missed a whole set of questions on a biology test, and was notified when I got it back.  Both Adam Nightser and  I did the same thing.  Oh, well, our scores were still the best.  Muahah.  Alex and I worked, and drove around and stuff.  Friday I got out of class early in 3rd hour to head to Des Moines to get some official birth papers to get my Dutch Passport.  Bunch of loopholes.  Along the way, Derek told me more about how Nostradamus (that one guy in Iowa City) knows Wing Tsun and Hapkido, and is a bad motherfucker who just spanges in his freetime.  On our way back we listened to Bad Religion and the Clash.  That night we played 2 hours of Onslaught on the LAN.  Yesterday I worked for 5 hours with Alex, and he got money.  After that we chilled at the mall and I got 4th high score in Galaga.  Yet more chilling occured when I got home and played some games and talked to my femalre companionship interest.  Then Alex came by and we drove through the ghettoes of Omaha and later stuff happened when we got back into town.    o_O               (thats my, memory is shot face)  Today I went to brunch with Gary and Tamara at Ameristar.  I'll probably do some stuff later, but for now, I am, gonna switch to FireBird web browser.

      So Friday I stayed home due to the ankle.  At around 6 I ate some Toxic Hell with Vannier, and at 7:15 we went with Logan and Bauerly to see Taking Lives.  By the by, I showed them Ashley's picture and they agree in the thinking you are purrrty.  Heheh.  I changed my voicemail, too, and tricked Ash, hahah.  Yeah, you laughed, though.  We played some poker after that and I lost some money, but won some games, too.  It was good.  Now I'm doing this,  Sonja's coming later today (since this is saturday morning) and I have to work, AND I want to go to a party with Ashley, I'm a busy man......  I need to sleep.

I think I'm gonna just use a timechart to display what I've been doing:  Wednesday:  Greg was over, and we had the grip of fun, and Alex can attest to that.  I showed him some games and we did some stuff. He stayed the night.  Today, in PE I twisted my ankle.  Yeah, and I was walking all day on it.  Alex and I did duo improvs. Eh.  I went to work on my ankle, and we actually finished a huge moving job.  But that aggravated my ankle, so now its wrapped in medical tape and my brother put chinese oil on it.

      So Monday, Ashley's dog died, and I *hopefully* cheered her up by being with her and spending vielen zeit mit ihn.  She's so great.  Sheeeeeeeeeee's a magical girl. *guitar vader, good song for being annoying*  Wow, typing in german is serhr...... easy.    Iunno,  I worked yesterday and stuff.  Talked to Ashley for about 80 minutes on the phone, I hope I'm not going over.  Tonight I'm planning on going out with the family to Ameristar/Harvey's.

      Yeah, there needs to be an entry, and I'm just the man to provide with one.  Saturday it rained almost all day fairly hard, and due to hazards at work that it poses, I didn't go to work.  Gary did give me my new orders, which, are, heh, fairly confidential.  After that, I went out to Ashley's brother's friend's birthday party at family fun center.  I won a Bruce Lee poster!  Yeah.  And Ash and I spent some time together, which is great.  We went to Fuddruckers, and I have never eaten a larger burger in my life.  Man, I was full.  I had a great time with her, as usual.  I don't know what else to say other than that she makes me so happy, and I make her happy, too!  I later contemplated her birthday gift, and lo and behold, we agreed on a little sum'n sum'n. Sonja and my parents came when I got home from Fuddruckers.  Today, not a whole lot else happened except that I got my ut cds.  BUT UT DOESN'T WANT TO WORK.  I don't wanna have to pay......... ugh......  I am glad that Unreal4Ever is the greatest weapon Mutator for Unreal Tournament 2003, and will hold me over until I can get ut2004.  And then there's Kotor, which I am still playing.  Ashley and her friend Ashley (same middle name, too) talked a while today, and that was pretty fun, too.  Scary, but fun.  Sonja and Ryan left, also.  Yeah short visit.  It was mainly for Sonja to see her friends and then complain about the house.  Swear to God, she always whines about the house.    I'm doin' a wash right now.. prolly gonna see Ash to celebrate our 2 weeks *fweeeeeet!*.  Its not much, but it should be fun, again.

      Florida post:  Current Music - The Offspring - There's No Tomorrow Mood - Relaxed  Today I woke up and had an all doughnut buffet, as per the usual monday charter club ritual.  Then I went sailing with Steve and Jerouen (my uncle from the Netherlands).  My dad tried to hop on the catamaran and couldn't get in, haha.  But I lost my blue wetshoe.  I got some new ones.  Took a 4 mile walk and did some laps in the pool.  Been playing Final Fantasy quite heavily.  Not much else.  Miss ya Ashee.

      Yesterday was insanely chocked with coincidences.  I was on my way to Hellboy and saw a girl I know from Law and Legal a few yards from my house, then I was at omni four, and Jason from Law and Legal was there, and then I saw Alex Conyers' loud ass geo metro drive by with a head-bobbing Alex Beckman in the passenger seat.  They drove to Subway, we got out, talked, and then there was this girl from my Chemistry class!  Insane.  And then at work today, I went to Menards and saw John Seymour.  And I got paid for 21 hours.  Wooot.  I got some more black tranfer paper, so I''m gonna work on another Megadeth shirt.  I'm driving the Lincoln LS down to KCI airport with my dad to pick up my mom tonight.  Painkiller?  After I make the transfer.

      SO on sunday I worked on my English, no biggie.  On Monday I worked on Empire Lawn Industries for 6 hours and then topped that off with finishing my english.  Not due for another week, but meh.  Today I was sick but still went to school.  When I got home, I realized that I forgot my key.  I was locked out for 4 hours with Fat'll and Pilitje.  So I finished my Biology homework and shot some hoops.  Dad brought me some really nice steaks and shrimp.  We were just watching Band of Brothers on the WW2 channel.  I mean, History Channel.  One last thing:  WrathS 01: see WrathS 01: the thing about painkiller is WrathS 01: its everything you could want in an fps WrathS 01: zombies WrathS 01: skeletons that gib WrathS 01: giblets that spew blood WrathS 01: trickling blood WrathS 01: fast firing be-all end-all shotguns WrathS 01: and fucking METAL C Keith Parker: lol C Keith Parker: i told ya man WrathS 01: METAL, CHRIS WrathS 01: and not just any metal C Keith Parker: LOL WrathS 01: it sounds like 80s metal WrathS 01: with the crazy guitars WrathS 01: that go WEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHH C Keith Parker: aahah WrathS 01: and did i mention that the giblets FUCKING SPEW BLOOD WrathS 01: THATS AWESOME WrathS 01: its like BLEOW BLORTCH BLAHAHAHAHGHGHHAHG C Keith Parker: hahahahaha

      Well, well.  Guess who's back.  I'm sorry I left you guys..... but Florida is great stuff.  All the hot girls in bikinis and alcohol..   Pretend I didn't say that last part.  But it really is great.  I sailed and I did so much walking, and so many beautiful things.... nature. Not to mention these two girls from the UK, hehehhe.  Thats another story.  It turns out that those Dutch relatives of mine didn't take everything and the kitchen sink!  Good for them.  Its crazy, really, how fast they grow up!  I don't remember them being so mature.  Little Jasper (ya-sper) is 10 years old!  Imagine that.  He has studied English for only one year and can communicate quite well!  He's a smart one, and he's not as much of a spazznoid/jerk as he was before. Martaijn is quiet, probably because he's hitting puberty, hah.  He's .....12... or 13 now...  yeah, he's cool. And little Peter has a little knowledge of English, but is apparently dyslexic!  I don't understand why his parents (my uncle and aunt Jeroen and Renate) worry so much about the kids academically so much.  Jeroen is fine, and since last year managed to keep the weight off!  Renate is still... Renate.  Hahhah.  Oh well.  Good people.  One day we were talking about his job, and he discussed with me Holland's janked up system.  Its janky.  Though there's not as much sueing there, if you own a business, you're responsible for EVERYthing that happens to your employees and therefore must pay lots of insurance.  The rich gotta pay a lot of money and such to benefit those that lack job skills.  Oh well, kinda like here, I guess.    One day, while I was sailing, I lost my wet shoe.  The ocean is a cruel bitch-mother, she is.  Grand, yet brutal.  I had to buy another pair of wet shoes, but those buggers give me blisters.  I need to strengthen my feet.  Wow, I just realized that I already posted that 6 days ago!  Hahha.    Florida isn't as hot as you may think around this time... its only in the upper to mid 80's.   In accordance with my everlasting nerditude, I played lots of Final Fantasy and beat Kirbys Adventure for the NES (which, is completely and utterly trippy/awesome). I took plenty of pictures of the scenery and a few of my relatives.  Very good stuff.  Halfway through the week, Sonja and Ryan came down.  My dad and mom picked them up from.... Fort Lauderdale?  I guess.   I think I have a new mathematical theory in regards to Ryan. x=wz^2 + n       where x is the amount of times a day he makes fun of my choice in girlfriend and w is our age difference and z is the amount of time we've been dating.  N is her ethnicity (the numerical value being what letter their birth country is   america = a = 1).    Bogus, eh?  I think no matter who I date, I'm gonna be given a hard time.  He and Sonja have been working quite hard on wedding invitations.... buh. Did I say that those three cousins only eat meat?  Yeah.... thats all.  But they're completely thin...... I think, then, that the Atikins diet works.... even though they've been on it before it was ever 'invented'.  I met some nice kids on thursday and we socialized.  Two were 14 and from the UK.  And looked quite... ahem.... mature.  We discussed British music and such.  But I did tell them I had a girlfriend (don't worry Ashley, heh) Some of the kids did martial arts and we talked and stuff.  Really cool.  I got some pictures of em, too.  I watched a lot of Spike TV and am very fond of Most Extreme Elimination Challenge!  Those rebdubs are HILARIOUS!  Yesterday morning I must've woken up about 6 times, due to very realistic dreams of us all getting ready to leave the condominiums and packing up.  I fell for that about 3 times.  Some other dreams included me being in a massive zombie fight, and moving out of a house in a city.   Iunno.  Miami international airport is a freaking ZOO.  Enough said.  Well, actually... not enough.  My dad and I l had to leave yesterday, and at the airport we ate some sushi.  It was FECKIN GOOD!  It was like a little tray of 12 rolls (rice and tuna/salmon) with wasabi.  Cheap, too!  And I'm not sick today.    On one of the flights home, I finally got to see Big Fish!  What a great movie.  Steve-o and I were getting teary eyed in the end.  One of those great father son bonding moments.  *SHUT UP, guys*.  There was like a little touch screen tv in the seat in front of me!  So cool.  On the road home from Kansas International, we ate grilled stufft burritos and listened to classic rock.  Good stuff.  He and I like a lot of the same bands from that era.  Now its just me and him until Saturday.  Me and the good doctor.  Maybe we can see Hellboy!  I think I'm a very lucky person.  Pcture this.  White.... rich(ish) family..... educated....live in heartland america.... girlfriend thats everything....chance to vacation and see the world....  I wonder a lot: WHY?!  I see so many other people that don't get these things and here I am....  just the chance I was born in the right place at the right time.  I ponder that.  SURVEY TIME!  Just because I like making HUMONGOID blogs. 1.Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says: "Display(HUD).  Keep an eye on your HUD to keep in touch with the"  2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?: mid air.  If I moved more to the left  would touch another chair.  3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?: The Jewel of the Nile on comedy central  4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is: 11:15  5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?: 11:22 ( I have an extremely distorted sense of time, when I was young, I never understood the concept of a second)  6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear? Well, aside from the fans/hard drives of my computer tower, I can hear Megadeth - Vortex (good song)  7: When did you last step outside? what were you doing?: from inside? I was leaving KCI airport to wait for a blue bus to take me and daddy-o to our car  8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?: Before Blogger... Alex Peterson's Xanga.  9: What are you wearing?:  Stained wife beater and checkered boxers.  I look so much like a stereotypical disheveled man right now.  10: Did you dream last night?  I forgot!  I usually try not to forget.  11: When did you last laugh? When The streets were playing and Terry was gonna batter someone.  12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?: French painting, grandma's quilt, Spike, the punk rock kitten with a spike collar on its neck (its a poster), another quilt, a poster of a Japanese Macaque monkey with a snowball,  two of eleanor's depressing paintings, another of her paintings with lightning, a mirror, balloon paintings, glass..... mexican hats??  And an old OLD OLD Lifesavers advertisement: "They're as pure as the driven snow!  Won't you try one?  You're bound to like them- they have such a dainty, refreshing sweetness.  Everybody likes Lifesavers, because they  taste  so good.  And they're so clean and crisp in their tight little tinfoil packages.  Just the sort of sweets you want."  I can't help but laugh.  13: Seen anything weird lately?:  In a terminal transit in Dallas, I sat across a girl who looked EXACTLY LIKE ASHLEY.  And then, someones cell phone rang and they said "Oh, hey Ashley!" WHICH WAS WEIRD.  Speaking of Ashley, my parents were watching star wars episode two and they say you look like natalie portman.  I would post a picture here, but that would ruin the flow of the quiz.    14: What do you think of this quiz?: i like it  15: What is the last film you saw?: Big Fish  16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?: guns  17: Tell me something about you that I don't know: I used to be skinny  18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?: Make everyone realize they need to recyvle moe and be friendlier to the planet   19: Do you like to dance?: yes  20: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?:  Katalina.... Latin for Katherine.  21: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?: Romulus.  Oh yeah. OR Xtoverus.  Latin for christopher.  People would call him X.  22: Would you ever consider living abroad?: Yep!  Maybe holland or germany or tokyo.  23: Will you pass on this survey?: done!

      *Sigh*  Invariably I will have offended someone.  You should know I was referring to this Wiccan (witch) girl in my Psychology class.  Who, upon seeing my Megadeth shirt and Megadeth CD, told me "Megadeth sucks."  She was wearing an LP shirt, and goth girl wearing a Korn shirt was next to me.  Right then, I was pretty pissed off at Witch-girl and Korn girl. I respect all music, but when someone takes a stab at my own favorite type, well, then, they get made fun of.  Since you two don't make fun of metal, I wasn't making fun of your liking of Linkin Park.  I was talking about someone else.  Didn't I say that LP has some good songs?  I have listened to them.  Wow.  Settle down.  I can't believe I have to explain things like this on my own little journal.  In other news.... Alex and I went out and saw Kill Bill volume 2.  We bought tickets to Hell Boy and then made fun of Megan Parott, who works at the counter.  Eh, she's a decent person, I was just giving her a hard time on the job.  Anyway, we 'snuck' into KIll Bill and it was freaking awesome.  The kung fu parts ruled.    I worked shortly today, and now am finishing up some songs for a cd.

      Alex and I were about 15 minutes late to PE yesterday, sicne Kyle didn't tell me he couldn't take me.  Well, as we were walking up to the track, about read yo to do our punishment laps, we beheld a beautiful, yet strange sight: Mr. Chamberlain.  Bwhahahaha, Alex and I were so relieved coach Olsen wasn't there.  I did my kung fu speech, and it went well (I hope).  I normally don't get nervous when I speak to people, but my hand got a really bad nervous twitch.  Yikes.  Hansen was still gone.  Garrett and I got owned in Biology.  Today was mellow.  I wore my newer Megadeth shirt, and sure enough, a diehard Metalhead walked up to me and asked me where I got it.  I said I made it and how.    Then we shot the shit and talked about Metallica and Megadeth.  It was pretty cool.  I prolly need to do more research cards tonight.  Damn.

      Alex and I ate some good sushi and made asian jokes yesterday.  And then got some bawls.  I played Far Cry for a minute on a fast computer, too, at compusa.  I got my mom back!  (sounds like she was in prison, haha)  and then we stayed at aunt Jo's.  I'm back.

      Thursday night volunteering rocks the crap out of Friday night.... and I got free cake!  That night I had a weeird and scary and bad dream about Gary yelling at me and saying I was a horrible worker, and Ashley kept calling me at work and I kept having to put her off because Gary was there.  I woke up with an immense feeling of dread.  Today was a good day, though!  We voted for student council representatives for next year.  And I've been playing ut for a while since I've been home.  I've been playing some guitar, and I could play the opening riff to Almost Honest by Megadeth, if my guitar was in tune.  Blargh.  Now..... to play some more UT or maybe some Painkiller...... or..... *gasp* kotor?  I've been neglecting that beautiful game.  Oh well.

      So, if you guys were reading my blog everyday, good.  I'm glad.  It means a lot to me.  Its a shame, though, that I don't post enough, like I used to.  Anyway, this was quite the eventful weekend.  But no matter what, it turned out great.  I beat unreal 2004.  And I spent four hours with Ashley on monday, which was aaaaawesome.    Yesterday, I didn't work.  So I played unreal.  Derek is back, too.  Last night, I cut my  thumb on a sword, and today in chemistry, I accidentally got Zinc Nitrate on the cut.  IT STUNG.... REALLY BADLY.  I worked today, and now I will do other things.

      Well, it turns out that Swipey lives.  Ok, we were quick to think that she's dead, but when your cat is gone for two days and weighs about 4 lbs and is that old, you start to worry if they can still handle themselves.  She's hardly eating, so Iunno whats gonna happen.   I worked yesterday and then had to help Tamara get the computer at the office to Compusa.  While I was there, I got some Bawls and some case. sticker things.   Unreal and AMD.  Woot.  Then today, I worked and while I was weedwhacking, I didn't wear jeans (too hot) and my legs kinda got pelted with debris.  Oh well, I need to change how I walk with that thing.  Last night (whoa, I'm skipping around here) I played diablo 2 for about 2 or 3 hours with Jake Stark.  God..... I need help.  Seriously.   I have a serious problem, and I need to be cured of my D2 addiction.  My Car is at Ballenger's automotive, getting the shocks fixed, since its been a bumpy little ride.  Speaking of which, I registered for 7:30 -9 am driver's ed classes in the summer.  I chose that to conveniently put them before work.  I hope I get enough sleep!  I have few other plans for today.

"Carpe Cerevisi" sieze the beer, good Latin saying.   1. What do you most like about your body? muscular 2. And least? i'm fat. 3. How many fillings do you have? none, good teeth 4. Do you think you're good looking? well i hear it a lot from Ashley 5.

She often played NIN's Downward Spiral album,  They Might Be Giants Flood album, REM, and some other bands (I even starred in a music video she made in High school,  with U2's  End of the World song, and me eating a pizza slice and dancing).  For a fact, I know that the first music video I ever saw was  Megadeth's 99 Ways to Die, on MTV, talking about gun violence and all the kids with guns.  So I guess Nine Inch Nails?  I really don't know.

      Schiggity?  Schwa.  Battle of the Bands was really fun, and 30 Seconds Late had a real hit with Megalomaniac.  It sucks that Jake Stark's guitar got unplugged.  I think I've talked about Jake hear before....  anyway.  Sonja left on sunday, and so did her kung fu buddy and Ryan.  I only saw all of them together this weekend for a collective.. 15-20 minutes.  Awesome... Sonja's been a bitch.  Then I played the grip of Painkiller, which was awesome, what with the zombie ninjas and the zombie Nazi's and my arsenal of 100 rockets.  PEOPLE CAN FLY! And, coincidentally, be blown into small pieces.   I can play Painkiller online, even though I got it off of Deviance (hahaha)  Today was mellow.  Good.  I need less drama.  I guess it can be said that life is drama.  To say you're done with drama is to stop being alive.  Both metaphorically and physically.  I just want to be slightly sedated/have less drama.  Not a complete lack thereof, of course.  Buuh.  What? Yeah, ok.

      Metallica ROCKED.  My god I screamed all the lyrics and rocked out so hard.  Not much headbanging, but it was awesome for my 1st concert.  And when you see about a thousand lighters in the blackness while Kirk plays the solo to Sanitarium, its a beautiful thing.  Then thursday I dissected a pig.  It was about 20 or so inches long.  Ugh, so many fluids in those little bastards.  I was so hoarse that day, though.  I worked today.  So yeah, I'm out for now.

      WOW.  WHAT HAPPENED TO BLOGGER?!  I DON'T KNOW.  It looks differenton my neck of the woods.  So, since the 8th, some stuff has happened.  Sunday I played KOTOR for 8 hours.  It was awesome.  Yesterday I forget.  I'll remember later.  Today I ran 20 laps in the gym for being late and then a lap around the track and even more running for soccer.  Running angers me.  Really.  So yeah, and I didn't have to present my work today in English so Kim and I both sorta lucked out.  Hahaha Ms Kalkman is hilarious.  OH man, speaking of hilarious, I showed my audio tape in class today.  Everyone laughed.  My God, I was embarrassed though.

I got my glasses repaired with gary after work and he even let me drive the denali!! Smoothe as heck driving, too, let me tell ya.  My left arm hurts like a mofo though, no idea why.  Work?

      Well, I think I need to make a timechart-ish deal for what has happened.  Friday, I got out early and did my last English speech.  No final for that class, that deserves a mighty w00t. Ok, I'm neglecting to say that Hans sounds like Pacino + the talking goat enough.  He Does.  And he heard the talking goat, and busted up.  My God.  We rehearsed the wedding with all the important guys (groomsmen, me being one of them) and then went out to eat.  I met Ryan's brother, Eric (very similar in appearance) and his English uncle.  Good ole chap.  Derek went to a seminar that night with Sei Tai Gung (anthony dandridge) smoking and fighting and whatnot.  Yestermorn, as I am want to call it, it rained, just as my dad predicted.  Eh.  We still got in our tuxes, went to the gazebo on the green, and had Sonja's ceremony as planned.  I have pictures!  Anyway. Reception rocked, kung fu people came.  Wine flowed free.  The band played Sabbath at my request (sweet leaf! yesss) and one of my dad's old friends got high and started talking about how his computer runs off of gerbil power and how it costs a damned fortune to feed those bastards.... or somesuch stoned jabber.  Yep.  Sonja and Ryan have tons of presents.  I played some Virtua Fighter 4, as the shaolin monk.  Awesome.  I drove all 4 hours back to town in the van.  Woot.  Oh, yeah, Hans had more sex, too.  And he's old.  Hahahaha, horny Dutchman.  Anyway.  Ask me in person, I'll tell you more.

      I JUST REALIZED THAT 80% OF MY POSTS START WITH "Well..." and "So..."!  HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH   God, thats so lame.    I think on wednesday, I saw Derek do the grossest thing he's ever done. Even more gross than spitting a one foot loogie on my arm.  He was pissing in the sink.  My god.  Ugh.  I'm out of school, and on Friday (the last day) I worked.  Later that night, I went to Tara's and watched bad boys 2.  And then after work on saturday, she breaks up with me.  Haha.  Weird.  Anyway, Friday, I got my parts, and saturday, derek screwed the mobo in, and I did the software work, installing bios, drivers, testing, benchmarking.  Anyway, turns out, my computer is 2x faster now.  *ha ha ha*  I saw Troy last night, my god it was awesomely cool.    So I have two ideas on getting yet another female counterpart. One, I get to know a certain girl I've been talking to for a while Two, I ask Rod how the fuck he gets so much poon, study his ways, and reap the benefits of being a playa.  Thats all I can think of now.  I start driver's ed soon.   Meh, sorry about the grammar.

      Well, I turned 16 yesterday.  Yes, yesterday was my birthday, and nothing special happened.  Good, since I don't deserve much special.  I worked 9 to 5, thanks, Gary.  Asshole.  At least Heather, the HOT NEW MANAGER was there.  She looks like a blonde Tina Fey with bigger tits and my God, HOT.  She was there today, as well.  I mowed with Rod both days.  She's gonna be with us every Friday.  Awesome, because she will lie for us to Gary.  Muahaha.  I'm prolly gonna get myself a dvd and a cd and extra money sometime soon as a belated gift.   While I wasw mowing, I saw the biggest butterfly I have ever seen, and in itself, it represented the beaty of nature, pacified.  It was as large as my hand and more colorful than a kaleidoscope.  Delicate and yet, great in size.  I have never seen such a thing in my life and probably never wil again.  It is sad to think when you want to take a picture, to remember the image, you can't....

      I don't know.  I'm feeling so tired lately, like the world has shackled itself to my feet and the only escape I have is computer games and talking to people.  Which is acutally quite a good escape.  I have the HL2 beta, and its nothing to get sticky pants over.  Its nice, but buggy, as I may have said before.  Now Adam has ut2004 and we're probably gonna keep playing till he gets good.  Thats gonna take a bit.  Gimme gimme gimme.   I want some more.  Gimme gimme gimme.  Don't ask what for.  Black Flag - Gimme Gimme Gimme (old school punk)

      I worked like a motherfucker today.  Argh.  1. Take your BLOGSPOT username and replace each letter with the corresponding number (A=1, B=2, etc...). WrathS= 23 18 1 20 8 19    2. Add all of the numbers together to create a kind of super number. 89  3. Make a note of the first digit of this number, then add the digits of the number together. (8) 17  4. Find the post of this number in your Xanga. If you don't have that many posts, add the digits together again. Keep doing so until the number is smaller than your pathetic number of posts.  5. Take the digit you noted in step 3, and count that many words into the post. 8= Keep  6. Use the resulting word in a Google Image Search, and select a picture from the first page.   7. Post the results for us all to see!

      In Drivers ed (or Ded, as I like to call it, to refer my state of mind in that class) I did the backing test.  I did pretty sucky on the left turn around the island part and the straight backing across the curb part.  But I did do well on parallel parking.  Kudos... to me!  After that, Rod picked me up and we were off to work.  In the rain.  At Gary's demand.  And started to mow.  At Gary's demand.  And stopped mowing 20 minutes later.  At Gary's demand.  I was really wet by then.  So then we packed the crap up.  And got lunch at Ameristar.  Then we went to Gary's place, moved some shit for him (like 80 lb dumbbells).  Rod was struggling on deadlifting one in each hand, it was funny.  But the guy is pretty tough, no less.  We did some curls and benching and ping pong.  Went back to the units, unpacked the mower, hitched it up to the trailer/truck, and rode to Herr und Frau Schubert's to mow.  Then went back home.  8 hours, oh yeaah.  I'm kinda pissed that I ruined my (admittedly crappy) Megadeth Shirt with the demons on it.  Meh!  And how Rod and Gary talk about "innapropriate" things all the time.  Its almost sickening.  Well, I reinstalled UT thanks to Adam, who is Jesus Christ.  Blessed be the gifts of CD's brought upon by thee.  And whatnot.  God, I have no idea what to do now.  Maybe install UT updates.

      Alex Pants came over last night and he had to 'fix' his dash.  And for some reason Andrea decided to drop by and bring that Steve dude and Adriana girl.  And Alex Beckmeister.  Which was alright.  I didn't see anyone but Alex B, which was awesome, because we talked about strategy and conspiracys and crazy time cycles and fighting galactic wars, and memes.  And Atlantis.  It all comes back to Atlantis.  You know, people that don't like him  probably don't because they aren't smart enough to grasp the concepts (or understand, or fit into their own mnds) he speaks of.  When you get him and I together, we can relate our ideas on so many things, its very intellectual.  Well, I'm gona play a little D2 and then go to work.

Well, it all ties in back to the Illuminati and the 13 stars, the pentagram, followers, anarchy and so much stuff that makes your head spin.  Seriously, guys and gals.  Seriously.  fnord.  http://www.verthaine.sphosting.com/dd.html  I know this sounds weird, but maybe its the clue the key to all the conspiracies?    What the fuck........

      I'm listening to the instrumental version of She-Wolf by Megadeth from Cryptic Sounds (intrumentals from Cryptic Writings).  Its pretty nice.  It starts off with acoustics and sorta sounds like some action Antonio Banderas spanish song.  Like, you know, fast and spanish sounding.  It made me want to write this post.  And here, then it goes back to how it originally sounded, full blasting metal outtro solo replete with drums.  Goddamn, thats a good song.  Continuing on about music, Rod god some 12 inch subs in his car and now feels the need to blast rap all the time (even moreso than usual) and all you can here is BBBBBBBBBBBBB    BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB    BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB    BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBbbbbbbbbBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBbbbbbbbbbbb BBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB and its super counter-intuitive.  Why listen to MUSIC when all you can hear is some synthetic bass?  Meh.  Some people, I tells ya.  Hey, did I ever say I took a leave of absence from volunteering?  Because I did.  Like last week.  Wow I lost track and forgot about this post.   Lindsey and Andrea chilled here lst niht for a bit, it was cool.  I never have hung out with Lindsey before.  End transmission.

Saddest/funniest/weirdest:  Logan.  Hahaha.    Suprising: Finding Bartuc's cut throat  Enjoyable:  Leading 2 invasion maps in a 24 person server.  Fun!

      So, by some demented twist of fate, I owe you all a blog post.  Today, I waited for a while for Derek to get me from TJ.  So then I go back into the school and call my mom.  Who doesn't know if he left or not.  As fate would conspire against me the first time today (this blog being the last, hopefully) Derek had driven to and left TJ in the few minutes I was inside the school. Blast it!  So my mom took me into work.  And I worked 7 hours, yey.  I just despise the scent of decaying flesh... bird flesh.  Its no different from any other type of chordate flesh, but meh.  God taco bell zesty chicken bowls are soooo awesome and filling.  God invoices are so lame.  God Alex Apostol is so dumb (zing!).  Then at 7 ( an hour after I got home) Boucher offers to take me to the Movies.  Which?  King Arthur!  Yay!  Romans and Latin! Good shit.  I saw Taylor Scott too, after leaving the film.  And going back down broadway, this hot sophomore (now)  chick named Halay.   Mmmm I would so hit it.    Anyway, She was in the car on our right, and I said "Yeah, guys, I'm gonna get her number".  And then they looked at her and said "The blonde?  Yeah she's hot, go for it."  And Eric gave me a pen. And then her car turns away.  Damn you fate!!  Ok, end post before it goes sour.  wait, wait, Fridge Full of Jizz and the Cankles.  There we go.

      Well this sucks.  Derek was on my aim last night, which I already knew, and thought it was no biggie.  He started talking to amy and i told him she was dating kevin, so i told him not to fuck around.  He asked if she was good looking and i said, sure.  Well he apparently proceeded to hit on her after I left.  I figured he would do something stoogish (as usual) but not this bad. I saw him talking to nate at one point when i returned to put my phone in the charger.  I said 'that's nate, remember when he was here once?". I assumed it was nothing, and theyre not having any of the facts. So I guess nate duncan is calling me a liar after i found out what derek said and tried to talk to her/him.  Why he's on her aim sn i don't know.    So yeah, I'm partially responsible for leaving aim on to send an album to a friend.  But its not like i can stop him from acting dumb.  Its kinda hard to do that when i don't know what he's doing.  Even if i did see him coming on to amy, wrestling the mouse away from him is not easy at all.  Anyway, i'm sure things will clear up with time, even if they doubt my acount.

"Father time, I'm running late  I'm winding down, I'm growing tired  Seconds drift into the night  The clock just ticks till my time expires       You were once my friend  Now I know I can't tie your hands  The days I saved I couldn't spend  They fell like sand through the hourglass  No time to lose, no time to choose       Time taking time, it's taken mine  Scenes of my life seem so unkind  Time chasing time creeps up behind  I can't run forever, and time waits for no one  Not even me       An enemy I can't defend  My final place a deadly end  Life's just a speck in space  Dreams of an eternal resting place       I can't get any younger  Time has brutal hunger"     I have no time anymore.  I lied.  I do have time, but no one else does when I do.  Wtf.... I know the world doesn't work around me... but still.  I'd like something to work out with people sometime in my life.....

      What have I done for 5 days?  I forget.  Its all just a haze (thankfully not drug-induced) of me being at Gary's, the Units, the Star Cinema (watching Anchorman twice) and being on aim.    I Have not done a LICK of biology.  I NEED TO FINISH a chapter every week.  God help me if I don't.  I have to read a lotta pages and do a lotta work tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  I know I can do this, I know it, I just gotta stay home and not go out. Stay away from the computer.  That sorta deal.    I'm getting my haid cut in 15 minutes.  I should probably leave 'n do that.    The lyrics to "I wanna be sedated" come to mind.  Sooo...  let me play it, post the lyrics, and leave.  If you don't know who sings this, you need to be shot.     Twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go   I wanna be sedated   Nothing to do, no where to go, oh   I wanna be sedated      Just get me to the airport, put me on a plane   Hurry hurry hurry, before I go insane   I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain   Oh no oh oh oh oh     Just put me in a wheelchair, get me on a plane   Hurry hurry hurry, before I go insane   I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain   Oh no oh oh oh oh     Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show   Hurry hurry hurry, before I go loco   I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes   Oh no oh oh oh oh     Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show   Hurry hurry hurry, before I go loco   I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes   Oh no oh oh oh oh      Ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated   Ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated   Ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated   Ba-ba-baba, baba-ba-baba, I wanna be sedated    WHOOOOOOOO!!!

      Sigh.  This is tiring to update, and even moreso to read, I'm thinking.  I thank anyone who still reads this unfunny drivel.  I look back into my archives and laugh, because I was a funny little wanker.  Now look at me.  Waah waa waah.  Anyway.  Me mama's b-day was on the 2nd, and I'm buying her a vaio to appease her.  And do her mail and whatnot.  All the more 'puter for me to DOOM 3 ON!!!  Yeah, I have it.  Yeah, its so scary, sometimes I don't want to play it....  But I can't for more than 20 minutes anyway.  I've figured that my games crashing isn't a problem due to HEAT, since Aaron Keck and Dustin Graybill rewired my Case and put arctic silver thermal paste over my heatsink. My AMD's temperature right now is around 48 C.  Which would be normal, or so.  Critical is around 70, and after doom 3, its 52....  Unreal crashes fairly fast, too.  Hmm... d2 doesn't at all.  So I'm thinking that its my Graphics card being gay as usual.  Derek thinks that the modern games put too much demand on my onboard AC97 sound, and thats why it crashes to desktop.  Well, Dustin lent me some soundcards, and maybe that will stop the hardware buffer from overflowing.  Or maybe it is the graphics card and time for me to kill Chris parker with an x800 pro.   I got paid, whoop de fuck.  I got my classes. Whoo-hoo.  I'm almost done with my biology, I can do a chapter every day, so I'm planning on using tomorrow to start/finish chapter 53?  And tuesday to thoroughly PWN chapter 54.  Leaving me 2 weeks to do chapter 55.   OH!  I FUCKED UP MY ALIGNMENT!! WOO.  I was speeding in front of LC *teacher lot* and I was changing the bass boost on my stereo, cranking the volume on Holy Wars (Alex Apostol and Chris Parker truly can respect that) and I wasn't paying attention and hit a curb!  My first one on my own, its a milestone.  Now I have to fix it.  Christ, what else.  What else.  Not much else.  I'll think of more.

      I saw Harold and Kumar go to White Castle last night, it was hilarious.  Plus I blasted Rust In Peace on the way and sped there and back.  I saw Alex and like 8 other people there. No surprise.  They all swing off someone's balls.  End transmission?
