      He walks through the door  He greets his wife with a smile brighter than the sun In his eyes there is love far greater than anything on this planet His son bounces to him and immediately starts jabbering They talk and the son tells his father about his day Excitement rising, cheeks flushed, living breathing love I feel the warmth in that moment, in that house, in that family It radiates and spills over onto me and I take a deep breath  His daughter blubbering with words and chirps Smiling up at him like it is the first time They sit together and talk speaking a language all their own Playing patty cake in a way only between them The son joins in at the father's request He coaxes him and teaches him how to do it And they play they show his daughter how  His wife falls into the picture like that missing piece The piece that makes the picture almost whole But there is another piece  A piece that has become vital to this picture She is the new gift that was given And the communication amongst them continues  The interaction that no one else was meant to understand As is slowly dissipates they fall together into the living room And I feel like one of the family He walks over to me and lifts her from my arms to his "How is my gorgeous girl?"  With the cheesy yet enduring grin that he has He crosses the room holding her close Settles himself into the couch  Crossing his legs  Sets her little tiny body in a spot that was created just for her And he looks at her, gazes at her beauty The Son shining behind them  Light flowing over them and I know This moment will be etched in eternity It will be framed and hung on a wall In a mansion where the streets are gold And that's where it will stay Forever and always until the end of the ages  To my friends the Clouds, I just want you to know how much I love, cherish and respect all of you.

      O.K. so for those of you who read this often if you haven't noticed I can't decide on a template. I really like some of the one's on there but the one I really like is the one that Micah used. So with all of my heartfelt apologies to Micah I am going to use it. I hope that someday you can find it in you to forgive me.

      So how do I say this without sounding like the most horrible person. I sometimes feel like I am quite possibly the worst Christian on the face of the planet. However I do not feel any guilt or remorse about this because there is peace. I have not talked to my mother in over 3 weeks and she has been calling trying to get in touch with me. I have not returned a phone call or e-mail and I don't want to. There is a fear that lies beneath in my soul that I can not think about. There is a heaviness and a darkness that burdens me everytime I think about talking to my mother. Why? Why? Why? I want to love and respect her, I want to cherish her, I want to honor her as the Lord would call me to do but I can't. I think that I can honestly say without a question that I do not love my mother. I don't respect her deicisions, her advice, the way she treats everyone including me. I don't respect her as a mother because she has done an absolutely horrible job. I don't respect her advice and the way she expresses herself in all situations. I do not cherish anything about her. Cherish would imply to value highly, to hold dear and I don't value her as a person, as an adult grown woman, as a parent, a wife, or a friend. The thing that I have the hardest time with is the honor part, she doesn't honor anyone in any definition of the word. How do you give honor to someone that does not deserve it at all. How do I justify my feelings towards my mother when it explicitely goes against everything that I am called to. The fear that I speak of is the fact that I was once just like her. I was angry and violent towards people and the world in general. I was confrontational and aggressive when things were not done my way. I was a horrible person to everyone, family, friends, people I didn't know. I don't ever want to be like that again, I want to be bigger than all of those things that hinder me and build a wall between God and I. My mother's wall is still a million feet high. She won't let anyone in and when she does they are lies. She won't put anyone first because it does not advantage her. There is no gain in giving of herself so she doesn't do it even though she thinks she does and will be irrationally angry if you don't see it. I hate the person she is and all she does is help me to put myself right back in that place of contempt. She is the only person on the face of this planet that can get me right to that edge where I used to lose it. She is the only person that can still drive me to a rage that is uncontrolable. She is the only person that I would hit because of my anger and her complete disregard for anyone but herself. She has lied to me, stole form me, and beat me down so much that I can't do it anymore. She has lied to my sisters and given them false hope that she will actually be the mother that they yearn for. She has badmouthed my father, blamed the entire divorce on him, and criticized him to me. I really think that she thinks that I was to young to really understand what was happening. I think that she really believes that I didn't see her affair, her abusiveness of my dad, and her lack of attention to my sisters and I. She sees me as a 12 year old kid that doesn't know what I am talking about. I can't watch her treat my sisters the way that she does, and I can't listen to her blatantly lie about my father not only to me but people that don't even know my father. I can't do it anymore. These last 3 weeks have been so peaceful. I have been able to focus 100% on my marriage, family other than my immediate, school, and work. She calls every night and the dread rises in my throat. I honestly have this feeling of nasea every time I think about talking to her or listening to her crap. I really don't know what to do about it. I have prayed that God would change my heart and I would be an example. I truly think that I have been however nothing has changed and it has literally been 4 years. I am tired, I am drained, and I am weary of her. I can't do it anymore.

      Noise  noise is that rumbling in your head deafening in your soul it's the place between serenity and chaos the environment where you find ideas you don't need to search for them in noise they are just there being thrown and tossed waiting to be caught and used creativity is in the idea  conversation, voices, and emotion all of which you can touch  sensation and feelings course through your blood on the tip of your tongue you savor it the noise has texture and taste you can smell it as it passes by you every ounce of aroma filling your nostrils watch it take shape expression, body language, and movement  the serenity in noise is your own personal chaos  you can block out all other noise and the chaos in your head is it's own being the chaos is when you can't find the serenity when all you want is silence and it blares and rings like a gong then the noise evolves and it makes sense, sometimes at times you can translate it carries clarity and annunciation however you stare dumfounded  mouth agape trying to understand wanting to know and not miss the noise then you scream in fear and frustration the chaos in the noise is disturbing the serenity that you found interrupting your own personal chaos the ideas that you caught are gone vanished in the unwelcome noise the noise that once inspired now sealed shut the chaos that was once clear is now just chaos, only chaos confusing, annoying, demeaning you plead for the serenity  demanding it's return wanting more than anything to throw the ideas you have left back in the noise realizing you never wanted them  these were not the ones you wanted to grasp the noise decieved you talked you into the very thing you didn't desire then you realize it wasn't the noise it was you listening and hearing the wrong voice translating and trying to understand the wrong voice in that moment you want to go back yearning for a second chance to hear to listen and decipher and you cry and sob filled with despair as you begin to realize a second chance isn't coming the noise comes again this time you hear more thoroughly you listen more carefully and intuitively and this time you hear it the voice you wanted to hear the first time the ideas that you longed to catch realizing that it never required translation and it didn't need some deep understanding you just needed to drown out the rumbling  not let the blaring and ringing take your focus focus on the voice that you want to hear not the voice the noise wants you to hear when you can hear that voice in the midst of the serenity and chaos  hold it, catch it, grab it, never loosen your grip and once again the ideas will pour over you taste them in your mouth smell them in your nostrils and they will take shape in you your own personal chaos evolves into serenity the serenity is exciting  it draws you to expression which may not always be perfect it will never be perfect but you will try, push forward, and run faster then once again you will find, hear, and listen to the noise in a still small voice

      I was in a really bad ugly mood last night and I wrote this out of that mood.  Love to Hate  Love humiliates hatred cradles In the arms of love I find disrespect Contempt for the other I have never concieved The embrace is so strong and controlling Pinning my wrists and spitting in my face Wanting to cry and yell at his love  Demanding it be different and changed Desiring it to become something it can't Now in the arms of hatred I sometimes find peace Loathe the love and love the loathing Hatred doesn't hold me, I won't let it go  Holding so tightly, knuckles white from my grip  I choose not to change and I am satisfied to stay No sobbing or weeping in despair Content in my hatred knowing it is all it will ever be This is what I want though  His love to cradle  His hatred to hide

      this is my simple song that i realized is not so simple because a friend told me that it is sometimes the most simple songs that say the most.  Why Don't We Fight??  Why don't we fight for love Why don't we fight for peace Why don't we fight for trust Why don't we fight for unity  Will you fight with me Will you fight with me  Lord fight for me Lord fight with me Lord fight for me Lord fight beside me  Why don't we fight for grace Why don't we fight for the lost Why don't we fight for mercy Why don't we fight for Jesus  Will you fight with me Will you fight with me  Lord fight for us  Lord fight with us Lord fight for us Lord fight besided us

      The World is Changed  You planted the seed long ago Then waiting patiently for her to break the surface of this earth You continually thanked God for the seed Praying for sunlight and water to nourish her Praising Him for His abundance And today the world is changed A delicate flower sprouted through the soil Pushing and forcing her life out to you Her roots go down deep and are strong and thick Her stem is beautifully intricate and unique In her leaves you can see the path of life which was and is to come As she stretches up and unfolds, her face shines on you Her petals are wide and broad They are an array of living colors taken from the rainbow Full of vivid hues that bring promise In the center He will abide In the middle of everything about her Today you smile at your gorgeous flower She is all and everything you hoped for And right now you pray You pray that His merciful rain will fall on her always You fall on your knees with the expectation that she will soak up the Son forever Your request is that His face shines on her always Then you stand in His peace with confirmation Reassured of his words and commitment to you and her Always keep the soil fertile for her as He has for you Plant other flowers beside her that will exalt her Keep your garden which is her garden safe and protected the way he has protected you Guard her from the wind that comes to rip her out From the people that come to steal away her worth Strive to tend to her the way that He tends to her Now go, nurture, teach , love, and grow your precious flower  Dedicated to Annah Arwen Cloud 9/17/02

      Youth  I see the light in their eyes.  The light that permeates their smiles. I can feel the life running through their veins. I can hear the pounding of their hearts. I can hear the questions on their lips wanting, yearning, demanding answers. I can see the growth in their bodies and hear it in their voice. I can feel how they don't understand. I know their frustration and aggravation. I relate with wanting to fit in wanting to be more and better than they are. I see where they want to go. I understand that they don't know how to get there. I watch them reaching, reaching for something that they don't quite get. I look at them looking at me like I have all the answers. I watch them listen and absorb and take in everything that is said. I feel the confusion and the obliviousness that is written on their faces. I laugh at their jokes I smile at their naivity and giggle at their silliness. I am perplexed at how they push themselves. I stand in awe of their talents. I am struck by their gifts. I am enlightened by their ideas and thoughts. I cringe to think about the things that they fear. I hate how the enemy holds them so tight. I will fight for them on my knees. I will talk to them. I won't talk when they just need me to listen. I can show them they can trust me. I stand beside them when they hurt. I lift them up when they are down. I jump for joy next to them when it has been a good day, week, month, year. I will watch them become men and women of God. I see them standing on faith and fighting for the truth. I will watch them become whole.  I feel the light in their eyes.

      In the Still of the Heart  In the still of my heart there is peace that flows like a river. It flows to the quarry that God etched in me before time began.  In that quarry there is love like no other. Love that casts down all fears and gives me the wings to soar. Wings to soar where? Wings like the eagle to rise above this hell that I live in.  I don't really live there though I put myself there. I really live in a place full of hope and joy. Hope that withstands the test of time. Time that does not exist because it has always been. Existing to be more and more like Him. More like who??? Him who formed me in my mothers womb knitting me together tenderly. My mothers womb where He first gave me life.  Gave me life eternally never again to cry or feel pain. Eternity, do you really know how long that is? Stretching my arms as far as they will go, no I don't know how long that is. Arms that open to embrace me dirty, poor, and sinning. Poor, am I really poor? No I am rich I have more wealth than anyone on earth. Wealth that does not tarnish or fade. Does not? Stays pure and bright and full of zeal. Full to the brim with holiness and faithfulness. Am I faithful? Pray without ceasing. Ceasing to envelope myself in this world full of hate. World that He longs to pour compassion and kindness and salvation on. Longing to use me I am his hands and his feet. His hand that his knocking on the door of my heart.  The door that is waiting to be opened. Wait on Him and He will renew your strength.  Renewing everyday.  Everyday joy comes. Everyday? Everyday if you listen in the still of your heart.

      It's just one of those things. When you know that this weight that you are feeling is from God you just know. It's not a heavy weight nor is it a burdensome weight. It is that type of weight that just lays on you not uncomfortably but slightly and somewhat heavy. It's that tugging thought in the back of your head that tells you that there is something to be done. It is definitely not the thought of that something that you dread doing, it is the one that you know is going to bring you a deep unexplainable joy. What stops us? We stop us. We stop ourselves from pursuing it because of many various reasons. We don't see the means that we need to see as fleshly humans and we don't depend on him to provide it. We convince ourselves that it can't be done because we don't have the materials or resources to do it. The sad fact is we just won't try, we won't push ourselves past that mind set and we get ourselves stuck in a rut. You ever wonder what this world would be like if everyone that ever had a burden from God would have just taken that one step on faith to do it. You ever wonder how many more people would be in his kingdom if we could have just believed that it could be done. This is where I am at in my walk and this vision that I have. I am at the point of hopelessness and telling myself it can't be done. I am to small and it is to big for me to accomplish with success. But that is where I am wrong. If I would just take that first step of faith and seek God in every step it will be successful no if's and's or but's. So here it goes, I am going to put myself out on a limb here and I am going to do it. I am going to seek God and counsel from friends and mentors. I am going to continuously ask for prayer and guidance and advice. I am going to make a difference even if it is rough and painful and hopeless at times. I am going to rise up just as Christ has called me to do and it's not that he even called me to that I am already there I just am so blinded by my own walls and perceptions of what I think my abilities are. I am so much more talented than I think and I know this because I am a child of God. I am a daughter of a king and I am capable of anything because I have the confidence of the creator of the world backing me up. I have the encouragement from the one that never recieved any. And so I will go and I will take that step and if it ends up that I have to take five million steps before anything happens I will do it. I will do it not because I want to impress anyone I just want to be able to carry this burden so easily and relaxed that it is a way for me to show myself that I did it.

      Regal Royal Noble What do those words mean to me? Well they describe me I am a daughter of a king. What do I call him you ask? Abba Yahweh Adonai Messiah Redeemer Jesus Father One word that describes him the best is friend. My King is my best friend. He loves and respects me. He carries me when I can't go on He lifts me up on wings of eagles. He is my rock and fortress. My strong tower in distress. He is the shade from the sun and the sun in the rain. He is the rainbow that gives promise. Fights for me in the pit. Wipes the tears from my eyes. Comforts my sorrows. Applaudes my triumphs. Disciplines my wrongs. Blesses my prayers. He taught them how to reach his kingdom. He is the one that stretched his arms for me. Stretched them to hold me and this world close to him. He took the whipping and beatings for me. He was mocked, questioned,and torn down for me. He came back to tell me. To commission and command me. Go. It's my turn now. To be a best friend. Show love and respect to all. Carry the weak and the broken. Exalt my brother and sister. Be a shelter and safe haven. Make and keep promises. Fight for salvation. Be kind and compassionate outside of my box. Cheer. Chastise and rebuke according to His ways. Pray for blessings. To teach, empower, and equip. Stretch my life. Suffer. To be hated, martyred, and killed with words.  I am royalty and I need to take responsibility. It is my turn to show my position, As daughter of a King.

      Does That Really?  I wore a Christian sweatshirt today, does that really show God's love? I wore a WWJD bracelet, does that really show God's salvation? I go to church on Sunday's, does that really make me a Christian? I tell people that I am involved with church, does that really make me a disciple? I built a house in Mexico, does that really show God's refuge? I forgave someone their trespasses but held it in my heart, does that really show God's mercy? I was kind to someone in need, does that really show God's grace? I volunteered at the homeless shelter, does that really show God's compassion? I argued with my husband about something pointless, does that really show God's submission? I got into a mindless theological debate, does that really show God's wisdom? I listen to secular music in private, does that really show God's praise? I tithe every once in a while, does that really show God's abundance? I question myself and other's,  does that really show God's faith? In the end I have done all these "things", however really showing God starts on the inside.

      Today is October 25th, 2002 and tomorrow will be October 26th, 2002. If you had asked me what is significant about this date 3 years ago I would have looked at you with confusion because I have no idea. It's not a holiday, it's not my birthday or anyone in my family so I probably would have told you nothing. If you ask me today what is significant about October 26th, 2002 I will tell you it is the day that I married Jordan Michael Smith and became his wife. October 26th, 2001 we were married at Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Gilbert , AZ in front of our family and closest friends. October 26th, 2002 it will be one year. Hard and tough? Yes. Fulfilling and blessed? Yes as well. Let me tell you something though, over the course of this year someone told me that if we could make it through the first year we would be just fine. Well here we are and yeah we are going to be just fine. I won't lie to you and tell you everything was roses because I don't want you to have a false sense of what true unity and marriage is. You are going to have conflicts and yep you are going to argue on occasion. If you are that married couple that doesn't may God bless you and keep you that way. Jordan and I however have had our fair share of yelling and arguing but we are here and still together and we love God and each other. So we made it through the first year, I would not say with flying colors, but we made it and I think that as a husband and wife we are better people because of this last year. We have come to a solid ground in our faith as individuals and a couple, we love our families and have made some solid decisions for our own good in regards to them, and we cherish our family in Christ our friends who mean everything to us.

      I am so tired today I can barely keep my eyes open. More sleep is what I truly want and need. If I could just go back to bed for another 4 hours I would be in good shape. Eyes stay open and sleep will not find me until the right time after work and school and business that absorbs my life.

      It has been awhile but things have been really busy. I have been quite sick the last week and I am just now starting to get over it. It is really interesting the things that you think about when you are lying in bed and you can't breathe and all you do is cough. It is kind of scary but I actually thought about what would happen if the bronchitis got so bad that I died. Don't ask me why or where it came from but it came. What would Jordan do? What would my family do? What about my friends? I was really curious to see how people would react to my untimely departure. I think the fever was getting to me.

      I have not posted in awhile and it really sucks that this is the first thing that I have to say since the last post. Romeo died yesterday. We have had him for a year and a half and he is gone. He was really sick and it had been going on for about a week. He wasn't eating or drinking anything and he was just not himself. He usually would come and love on you and want you to pay attention to him. He would nudge you and rub against you until you would pet him. I would get so annoyed and push him away for whatever reason. Now all I want is for him to come and rub against me, I want him to come and lay on my chest and give me kisses, I want him to roll up in a ball and sleep on the couch and look very serene and beautiful. Romeo was a regal cat he was gorgeous, I had never seen a cat like him. He was black and white it looked like he was wearing a tuxedo with his white chest and black back. He had white socks and a pink nose that was always wet and cold. I think that the most amazing thing about him though was his eyes, he had emerald green eyes and when he had been sitting in the window for a little while with the sun shining in on them and his pupils were constricted you could see straight into the rainforests of Africa. He was the most amazing creature I have ever known. He loved everyone, never ran from anyone even when Hannah would kick him he would come back for more. Cela would always give him attention and he would just basque in it. All the boys (Micah.Grant,Luke,Rodney) were very respectful of him. I would watch him interact with all of my friends and I would truly thank God for the blessing that he was. At night he would come in and climb up on Jordan's chest and just lay there all 16lbs. of him. After awhile of that he would make himself comfortable in his armpit and he would sleep ther all night right next to Jordan. I think that the thing that I will always find the most amazing about our cat was he was our angel. Romeo would come and plop himself down right in between us when we were fighting and just talk to us in that language that wasn't a meow but it wasn't english. I wll never be able to explain how he communicated with us but he did and it will never be matched. He would just sit there in between us and look from one to the other and purr and talk and rub and nudge. He was always the one that would reconcile us and now we are forever reconciled to the realization that he is gone. I just want to apologize to my husband for my lack of courage and not being able to wrap him up, I know that it must have been terrible for you and I am so sorry for that. I just really want to thankyou for your heart and sensitivity to me. I love you. Jordan wrapped him up and we took him out and buried him. Jordan, Reston, Hannah, Cela, Jessica and myself drove out to the desert last night and buried him next to a beautiful verde tree. I have never in my life missed something more than Romeo beside my family that is gone. I just really hope that in his last breaths he knew that I loved him and how much I am going to miss him. Lord I just thankyou for the blessing that Romoeo was in my life and everyone that had a chance to meet him and see what a wonderful creature he was. I just pray that you would make the transition easy and the grief short. Fill the void that is there with your love and peace. Thankyou Jesus.

Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen

      Youth  I see the light in their eyes.  The light that permeates their smiles. I can feel the life running through their veins. I can hear the pounding of their hearts. I can hear the questions on their lips wanting, yearning, demanding answers. I can see the growth in their bodies and hear it in their voice. I can feel how they don't understand. I know their frustration and aggravation. I relate with wanting to fit in wanting to be more and better than they are. I see where they want to go. I understand that they don't know how to get there. I watch them reaching, reaching for something that they don't quite get. I look at them looking at me like I have all the answers. I watch them listen and absorb and take in everything that is said. I feel the confusion and the obliviousness that is written on their faces. I laugh at their jokes I smile at their naivity and giggle at their silliness. I am perplexed at how they push themselves. I stand in awe of their talents. I am struck by their gifts. I am enlightened by their ideas and thoughts. I cringe to think about the things that they fear. I hate how the enemy holds them so tight. I will fight for them on my knees. I will talk to them. I won't talk when they just need me to listen. I can show them they can trust me. I stand beside them when they hurt. I lift them up when they are down. I jump for joy next to them when it has been a good day, week, month, year. I will watch them become men and women of God. I see them standing on faith and fighting for the truth. I will watch them become whole.  I feel the light in their eyes.

      It's just one of those things. When you know that this weight that you are feeling is from God you just know. It's not a heavy weight nor is it a burdensome weight. It is that type of weight that just lays on you not uncomfortably but slightly and somewhat heavy. It's that tugging thought in the back of your head that tells you that there is something to be done. It is definitely not the thought of that something that you dread doing, it is the one that you know is going to bring you a deep unexplainable joy. What stops us? We stop us. We stop ourselves from pursuing it because of many various reasons. We don't see the means that we need to see as fleshly humans and we don't depend on him to provide it. We convince ourselves that it can't be done because we don't have the materials or resources to do it. The sad fact is we just won't try, we won't push ourselves past that mind set and we get ourselves stuck in a rut. You ever wonder what this world would be like if everyone that ever had a burden from God would have just taken that one step on faith to do it. You ever wonder how many more people would be in his kingdom if we could have just believed that it could be done. This is where I am at in my walk and this vision that I have. I am at the point of hopelessness and telling myself it can't be done. I am to small and it is to big for me to accomplish with success. But that is where I am wrong. If I would just take that first step of faith and seek God in every step it will be successful no if's and's or but's. So here it goes, I am going to put myself out on a limb here and I am going to do it. I am going to seek God and counsel from friends and mentors. I am going to continuously ask for prayer and guidance and advice. I am going to make a difference even if it is rough and painful and hopeless at times. I am going to rise up just as Christ has called me to do and it's not that he even called me to that I am already there I just am so blinded by my own walls and perceptions of what I think my abilities are. I am so much more talented than I think and I know this because I am a child of God. I am a daughter of a king and I am capable of anything because I have the confidence of the creator of the world backing me up. I have the encouragement from the one that never recieved any. And so I will go and I will take that step and if it ends up that I have to take five million steps before anything happens I will do it. I will do it not because I want to impress anyone I just want to be able to carry this burden so easily and relaxed that it is a way for me to show myself that I did it.

      Regal Royal Noble What do those words mean to me? Well they describe me I am a daughter of a king. What do I call him you ask? Abba Yahweh Adonai Messiah Redeemer Jesus Father One word that describes him the best is friend. My King is my best friend. He loves and respects me. He carries me when I can't go on He lifts me up on wings of eagles. He is my rock and fortress. My strong tower in distress. He is the shade from the sun and the sun in the rain. He is the rainbow that gives promise. Fights for me in the pit. Wipes the tears from my eyes. Comforts my sorrows. Applaudes my triumphs. Disciplines my wrongs. Blesses my prayers. He taught them how to reach his kingdom. He is the one that stretched his arms for me. Stretched them to hold me and this world close to him. He took the whipping and beatings for me. He was mocked, questioned,and torn down for me. He came back to tell me. To commission and command me. Go. It's my turn now. To be a best friend. Show love and respect to all. Carry the weak and the broken. Exalt my brother and sister. Be a shelter and safe haven. Make and keep promises. Fight for salvation. Be kind and compassionate outside of my box. Cheer. Chastise and rebuke according to His ways. Pray for blessings. To teach, empower, and equip. Stretch my life. Suffer. To be hated, martyred, and killed with words.  I am royalty and I need to take responsibility. It is my turn to show my position, As daughter of a King.

      So Jordan and I just filled out a loan application to buy a house. I would ask that anyone who reads this would please pray that it would go through smoothly. I have to tell you an amazing story about what happened the day that we went and looked. We drove out to Johnson Ranch which is in Queen Creek and looked at some models and talked to some sales guys and they were really informative. We talked to this guy named Sean at Centex homes and he was so encouraging and come to find out he is a Christian. A living, walking, talking, Christian. He basically told us that he would do whatever it takes to get us into a home of our own. He also told us that if we needed anything not just a house but ANYTHING he is there. This guy barely knows us and he is already willing to lay himself down to serve us. His wife and him do marriage counseling and it is like a 3 year program that they go through. His wife and him go to Word of Grace in Mesa. I was just amazed at how God works in all and every situation once again confirming my commitment to him and calling me to a deeper relationship. I love him so much. Once again though for those of you who read this if you could please pray that this goes through it would be a huge step for us in the right direction. Thanks.

      people really piss me off. i am reading babbleon today and i think that i discovered the reason that i stopped going as often as i was. people are mean and cruel and comprimising. elanna, i don't know who she is but she really gets under my skin because she justifies everything. she has a reason for why she does and says the things she does and says. when are we as a people as god fearing people going to have the fear of the lord? when are we going to start living up to that higher standard that christ calls us to? when are we going to imbed romans 12:2 into our brains and burn it into our flesh? when are we going to stop comforming to this world and being in it but not of it? she uses foul language and she says that she is only human, she tears other people and ministries down with her words and points the finger in all directions. i just want to ask her why she does not take responsibility for what happened to babbleon? why does she not realize that they started to censor it because they had to because it was not showing the fruit of christ. micah said today that "being in the body of christ is all about toes getting stepped on until we all learn how to dance" well when are we all going to learn how to dance with each other and compliment each other's strengths instead of feeding off each other's sadness, human weaknesses, and rage? she calls them lurkers and confronts them with her tongue, why can't she realize that there is a sense of predator in her? she seeks out the argument because she wants her way. i am interested in seeing how she reacts to my reply to the topic. will i be turned on or will she open her heart enough to see she is partly in the world and of the world. please for all who read this i am not perfect to any extent, i never claim to be but i do strive to be full of christ and only christ. i don't want my actions, language and feelings to give anyone that i try to share my savior with a reason to think that the church or i am a hypocrite. i strive to live that higher standard that god put before me. i just ache for those of us who still hold on so tightly and won't let go fully. it's when you let go of everything that you gain everything.

      So I need to talk about something that is really bothering me today. I was reading an article in the newspapar at school about abortion cams. Let me explain. There are people that are standing and waiting outside abortion clinics for anyone to walk by, drve by, or walk in so they can take their picture. Half of the pictures you can not for sure say whether that person is going to walk in or walk right on by. They have pictures of people's license plates posted, like I know who that car belongs to and if that person has ever really been in an abortion clinic. I really believe that no matter what side of the line you stand on in regards to the abortion issue people still have a right to make a choice and a right to their privacy. The thing that irritates me the most about this whole thing is that they are claiming to be a Christian organization and their website has scripture posted all over it. So should I as a Christian serving the Lord wait outside and exploit women who are having abortions? Not at all! These women are not me and because I wouldn't do it obviously does not mean they wouldn't. I will continue to pray for those women and the doctors that they are going to. I will continue to lift those unlived lives up to the Lord and ask that he would take them in his arms. I will stand in my beliefs and hold my ground firmly. I will not support it but I will comfort. I will argue pro-life until the day that I die but I will console. I think that both sides of what is going on is wrong and disgusting, women are going to have abortions we have made it legal and people are going to wait outside and take pictures we have taken away privacy. I just ache inside for them all.

      I am really beginning to understand how compassion and kindness really works. I am being shown that being a hardball does not work most of the time. I am realizing the idea of kill them with kindness in a genuine fashion and it feels good. I am amazed at how my attitude has just been great since my revelation. Thankyou Lord for building and growing this in me, continue to help it grow and flourish in my heart and mind.

      So for those of you that have not heard yet Jordan and I got approved it has actually been while since then but we got approved. We are going to be building our first house. Praise God!!! Something that we own that is ours that we don't have to share with anyone else, just us. Also I got a new job, I am going to be a Distribution Manager for International Marketing. How amazing is that? I have been looking for a job since all the ouse stuff went through and I got one within 3 days and it is a manager position starting at 30,000/year. God is so good and he is always right on time. So things are amazing on this end as far as financially. I just am struggling really bad with something. I have had this feeling that God is trying to separate Jordan and I from the regular group that we normally spend all our time with. I really know that he is trying to tell us that we need more one on one time and we also need a lot more fellowship with other married couples. I also know that he is telling me that my friendship with Hannah is not as healthy for me as I really want it to be because I love her. It hurts because I think she is an incredible person but everytime I have spent time with her in the last 2 weeks it has felt like there has been this dissension. I don't know if it is the enemy because it's not like I am ending our friendship all together I am just having this feeling of sorrow about our relationship. I don't even know how to explain it in a way that makes sense. I just know that I have had a really hard time being around her because we have bickered more, been short and trite with each other, and just are not the way we used to be. It makes sense in my brain but I don't think it is here. If you could just pray for me that God will reveal exactly what it is he wants me to learn from this situation that has risen I would greatly appreciate it.

      it's about forgiveness. it's about apologizing and not expecting an apology back. it's about loving unconditionally even when you want to hate. it's about showing mercy to those that never have and never will show it to you. it's about laying your life down for your friends. it's about sucking up your pride. it's about being strong in the face of adversity. it's about standing for what is right and true because you know it's right and true. it's about being an example because you never know when someone is watching. it's about being submissive to your leaders, spouses, and friends. it's about not needing to be right. it's about loving Christ, following Him, and serving His kingdom.

      I watched this movie last night about Rachel Joy Scott. She was one of the girls whose life was claimed at Columbine High School, April 20th, 1999. First of all I just want to say that I can not believe that it has been almost 4 years since that fateful day. I can't believe what those boys did and I find it kind of humorous that this had such an amazing effect in spreading the word of God that the devil never saw coming. This vidoe however was amazing because it was Rachel's dad talking about how he knew and his daughter knew that she was going to die. She didn't know that she was going to die that day or in that way but she knew that her time was short and that God was going to use her through something a year before the event. She wrote about it in her diary, poems and thoughts and hopes and dreams and the ultimate longing and desire to live in God's presence forever. There were also people that knew what was coming, they had been told by God in dreams. Forgotten, months later the dreams came to pass and were lived out here on earth. She sounded like an amazing person someone that I probably would have been honored to meet and have in my life, however I didn't meet her and she wasn't in my life but her mesage was so much louder. I pray that her message can be my message and I can live my life the way she did so if anything were ever to happen people would stand up and say things about me that they said about her.

      I was really thinking last night after I taught my lesson to the youth. My lesson was on the devil because we are studying Genesis right now and we were on chapter 3 which is about the fall. It really got me thinking last night about what road I walk down a majority of the time. I need Jesus so much and I don't think that I communicate that to Him in my words actions or thoughts. I really want to walk down the road less traveled, I want to be an example more than he will ever know I don't think I really know how. Third Day has a song about Peter's denial of Jesus. Is that me? It is such a beautiful song about Christ's sacrifice and man's lack of commitment to following Him. I love God and I want my life to be a beautiful things in his sight. Lord help me to be beautiful in your sight in all I do, say, and act. Here is that song.  No, I didn't see this one coming It suddenly snuck up on me I can't say you didn't tell me so I can't say you didn't warn me I can't take the pain of knowing that I left You I can't bear the shame of knowing I was wrong But I'll take the blame for everything that I've done I can't take the pain of leaving you alone Of leaving you alone  I was there when they accused you but I guess I was too afraid Not just once and not just twice But three times I denied your name  I never thought I'd get even a second chance But you've given that and so much more And then for every time I ever did deny You ask me if I love you, You know I do, Lord  So I'm off to follow in your steps it won't be easy, it's safe to say There are only two roads I can walk on down The road less traveled is the one you paved  Lord, You took the pain even though I left You And You took the shame and You made it all Your own Why'd you take the blame for everything that I've done? Lord, You took the pain You and You alone, You and You alone

      The first time I heard this song I immediately thought about Jordan.  Never knew I could feel like this Like I've never seen the sky before I want to vanish inside your kiss Every day I'm loving you more and more Listen to my heart, can you hear it sings Telling me to give you everything Seasons may change, winter to spring But I love you until the end of time  Chorus: Come what may Come what may I will love you until my dying day  Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste It all revolves around you And there's no mountain too high No river too wide Sing out this song I'll be there by your side Storm clouds may gather And stars may collide But I love you until the end of time

      I have to say one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen is Moulin Rouge. The theme is just incredible and the music is beautiful. This is one of my favorite songs from the movie. Christian sings it for Satine in the elephant room when she thinks he is the duke.  My gift is my song And this one's for you And you can tell everybody That this is your song It maybe quite simple But now that it's done Hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind That I put down in words How wonderful life is now you're in the world  Sat on the roof And I kicked off the moss Well some of the verses well They got me quite cross But the sun's been kind While I wrote this song It's for people like you that Keep it turned on  So excuse me for forgetting But these things I do You see I've forgotten If they're green or they're blue Anyway the thing is what I really mean Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen    And you can tell everybody This is your song It may be quite simple But now that it's done I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  How wonderful life is now you're in the world I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind that I put down in words How wonderful life is now you're in the world

      If  If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  But make allowance for their doubting too;  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,  Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:  If you can dream -- and not make dreams your master; If you can think -- and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two imposters just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build them up with worn-out tools;  If you can make a heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings -- nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds worth of distance run -- Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And -- which is more -- you'll be a Man, my son!

      OK so this thing that I have been struggling with this last week has been a pain but it was all fixed on Wednesday night. I just need to write this down somewhere so I have it and remember how faithful God has been to me in this. I had totally forgot that we were having that concert and I went there expecting another youth night. When I got there and realized what was going on I went outside and I prayed that God would speak to me in whatever way He needed to. I went back in truly expecting to hear HIs voice. So the concert started and things were awesome the band was really really good and the lead singer was very surrendered to God's leading. After standing and worshiping for awhile I sat down to take a break, I looked across the crowd and really felt the spirit moving. I saw Mia and really felt the Lord was doing something and moving on her heart. God kept pushing me and telling me to go and lay hands and pray for her but I was being completely stubborn. So I sat there in my unfauthfulness as usual and did nothing. I was sitting right in front of Robert and Angela and about 10 seconds after I sat down Robert leaned over my shoulder and said "God is telling me to tell you that if you go pray for Mia she will go over the edge." I thought OK that is definitely my cue. I got up and walked over and laid my hands on her and I could feel the presence of the Spirit there. Wouldn't know it right at that moment the lead singer (Richie) stopped and said that he wants only the "red head" to pray for that girl, obviously not knowing our names. He said that the "red head" has the anointing right now and she needs to pray over her. I sobbed right there, I knew that this was how God was talking to me. I continued to pray and finally Mia gave in, she had been fighting it a little, and the spirit just clobbered her. She went down and I prostrated myself and cried and prayed and thanked God for once again being more faithful than anything and anyone. The concert continued on and after the band played the last song they were going to pray over all of us. I hope this doesn't sound like pride but no one else was given a word that night except me. Richie looked at me and told me "You have an incredible anointing and God wants you to stop building walls out of fear and come into Him, He wants to capture you and give you the peace and joy that you long for." I was blown away, that was the first time in a long time I had really let myself be open and sure enough God spoke and I listened.

      So I really need some prayer. I have really been struggling lately about something that is very important to me. Ever since I was 19 all I wanted was to be a mother, to have life growing inside of me and bear my own child with my husband whoever he was going to be. Well now I am married and most of my friends have children and all I do is live vicariously through them. I want a baby of my own, I want a tiny version of me or Jordan that I can nurture and call my own. My fear is I can't for whatever reason have kids. I fear that somewhere in all of my mess of my past I have screwed up my body so bad that I can't get pregnant. I fear that my mother being completely oblivious to the fact that she was pregnant continued to take birth control which my doctor has already told me has affected my uterus development. I am afraid that the STD I contracted while I was in the world that can not be healed by means of any type of medication is going to give me cervical cancer and strip any last chance that I have. I know that God is in control of all of this and He is more sovereign than anything I can imagine and if He wants me to have a child of my own He will let Jordan and I get pregnant. I am just letting my fears take over and I need some help. I had gone through this whole episode about a year ago and I thought I had come to a point of surrendering it to the Lord and whatever is going to happen happens for a reason. But lately, as I have spent more time with Ben and Mandy (not saying that in any way this is their fault or I blame them) and loved on Annah and Jennah I have begun to dwell on it again. I really need to be lifted up, I really need prayer that God will take this from me again and I will let Him have it and not take it back. I also need God to break this stubborness that is inside of me, I really hurt Jordan last night because in my private anguish I would not turn to him, I would not let him hold me and that is all he longs to do. There is this undying ability to do things on my own without the help of anyone. I need God to break that ability in me, I need Him to show me just how weak I really am. I really just need to be broken before Him, I need to bow at His throne and ask for patience and hope in this area that I have lost it. I need to let my husband into the places that I sometimes don't even want to go. I need to be vulnerable with my friends and my leaders that love and care for me. I just to need to give in to the Almighty Creator that knew me before the universe existed. I just need some faith right now that everything is going to work out for the good because I love Him who has called me according to His purpose. I need to stand on the promise that He gave me that He does have plans for me and they are to prosper me and not to hurt me to give me a hope and a future even if it is not the future that I envision for myself.

      Thank you Ben with everything that is inside of me. You not only have been a friend but a mentor. You have shown me what true service and sacrifice is all about. You have shown me graciousness and compassion in a way that no other human being has shown me. You know just what to say and when to say it whether it be a rebuke or word of affirmation. You see potential where sometimes I see none not only in myself but in others. You see the good when I want to see the bad, your cup is more often than not half full. I love you for the person you are and the person that you push me to be. I find it amusing at times that you see ability in me that I don't really think is there. I really don't have the words for everything that you mean to me and and how you make me feel as a woman striving to serve her God. I have so much appreciation for you and if I never find the words to express just how I feel about you I hope that in your heart and soul you know. Thank you once again for the opportunity that you have given me working with the youth, thank you for having the faith in me that I don't have, thank you for showing me just how awesome our God is, thank you for affirming to me that I am wonderfully and fearfully made, thank you for telling me that my will is not unattractive, thank you for calling me beautiful, thank you for viewing me as that dimaond in the rough as the geode I don't often feel like. Thank you from the deepest parts within me. Thank you.

      I want to share this with everyone, Ben wrote this as a thank you to all of his youth group leaders. I want to share it because it is beautiful and once again Ben has succeeded in making me cry not only because of his words about me but his words about all of us. I just want Ben to know that he is an awesome and incredible person and I just pray that I can learn the kind of sacrifice that Ben is.    Dear Youth Group in Gilbert   Receive with gladnes my servant Sara.  She is young in the faith, but in her is found strength and a desire to do the Lord's work that is found in very few people.  Although she is young in the faith, already she is running the race with passion and zeal.  You should model that yourselves, for many of you who are old in the faith, even though you are young, have not caught the seriousness of this journey that we are on.  Wear the beauty of Christ as this sister does and so make the father in heaven pleased with your willing and open heart.   Welcome your brother Britt as a dear family member.  He has faithfully served me and so many young adults with his music and song.  In Britt you have a disciplined leader who in concerned about an attention to detail that is necessary for the church to run smoothly.  Your brother Britt is humble and meek, yet smart and able to lead others in both the workplace and in the church.   You all should aspire to have a spirit of service such as Britt has.  Bless him for the many ways he has blessed the church.   Also, welcome your sister Kristi - who has endured much persecution at work for her faithfulness in serving the young in Jesus name.  This sister has sacrificed even time with her family to bring you the good news of Jesus Christ.  She has dedicated herself to building the community and receving the tithes and offerings for the work of Jesus Christ.  We all should be looking at such needs and seeking to fill them as she has done.  Let her model of faith and love for the brothers and sisters be immitated by all who read this letter.   Receive with love your new sisters and brothers from the East Valley church.  They bring great spiritual giftings and a genuine concern and love for all the saints.   Greet Obadiah with blessings and a holy kiss.  I have known him and worked by his side for over three years now and know his commitment to the cause of Christ.  He has been tired and worked faithfully and a season of rest is due him.  I know the time is coming, and we look forward to his rest so that he might come back to us energized with a new passion and purpose.  He has read the word of God deeply and has much spiritual insight to give to you so that you might find yourself approved on the day of the judgement of the Lord.  Young men, you too should model his steadfastness in following the Lord - even to the point of exhaustion.  There is time for rest, as Obadiah will be getting soon, but there is also a time for going to war - and he has been in just such a war for the last few years.   I want you to pay special attention to my sister in the Lord named Jen.  She is faithful and true - a model of youth serving God faithfully.  You too should try to model a beauty that comes from the inside like this sister.  She is completely capable but she is not proud.  She has a swift mind, but she does not use it to tear down like some mongrels of the word - who seek to use the word to bring down other brothers and sister.  She comes from a church that teaches the word and is dedicated to community and family - see that you too imitate her and what she has learned as you become dedicated to learning the scriptures and loving one another.  You, the youth group, are young like her and may rise up to be women of the Lord.   Another special sister in the Lord is Cela.  Do you want to learn how to act with grace amidst trials.  Look at her life and gain courage.  Do you want to see where true strength comes from?  If so, watch this sister who serves the Lord and his people without grumbling or complaining.  She does not compromise in her morals and she is a champion of the down trodden and lost.  She faithfully calls students and new guests and is genuinely concerned about the welfare of all of us.  She clothes herself with humility and grace.  Young women, hear me clearly, watch her amd model yourself after her and you will live long in the land the Lord your God has given you.   Very few men have had the privelege to work with such mighty women in the ministry of Christ as I have.  And yet, in my list I am still not done.  Greet with love and compassion your sister in the Lord Susie.  On the outside she appears to be rough like a geode - but clearly understand this - inside of her are treasures of the Kingdom.  Brilliant Crystals of light that find their source in the One and Only son Jesus Christ.  If all men would stand up and serve the Christ like she does, there would be no need for women such as her to lead; however, there is much need in the Kingdom and many men have not stood up to take hold of the mantle to which they have been called - and in Susie you will find a Joan of Arc - who like David - found the courage to charge into battle while the "supposed" men cowered in the backstage.  This lady loves the word, loves and seeks after righteousness, and has much to offer you, since she has been gifted by the master to teach the word. Listen closely to her and withold judgements about her dress, piercings, tatoos, or hair color - for beauty comes from within - and in her is great beauty and truth.  I would not trade this warrior in battle for any number of weak and lazy men who have no passion for the service of the King.   Pay special attention to the words of your brother in the Lord, Andre.  Day by day he is being transformed into the image of Christ.  In this man is a special zeal to speak and do the words of Christ Jesus.  I have seen perhaps the greatest growth in this brother as I have seen in any brother.  He is serious about seeking after the will of the father, and he will challenge us all in our call as he listens to the words of the Lord.  Young men, think about the traits of a real man and I am sure you will see that in Andre.  He loves the word, he loves to pray, and he loves to worship.  He is dedicated to the fellowship of the believers and dedicated to the cause of Christ. See to it that you are doing the same.   Greet my brother Robert in the name of the Lord.  Here is a young man with a special calling to the youth.  He is self-sacrificing, crazy, responsible, a good teacher, a gentle spirit, a man of confession - as the word calls you to be, a man dedicated to making things happen.  Many people will sometimes talk about serving - this brother actually serves with all his heart and soul and mind.  In him, is a king-in-waiting. A humble king and a servant king. Do you want to know how to be trusted with much? - then observe how he has been faithful with a little.  Do you want to know what it means to be a servant - then serve somebody as he has served me.  Listen to this man carefully.  Do what he does as he follows the Christ and all will go well for you.   Greet my brother Derek.  He is a faithful friend to the young believers in the community.  He has served at the Portal for the longest time and now is enjoying a much needed rest from his labors.  He has served Jesus in the ministry of friendship - and it is a noble and worthy cause.  Will you continue to befriend those who are the friendless as he has done?  It is my hope for you and the family of God.   Greet Mike Margoliese (Spelling?) - whom we just met in our last battle in Pinetop, Arizona.  Here is an aged veteran (like myself) of the fight, who came to offer his spirit of wisdom to the rest of us who have been fighting in our youth and naivety.  Notice how he has dealt both gracefully and with strength when the battle has called for it.  Also, note how he served the rest of us, humbling himself by sacrificing time, money and energy.  He is even tempored yet has a sense of humor.  He is contiunally filled with the energy and life that comes from Jesus Christ.  Let us all begin working on such a spirit that brings honor and pride to our father God who is in heaven.   Now, there are also some among the youth deserving of special praise.   Youth, observe your sister Kara.  Weekly she brings be courage and encouragement.  She is not only concerned about her own needs, but my own.  I have been weak and she has spoken words of healing.  Without young women and men like her I would be easily discouraged.  Do you all see how a humble servant such as her, makes those in leadership strong and courageous.  Observe how she invites the new people in, showing her gift of hospitality.  Why is it that my initial leaders are always women...there is bravery in women that runs deep and true.  A woman is a gift like none other, therefore brothers in Christ, give them the greatest respect and treat them as nobility in the youth group.   Also, observe the men who know how to worship the Lord.  Observe James and Adam, who not only worship with their instruments but also with their hands as they attend to the needs of your fellowship group.  They are young, yet they are standing up and leading the group in prayers and service to me and all of you.  Observe, Darian who is unafraid to lift his hands in worship to God during the winter retreat.  God is more important to him than man.  Is he more important to you.   Observe the young ladies who dance before the Lord during worship.   Observe Michelle's tenacity to love the new people in the group.   Observe Courtney and Kara's bravery to go where no other person has gone before as they commit to gathering for the sole purpose of reading the word at their student lead Bible Study.   Observe Allison's gentle spirit.  Observe her grace, artistry, discipline, leadership, and voice - all gifts from the God who will also give to you if you would only ask.   I don't think many of you have seen the leadership of some mighty warriors of the King.  Behold Emily, who every week is willing to serve by setting up the room, stapling copies, putting announcements on the board.  Behold Lindsey who has done the same.  Behold Johanna who fights for the sick and poor all over the world by leading us in the 30 hour famine.   I could go on and on speaking of all of those who have been a blessing to the body of Christ.  But there are also those of you who need to step up and take hold of that which Christ has called you to.  The harvest is ripe, the workers are few.  Let's Roll.

      I hate that feeling I get when I doubt. The questioning that this might all be one big setup and we are the biggest fools in the universe. Then I know, I know that it is not true and I know that there is a God and I know that he has done amazing things for me. I want nothing more than to serve him with all of my heart but there is something holding me back at times and I want it to just go away. Maybe it's fear that holds me because I am afraid of what God wants to do or what God wants me to do. Maybe it's just me holding myself back. I want to be so much more than I am and I want to be an example and I wonder sometimes if I am. Am I a leader? Do I have leadership qualities or is it just pride that I think I do? I just don't know. I have prayed more about this than anything before and it feels good to talk to God about it but I am not hearing his voice, or maybe I am just not listening. I have a bad habit of doing that, talking and not stopping to listen. I just want to hear His voice and not my own I want to make his decisions and not my own, how do I do that? I want to be still and know, I want him to let me know to be still. All of these things I want and maybe I need to not focus on what I want but what God wants. If God wants me to touch my husband more than I need to. If God wants me to just spend time with Jordan thatn maybe I need to. If God wants me to just have faith that everything is going to workout than maybe I just need to have faith. If God wants me to workout everyday than maybe I need to. If God wants me to put more time and energy into my marriage than anything else first than maybe I need to. But what happens when I know that God has called me to work with the youth?  What do I do with that? AHHH!!! I just don't know Lord I need some clarity, when ever you are ready to enlighten me I am ready to recieve it.

      so I think that God has given me something amazing to remember that whether we were in His will at the time or not that He is going to bless my marriage with Jordan no matter how tough it get's. Hanah and I went to the Bebo Norman concert a week ago and it was incredible. I never really knew how amazing he was until that night. To make a long story short he told the audience about this song that he had written for a married couple that were very close friends to him. He explained that he wrote this song for them because these 2 people had every reason to want to give up but both of them took convenant very seriously and knew that God would get them through it as long as they leaned on him. Bebo played the song and there were tears streaming down my face and I went and got the cd and listened to it and once again was sobbing I just want to give you the chorus right now and give you the rest later.  I will not give up this fight  I will not lay down and die I will not carry this heart of stone I may not be your place to run I may not be your kingdom come  I may stumble through this great unknown But I will be all that is true I will not give up on you I was made to be with you alone Cause you and me we're gonna see the long way home.

      So I need to mention two people that in this last week have totally blown me away and shattered any perceptions and assumptions that I had made about them. First I need to recognize Jake Ressler(sp.) this young man has absolutely shown me a side of himself that I completely respect. He spent close to 8 hours digging holes in Mexico to lay fence post and directly after that came into the kitchen and helpes make close to 130 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The kid is amazing! Also Missy constantly was playing with the kids and then when it was time to paint she stayed in that room until it was complete. Those two made a huge impact on me last week in Mexico during Spring Break. I do also have to say that instead of staying at home and hanging out at the mall and in their nice comfortable warm beds they sacrificed that to go to Mexico to give their time and energy and hearts in service. It was cold and rainy and cold and cold and they slept on boards literally and did not complain or groan about it. I have to admit that the more and more time that I have spent with these kids the more and more I am learning that God uses everyone in amazing ways to touch people and these kids have touched my heart in a way that they may never know but God continue to bless them and all they do.

      I want to create art that is loud and raw and real.  I want to create art that will kick you in the teeth but also be subtle like fingertips on your back.  I want God to speak to your heart through my expression and move you in a way that you may never thought possible. I want to create art that may change the way you think, that may shift your paradigm in a direction that you never thought you would go.  I want to create art that glorifies all that is true and beautiful and free.  I want to create art that grabs you by your shirt collar and screams at you and forces you to look, look at what you don't want to look at, look at what you are trying to turn our face from, look at yourself. I want to create art that can bring you to tears by the mere thought of what it is trying to represent, even if that may be different for you than it is for the next. I want to create art that expresses the heart of Christ. I want to create art that shows you just how crappy and sucky things can be and forces you to a new place of gratitude. I want to create are that brings you to your knees in reverence for what God does for you daily. I want to create art that does not make me exempt from all of these things happening in my life too.

      Why is it that when you are in a place where you want to have some amazing inspiration and you want to put it on paper nothing is coming. The only thing that is constantly running through your head is no creativity, no imagination, no inspiration, no talent. In the other part of your head is the voices of all the people that love you that are saying your art is beautiful, you are amazing, and yet all you can seem to think is how what they have seen is all you have. Is there more? Will I ever create another piece of work as amazing and beautiful as the first? I just don't know. So I bought paint and come canvas and I am deathly afraid to try and use it. I am afraid that I am going to sit down and nothing is going to come. Ian has been talking to me about how I integrate my art with my faith. I can see in my head all these beautiful pictures that I want to put down but then I go to create them and it just doesn't flow right off of my hand. Also where do I draw the line in my art where it is not tactful or proper as a "Christian" to expose that part of my thinking and my expression to the world. There are times where I am sitting and I get this picture of this incredible image but to some it may be inappropriate and crude as a woman of God to see things that way. For example I see a woman, standing with her arms behind her back smiling, looking as if she is happy to be in the position that she is, she is however nude, the next image I get is from behind her and you get to see what is really going on. She has her arms behind her back and she is bound. Now I think that it could be a loud image of what we as christians do. We are happy and free hence the smile and the nakedness but when we really look and let God in it's fake because we are bound by things that we don't want to give up. Now how do I integrate that with my faith. Is it wrong for a woman or child of God to see those things and want to express them in there rawness? I don't know and maybe I never will, I do however believe that God can be glorified in that if people including myself could see past the nudity and really look into what I am saying and maybe even let it speak to them in thoses hidden areas of their lives possibly touch God's heart.

      After Awhile  After awhile, you learn the subtle difference between holding a hand and chaining a soul, and you learn that love doesn't mean leaning, and company doesn't mean security, and you begin to learn that kisses aren't contracts, and presents aren't promises, and you begin to accept your defeats with your head up and your eyes open with the grace of a woman, not the grief of a child, and you learn to build all your roads on today, because tomorrow's ground is to uncertain for plans, and futures have a way of falling down in midflight.    After awhile, you learn, that even sunshine burns if you get too much.  So you plant your own garden and decorate your own soul instead of waiting for someone to bring you  flowers.  And you learn that you really can endure, that you really are strong, and you really do have worth.  And you learn and you learn and you learn.

      Why is it there is a person out there who is pregnant? Why is it she is not married and not in the will of the Father? Why is it that she is not taking care of her body knowing there is a life growing inside of her, a life that is not her own? Why is it that she clings so tightly to her sin? Why is it she does not realize that the sins of the father affect? Why is it I hold so much bitterness towrds this person when I shoule be loving her? Why is it not me?

      How do you win back the trust of someone you hurt? Someone who's business is none of yours? How do you show her that you aren't just out to be right but instead that you love her unconditionally even when she may not say the right things or make the right decisions. When is the age that we start respecting her as a person and not a child that needs to be under a thumb. When do we realize that she has feelings too and no matter how right you thought you were you were wrong.  How do you make her realize that just because you are a leader does not mean you are her parent. I think that there is a fine line that we have to walk. I understand that there are certain things that we HAVE to do and say. However there are things that are not our place. We have to be above reproach and blameless but to try and make her feel that we are above her is absolutely the wrong thing to do. She doesn't want an authority in you even though sometimes you need to be that she was looking for a  friend. When you can get to a place with her that you are her friend you find richness in her that can not be found anywhere else. We realize that we underestimate the deepness in her eyes and her soul. We understand that the questions that she has are deep if not more deep than the crap we contemplate. You don't get to experience that deepness if you wound her. When you are young and struggling to begin with wounds take even longer to heal and bitterness tends to fester, and, without notice you find out that all of that is directed at you and what you didn't do for her when she needed it the most. The reason she needs it is because at this time in her life she feels like a lot of people that tell her they love her are turning on her. Then to top it all off she goes to someone else and tells them what you did to her and how she has lost respect for you because what you thought was the best for her was really the best that you selfishly wanted. She tells you she thinks that you try to hard and it's pathetic. You cringe but you listen because that is what they need at that exact moment in time. She doesn't need someone to tell her their opinion or share what they think and are feeling she doesn't want to hear it. The hardest thing on top of all of this is that you agree, you have this feeling of disgust because you can relate to being hurt the same way by that same person. The attitude of being better than everyone has been shown to you too by that person and you swallow the lump in your throat. You really don't know what to say because how do you tell her you feel the same way. How do you tell her that the person is nosy in your life too, that they don't know how to just stop, that they are always trying to prove you wrong and in a sense make you feel dumb. How do you tell her that? You don't because that would be even more wrong than what they did to her. Then you really think about it and you realize that you really don't care. You don't care that that person is the way that they are because you have your own issues that you need to deal with before you can point out anyone else's faults. So instead you look at her and tell her you love her and that if she needs someone to talk to you are there and you leave it at that. Then you go inside grieved that this person is causing people to be discouraged and hurt and you try and figure out what needs to happen. You can't though because just as much as it wasn't that person's place to do what they did to her it's not your responsibility to "fix" that person, God will do that on His own without your help. So you trust and hope that it will be soon because they are and have hurt a lot of people and all it does is continue.

      How do you explain the feelings that flood your mind and soul when you know at that moment in time you are in the presence of the Lord. We ask them to stand for worship and we try to get them involved and sometimes it's not easy and sometimes they don't want to. On a night, on an amazing night in Gilbert, AZ in a little room without having to say a word they entered in with unabandoned ferver and praised like I have never seen them praise before. He was there arms wrapped around each one of us, holding our hands as we lifted them to Him. He smiled at us as we smiled at the words that were written for and to Him. He cried with me when my eyes filled with tears and my heart filled with joy that they brought me. He told me He loved me and it was ok when I realized that I fall short with them all the time. He showed me that night that His mercies are new everyday and His joy is my strength and I stood and watched and listened. Our voices raised in unison in one song to Him and my heart lept and the tingles went down my back. That's heaven right there, standing before his throne praising the one who brought me and taught me and is continuing to bring me and teach me. I wasn't there the day the temple curtain tore in two but praise God that we can enter into the holy of holies without shame and recieve mercy and grace. He danced when they danced to the song and applauded like a proud father would for his child at the end. Then he sat with us as we watched his story and he remembered that it wasn't all in vain because we were there and He was amongst us. He grieved for Judas from the bottom of his soul and longed that we would not become that or choose that. When we talked about Heaven he was and is anxious to spend eternity with us and He wants us to keep pushing and striving towards that prize. The he listened to Ben pray for them and thanked his Father for him and the work and time he puts into them. As we all walked out He granted us peace on the way. It was a good night September 17th, 2003 at the Vineyard in Gilbert. It was a very good night one that we have needed and prayed for and longed for. Thank you God.

      I am so frustrated. I have been praying that my supoort would come in for Ireland and it is in it's own good time. So now I am praying about what I need to do in order to contribute to this mission. Ben has suggested putting $50-$100 every paycheck in just so there is some kind of contribution and that is a great idea. I just wonder why some have ahd it easier than others. Maybe God is trying to test and push my faithfulness. I need to step uo to the plate and get way more involved with this process than I have been. God give me the patience and the knowing that you are going to provide.

      So last night @ girls group was awesome. We were planning on having a birthday thing for Liz and she was really sick and ended up not coming. Lindsey was also really sick and so she did not come either. Kristen had talked to Hannah earlier that day to tell her that Lindsey was sick and Liz was sick so she was trying to find out if we were still going to have it. Kristen was basically asking since everyone else that comes is sick are we just going to cancel it. Obviously not because she was planning on coming so we had girls group last night just for Kristen. It was awesome, Kristen's spirit is amazing and the boldness that she has for the Lord blows me away. She tells us stories about how she talks to kids at her school about Jesus and I feel a little shame that with all the excuses that I come up with I don't talk that much about God to my co-workers. In a perfect world I would work for an organization like ATF or Compassion Ministries or a church where I am surrounded by people who believe the same thing that I do, then it wouldn't be so hard to talk about it and share it with each other. It's not that I ashamed of how people will react I am scared that I won't do a good enough job. However, this is not a perfect world and I work at Ikon  Matthew 9:35-37  35Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. 36When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 37Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. 38Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."   Matthew 13:36-43  36Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."  37He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. 38The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, 39and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.  40"As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. 41The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. 42They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 43Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.    The harvest is plenty but the workers are few. I am a worker and I need to step up and take that job seriously. If the weeds are going to be pulled and thrown in the fire am I not responsible for those weeds? I want as many people as possible to shine like the sun in the kingdom of the Father. Do I have those ears?

      I was in my car last night thinking about "holiday" stuff and this interesting thought came to mind as I was listening to a Relient K song on Air1.  The first time you opened your eyes, did you realize that you were going to be my savior? And the first breath that left your lips did you really know it would change this world forever?

      I wonder sometimes when I will get to a place where I can accept and recieve that there is no condemnation. When am I going to be convinced that as long as I am in God's will and doing what he calls me to then nothing else matters. I read all the blogs of my friends and feel inadequate at times because I am not original enough, or philisophical enough, or maybe even intelligent enough. I commit myself in ministry and constantly feel like I am falling short which I know I do but are there at least a few things I do successfully? I guess it has just been a hard day and this is where the enemy get's me.

      I have been reading C.S.Lewis' "The Great Divorce" and it has been very interesting . The imagery and approach that he takes on and towards certain things. He explains things through his character's in a way that you might not usually look at something. His approaches tend to very random and off the wall but when you really analyze it and try and think about it practically it makes complete sense. Some of the scenes in the book are cut short due to narrator moving on in his own journey but your imagination takes off and you begin to, in you own mind, complete what would have happened. Obviously just like any other piece of literature that I have read quotes, thoughts, and issues stand out.  In one of the scenes the ghost(the people who are in hell given a second chance at heaven) is talking to a spirit(a person who realized the err of their ways before death and made it to heaven the first time) are talking. This particular ghost was in his mortal life a scholar/writer of amazing pieces of work on earth. The spirit is trying to convince the ghost that the land that he will enter if he chooses is one of eternal answers and the ghost is arguing that there is no one definitive answer to anything including who or what God is. The ghost is basically stuck on the idea of status because of who he once was and after a long drawn out conversation the spirit sums it up in one response.  "No," said the spirit. "I can promise you none of those things. No sphere of usefulness: you are not  needed  at all. No scope for your talents: only the forgiveness for having perverted them. No atmosphere of inquiry, for I will bring you to the land not of questions but of answers, and you shall see the face of God." To think that God gives us life on earth and fills our life with grace and gifts that we can use to spread them to other's. Once we leave this place however we are of no need. I will not be useful in heaven. I will not be needed in heaven. I will though be wanted and desired by a loving God. The talents that I have been given by only Him alone are His to give and take. Since I have them though, how have I used them? Have I become prideful because I have a voice that can sing? Have I become prideful because I have fingers to play? Have I become prideful because I have legs and arms to use for physical activities? The answer to all of them is most likely whether I admit or accept it, yes. That is an example of the perversion that was spoken of. To think though that in the end when it all comes down to it God forgives me for not using those talents, those gifts for His glory all of the time. When I have fallen into that pridefulness God looks at me and says, "Don't forget where those came from." When it comes to questions and answers I think of all the conversations that I have had with people and the discussions that most often have ended in frustration. The hours that have been wasted on discussions about what everyone  thinks  scripture is saying is incredible. I have come to a place, I think, where scripture tends to be extremely black and white in more areas than this world and the church have determined. There is not a whole lot of gray area. I know that the only way to the Father is through the Son. I know that I have been redeemed from death because of the cross. I know that the righteousness that the Son possesses dwells in me. I know that I am cleansed by the blood of the lamb. And I know that I am forgiven of my sins. As far as predestination and pre-trib/post-trib those might very well be gray areas however, what does it matter? There is not atmosphere of inquiry because there will not be a need or persistence for answers because you will know beyond a shadow of doubt what the answers were all along. At that moment you might actually smack yourself in the head, duh. You might even realized that it had been in front of you the entire time but the complexity of man confused and distorted it, and you might just realize how simple it really was. However, none of these things may occur because you will be before the throne of the Almighty and that is really all that will matter.  more to come.............................................

      "It is the chiefest point of happiness that a man is willing to be what he is."    You are Desiderius Erasmus! You have great love for others and will do just about anything to show it to them. You are tolerant and avoid confrontations, so people generally are drawn to you. You are more quiet and reserved in front of strangers, but around some people you open up. When things get tough, you like to meditate alone. Unfortunately you often get things like "what a pansy," or "you're such a liberal."    Ineresting how this is competely not me. But maybe just maybe God mightbe trying to speak even through a corny internet quiz. Hmmmmm something to think about.

      So I was listening to KLove on the way to work this morning and the news was on. It was the State of the Union Address and  President Bush was talking about a bill that he is proposing to Congress. President Bush wants to double the funding from last year in order to make abstinence programs better and hopefully more effective in the United States in 2004. How awesome is that?????

      Lord get me to a place where all I do is focus on you and your will for mine and Jordan's life. Let me noy spend one minute pondering whether or not something someone is doing is prideful or boastful. Let me find contentment with what you would have for me and the blessings that you have filled my life with. Let me spend time seeking your healing in all areas of my life. Give me the desire to pursue your gentleness and quietness as a wife and  woman of you. Give me the boldness to continue to stand up for you in my workplace. Fill me with your spirit so that I can be an example of you to everyone. Let me not worry about anyone but me.

      By and by and through the years things you've taught me through the years my whole life was designed by you I'll never know anyone half as true. God knows the beginning from the end, He knew the beginning before it was the beginning. Just like us I think that God remembers the times that He has had with us. We take pictures and hang them on the walls of our houses and rooms, we put them in frames and sit them on our desks at work and in book cases in the hallway. I find myself looking at the pictures that I have pasted all over my cube at work and remember the day the hour the minute of that moment that will never be repeated. I think about the beauty in Stephen as he stood on the chair and listened to Seventh Day Slumber with the sun setting in front of him. I look at Adoniah with the drool running down her chin and the smile of innocence as she stares at a wildflower. I am again caught in the moment of the day that I married Jordan, the joy and happiness is indescribable. The walls of heaven are no different every moment of our lives are hanging on those walls from beginning to end. My mother the day that she found out that she was carrying me, the excitement and fear in her eyes. My first breath as I entered the world, my first word, my first step all of those are in a frame on those walls. I know it is common practice to take pictures of the moments that are happy and joyful and  momentous. We take pictures when we want to think back on the fun of that day, like the picture that I have of all the youth group leaders piled in a Walmart shopping cart. What about those times though that you want to forget but need to look back on sometimes to realize how blessed you are. Do those pictures hang on the walls of heaven too??? The day that Mandy passed out in the car and Ben thought that he was losing her? The days and weeks that Joey withered away from kidney failure with his family grieving the inevitable? The days that Melissa cried for the 2 miscarried babies that she desired with everything in her? The day that my stomach was pumped because whether I knew it at the time or not I was trying to leave this world because I couldn't handle it? Are there pictures of those? I would like to think not because why would you want to have pictures to remind you of those times? Deep down though I think there are, I think those pictures hang on the walls of triumph. God revels in those pictures because he looks and sees promise, He sees deliverance, He sees redemption, He sees His child overcoming. I think that those pictures might be treasured just as much if not more than the ones of constant happiness and jubilee. He treasures them because He knows that the reason for His son was that exactly. It makes the pain and misery that His son endured completely and absolutely worth it all. His countenance shines on us now because we can look back on that and give Him all the glory for those moments because in the end there is triumph, happiness, joy, fun, love, and grace beyond compare. Mandy is still here, Joey has gone home and knows pain no more, Melissa will have her baby, and I am still here with a purpose. He knows the beginning from the end and in the end of it all we will all serve the Lord with the fervor that we had when we grieved and cried and wanted to give up. We have been given a hope that we need to explain to people and that is why we will go on through the fire and the storms that this world brings against us. We will continue to fight this fight because we have an awesome cheering section and an even more awesome coach who not only stands on the sidelines but gets right in there with us with mud up to His elbows because He knows and is not afraid. He knows the beginning from the end.

      OK  since I don't believe in New Year's "resolutions" here is a list of goals that I have and God has told me for 2004.  1. write a letter of encouragement and edification for Jordan everyday no matter how long or short.  2. ask Jordan daily what he needs prayer for and pray for him in those areas.  3. spend at least an hour in the word everyday.  4. pray with Jordan once a day for areas in our life and areas of those we love.  5. not cut my hair until after I return from Ireland (this may seem weird but there is reason behind it)  6. be more committed in the area of the youth and the responsibility that I have to my kids.  That's it.

      Tonight is "The Passion of the Christ". I know the story up, down, back, and forth and I am kind of anxious about seeing it. I have heard the reviews and all of the controversy behind this film and I am glad that Gibson pushed on and is releasing it. However, even with all that said seeing the story again in this light and in this way might blow me away again like it did the first time. That is what I am hoping for. I have been praying for a renewed spirit and relationship with the God that redeemed me from the pit and I haven't felt it. Granted I probably am not doing as much as I can to help the process but maybe just maybe this is what I am going to need. To see this and soak it in again but like it is the first time. To fully realize again the magnitude of what it is exactly that Christ did for me. Let it be Lord that you reach in and start a fire that is fresh and new and doesn't compare with the ones that you have blazed before.

      you are deeppink #FF1493   Your dominant hues are red and magenta. You love doing your own thing and going on your own adventures, but there are close friends you know you just can't leave behind. You can influence others on days when you're patient, but most times you just want to go out, have fun, and do your own thing.  Your saturation level is high - you get into life and have a strong personality. Everyone you meet will either love you or hate you - either way, your goal is to get them to change the world with you. You are very hard working and don't have much patience for people without your initiative.  Your outlook on life is very bright. You are sunny and optimistic about life and others find it very encouraging, but remember to tone it down if you sense irritation.    find out what color you are http://www.spacefem.com/colorquiz/

      Lord, give me the focus to be faithful in the things that You are calling me to right now. Let me find a place of solitude where I can be still, listen, and know that You are God and that everything You do is perfect. Give me an even deeper focus in the areas of the ministry that I have committed myself to in order to show Your glory through them. Give me the patience to wait on You for the desires of my heart knowing that Your plan and timing is always exactly when I am ready. Let me find contentment in the now and not constantly be searching for the what ifs.

      Patience is a virtue that I don't possess in this area. I think that I want it more than anything else that I have ever wanted. However God is building patience in me and it hurts because in the process of building I can't hear His voice as to why He is telling me "Be patient my child". But as a good friend once said the moment for this rarity might not be this second. I need to believe that otherwise I will dwell in this place of longing and miss something else that He is trying to do in me or Jordan. That is what I do not want to happen. I don't want to miss these moments because years down the road after four children those are the moments that will be vague. Let me live in this moment and all the beauty that it holds and the majesty it is trying to create in me and my marriage. Give me that strength and focus Lord.

      Jordan,      Though I suck at being a wife a lot I want and need you to know that I love you with everything inside of me. The love that has grown within my being is that of an unquenchable fire that can't and won't be put out by the things or people of this world. I am sorry for the stupid things that I say in anger or in hurt. I apologize for the stupid things that I do in pain or defeat. Regardless of all the things that come against us daily I will never stop loving you and who you are in my life. My life indefinitely would not be the same without you in it. I love you for who you are and who you are becoming. I love the way that we have our devotional in the car on the way to work and school. I love how we can talk for hours about everything and still have hours of conversation left about everything. I love how we share what we want out of our marriage, what we want as far as a family, and what we want to do for the kingdom. I love how I get an e-mail from you everyday telling me how beautiful I am and that you hope that I have an awesome day. I love how you are supportive of my work with the youth even though at times I feel like I am falling short. I love that I can look back on where we were in the beginning and see just how far we have come, and I can thank God for the strength, endurance, and courage to push on. I love your smile and the way that I feel when it is directed at me. I am honored that you want me to be the mother of your children. I love how you enter fellowship with our friends and the relationships that have been built through that. I love that when I am having a really bad day you give me a reason to get up and try again even though I really don't want to sometimes. I love your blue eyes and how much the fire in them reminds me of me. I love how the reason that we fight most of the time is because we are exactly alike, we are without a doubt kindred spirits. I love your dark hair and how when I imagine my sons they look just like you. I love your determination in everything that you do and how you refuse to fail. I love that at 22 you are more grounded than anyone I know. I love how you are stubborn about our finances even though I don't show that. I love how I sit in bed and read with you asleep next to me and listen to you breathe. I love how you make me lunch every morning for work and you have a hot cup of coffee for me when we walk out the door. I love your sensitivity towards life, love, and my happiness. I love that God gave me a wonderful man to walk beside for the rest of this life. The gratitude that I have towards God for you is more immense and deeper than anyone will ever fully understand. Like John and Becky said don't ever entertain the idea of life apart because it would be telling God that He goofed.  I love you Susanna

      The distance between people even though they are in the same room is weird. You could be five feet away from them and feel like you are on the other side of the world. That weird distance feeling that you get sometimes leads to questioning. What are you doing wrong? What could you change to bring the intimacy back? What can you change to bring back the feeling of acceptance? What has changed thus far to bring the distance into existence?   Lord if there is anything that I have done to bring distance in between myself and anyone show me. If there is anger or hurt in anyone that I have caused let them forgive me. Let me make it very clear to that person that I did not mean to ever cause any kind of uncomfortableness in their life. Let me be dedicated to changing myself and conforming myself to your will and what you would have me do and be. Let the gap be filled and communication and honesty come forth.

      "This moment contains all moments"  This thought brings me to all the pivotal moments in the lives of the people that I love and in my own life. This is going to a brief time of reminiscing. Some of them mentioned I may not have been old enough to realize the immensity of them but I can imagine the emotions of those involved. There will probably be gaps.  The day that my mother found out she was carrying her first child, me. The day I took my first step and said my first word.  The day that I started school.  The day that I became a sibling and not an only child.  The day that I had two siblings. The day that my parents told us they were getting a divorce. The day that I found out the reason for my parents divorce was because of my mother's affair. The day that I started High School in a state 1500 miles away from what had been home for 13 years. The day that I first met the Lord.  The day I went on my first mission trip to Mexico to build houses for those who didn't have one.  The day that I graduated High School. The day that I had sex for the first time. The day that I tried drugs for the first time. The day that I realized I was a drug addict. The day that I signed a year of my life away to a faith based rehab. The day that I left rehab with a renewed relationship with God. The day that I met Obadiah working at Jesus Chapel. The day that he invited me to college group at the Vineyard in Gilbert. The day that I met all of my family in Christ at that very college group. The day that I met Jordan. The day that I married Jordan. The day that Adoniah was born. The day at the cabin in the closet when Ben and Mandy told us they were pregnant with Annah. The day that Annah was born. The day that Elianah was born The day that I started working with the youth at the Vineyard. The day that I went to Mexico to serve at an orphanage with those very same youth. The day that I feared we would never conceive a child of our own. The day that we found out it's not me and the relief that we both felt. The day that Rick and Rachel were married. The day that Robert and Angela were married. The day that the Ferguson's came back from Israel for good this time. The day that Chad and Jen were married. The days that we have spent in intimate fellowship with the Ferguson's. The day that Erin found out they were expecting their third. The day that Jordan was accepted to Nursing School. The day that Micah and Chrissy were married. The day that Kathy found out they were pregnant with their third. The days of accountability with Ben. The day the Lotts bought a house to start an adolescent home for girls. The day that Jordan graduates from Nursing School. The day that I find out that I am carrying our first. The day that face looks at me and I know more than anything it was meant to be at that moment. The day that we are pregnant with our third. The day that we sit on our porch and watch our grandchildren play. The day that we go home for eternity and have peace that, that moment contained all these moments.

      First let me explain what the "omnibus" is exactly. This is the bus that the ghosts get on to go to the place basically of a second chance. Just another exerpt that spoke volumes to me from "The Great Divorce"  "But what of the poor ghosts who never get into the omnibus at all?" "Everyone who wishes it does. Never fear. There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, "Thy will be done," and those to whom God says, "Thy will be done." All that are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no Hell. No sould that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. To those who seek find. To those who knock it is opened."  This really made me question what kind of person I am. Am I completely surrendered to Him in all aspects of my life to the point that I can say "thy will be done" or is He saying to me " thy  will be done". I guess since I am even asking the question I can guarantee that it quite possibly is 50/50. Now, since I can admit the fact that He is asking me that what do I do to change it. How do I quiet myself in all areas of my life and relationships to be open to His will all of the time and in everything I am. An area of prayer for me and other's for me? Yes. Pray that I can gain the confidence in my great, big, huger than any circumstance God to prostrate myself before Him and let His will be done. Let His will enter my individual walk, let it enter my marriage, let it enter into the leadership that I have been given, let it enter my relationships, let it enter my accoutability, let it enter my weak and feeble faith. Lord, your will be done in all that I am and going to be. World pray that it would be.

      Lord, I just want to glorify you in everything that I do. I yearn to be so close to you that I can't see anything in front of me without looking around you. I want yours to be the hand that I hold, yours to be the shoulder that I cry on, yours to be the arms that I run into, and you to be the person that I am grateful towards for all provision that you have given in the last few weeks. We didn't have the gap insurance on the Echo so you made it possible for Jordan to get a no interest loan from his work to pay off the remaining balance that we were liable for. We also don't have to pay it all back at once, the hospital is going to take $50 out of his paycheck a month until it is either paid off through that or we pay it off early. We didn't have a vehicle so you gave us a selfless friend who has basically moved into our house for the last 2 weeks and been driving me to work every morning. We were trying to figure out how we were going to come up with the money to pay for the repairs needed on Jordan's car so that when the friend that has been with us leaves we have transportation to school and work. You gave us another friend who without even thinking twice gave us the money that we needed to buy the parts to fix the car. Jordan and I were fighting about me giving money towards Ireland because we didn't have it and we were living check to check, and you opened up our finances so I can give more than what I was. Although the circumstance that led to this was scary and crappy you have made me realize more than ever that You have a plan and a purpose for my life. In all honesty this was the third time that I should be dead or even seriously injured and wasn't. If you had seen the car in the tow yard you probably would have cried like I did. Now more than ever though it makes me wonder and question and desire to hear the voice of God tell me what exactly it is He is doing in all of this. Why after an overdose and 2 major car accidents am I still here?

      Hey world just wanted to let you all know that I am OK. For those of you that have not heard I was in a pretty bad car accident on Sunday morning on my way to church. I hit some gravel in a construction zone and threw myself into a skid. I hit the median and did a 90 degree turn, then I hit the curb, jumped the curb and hit a tree and a cinder block wall head on. I hit so hard that my back end came off the ground and when it came down it rolled on the driver's side. The car is totaled and we have only had it for a year. This is the second accident that I have been in in less than 5 years that they have had to cut me out of the vehicle. They cut the roof off to get me out so they could stabalize my neck. I went and looked at the car today and the guy from the towing company said that he is amazed that I walked away from it. Seeing the car today really made me realize that God must really have some plans for me in order to to bring me out of two major accidents. It is really hard to communicate just how I feel about this whole situation because it's kind of a blessing in disguise. We as in Jordan and I have been trying to figure out what we can get rid of in order to cut back on our bills so that we can pay some things off and get out of some of our debt. So now that the car is totaled the insurance company is paying it off so that frees up $350 a month, Now, however we need to figure out what we need to do to fix Jordans car so that we have a vehicle because right now we don't have a running car besides the motocycle. So world pray that we figure everything out and that this actually turns out to be a good thing. I don't know if I have been rambling or if it has made any sense but that is the bottom line. I am alive once again after a major accident, I walked away without even a bruise or bump imagine that. God I love you.

      My dear Isaac, You always were and always will be beautiful Know in the deepest crevice of your soul how it hurt Laying you on that frigid rough stone Plunging that knife into the unrelenting heart that you possess It hurt to the bone My bones ached the way hers do in the darkness of night the tears burned my cheeks like coals in the fire And, they tasted bitter on my tongue those tears left the most horrendous taste in my mouth   Sweet Isaac,  Know your voice was ambition Your tone was vibrant as you called me But, His was desparate His was life and death He called out to me as I listeneed to you The words flowing from your mouth like a rainbow stretching from here to Ireland. I tried Isaac, I really truly did I tried to focus on you but I couldn't I couldn't ignore His agony and yearning to have me first  First in all I lay my mind and hands to First in my home with the person that He has gifted my life with First in my place of worship and fellowship First in the calling He placed in my life which includes all of them He wants me first Isaac  So as I walked away I turned and saw you You reached for me one last time in hopes that I would maybe change my mind Oh how I wanted to Isaac but He said no And, not only did He say no He told me to go back and do the one thing I had not wanted Him to ask of me He told me I wasn't ready  He lifted my chin and looked me square in the eye and said "Go back"  So I returneed to you on that stone and the knife I laid at your side hoping I wouldn't have to use it I picked up the knife trembling like a leaf and I turned to Him pleading with my eyes and spirit And He knodded The tears crashed from my eyes like waves on the rocks as I ran the knife through that beautiful heart There was peace Isaac  As I ran back to His arms there was peace Lonely and sad but peace How I did love you Isaac

      words can not express the gratitude of understanding from a dear friend, brother, and fellow warrior in the battle for truth and beauty.  Ireland Dreams  Have you ever killed a dream for beauty?  I saw a young lass, red hair, walking down a lonely road, through the Irish countryside, sad beyond measure, for she had given, up everything for a cause, for freedom.  He had been handsome, and adventurous, and was a hope for a new tomorrow, but Jesus was calling her elsewhere... what a pain, what a calamity.  She looked him in the eye, and said, "I love you my dear," but I love my master even more, and she laid him on a stone, on an altar and said again, "I loved you dearly, my sweet Isaac," and swung the knife down into his heart, ending this dream, for the now.  She would resurrect it when the master said it was ok, but for now, she was lonely in her faithfulness.  Dreams die, but not obedience.  Praise be, to those who obey, for obedience is better than sacrifice.  BR Cloud

            Samantha wears this bracelet that her mother gave her. This is the first gift in the last 5 years that Rachel, her mother, has given her that did not come with come gross expectation. The gross expectation had always and still does at times consist of near perfection. Why? Sam has never been able to answer that question and doesn't think that she ever will. Maybe, someday ten even fifteen years down the road she will know why, as for right now however she doesn't bother giving any effort to the question. The question plagued her for almost 5 years and that plague didn't get her anywhere except traveling the road of feeling like a constant failure. As of right now she contemplates the bracelet.         Rachel was never known to be a woman of profound thought or idea so it makes the bracelet even more of a mystery. It is made of pewter and is actually an extremely beautiful piece. The bracelet consists of your regular jewelry accesories such as a clasp and rings that usually in the end get caught on something and pull open. You grab the pliers and squeeze them back together, good as new right? The bracelet also has 7 charms on it which is the first interesting thing that Sam noticed. Seven of course is the number of perfection which makes the whole thing kind of ironic. Like that song by Alannis Morrisette, man get's on a plane for the first time and it crashes, that kind of ironic. The charms have words engraved in them on both sides. The first time Sam really looked at the charms she was intrigued by the word that was on the top compared to the word that was on the bottom depending on how you wore it. The first one and on down the line has Hope and Courage, Love and Humor, Trust and Kindness, Joy and Honor, Family and Passion, Truth and Unity, and lastly Loyalty and Charity. These make up the gift that was given from her mother.       Sam just kind of thought that the correllation of the words was not a very common one in most of the cases. The ones that she found to be more unusual than the others was hope and courage. Sam like most Americans heard on the news, radios, and newspapers about Pat Tillman. The pro football player that gave up millions of dollars to do something that he exceeded at, a sport that he had played in highschool and college. He turned down the Vikings and signed with the Cardinals, insane right? Even more insane was when he told the Cardinals that he was going to war. He was going to go fight a battle that was not his to fight but he thought differently. He did not want to be a hero, he didn't even want to make a big deal about it but the media got a hold of that one and wrapped it's greedy little fist around it. He was corageous and when Sam thought about corageousness she also thought bravery, fierceness, determination, fearlessness, lion-heartedness, and heroism. The last thing that Sam thought was hope. Hope was always something bigger that a person possessed. Sam always associated this with achievement, ambition, aspiration, dreams, and belief. After really thinking about it though doing what he did had to have some kind of sentimentality to it. Pat Tillman believed in something that most Americans didn't and don't. He believed in something a whole lot bigger than himself, he had a dream for the country that his future children would dwell. He was a genuine hero.        Sam was perplexed with the ideas that her mind was filled with due to this gift, the bracelet from her mother. The idea of believing that she could be fearless in endeavors that she faced was almost, in her weak faltering mind, ungraspable. To be determined in achievement and ambition is something that after thinking about it has always came naturally to her. She is stubborn and pig-headed and she is rarely known to back down from anything in her face. She may not be the most eloquent about it at times but she refuses to be taken advantage of or hurt. Maybe this is where the other charm comes into the picture, trust and kindness. Sam for a long time before Jeff had an issue with trusting anyone especially men and family had turned their back on her in her deepest need so she had little trust for them as well. So, naturally kindness did not come easily either. It took Sam a long time not to immediately doubt the motives of everyone in her life. She always assumed that if someone was trying to get close to her they wanted something from her and often times she let them in and they tapped her dry. Trust and kindness were not attritbutes that she possessed just because, she had to work at it for an extended period of time and she still fine tunes them daily.        Jeff has changed that in her since those days, he has shown her what real trust, honesty, and kindness is really all about. He has also shown her what true love means, not the sappy drippy love that you see in movies but real live, raw, in your face true love. Since marrying Jeff she has redefined in her reality what family is. Family and passion have merged to become something that is so beautiful that at times she can barely take it. She has learned and seen what unconditional love from man looks like. When she felt unlovable it was at that moment that Jeff told her just how much he cherished having her in his life. When she felt detestable Jeff told her that she was blessing from God. When she felt unattractive and fat and that her face looked like a land mine because she was on her period and all broke out Jeff told her she was the most incredible creature he had ever laid eyes on. The look in his eyes and the touch of his fingertips enlightened Sam to a passion that she had never experienced. Their physical intimacy was powerful and the way that he makes love to her opened her eyes to his selflessness. She may not be the best at telling him or communicating that to him but she knows he knows. Don't get me wrong there are times where the sparks have flown and things were said that shouldn't have been said but Jeff is her friend before anything else and that is why their love works. Sam laughs more with Jeff than any other man ever. His sense of humor is what makes them the best pair because there are times where he doesn't need to say a thing and Sam is in tears from laughter. Humor and love come hand in hand. If you can't have fun with the person you love than you really don't know what you are missing. Sam's experience with humor before Jeff with other men was always at her expense. The expense of her feelings, her emotions, and mostly her self-esteem. Back in the day the tears that fell from her eyes were not from laughter or happiness or even love, it was contempt, sadness, and depression. Now Sam and Jeff have a love that they can wrap their hands around and control because of loyalty they both have towards the sanctity of marriage.        Sam always compared every act of loyalty and charity to her father Brad. Sam will look you sqaure in the eye and tell you her father is one of the most loyal people that you will ever meet. Brad is and always has been the type of husband, father, and friend that would do whatever it took to make anything work. When Rachel cheated on him after 13 years of marriage he suggested counseling, a trial separation, even moving to a different state to try and put back together what obviously had fallen apart. When Sam was 16 and making some really stupid choices he did all the typical things that a father did to get his oldest daughter back on track. When that didn't work he offered counseling individually and together but Sam didn't want anything to do with it. She turned her back on him and left him with no choice but to move her back to Arizona with her mother Rachel but he didn't give up restoring what was broken. Today Brad and Sam are closer as a father an daughter than they ever were. Sam calls her dad and they talk for hours about everything from weather to baseball to what is going on with Sam's marriage and life in general. Loyalty has always been at the top of Brad's list when it came to his family especially his girls. That is where Sam got it from. She struggled with it because for a long time she wasn't shown any by anyone or anything in her existance. Today she not only tries hard to be loyal to people and commitments but she strives to be charitable as well. She opens her home to friends and family to just spend an afternoon together and eat and fellowship. She struggles with charity in her finances but she works on it daily. Loyalty and charity has always been to characteristics that Sam has tried to acquire in her life.             The bracelet that Sam has spent many minutes maybe even hours thinking about and looking at. It has evolved from it's original form the first time that she put it on her wrist. It still is a bracelet but it has become so much more to Sam. This jewelry has become and idea maybe even an action if put in motion. Sam still will wonder about the bracelet. She will wonder why out of all the things that her mother could have given her why something like that at a time and a place where she is at right now.

      It seems as if there is nothing creative.  Nothing creative being felt in the depths of my heart. No creativity on the tip of my tongue. Nothing creative flowing from my lips. Absolutely zero creativity falling from my fingertips. The world and it's needs and desires and requirement of me has tapped the creativy that once flowed freely.  The feelings that once sent shivers down my spine and made me smile while sitting alone are fading quickly. The art that has been created lately is tossed in the closet not being hung for anyone to see.  The rythms and lyrics that once pounded in my soul are as the waves on the shore as tide is retreating.  The ministry that once brought immense joy to my being has been put on hold while I get me back together. Why is it that at the time that I need to creativiy the most it hides it's face from my imagination. The inspiration that comes from knowing that there is something unique inside of me is uncomparable yet blurry. Back to the place where I started is the road I need to travel. Back to the beginning and experience it all over again. Mercy for the things that I deserve, grace for the things I don't, happiness with myself and my position, joy in Him who is joy, studying hours on end, laying with eyes wide shut being still, being broken and vulnerable at the alter, being on my knees lifting everything and everyone besides me and mine up like incencse, holding the hand of my lover and friend as we lie in bed together, praising Him in all circumstance, All curcumstance. Can I and will I travel this road so bare. The road that is not traveled or trod by very may before, during, or after me.  This road that is narrow and straight yet winds itself through the beauty, truth, and love of life. Do I have the courage to travel it alone? Because I have to I am the only one that can make this decision to fix me.

      to cry and not care that her mascara is running all over her face and her chest rises and falls gasping for the breath that doesn't want to come at times. her flesh doesn't allow the air she breathes to enter because the death is holding with fists clenched to her spirit that can't raise her head and look into His eyes. she feels tired and weary of the lessons and trials and wants so bad to just fall asleep and dream of that place where He wants her to be. there are times lately where she wonders if that place exists anymore and if so why doesn't someone as big as Him reach down and take her from the fist and the nails digging into her heart. she tasted of the vine it seems a life time ago, she knew the redemption and she definitely knew the deliverance. she felt the grace fall on her face and her broken back like rain. she knew the freedom to dance like a child and praise Him in the midst of any and all circumstance. now she hardly remembers what all of that felt like because she has not dwelt there in a long time. she has forgotten the release of just standing and thanking him that she is not a drug addict, alcoholic, a mother of a child of a man that treated her like scum. she forgets how blessed she really is to have Him that loved her before time, a husband that treats her the way He would treat her, a beautiful home, family and friends that care enough to scream at the fist when it seems to be dragging her away. yet her head stays low and her eyes scan the ground and looks at the fingers of the fist and wipes the mascara from her cheeks.

      I still haven't figured out how to get links on my new page. I also noticed that mostly everyone I know that have blogs don't have a link to my page. It's weird that that is something I would notice. Selfish? Conceited? I don't know it's just weird to think I read the thoughts of my friends and really care what happens and what is going on in their lives and do they think the same of me? Please don't be offended by this because that is not my intention. Just a thought process running through my brain and this is my place to put it in black and white.

      It is definitely one of those things that I am torn over. I have really missed youth on Wednesday nights but I also have enojoyed the time away. I have been able to focus on me and my marriage and spending time with Jordan. We have been able to sit down and talk about things that we have been putting off or have not had the time to focus on them. I have been able to rest physically and get the sleep and relaxation that I think my body has needed for a long time. However, I read Klao's blog and that is the stuff that I miss being involved in. Getting up at the break of day and taking our kids out for breakfast to honor them. I read that and I was some what jealous but it wasn't the destructive jealousy. It was the kind that made me want to get back and be able to experience all the cool things that are happening. I love them but I love my God more and want that to be right first.

      So you want to hear a weird story that kind falls in line with the last post. Yesterday at work I was sitting in my desk and one of my co-workers walked by. She took about 3 steps past my desk and then back tracked and came into my cube. She looked down at me and said "You are pregnant aren't you?". I told her no and why would she think that. She went on to explain that in the last 15 years everytime one of her friends or co-workers at other jobs has been pregnant she knew before they did and she has never been wrong. She said that for the last few days she had been getting this "vibe" and when she walked past me she just "knew". I was talking to Jordan about it on the way home from work last night and we started counting the days. OK so for you men this may get a little weird for you. The first day of my last period was 4/29/04. My Dr. has told me that you count approximately 12-14 days from that day and that is when you are ovulating. Well 12-14 days from 4/29/04 is 5/11/04-5/13/04. Not to be to descriptive but we have been trying exceptionally more the last week than usual. Please do not mistake that I am believing her or excited because you have already read my last post I hope. It was just really weird.

      You give and take away You give and take away Still my heart will choose to say Lord, Blessed be your name.  I have been spending a lot of time in prayer about the baby situation. I know that I have said before that I am finally to a point of acceptance of when it happens it happens. I am still in that place I have just been seeking God's voice. After about two weeks He finally decided to talk to me about it. I have always been the type that has heard His voice in music and lyrics. The Worship Gathering was on Friday night and it is the best one that I have been to yet. They played a song that night, Blessed me the Name. Part of the song is at the top and that is what He said to me, "I give and take away and until you get to that place where you can say with full confidence and faithfulness blessed be My name I will not give. Not only you but Jordan too. I want to take all the stuff out of your life that has taken your focus off Me so that when I do give you can focus on that with Me at the center." That however is not the the most amazing thing about this. On Saturday I went and hungout with my mom, she was helping me sew curtains for my living room. That evening she asked if I wanted to go to church with them. They still attend Central which is not a bad thing at all, Jordan and I just decided that it wasn't going to be our home church because we didn't get the intimacy that we get at Vineyard. God knew what he was doing obviously. The worship band at Central played that song so there was my confirmation but that was not all. The teaching that night that Cal Jernigan did was on parenting and it was the first in a series that they are doing. The first lesson was on realizing that your children are a treasure from the Lord and that they are the most important thing that you will ever do for God. That is not where it ended though. Very rarely does Kim play the same songs week to week so it is all that more rare to hear a song that was played on Friday night at the Worship Gathering on Sunday morning in church. It happened though, they played Blessed be the Name again and I laughed out loud and both Jordan and Reston looked at me weird. So tell me that God doesn't speak to his children. Tell me that God doesn't spend time conversing with his daughters and sons. He talked to me loud and clear and I have had such an amazing peace about it.   You give and take away You give and take away Still my heart will choose to say Lord, Blessed be your name  Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be Your name Blessed be the name of the Lord Blessed be Your  GLORIOUS  name

      We as Christians are so quick to judge the actions and words of our brothers and sisters. We are even more quick to voice our dislike and distaste of something that a brother or sister has done or said. I know someone who is an incredible man of God as well as an incredible youth pastor who has done nothing but be brutally honest with me many times. All of those time and occurences have led to change or affirmation. He called me out when Jordan and I weren't tithing and it changed. He has told me countless number of times that I am talented and creative regardless of how I feel and it affirmed God's call in my life. Yet my brother LKinKS has been slandered and torn down because of something cute that he said about a girl. Yet the accusers can't put their name on something that they at least feel to be true. If you truly believe something and feel something is true put your name on it. Don't be a coward so that no one will know who you are or what you think.  I Susanna Smith believe in Jesus and that he was the only Son of God. I Susanna Smith am pro-life and believe that any form of abortion is murder. I Susanna Smith believe that cloning is not of God. I Susanna Smith do not believe in "religion" but in a relationship. I Susanna Smith believe in the youth of this generation and I believe that they are going to stand up and do some amazing things for the Kingdom of God. I Susanna Smith believe in my family and my friends. I Susanna Smith believe in love, truth, and beauty. I Susanna Smith believe that if you don't have the courage to own up then you should be quiet.

      So second weird thing at work. There is another girl at work that came up to me yesterday and told me that she had a dream about me. I asked her if it was good or bad. She said she hopes it was good, she said that I was pregnant in the dream. She is the second girl in the last month that has told me I was going to be pregnant soon and neither of them knew about the other. I have prayed that God would calm my heart and not let it affect me. I have also prayed that He would let me know if it's from Him or just weird stuff and I haven't heard anything. I am however very at peace about it which I have been for awhile about the whole baby situation. It's just weird.

      How do you find your place when the place you used to be is running so smooth without you?  How do you find your voice when you haven't sung the song of creativity in a while? How do you find the focus to seek the face of the one who died when your focus is on so many other things? How do you celebrate finally being out of financial sin when you have been there for so long?

      First I just wanted to say that I love you Cela. You really are a blessing in my life.   Cool, excellent, exciting news. We are getting a roommate. The girl that Ben sent the e-mail about is going to be living with us. Her name is Stephanie and she is really awesome. Jordan and I had the opportunity to talk to her and get to know her a little on Sunday morning when she came to our church for the first time. Hopefully she will start coming to college group on Friday nights when she doesn't have to work. We are not sure how long she will be staying but it sounds like 6 months or so.   Also we had a chance to visit with Joel Bidderman last night. He came out to our house and ate with us. I am really excited that he is going to be around more now, he is a very gentle person that I enjoy talking to. He came out to the house to talk about a place to stay if needed. We told him the same thing that we would tell anyone else in need. Our house is open to anyone and everyone at any time. He said something that changed my perspective on our house. Joel said that is nice that we are that far away from everything it makes the seclusion peaceful. He made our home sound like a hidden get away where you can be restored. He is still not sure that he is going to need to stay with us definitely but he was appreciative of the fact that it is open if he needs it. He saw it as a place to refresh since he is so used to the mountains, the quiet, and the dark that surrounds us out there. He said it would be cool to have a place to study or to mess around on his guitar. I am very thankful for Joel Bidderman and the sweet spirit that he possesses.   Ben called me last week and we got on a subject that is worth mentioning. He said something about me spending more time with my mother and the fact that she is going to the quilting class on Monday nights. All I can say about this is that God really is good to His children, He knows the exact time to restore something that is broken. There has been restoration in the relationship with my mother in huge ways. I hadn't really taken the time to see the change but Ben stopped me and gave me that chance. My mother and I have come a long way and no I don't think that we are there yet but we are well on our way. This is due to the grace that God grants man to see past the faults and downfalls of people who have hurt us.

      It's HOT!!!!!!!!! I stinkin hate the heat. The summer is the reason that I would like to live somewhere else other than here. It also doesn't help that the air conditioner went out in our car either. Anyways, enough about the heat because it is not going anywhere. Just wanted to say hi to the world that I seem to be unattached to during the week. I love my job but it takes so much work and energy it hurts my brain sometimes. I guess that is the price I pay for being in the position that I am in. I love all of you and truly wish that I had more time. Someone once told me that when you are little you have little person issues, when you are a teenager you have teenager issuess, and when you grow up you have grown up issues which are bigger than the 2 prior. I don't have bad issues just a lot of issues and work seems to be at the top of the list. The rest the last month has been wonderful however. I have been able to read and spend time with my darling husband and that is irreplacable.

      In this world where nothing is for sure and you do not know what tomorrow holds there are a few things that I know to be constant.  I love my husband and I know that he loves me with an unconditional love that only a man of God possesses. We will one day have children and when that day comes we will raise them to know, love, and fear God. My friends and spiritual family love me with brutal truth, honesty, and beauty. I have been redeemed and delivered from addiction and anger within myself and from others. I have learned how to forgive without holding bitterness. I have learned how to hold my head up with the grace of a daughter of the King. I have realized with maturity come much responsibility. I have learned to love others for who they are instead of what they can offer. I can accept compliments as just that and not someone trying to get something out of me. I have come to the conclusion that everything comes with a price whether it be positive or negative. Ultimately I have learned and accepted that the one who carries me and cares for me is the one that does the same for every other person on the face of this planet.

      Pending Response.  After talking to Praying Mantis this weekend and throwing some ideas around for the ministry that he is wanting to start I am excited for the response that will be received. Reach out to the "unreachable" befriend the "friendless". I am not quite sure if that is the way it should be worded but maybe that is the way it has translated in my spirit. I am really feeling this. Please pray that this new fresh idea that is being birthed will be successful and fruitful. Pray that it is not a religious thing but a in the world but not of the world thing.  Weekends at Agape. I have been offered the weekend position on Saturday and Sundays 7am-7pm at the Agape House. Pray that I would be given the ability to show grace to the girl's in this home. Pray that my organizational skills would increase and improve ten fold. Pray that my creativity would open wide again as I find activities to do and places to go on Saturdays. Pray that I once again would be a friend first and authority second.  New York City, NY March 2005. I can taste the city on my tongue. Pray those of us being led to the inner city would be beneficial to the Kingdom. Pray that everything would fall into place and there would be a movement.  2014, Jordan's long term goal for possibly being on the mission field full time as a family. Pray now that if it His will he would pave the way and open the door. Pray that he would begin to prepare our hearts now. Pray that He would reveal to us what this seed that has been planted would mean as far as starting a family in the Sates or waiting. Maybe not having a child right now is what this has all been for. Pray for guidance and wisdom.  Pray for me as I have returned full time to Youth Ministry. Pray that my spirit would be in full submission to my leadership. Pray that I would enter back into this more as a friend and mentor rather than an authority.  I thanked God on Friday night that He knows the time and place for everyone. I thank Him again today for taking me through the valley these last 6 months. I pray that he would refuel me with a desire to do His work with more fervor and dedication than ever before. Thank you God for this time and place.

      Embarking on a journey that I have traveled before. Traveling a road that I know the bumps and curves. The sway of the trees and the stories they tell. The sunshine in their faces that my skin has missed desperately. The laughter in the flowers and the voices in the wind. I know this road like the veins that riddle the palm of my hand. I know the movement of the life on this road like the blood running through my veins. The bumps were harsh and difficult. My pride and selfish wanting were the hardest to break. The jealousy and hurt of not seeing the green of the island was enough to cry a river. But the bumps in this road were worth it. Tangled in the bramble and fighting out was a battle to be told. I have emerged a refreshed vessel, ready again to be filled with the work of someone other than myself. It will be different and new. It's will be like tasting the nectar of the vine for the first time. Like the nourishment of a mother's breast. The hand of the Father around my heart ready once again to mold it to His plan. He waited patiently as I dealt with my sin. He dealt with my fists pounding on His chest. He wiped the tears from my eyes the day Isaac was gone. In my yearnings and through the storm He once again calmed the seas. Patience can be a gift and a curse when it is not channeled properly. I have experienced both worlds of that patience during this time and I have learned. I am excited to follow this road again. To watch Him unfold in everything and everyone. Lord have me as I return, the prodigal daughter.
