      Last night we went to the theater and saw a girl get her first boner. Then another girl gave her head. Sounds like family entertainment, eh?  Actually, it was just the warm-up act for the main attraction. We were sitting damn near the front row of the  urlLink Alamo Drafhouse . While this gives an excellent view of the relatively small screen, it also places you too close to the speakers -- considering that they are the only speakers in the theater, they are inevitably cranked up loud enough to reach the deaf drunk in the back, which results in a deafening ring in your ears the next morning.  So, you may be wondering about the two girls. Kat and Morgan were volunteers from the audience. The MC for the evening, who was wearing a  urlLink giant foam cowboy hat  and a pair of  urlLink brown and orange Adidas  identical to mine, had initially requested two girls from the audience with the condition that they be "fun." Lacking volunteers, he eased his requirements to include "semi-fun," and finally, "boring ass bitches." Fortunately for the crowd, someone in the "semi-fun" category finally stepped forward. Of course, they were unaware of the challenge that lay before them.  Morgan volunteered to get her first boner. They laid her down on the stage. The MC then called his assistant to the stage with a few props. The first was a box of  urlLink Krispy Kreme donuts . One Original Glazed was placed on the girl's crotch -- err, swimsuit zone. The assistant then produced a banana, which he peeled. He then offered to the audience a choice: straight or bent. The audience voted "bent," which was apparently the choice of every performance before. The "bent" banana was then inserted snuggly into the Krispy Kreme.  "Of course," to quote the MC, "no boner would be complete without some cream." The MC proceeded to crown the banana with ReadyWhip. He then invited Kat to join him on his knees. It was time to "service the first boner." And she did. To be honest, it looked as though she had done it before (or had at least received professional training).  What's the point of the stroy? Is 35MPH sliding down the ladder into a smut-ridden bog of sex and fart jokes? Well, maybe, but that's not the point of this post. The point is the follow-up to the opening act:  urlLink Spike & Mike's Festival of Sick & Twisted Animation . Two hours of non-commercial animation with a seriously non-PC slant. In other words, it was quite entertaining.  One particularly well-done animation was Happy Tree Friends, from the people at  urlLink Mondo Media . Oddly, I've been speaking with the artists at Mondo Media for the last two weeks, the whole time not realizing that they did  those  animations. In fact, I'll be visiting Mondo on Monday in San Francisco. (I'm working with them to develop a demo for our products and Alias Maya.) I'll be sure to get autographs for everyone.

      Sorry no posts yesterday - I was skiing. Uh, I mean I was sick - yeah that's it.  As far as the graphics for the page - I think we need to make a sincere effort to draw this stuff out on our own, without precedent or looking to see what else is out there. 35mph is a creation of our own and I believe everything within it should come from us - not anyone else. The graphics for the front page are only a small part of an overall feel that 35mph should have. It should all relate back to what 35mph means to the group and to each of us. A little mooshy (sp?), I know but that's how I feel. If I were to pick a website that has the same cohesiveness that I would like to see in ours it would be  urlLink Tool .  Speaking of Tool, Bennett - are they doing anything crazy (a new album maybe?)

      The Tall Grunge was really just a visual treatment, not necessarily a final product for a front page or a template for the site. Just an aesthetic piece, really.  I'm not quite sure where to go with a site template. I definitely agree with Heath that the template needs to evoke more of a gritty film-like quality, similar to the previous placeholder graphic form the Untitled piece. The Tall Grunge was something starting in that direction, but it's not quite evolved to the point of a template for the site.  Come on, guys... y'all surf the web. Do you guys not see anything out there in the same genre of what we're wanting to do? Any similar imagery?

      Here's another quick 35MPH treatment I quickly put together this evening in Photoshop. It leans more toward the "grunge" style, and it's tall, so there you have it...  &rarr;  urlLink Tall Grunge   I quickly picked up some free fonts from  urlLink Chank . I then picked up some grunge brushes from  urlLink Nocturna . For the background, I took a close-up digital picture of a colorful ashtray (the blue green tones) and some potting soil (the earthier brown tones). Mix it all together and you get what you get. Enjoy.

      I completely understand what you mean, Heath. I'd like to go with the older style as well, I just don't happen to have any work done like that at the moment. Hopefully, if my harddrive is recovered, I'll have some of that to post. Of course, the next time I get a moment to sit down with Photoshop (maybe this weekend) I'll aim in that direction...

      OK - Troy, I know that you were just playing around with Photoshop but... I guess what I had in mind for a graphic library was more related to the old frontpage of 35mph.com. Maybe what we need to do is put our heads together and develop this graphics library. I really liked the screenshot from Untitled. It gave me a good film vibe. That stuff makes me think I'm watching Nickelodeon (sp?). Just an honest crit - nothing personal.

Unfortunately, my harddrive kicked the bucket over Christmas. Well, I got a new machine from the deal but I lost a lot of Photoshop work. Damn.  So, I've been starting to create new stuff. The blog gives me new inspiration. Here are a few elements I've done:  &rarr;  urlLink Jungle 35MPH  &rarr;  urlLink Pentagons  &rarr;  urlLink 35MPH Bluegel Logo

      Prior to the primary photography for "Shadow Vision," I'll be setting up lights and recording equipment for a Tyson Foods Event. I'll be responsible for gels, constructing rigging for lights and assistant camera work. This will be February 4-6. Though I've been contacted about "Shadow Vision," I have not received an assignment yet. I hope to hear that from Ozark Film and Video or through Alder very soon.  By the way, I researched a little concerning Alder's "Winterfest" event at Meadowbrook. It appears to have been cancelled at the last minute for insurance reasons. I think it was going to be to expensive to do legally.  Lastly, could one of you send me an email describing how to put a link in the posts?  The short instructions sent previously didn't quite soak in.

      Take a deep breath... we're about to go deep, deep, deep into the biggest 35MPH weblog post...  EVER!   My adventure today started with a link forwarded by co-worker Ben:  urlLink sputnik7.com . This site, dubbed as "the world's first real-time audio/video Internet entertainment experience," thinks of itself as a broadcast network. It evokes a possible template for our ever evolving, deeply beloved 35MPH.com. While sputnik7.com includes video and audio "stations," I was more interested in their video on demand. Herein you can find some great shorts, mostly of the digital variety. Currently on the front of their video-on-demand archive are their RESFEST picks. And here we go deeper...  First things first:  urlLink RESFEST . This is an "annual, global festival dedicated to showcasing innovative film, music, art, design and technology." Right. Sounds like everything we love to do, so these guys have got the right idea. RESFEST is a companion to what was originally a magainze,  urlLink RES . The magazine focuses on similar topics, obviously. Always cool, always expensive (shiny, glossy, thick pages, good binding, bi-monthly... about $60/year for a subscription).  Second things second: the RESFEST picks. Four of them stood out above the others as worthy of commenting. The rest are obviously the pick-of-the-litter as far as cutting edge shorts go, but we shall leave them as an exercise for the reader. My recommended viewings are the following:  urlLink  Sweet  ,  urlLink  Everything Hits At Once  ,  urlLink  Vision Point   and  urlLink  Tongues and Taxis  .   Sweet  has the most professional cinematography of my four selections. And for good reason: the cinematographer was five-time Oscar nominee  urlLink Allen Daviau , whose work includes  urlLink E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ,  urlLink The Color Purple  and  urlLink Empire of the Sun . But, it was shot entirely on digital video... so how did they get that spectacular "film-look?" The answer is simple:  urlLink The Orphanage 's Magic Bullet Suite. This suite of tools (plug-ins for Adobe After Effects) provide framerate adjustment, color balancing, and letterboxing utilties to shift digital video from Local-And-Late-Breaking to Cinemascope and beyond. There was an interview with one of the creators of Magic Bullet on TechTV; you can find the article  urlLink here . For a more in-depth review of the product,  urlLink check out this review from Ken Stone  and  urlLink this newsgroup posting .  The second short worth watching is  Vision Point . This short introduces a unique technique I've not seen before. The camera is focused on the horizon (or an object, like a mountain, on the horizon) during time-lapse footage of a car trip. The end result is quite hypnotic and his editing is synched with the music toward a very trippy effect. The technique, dubbed Tran Scan by its creator,  urlLink Stephen X. Arthur , is showcased in  urlLink a second short of the same name  wherein Arthur travels the Trans-Canadian Highway from one side of our neighbor-to-the-north to the other.  Arthur also did another short of incredible digital trickery,  urlLink  Transfigured  . In this work, Arthur took the collected works of abstract painter  urlLink Jack Shadbolt  and brought them to life through a multitude of digital techniques. An inspriation to us all!  The third (or fourth, depending on who's counting) short to check out is  Everything Hits At Once . This short was done by a local (to me at least, in Austin) web illustrator,  urlLink Divya Srinivasan . The short was done using a non-commercial software package dubbed Rotoshop. The look may be familiar to those who have seen  urlLink Waking Life  by  urlLink Richard Linklater  (of  urlLink Dazed and Confused  fame). Rotoshop was created by artist/programmer  urlLink Bob Sabiston  of  urlLink Flat Black Films . The software is very, very cool, and I recommend that everyone rent/buy Waking Life where one can find a behind-the-scenes demonstration of the software. To provide a more comprehensive look, here are some of my favorite links:  &rarr;  urlLink From the Waking Life website: Rotoscoping (QuickTime movie)  &rarr;  urlLink Wired News: Animating a Waking Life  &rarr;  urlLink Wired 9.02: Unreal World  &rarr;  urlLink Apple: The Dreamlike Animation of &quot;Waking Life&quot;  &rarr;  urlLink TechTV: Rotoshop Animation  &rarr;  urlLink Animation World Magazine: Dream Is Destiny: Waking Life   And last but certainly not least: a bit of traditional animation. Well, semi-traditional.  urlLink Mike Overbeck 's cartoons are made in  urlLink Flash . Flash was originally developed as a web-animation tool. And for those for a mind toward history, back in the whacky, halcyon dot-com days of the late 1990's, our intrepid blogger  urlLink Troy was deeply involved with Flash . Back to Mike, though... his cartoon  Tongues and Taxis  is featured in the RESFEST picks. It's fairly funny and cleverly animated. For a little (very little) behind-the-scenes footage see  urlLink his documentary on its making . Don't forget to check out his political cartoons on his website... they're good for a laugh.

His name is Stephen Dyer and his works include films like  urlLink Finding North ,  urlLink Late Bloomers  and  urlLink Ball in the House .   The 35MPH network continues to grow...

      This nice little site was forwarded on to me from Elizabeth's cousin in Hawaii.  urlLink DFILM  is a "visual communications" company that makes various things for various people. The cool thing that they've done (I'm sure there are others) is something called the DFILM Moviemaker (you can find it off their homepage).  DFILM Moviemaker allows you to create little Flash films by choosing characters, scenes, backdrops and music. You even get to throw on a title sequence. It's not perfect: the choices of scenes are fairly limited, and the characters are not very generic, but it's fun to try to make something interesting within the limits they establish. It's an interesting idea, something I'd like to see more of on the web.  To introduce everyone to DFILM, I made a little one of my own:  urlLink My Homage . This link probably won't last forever, but it should last long enough for those here to see it.  To go along with this homage, here are some expository links:     urlLink First Prize: Cadillac Eldorado     urlLink Second Prize: Steak Knives     urlLink Inspiration: The Glengarry Mix

      A re-edit or (re-shoot?) is definitely in order....but a trip to Austin, for myself, is not in the forseeable future. But then again, neither was my trip to NWA for the holidays and I still managed to share a few laughs and a lot of drinks at the Lounge. Maybe we could work something out over a long weekend. At the least, a collective mindset needs to be re-established and start up on some fantastic new project.

      Just added a link to  urlLink TroyGilbert.com . This is my own personal blog devoted to the games industry.  For those that don't know, I work in the games industry. I don't make games, but I help other companies make their games (I'm a field engineer for Criterion Software -- we make various game technologies). This means I end up seeing the inside of a lot of games -- games like Call of Duty, Dead To Rights 2, and Kill.Switch -- instead of spending 18 months looking at one game. I think that uniquely qualifies me to share my slanted opinion.  Oh yeah, I play quite a few games as well. But doesn't everyone?

      Over the next few days I'll start uploading some of our past productions. Right now, there's only one 35MPH production on-line, and it's seasonal. Check out the  urlLink Happy Halloween Stopmotion Greeting .  The sets and characters were created from scratch by Elizabeth (actual size of house is about a foot-and-a-half tall). She also did the animation (over 600 individual still frames). I did the editing, sound and effects.  We used the following software:  urlLink Stop Motion Pro  for capture and rough edit;  urlLink Adobe Premiere  for final editing and sound mixing;  urlLink Adobe Photoshop  for titles; and  urlLink Sony Sound Forge  for audio effects editing. Some audio samples were used from  urlLink SoundDogs .  The entire production, from storyboarding to set construction, filming to editing, took about two weeks (evenings and weekends). We began by storyboarding. Unfortunately, we accidentally threw them away after the shoot was finished so I can't post them. The final video is fairly close to the storyboard, the only difference being that we originally intended to have a cat as well -- it was cut due to the difficulties in animating it.  The filming was done with a Sony DCR-TRV330 Digital8 video camera (several years old, roughly equivalent to the  urlLink DCR-TRV350 ). Stop Motion Pro allows you to capture multiple frames at a time and average them together. This virtually eliminates video noise and interlacing artifacts without introducing too much softening to the image. Stop Motion Pro also provides an onion-skin mode that allows us to preview the live image against the previously captured stills, making animation far easier than without it.  The video has been featured at the top of  urlLink Stop Motion Pro's Gallery ! It may not be the Oscars, but it's good company nonetheless.

      Okay, I think we've cleaned things up a bit... and moved ourselves to the proper spot, 35mph.com. How about that?  Direct your attention to the links to my left:  urlLink IMDb  and  urlLink iFILM . Notice how they either begin with or end with a lower-case letter. That's what we in the industry call geek-chic.  Seriously, folks... IMDb may be the single most useful thing on the Internet (outside of  urlLink Google ).  And iFILM... well, it hosts a great deal of the strangest stuff on the 'net (in video form, of course).  These two sites are great "first links." Why? Because they represent some pretty solid ideals for what this site will eventually become: useful -- and more importantly -- a place where you can find some of the strangest stuff on the net (in video form, of course).

      Nice Bennett... keep the ball rolling and keep sticking your big, fat wide-ass foot in all those doors. Commercials and such would be a good departure point for 35MPH to get some real exposure as a full-fledged company. Until all of us are in the same area again (who knows when that will be?) we should start a rotating location pow-wow. We can start in NWA then to Austin and then -- wahoo -- Jackson! What do you guys think? One rotation per year, meet three times per year. We could really get some work done.

      Just got another production job. Jones Productions from Little Rock hired me to help shoot a commercial in Bella Vista. This is the largest and oldest film and video company in Arkansas. It pays $150 for two hours.  CJ, Emery and I had a talk the other day about shooting some "knock around" footage for the Frisco and/or IHCC. This footage could be mere practice or used for televised advertising. I think businesses with the right kind of character would like to use a small production company to create unique, one of a kind commercials. I think, once we're all in the same area, we could make some serious start up capitol shooting these small projects. We've all talked about music videos before and I still want to do that as well. These two types of things could be a nice sized bite to chew for our early "money-making" endeavors.

Only drawback is a red line they burn into the video about 1/3rd down from the top of the frame.  Here's your  urlLink one-stop source  for a lot of information on stop-motion in general.  And here's a  urlLink good source  that refers to Stop Motion Pro as long as other alternatives (many of them free).

      I have some negs I can scan and post (with some help) from the Blackbird shoot(s).  Troy, could you get me the software that turns digital photos to video? I'm going to try some stop motion with a Nikon D100 and high powered flood light kit from work. Do you have any suggestions on what file format to capture the frames in?  As for weekend excursions, I'm ready whenever.  I can easily arrange for a long weekend if I have a couple of weeks to arrange it. Let's get something going.

      As for the font - it was some weird script we used. EXCEPT for the  a . Remember we didn't like the  a  that was in the script so we went through all the other fonts on our computers until we found one that we thought looked good - and no, I don't remember that one either.  Troy, by all means, post everything you've got. And I am very serious about getting together SOON. I can take a long weekend to come down to NWA or Autsin (my preference would be Austin). We need to start the machine back up!!

      Damn... I didn't get stuff on last night either. I was up until 230am, just ran out of time to compress and upload the final product.  For  Untitled , I pulled a copy off of tape onto my machine -- I'm not sure if it's the right copy because it doesn't have any titles (didn't it have titles at the end?). Unfortunately, when we did the original edit on the iMac in the computer lab it encoded the audio in a format that can't be transferred off of the tape via Firewire. So, I had to capture the video then capture the audio using the line-in of my sound card. Then I had to re-synch the two (since they were captured separately and the audio didn't have any timecode).  Finally, I got all of that done. Last step was to de-interlace the footage and letterbox it. I didn't mess with color correcting it or anything because I was running out of time (a few obvious tries didn't look very good). All that remains is to compress the video down to a downloadable format, which is actually happening at home right now. Of course, we'll have to wait until this evening before I can upload it to the website... so check back then.  For  Blackbird , I captured it. Didn't have any problems (probably because I used my old PC's Firewire instead of an iMac to do the editing). I'll compress it as well and upload this evening.  I gotta say, guys, watching the movies made me pretty nostalgic. And I gotta say... we didn't do half-bad. The  Blackbird  shot is pretty cool (and it's just a rough, first attempt!).  So,  Watch This Space . Check back this evening for new video footage.  BTW, would you guys be interested in me posting scans of the storyboards and notes I have for  Blackbird ?

      As I may have mentioned before, my harddrive crashed while I was in NWA over Christmas. Since the first of January my harddrive has been in the hands of PC Guru, a data recovery expert. It's major surgery guys. It's been weeks that they've been working on it.  So, I unfortunately do not have the  Blackbird  title cards. I also will have to track the font back down that we used (anyone remember its name?).

      Thanks for the compliment on the image... to be honest, it was only about an hour's worth of work, and far from one of my favorites. But it came out nicely. I forced myself to use only photos I had taken with my camera. In that photo are several elements: the cooking element of a stovetop, the stairwell of a parking garage, the asphalt of an alleyway, and the shaving mirror from my shower. They were combined in layers, using whatever blend modes looked interesting. I built the focus around the the stairwell picture, which would probably make a decent picture in its own right.  I'll try to get the  Blackbird  and  Untitled  stuff online tonight.

Maybe we could each try some things and then exchange in a format that can be built upon. This idea can be applied to writing as well, like we've talked about.  Tyson Shareholders went quite well.

      Alright guys, I'm not usually one to get upset by crap like  urlLink this  but CBS and their executives are going too far. It seems they have forgotten about the equal opportunity for every American to speak their mind. And CBS is regulating it on a national and sometimes global scale. Once you have enough pent-up anger - send them an  urlLink email  and let them know that they and the rest of the Republicans are screwing their fellow Americans.  Here is an example of what I sent them:   The CBS executives must have their hands deep into the Presidents pockets in order to justify such a double-standard, which is becoming more prominent as Election Day nears. As such a large part of the national media, it is your responsibility to be a steward of the airwaves and ensure that all people can voice their opinions - which is a right of the American people. Your refusal to run the MoveOn Voters Fund "Childs Pay" ad while running and ad for George Bush's Presidential campaign is a slap in the face of all Americans and their right to speak freely. Furthermore, if your network runs Bush's Medicare ad - which is full of lies - then by default, you must run competing ads which portray the truth. Don't be a platform for a failed and corrupted presidency.  Heath Kuszak Jackson, Wyoming  Get Proactive!!

      I like it. Of course, like you say, it all depends on the writing whether it's Hemmingway-esque or a bad episode of  Saved by the Bell . I'll reserve judgement until then.  I think this group could very much understand the characters and the situation. While I wouldn't say any of us have been there, I think we could all imagine it quite readily.  It's also a very realistic concept in that the production requirements are minimal. Dialogue, location establishing shots, no effects. Unfortunately, the quality of the final product would almost entirely rest on the ability (and confidence) of the actors we had.  As a realistic show piece it would need to fall into the sub-twenty minutes category, which it sounds as if that's where you'd be aiming. This would land it cleanly in the "shorts" category of most film festivals (I'm sure that was your plan).  In regards to flashbacks: personally, I love playing with temporal structure and am envious of directors who do it masterfully. Obviously our past efforts have specifically been built around that concept. While we don't want to go overboard, it'd be fun to break away from the normal by playing an interesting twist on flashbacks.

      Howdy all!  After several false starts, I'm off and running on the 35mph blog!  More grabass from my blog, which is grabass from life as a grad student.    Alright...here's my life, and here's what I would like to do.  I graduate in May, pass through NWArk beginning of June, and then spend June and July teaching creative writing to high schoolers in Kansas.  After that, I've got no job, but lots of plans.  If I find work between now and then, I'll probably have a week or two to dick around, but if not, the tentative plan is for me to pull up in Fayetteville for a month or six weeks, and try to find some part-time work in production...work some commercial shoots or try to find a film in the area to PA for.    I also want to make a film, and since this is up and established and looking for work, here's my pitch.     Log Line  - A recent college graduate and his drug addict friend take one last road trip through their home state, before the addict unwittingly begins drug rehab.     Story  - Matt, a college grad, heads out to Nashville to start a job and find his life.  With him is Dennis, his oldest friend, who plans to start anew in Nashville again.  But Matt plans a stop in Little Rock to take the unaware Dennis to drug rehab.  The film chronicles the drive, and acts as a Hemingway short story, where they talk about everything but the problem that they both know is a wedge between them.    We're looking at 10-12 minutes, mostly taking place along I-40 as I see it, with the possibility of flashbacks...but flashbacks have the ability to take serious topics and turn them schmaltzy, and I'm interested in chronicling friendship rather than drug addiction...Matt believes this is their last road trip, as everything will be different once Dennis starts rehab.  And he's correct.  The quesiton at the crux of this -- how would you say goodbye to a friend?  I'm working out first draft in my spare time, and wrestling questions about how to make this a drama of the mind rather than an after-school special (which it could easily tend towards if not kept in check).  So that's that.  If it sounds interesting, let me know.  If not, I've got another short that could be easier to film.

      Excellent stuff, Bennett. Photoshop would definitely make it easier. But it never hurts to get your hands dirty. Sometimes the ease of Photoshop let's you fly by the better options.

Right now it's just fragments of photographs placed on white poster board. It took a few hours to do and I think I'll do it in Photoshop next time. The flash on my camera and a much too wide lens combined to make the thing look contorted and blown out. The lines are straight in real life.

      Sorry I haven't posted much lately. I've been smashed at work with a full plate. Just a bit of info...  For most of February I was traveling around the country talking to publishers about our latest tech,  urlLink RenderWare4 . It's something we've had in development for over two years now, and it still has another year before it will be finished. It's aimed at the next generation of video game consoles (PlayStation3, Xbox2) and is a complete re-write of everything we currently offer. Really cool shit and it's leaving a lot of people speechless.  March was pretty packed as well. I was at home in the office, but there were a lot of distractions. I've been working with a 3D tools company,  urlLink Alias , makers of the modelling package Maya, to create a "cinematic real-time" demo for current and next generation hardware. It's been really cool. I believe I've mentioned it before. I was working with art production house  urlLink MondoMedia , who famously have worked on the cinematics for a recent James Bond game,  urlLink 007: Nightfire .  The first milestone for our demo was GDC (which took place last week) and I only got the final artwork the Friday before. Needless to say I spent several long nights over the weekend working on this (until 4am Sunday morning and 5am Monday morning) because I had to get on a plane 930am Monday morning. Unfortunately, I didn't get it as far as I wanted to (just the environments were rendering, none of the characters or special effects). Needless to say, I was a bit wasted at the end of the day Monday after nearly 48 hours without a single full nights sleep.  Going on in parallel with the demo at work was  urlLink SXSW  at home. Elizabeth and I (as well some friends of ours, Ben and Jenny) picked up film passes. There were definitely soom good flicks and I wasn't disappointed with anything we saw. One of the highlights was  urlLink Bush's Brain  which we were at the world premiere of.   urlLink GDC (the Game Developer's Conference)  was last week. Pretty cool stuff. We were one of the most dominant forces there with a huge presence on the show floor and meetings with most of the top movers and shakers in the industry.  But beyond the business stuff, the week was quite interesting in the "after hours" scene. To kick things off, Sony hosted an invite-only party Wednesday night. I was lucky that my Sony meeting was during the day Wednesday so I was able to get a ticket. The party kicked off as a fairly standard one: more free alcohol than is healthy, a huge assorment of food and a very decent club DJ on the turntables. They had some interesting big-screen visuals with the music, most of them tape loops of random things. The night got really interesting when the main act came on.  urlLink The Crystal Method . These guys can put on a helluva show, even though it's just two guys who look like they just arrived from watching football/soccer game down at the local pub. The show was awesome. I was about five feet from the stage and the music was about as loud as I can ever remember music being. I'm worried that I may have potentially vibrated my organs into different positions with their ultra-low bass beats. I didn't have my camera with me, but a friend did and he promised to forward his pics. If you check out their website linked above, under the photo sections, there are some pics from their recent LOB tour where they stopped off in Austin (for SXSW) and the setup looked pretty similar.  The next night had two big headliner parties, one at the "cocktail hour" and the other post-dinner. The first was put on by Criterion (that's me) and Sammy Studios, a big Japanese video game maker who's been building a big American precense (the US division is a customer of ours). The second party was Microsoft's Xbox party: Risque Cafe. Unfortunately, Microsoft is not quite as good at throwing parties as Sony. I guess Sony has all of these bands on their payroll (Sony Music, Columbia), whereas Microsoft does not. They just had a DJ (but of course had the required copious alcohol and food). They did have freshly hand-rolled cigars, though because it's California, you had to head outside to smoke them (where you couldn't take your drinks -- tough choice for some!). They also had free massages, etc. I hung out for an hour or so shooting the shit with a friend while we finished our cigars then I hit the road for the evening.  So, that's what I've been up to. I'm about to dig into doing my taxes. How fun. Mr. Rolin Moe has asked to join our little blog to present an idea, so I've invited him to join. Rolin, take it away...

      I shot three commercials on Monday. It was "run and gun" all day long, but we shot inside a Lasik surgery clinic for eye correction. It was quite interesting and gave me an opportunity to experience fitting the gear for a full production into a tiny space. We also used some creative light tricks to enhance the color of the lasers and such. It was a really fun shoot.  I also may be able to do a little traveling soon. I have lots of loose ends to tie up first, but everyone else at work is done with their vacations, so maybe I could take a little time off soon. Let me know of anything in your respective locations that would be exciting and cool. This doesn't apply to CJ, as I know what is going on here all too well.

      Well, its been a while -- regardless, I have some news that may be of interest to everyone. A new film festival -- likened to the Sundances, Tellurides, and Cannes of the film world -- is springing legs in Jackson Hole. Called the  urlLink Jackson Hole Film Festival , it is going to bring top notch indie features and shorts to Teton County, Wyoming. All just in time for the Fall "off-season" -- which won't be an off-season anymore if this thing sticks around. I plan to attend and probably volunteer.

      There shouldn't be any difference between expensive and cheap cards, except maybe additional features and additional firewire ports. Speed also shouldn't be an issue as most cameras can only transmit over firewire while playing back, so it's single-speed anyway.  The biggest difference is usually whether or not the card also supports other types of capture, or if it can support multiple firewire devices (my old one had three firewire plugs, my new one has two). There's also a new FireWire800, which is twice as fast as standard firewire and supports cable lengths up to 100 meters. It'll probably be useful for HD signals.

      Firewire is definitely going to be the best way to go for video. It'll come out of the camera in a lossless fashion, and at a fairly fast rate.  If your computer doesn't have a firewire port then you'll need to buy a firewire card. Should be in the ballpark of $50 - $75, and they usually come with some simple video editing software (similar to iMovie, which is what we used to edit  Untitled ).  You can also get 30-day evaluations of Adobe After Effects (motion graphics, think Photoshop for animation/video) and Adobe Premiere Pro (which is essentially the 7.0/CS version of Premiere). The 30-day evaluations are fully functional with no strings attached.  If you want, I can dump all of the Untitled stuff (and Blackbird) onto a DVD and send it your way. Does your PC have a DVD-ROM? If not I'd have to send it on Digital8.

      I haven't had the time or inspiration to work on the short I pitched you all earlier, but I've got several first draft shorts written that might suffice for production without requiring driving shots.     urlLink Music Short Film  (approx. 3 min)  urlLink Relationship Drama Short Film  (approx. 9 min)  urlLink Character Drama Short Film  (approx. 11 min)  The first is a short I wrote for the Coca Cola Student Filmmakers scholarship, required to be shot in 50 seconds and deal with the movies.  I thought it was very good, but the content might not be family appropriate.    The second is a short I developed last year, under the question "How can you love two people at the same time?"  Not a whole lot of people I've shown it to have understood it as I want, but I think it would be interesting on film.    The last one is a recent project, based on a moment in Harold Pinter's  The Dumbwaiter .  I finished the first draft tonight, in lieu of working on my thesis feature, due to inspiration and a recent harnekning to the opera  Faust .  There are a few character issues, and the turning point might not come off as strong as I hope.    Read 'em.  See if you like the general idea of the story.  If one of these stands out, we can try to adopt it as a summer project...do a few rewriters, work out equipment and production.  The first and last could be shot in one night, albeit a long night.  The second one would require two or three days of shooting.    And be honest in your criticism.  These are first drafts, so they aren't meant to be perfect, but if something isn't working, it won't get better if you don't bring it up.

      I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll get a nice graduation bonus from some family members come May.  If it happens, I'll probably invest it into an XL-1 (selling for $2G on ebay these days, including XLR adaptor and other periphials), as my career plan is to write screenplays and shoot documentaries.  Regardless, if we've got a camera body (whether it be one we own or one we rent), borrowing lenses shouldn't be a problem...it might be the only thing that my UT film degree will come in handy for (getting free shit in Arkansas).    My thoughts on the car were either an old beast wagon, kind of like the one I used to drive...or something like the Suburban that Chris Cousins flipped in Alma.  But it doesn't matter...it's basically what we can get our hands on.  I'll write it as a Volvo, if only because it'll be more visual on the page.    And I won't worry about car shots.  Sounds like we've got it under control.  I'll just write it to write it and leave the logistics to the professionals.    I've shot a few films in my day, so I've got a pretty good heads up on sync sound and lighting technique.  And I've got a pretty broad stage theatre background, as far as actors are concerned.  That being said, as the writer, I will leave camera angles and cinematography and director's intent and really everything past original story completely to the board of supervisors.  Nothing worse than a writer/director auture.    Timetable (because it never hurts to think about it early) for me - in Arkansas June 1 to 8 for pre-production meetings.  Then in Arkansas August 1 to ??? (probably Labor Day at the latest), for time to shoot everything.  My presence is not imperative, but I wanted those who live out of Rogers to know what my schedule was in case we want to coordinate.

      First: I may have access to the Canon GL-2 through the summer.  Otherwise, I could borrow an XL-1s from work (if I leave my soul as a deposit.)  Second: My first ideas for shots called for camera vehicle driving next to subject vehicle. Though we couldn't do this for the whole film, it could look nice. I believe my Cherokee would support a camera man and equipment on it's roof if we make some sort of platform to stand on. This could provide for some neat and cheap driving shots.  Third: I just inherited $5,000. This is not a joke. Though a lot of it is spoken for, I will entertain ideas for 35MPH investments. I have purchased a nice tripod and a fluid head. I don't know if we're ready to invest in a camera, but I've already mentioned options for that.  I'm extremely excited about this.

      how about this... we find a car - preferably one of those old boats that our parents / grandparents drove back in the day - that has a massive dashboard clearance from the windshield. Enough to get the lens of the camera (another good question, what camera?) 1.5 to 2 feet away from the subjects and then use a fisheye lens to capture all of the in-car dialogue between both front seats. This might be a cool effect and would also allow us to show what's going on in the periphery (passing cars, etc.) while going at real speeds - maybe not 70 mph but not 35 either.   What sort of vehicle did you have in mind, Rolin?

      After watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind again, there might be a good way to incorporate the flashbacks into something like this.    I'm a writer, and I think specifically in the story...what steps do we take to evoke the wanted feeling, plotwise?  How that is directed doesn't matter to me, but looking at how you'd shoot a story like this, it would be best for us to spend as much time out of the car as possible, mainly because we don't have the production mechanism to shoot many driving shots.  We can shoot the driver very easy, but if they both sit in the front seat, that's a bitch to shoot, and if one sits in the back, capturing both in the frame is a bitch as well.  Hollywood rigs the camera up afront the car (or on a trailer behind), and we could do something like that (more back-window shooting rather than rigging, and knowing how bumpy that damn road is...), but it would involve going 35mph in the right lane.  Passing cars would kill the idea that we're going faster than we are.    So flashbacks might be the best way to go with this.  I can write it two ways...idea would be that we film the best written one, but hopefully the easy one to film is as good as the more difficult one.    As far as actors, I have no clue.  I don't know any real actors in the area.  I'm sure we could grab a few UA students to do it.  I don't mind working in-house, but the two main roles would be best done with professionals. Putting ourselves in such a project is best reserved for cameos, so we can focus on production measures.    I'll start drawing things out over the next few weeks, starting with a character sketch, then outline, and finally draft.

      Hey there, sorry I haven't posted in so long, been real busy at work.  As you can see, there's a new look to the site and a lot of new features. Well, I guess two new features: comments and profiles. These are new features of Blogger. Blogger has been revamped. Much cooler, check it out. They've also added some new templates, this being one of them. I may tweak it up a bit given the time. If anyone has any suggestions let me know.  I've also updated  urlLink TroyGilbert.com  similarly. Check it out as well.  I encourage everyone to update their profile with some info. And also start adding titles to their blog posts (if you want to).  Cheers!

      In case you guys haven't checked your e-mail or seen  urlLink my blog  (recently updated the look)...  BTW, I'm transferring the domain names to another registrar. No changes at all on the site end (still the same servers), but there may be a 24-48 hour period where the site goes down as the name records are updated. Of course, anything *.35mph.com would be affected, so e-mail would be out for a while as well. It's likely not even going to register anything since the actual servers don't change.

      So, as a working title, we'll call it the  Labor Day Project.   To get the most work done, we're going to need to enlist local professionals. Well, at least local top-ranked amateurs. Okay, okay... locals I happen to know! Elizabeth will of course assist in any way she can. Additionally, a guy I work with is interested, Ben, and his girlfriend Jenny would probably be interested as well (particularly if Elizabeth was participating). Both of them have art degrees so their interests definitely line up with our needs.  That brings our potential crew to:   Heath, Ben and myself  Elizabeth and Jenny (if we need them)  Bennett and Rolin (and Chuck?) if you guys can be here   That's between 3 and 8 people. That's a good size crew and would be very, very cool to have all of that input.  Now, onto what we're going to do...  Well, I don't have an answer, but I have a suggestion (sorry, this is a style suggestion not an actual plot suggestion). Along the lines of what I was mentioning previously about mixing medias and techniques, animation, live action, etc.  The drawback of video is that, well, it looks like video. Not so much of a problem these days as people are getting used to it, and video can be treated on the computer to look much nicer anyway. But, what I'd love to do would be to work in a format with a higher resolution than video. While we can't afford film, we can maybe approach that quality level through some clever combinations of tech that we can afford.  I think we're all familiar with digital cameras. Even my simple digital camera can take very high-res pics (4+ megapixels), and Bennett likely has access to cameras that can take both incredible pictures and high-res (6+ megapixels). Compare this to video, which is in the ballpark of 1 megapixel.  One technique I've been wanting to experiment with is mixing animation with photographic sources. This is called rotoscoping. Rotoscoping basically involves taking some source live action footage (film, video) and then drawing over each frame. See  Waking Life  for an example of this (and see previous posts on the subject). What I'm proposing is not exactly the same, but its close.  Using a digital camera, you snap a high-res picture of your location. You then video your actors doing the scene. In post-production, you take your high-res picture and clean it up, color balance it, whatever (give it a painterly effect, apply special effects, whatever you want in photoshop). You then take the video and rotoscope the characters. For the rotoscoping, you use something like a Wacom tablet and trace each frame of video to whatever detail is desired. You can then toss the video and drop the rotoscoped characters onto your clean backdrop.  This should give a very interesting look that combines realistic backdrops with very dynamic, organic actors that are hand-drawn animated. I'm going to try to do a simple test this weekend to see how this looks.  Some advantages of this approach:   It's unique, thus it instantly makes whatever we make stand out from the crowd of amateur shorts out there.  It improves the quality of what we can produce. It should provide much sharper, cleaner visuals than video because we can essentially work at film (or at least HD) resolutions. Also, the result is never compressed significantly so the colors all remain pure and sharp.  Because it is already very manipulated, we can manipulate it much further without it looking like a bad special effect. You can make an animated character "explode" and it look "correct" in the character's world; if I have live action footage and try to make a character explode it would require very polished special effects to not be distracting.  It opens up a wide spectrum of shorts we could possibly make. Because the result is so stylized, it begs that you use it on very stylized material, i.e. fantasy, sci-fi, psychadelia, Twilight Zone kinda things, comedies, anything you can imagine as a cartoon.   So, just throwing that idea out there. I understand if everyone would prefer to do something a bit more traditional. I'd also understand if you guys think this may be too ambitious. But, considering how often we seriously do this stuff I'm tending to go whole hog on this...  And finally, my actual project suggestion if we wanted to go with a technique like above: what about doing something based on the work of HP Lovecraft? A modern interpretation, maybe?  Just a thought...  Okay, quickly, be...  *bzzzt*   ... damn, didn't finish the post before my battery died (I'm sitting at a conference in Seattle on making Windows games). But, fortunately, a power-outlet was nearby.  Let me know what you guys think!

      Ok, so things shuffled around a bit on Thursday, but here's finalized information for my new residence and phone.   Bennett Ryel (my name is still the same)  506 N. Oak St.  Little Rock, AR ?????   501 .351.0745   Labor Day: I'm not sure yet what my schedule will look like then, but the Austin Cram Session is my FIRST priority.   Story Ideas: this idea has popped into my head a few times in the last few years. Imagine a near-future society where a pill has been developed to allow humans to digest and break down fiber molecules into glucose. Entire nations of people with access to this pill could take it every morning and then munch on grass, cardboard or even notebook paper for their nouishment.

      The time is nearing, folks. We really have to do something meaningful and productive because, if we don't, 35mph will turn into 0mph. So, excuse me if I am taking liberties here Troy, this coming Labor Day weekend a 35mph rendezvous will occur in Austin, TX. The proverbial ball has almost stopped rolling and we need to get it moving again. Anyone who is interested - Rolin?! - is welcome but come prepared to have ideas flushed out and be ready to work.   Cake Please!

      I recently encountered a long lost friend. Kylie Neal came up to Rogers from her home in Little Rock to visit me and we began dating (I'm bad with the titles, but I think that's what you call it.) I also have started playing music with Jackson Jennings at Club Frisco on Friday nights, as well as random weeknights when we feel inspired. Both of these offer an outlet of sorts for my restless mind. If any of you are in the neighborhood on Friday nights, stop by and say hello to the band and to Kylie, who usually hides from her degree-having, good-job-working, financially stable life at my no-cable having, crap-job-working, starving-wannabe-artist-poorass apartment. I hope you all are well. By the way, if you haven't checked out Hunter's website, you should. Mad Props to H.Mack. Word.

      Ok, so the first week of August is almost over. Labor Day weekend is going to come chugging around the corner before we know it. I think that we need to pick a story fairly soon and go with it so we can start brainstorming how and where and what to shoot for this thing. Rolin and Troy have mentioned that they both have some ideas on where to start in terms of translating a HP Lovecraft , William Gibson or Richard Powers work into a short. I think everyone involved (that is, three or four of us) should be able to agree on one of these and begin to develop ideas on how we can make it into a 35mph Production.  And as far as I know a preliminary head count for that weekend - someone correct me if I'm wrong - Myself, Troy, Bennett.  Rolin - will you be there? What about CJ? Who else? I guess we shouldn't have too many people...thoughts?

      Flipping around late last night after another strong episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, I noticed that freedom fighter Nelson Mandela has  urlLink publicly condemned George Bush  and his penchant for war with Iraq.  But even better is Ari Fleischer's  urlLink comment  that "there are people comfortable doing nothing" to fight for what Bush referred to on Tuesday as "the freedom of the Iraqi people."    Forgive me if I'm wrong, for as an English undergrad I always assumed that Nuculah was in fact supposed to be Nuclear (but since my omnipotent president says otherwise, I better get in line), but I seem to remember that Mandela spent nearly 30 years in prison because he fought for the freedom of the undermined peoples of a governmental regime that slaughtered their own people.  And I also seem to remember that Ronald Reagan made no effort to help Mandela's fight, even though Reagan's country had aboloshed discriminatory laws in the 1960s.  And considering George Bush was recently described as  Reagan's Heir , I have a hard time believing that Bush is all too knowledgable of Mandela's willingness to  urlLink fight the bad guys .    Here's a thought...maybe Iraq isn't such a threat after all.  I'm not a Hussein apologist, but I am definitely in the camp of "Why should I need to be sold on something, unless it never really was a threat in the first place?"  In other fun political news, I watched enough of the  urlLink State of the Union  to be sick; it always brings me joy to see that politicians are A+ students in shameless pandering.  What was arguably worse, though, was NBC News' idea to hold a Republican Focus Group after the speech, gathering the all-important Everyman Republican Response from the people.  There wasn't much time, so the moderator asked everyone in the group to say two words that best illustrated Bush's speech.  My favorites:      - Corageous Determinism      - Inspired Vernacular      - SmokingGun Provided (they were only allowed two words, so I'm guessing this is how she fudged it) My choice on the matter is frowned upon by my web server, so I'll  urlLink link  to a search on the words, and let you figure it out.

      Saw the RISK footage this afternoon...  All in all, nothing to hang your hat over.  But it wasn't what I was looking for.  I knew the sound would be tough, but we can sync sound with image, so no one knows the difference much of the time.  The problem is, you need footage to sync sound with...an image of Dan Wearsch contemplating a move works well with the voices of JW and Philbrook.  Unfortunately, we have very little stock footage of player close-ups...it's mostly mid-range stuff, which includes too many people milling about, so you have Rachel Day in the background for one picture, and then you cut to something else, and you come back and Rachel is gone.  It doesn't sync well.  So we're going to have to take what we have and turn it into something.  Brian Thomas and I will work on this with our free time over the next few months.  Everyone is welcome to come to Austin, view a bit of footage, and tell us what we should focus on when making this film.  We hope to be done by the end of April!  Nailed the job interview.

      It's funny how personal life situation dictates the stress involved in a job interview.  I'm interviewing today at some place in South Austin that does City of Austin web design...I couldn't tell you what the job exactly is, how much it pays, or who I'd be working for if I get it.  And that is because I don't really care.  Yes, I want the job, but it's not that big a deal if I get it or not...I'm fine on money; this would just help get me to Europe for a few weeks this summer.  But comparing this upcoming interview to previous interviews in Austin, I see a huge difference.  I used to go to bed early the night before an interview, get all nervous in the morning, drive out, sit in the waiting area, heart pounding, chest pumping, deep breaths not soothing...once called into play, I'd try to make small talk and nice jokes, but I was nervous and I was desperate...canned chunk tuna was wearing me out.  Of all the interviews I held in Austin, only one went really well; it was September 13, 2001, and I was the first interview after the terrorist attacks for a conference coordinator/tech support position at the UT Pickle Center.  We talked for over an hour about all sorts of things, and the whole thing was at ease; the job was kind of out of my league, so I didn't really strive for it.  Anyway, I got the second interview, and I did well with that, but they ended up scrapping the position because most conferences cancelled after September 11, so the job was redundant.  It would've been $2500/mo and free tuition at UT.  Poo.  For your viewing pleasure, an indication of how  urlLink desperate I was .  Pay close attention to a young Dan Wearsch, in a happy place, before elongated exile from Overland Park embittered his already charred soul.   urlLink Bottle Rocket  is playing at the Union Theatre tonight; free for UT students.  However, Almodovor's  urlLink Talk to Her  is not, though it was advertised at Dobie on Saturday.  Does this mean I settle for  urlLink Nicholas Nickelby , solidifying my place as the gayest straight man ever?  Of course, to be honest to other gay straight men, I did not enjoy  urlLink Yentl ,  urlLink Sordid Lives , or  urlLink Xanadu .  Btw, if you ever want to see how NOT to reference classical art or literature in popular media, look no further than Tina Howe's wretched script  urlLink ">Costal Disturbances , a pointless romp on a beach of broken hearts and apathetic audiences which threw in a meaningless ode to Coleridge's  urlLink Kubla Khan ...no, no... urlLink Dr. Havird  would not be pleased...

      Sad news for me and few others outside of San Diego...Southern Southern California's most notable sports commentator, Ted Leitner, was  urlLink relieved of his duties  at KFMB Television & Radio.  Leitner not only was the evening sportscaster for the station (as he had been since 1978), but he also did the morning talk show on the AM affiliate, as well as the play-by-play for the San Diego Chargers.  It is tought to imagine this split as amicable in any way, considering  urlLink KFMB  has no mention of Leitner on their website; his presence has already been erased, and no memorial exists.  For those who care, Leitner and the head of KFMB, Ed Trimble, had several shouting matches during the last 12 months, after Trimble fired several employees in an attempt to break the station's union workers.  Leitner is an avid liberal and steadfast supporter of unions, doing commercials for trade unions and speaking at rallies in his spare time.    I grew up listening to Leitner do the sports on the old Hudson & Bauer show at 7:15 am; it was rarely sports, and usually a funny anecdote about the family or something going on in life.  In the 80s and early 90s, Leitner was on top of the sportscasting world, providing a fresh approach to what most considered a serious topic.  However, in the age of Fox Sports and the Jim Rome-inspired shock jock, Leitner comes off as a curmudgeon...while Jim Rome boosts his ego by blasting others, Leitner tells stories and talks about the world...it's harmless, but today it sounds like he's just stroking his ego because he likes to hear himself talk.  And I'm sure he does...he had a talk show in his last few years with KFMB.  The good news in all of this is that Leitner will continue to be the color commentator for the  urlLink San Diego Padres , which will aggrivate many die-hard Padres fans who aren't interested in Leitner's famed question, "What'cha do today, Colonel?"  But I'll smile.  Dammit, I'll smile!  Jimmy Kimmel was much better...he finally felt comfortable on-stage it seemed.  When Al Michaels came on and interacted with the likes of 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, and The Rock, I think Kimmel realized he could too.  And he was funny...hopefully he'll forget that he's the host and instead just try to have fun with the schtick.  The Milk & Cookies gag could've been funny if Kimmel had played it right...but that just takes time.  Ask  urlLink Harry Anderson .  Too bad Austin airs him at 1:00 am, most likely because their syndicated contract with eXtra is too important to move.    My addiction to  Joe Millionaire  is more serious than I first imagined.  At least I haven't bought the authentic  urlLink Celebrity Mole Journal  yet.  Yet.

      I must admit I was pretty disappointed with ABC's new late-night offering,  urlLink Jimmy Kimmel Live .  This is too bad, because I am a big fan of Kimmel's work from  Win Ben Stein's Money , and especially his friend Adam Carolla of  urlLink Loveline  fame.  Kimmel was incredibly nervous; his best moment was an ad-lib of a Jon Gruden interview gone wrong, and the only saving grace of the show was an inspired performance by  Coldplay .  The guests got little love, things ran on and on and on...this is stuff that gets fixed over time.  But Kimmel didn't look comfortable...it wasn't him.  The guy sitting at the desk looked like a mindless schmuck forced to ask questions and play host...if this is the Jimmy Kimmel show, I want to see the fool-hearted, dirty comedian, not a puppet dabbling in risque topics.  Hopefully he loosens up.  Otherwise, it's back to Page 2 for Bill Simmons.    Of course, the true disappointment of this week is that a friend is taping  urlLink Joe Millionaire  for me to watch after I get out of my night class.  This is so I can watch the show rather than hear who he kicks off...nothing worse than that morning cooler commentary of something you missed.  But that I would even regret missing this show is throwing into serious consideration my stature as someone worth knowing.    Saw an interesting film this week:  urlLink The Trial of Henry Kissinger .  The movie makes the same case that the book of the same name makes; that diplomat and 60s cosmopolitan Henry Kissinger should be brought up in front of an international tribunal for war crimes; the overarching theme resonates that Americans should not live a life without responsibility where they can act one way and not have to pay for it.  The movie is pretty tame by my standards, but that makes sense, considering Kissinger doesn't get out much these days, so editors were forced to use stock footage from the 60s and voice-overs of Kissinger cabinet members and journalists.  Imagine trying to get Kissinger to help you film this:    "Henry?  Hey, this is Eugene Jarecki from the BBC."   "Hello Eugene."   "Hey, I was wondering if you could help me out a bit.  Some friends and I are putting together a documentary where we investigate your role in the Nixon and Ford administrations as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State."   "Is that true?"   "Why yes it is. We want to show how you helped facilitate an extra five years of the Vietnam War in order to gain political clout, as well as bomb a neutral country, sell arms to a country you knew was going to slaughter hundereds of thousands of its own citizens, and pave the way for a coup against a country whose government in power posed no threat to the United States."   "That sounds interesting."   "The goal of this is to show that you are no different from Augusto Pinochet (the man you brought to power in Chile), Idi Amin, or Slobodon Milosevic.  We hope that this will spur you to be brought up on charges of war crimes in front of an international tribunal."     "Well, I am busy this week.  Perhaps lunch at the Johnny Rockets off 42nd next Tuesday?"   "Great.  See you at noon."  My father used to regail me with many a story about Henry Kissinger, and his red-eye flights around the world, all in the name of diplomacy.  This man was a hero, what men were made of, he was a throwback to a better day.  And he had a Monty Python song written about him.  I am quite sure that my dad would find the notion of Kissinger a criminal as preposterous.  And so does Kissinger.  Kissinger says that he bombed Cambodia because it was under the auspices of North Vietnam (not true), that he had nothing to do with the rise to power of Augusto Pinochet, and that his double-agent tactics cost the US and Vietnam a peace treaty in 1968.  But at the same time, my dad would say to me that he is not an alcoholic.  Who do I believe:  the man himself, who speaks in the interest of self-preservation, or those who worked with him and thus saw his motives first-hand?

      I watched two films yesterday... urlLink Adaptation  and  urlLink Clubbing .   Adaptation  is screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's new vehicle, in which the protagonist is a Charlie Kaufman, who is struggling with adapting Susan Orlean's award-winning novel  urlLink The Orchid Thief .  Kaufman's inclusion of a Kaufman character in the script reminds me of Richard Powers' use of himself as the protagonist in  urlLink Galatea 2.2 , one of the best books no one has read.  The inclusion of self in work creates an obvious calamity for the general reader, as we don't know whether to read this as autobiographical or fiction...though when is an author writing a removed work?    That question begs greater discussion, but I'm interested in comparing Kaufman's work to my work in  Clubbing ...this is my blog, and if I want to hoist my ego to the roofbeams, by damned I will do it.  In no way am I comparing myself to Kaufman as a writer...in fact, walking out of  Adaptation , I felt about as insignificant as any artist could possibly imagine... Adaptation  was a screenplay rich with conundra and discrepancy, and it was so much the better for being unique...the voice of the author was heard, and not because he was a character in the script; Kaufman took an idea and, working within the parameters of screenwriting, fucked with the parameters enough to let something new be shown.    I just finished a 30 page paper on the subject of originality in screenwriting, and its effect on women's empowerment in the film industry...while the essay was a feminist critique of the traditional Hollywood structure, it was evident that I was displeased with the state of affairs in screenwriting as perpetuated by Syd Field, Robert McKee, and Lew Hunter, among others.  However, looking back over my most recent work, I am dismayed to see that I wrote a script rich with ideas and barren of originality.  In order to appease the masses, I compromised my voice (a voice I am unsure of) and worked within a format rather than even trying to see how much the walls of Bob Foshko would give.  My screenplay is adequate; with several basic revisions I could probably sell the thing, but it's naked.  In fostering to a commercial public, I stripped  Three Strikes  of any authentic voice.    The last piece I wrote that was true to myself was  Clubbing , an 11 minute film about the fear of venturing outside walls and comfort zones, and the fear that even at a young age, your best days might be behind you.  The film was a triumph in being produced, edited, and shown at festival, but in all honesty, about 40% of what I felt the script was about was portrayed adequately on-screen, due to a combination of problems facing a new filmmaker.  But the script was fresh; it was exciting; it was my work.  After seeing the final result and the tepid audience response, I feared that I made a mastubatory piece, and vowed to work for my audience rather than myself.  From that moment, I lost my voice.  The piece of work that got me into school here,  Questions , had about 20 minutes of authentic, good writing...most dealing with an opening sequence and the vivid imagination of the supporting character Cameron.  The more recent  Three Strikes  employs some great tactics, and follows film rules as they should be...but there is something missing.  But I don't lose sleep over it, and I think that is the problem.    The most ambitious work I ever wrote was a poem about salvation via oral sex...it didn't happen the way I wanted, but I was 19, I had lots of time.  The most compelling work I ever wrote was a poem entitled  Lighting , using theatrical effects to convey a sense of anomie in my inability to get close to a girl.  Good, but the subject seems trite.  The best overall piece I've written would be  Three Strikes , but it isn't compelling, it isn't ambitious...it isn't what I'm interested in writing.  The script interests me...I've thought over that script for years, but now that it's done, it looks like something I could see on the USA network, or that spends six weeks in the theatre and gets one thumb up, one thumb down, and puts my name on the map so I can get a job writing for Tom Arnold's next failed sitcom.    An interesting anecdote regarding James Joyce...when he was writing  urlLink Dubliners , a friend came by and asked him how the writing was going.  "Good, good," said Joyce.  "I got a lot of good work done today." "How much did you get done?" "Two words." The friend paused.  "Two words?"  he said.  "That doesn't sound like a good day's work." "Ahhh," said Joyce, "they were two beautiful words." I wrote ten pages of my most recent work,  Faith  in 90 minutes on Monday.  Needless to say, it sucks.

      A few interesting articles in UT's  urlLink campus paper  today...one regarding the  urlLink MLK vandalism  and campus efforts to solve the problem of racism.  There was also a letter to the editor that unknowingly illustrates  urlLink white privilege  (at the bottom of the page).    I worry about writing these things, because it is difficult not to come off as insensitive.  I am a supporter of tolerance, and will verbally challenge any discrimination that I am privy to or even see on the street; few things upset me more than a barbed comment based on nothing more than a generic stereotype.  But the idea that we can teach kindness like we teach algebra is beyond me.  The campus is currently looking over initiatives to combat racial prejudice; one of them is education.    When I used to write debate cases in high school, we would often tie education to our solvency; we'd state the problem, why it was a big problem, and then we'd say that we would educate people in order to change the problem.  Since it was such a vague statement, it gave us a lot of leeway when negative teams would attack the idea of education.  "How can you be against education?" I remember saying many a time to a acne-stricken adolescent standing in a tan suit on the other side of a table.  Did I ever bother to think of how education would solve the problem?  No...because I never honestly thought it could, I only thought it sounded good.  Education initiatives often involve nothing more than pamphlets and rallies; pamphlets get thrown away, people don't go to the rallies.  Some people keep the pamphlets, and some people attend the rallies, but often they're the people that would've been there anyway, not the ones you are reaching out to.    I feel like most activists are into activism to feel better rather than change the world...I'm not naive enough to believe that the two are not mutually exculsive, so I understand that both are important byproducts.  But why stop at a rally?   urlLink Cultural Feminism  still boggles my mind...I see the point of creating community and creating heroes in areas where women are underrepresented, akin to Dava Sobel's work in finding the letters of  urlLink Suor Maria Celeste  in publishing  urlLink Galileo's Daughter ...empowerment is the catalyst to change.  But I  urlLink still don't see  how people can be satisfied with only creating heroes.  Maybe I am a results-oriented person, and can't look at feeling better as enough of a goal...maybe I feel good enough as it is.  But I want to see results...I'm tired of seeing gender and racial injustice carried out implicitly in our society.  If carrying a sign and going to a march is going to help change policy and attitudes, then I'll pick up the standard.  But if it's going to just make me feel better while the problem continues to fester, I'll use my energy on something else.  So don't hand me a pamphlet or show me a public service announcement or coddle me by holding a small rally.  Create a movement, govern that movement, and write out goals and demands that you want to see changed in the status quo.  Hold the marches to get more people together, and make the goals broad and large enough that even if people don't agree with you 100%, you're all in favor of the general idea and not squibbling over minutae.  Then hold the biggest damn rally imaginable, and market it as the one rally...bring everyone together, get celebrities on board, and hold it.  Make a big splash...not a bunch of little ones.  Think about the movement, not the friends you might meet and weed you might smoke.    I'll tackle white privilege later...I'm sure it'll come up again.

      This email just came to my box:  >> > EMERGENCY RALLY AGAINST RACISM AT UT  >> >  >> > This morning - on MLK Day - the MLK statue on  >> > the East Mall of UT campus was defaced in an  >> > act of vandalism.  >> > This is a blantent act of rasicm that must not  >> > be tolerated.

All concerned students and members of  >> > the community are invited to attend.   I post this for several reasons: one, to encourage any Austinites to attend this rally...with the advent of the internet, protesters can now  urlLink communicate  with one another and make their message more powerful.  But also, I am interested in the author's ideas of using protest as a panacea for societal ills.    I am an artist, and as an artist, I feel I have a social obligation to discuss reality and the misperceptions that our societal institutions feed us on a daily basis...I color life a little darker, but I try to say that the facade of brightness is worse than an actuality that is just a bit darker.  Thus, my feature-length films are all dramatic; I only do comedy in short format (which should be a relief to many of my friends).  One of the issues I am facing at present is writing about the current political situation we are in today.  I hate American foreign policy, and I hate the plastic World's Police monogram we throw on everything, when in fact we're fighting for " our interests " rather than humanity (quick lesson - "our interests" does not have much to do with solving world hunger or other problems).  I am trying to come up with a screenplay idea that tackles the current state of issues in America and abroad, and being a 23 year old white male who has lived in the South for 10+ years, it is difficult to gain the adequate perspective.    So why am I about to bash protesters, when they are making a more conceited effort to do something than I am?  Because I see little change coming from the majority of protests issued.  This protest of the vandalism of the MLK statue (a beautiful  urlLink statue  near the East Lawn on campus) is fine in order to vent frustration and gain a sense of community, but to expect that the capture of the vandals will be aided by this rally is preposterous.  At a campus of over 50,000, it is more than likely that the perps will be caught, regardless of the rally staged.    I'm more than likely arguing semantics here, but I think it's important.  Protests rarely change anything.  The 1963  urlLink March on Washington  was a protest that helped spur the Supreme Court to come to action with Brown vs. Board of Education, and to me, that's how a protest should be done.  Make it a big deal, get the biggest names you can to speak, and hold it in one area and one area only: the Capitol Mall.  If there were a War on Terror protest in Washington, D.C., and heads of state and big-name activists would come to speak, I would pilgimmage to D.C. to see it, no doubt.  Sheer numbers speak to politicians and the media, not 200 people sauntering down a street, more interested in getting to know the folks next to them rather than stopping an injustice.    Protests are a way to spur community and vent frustration.  And there is nothing wrong with that; in fact, there is a lot right with that.  It's like me and this blog.  Would I like this blog to change the world?  Hell yes.  Will it?  No way.  It's my personal feelings, that might get famous someday and there might be a lot of hits to this site, but that is incredibly doubtful.  But, it makes me feel better, it makes me articulate myself, and for that it's a good thing.  Same thing with protests.  But if you want to change the world, you've got to work past the feeling of complacency that you get by writing a blog or marching in a rally.  Because when people think that they're solving the world by painting a sign, marching with 20 friends, and getting beers afterwards, that's a detriment to any movement...the protest is where the fight  begins ...much work is left to be done after everyone marches.    I was gonna bitch about being sick.  Oh well.

      I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong, and I was wrong about Jack Nicholson in  About Schmidt .  Jack's acting in the piece was incredibly stellar, and I thought he rose to the occasion even more than Brody possibly because his material wasn't as good (which brings to question how  About Schmidt  won Best Screenplay, but that argument is for another day), but even though I enjoyed  urlLink The Pianist  more, I can't complain about Jack winning the award.  Excellent performance.  And who wants to pass up a chance to see Kathy Bates naked?    I passed across a great, quite controversial website yesterday entitled  urlLink Black People Love Us .  The website is about two white suburbanites who are just loved by the black community; it includes testimonials from black friends (such as, "Sally is always trying to hook me up with black people from her work.  She knows that because I am black too, we must have a lot in common.") and pictures of the loved Johnny and Sally partying down with their black homies.  The site is an amazing critique on hegemonic racism in society; it deconstructs the idea that racism is a thing of the past, and that discrimination is no longer alive.  True, the facets are different, but  urlLink Richard Dyer  was right; white priviledge still exists, and those of us who benefit from it are often too naive to realize that we are benefitting at someone else's loss.    I truly believe that most people consciously don't want to succeed at the sake of others failing, but at the same time, no one wants to give up concessions in order to pull people up from the bottom.  For equality to honestly happen, whites must lose status rather than blacks gaining equal footing...the men in power will always think of ways to keep the Good Ol' Boys club in order, and pass the hand-outs to their friends.  Whether it is about race or if it's class I don't know...but no matter how scathing and sarcastic, Black People Love Us is definitely something to be studied.    Happy Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  I'm not a big fan of holidays, but anyone who has ever read  urlLink Letter from a Birmingham Jail  can see why this man got his own holiday.  There have been a lot of great fighters and martyrs in the Civil Rights Era, and MLK probably gets credit for the actions of many of them, but he is deserving of it.

      Looking over the winners at tonight's  urlLink Golden Globe Awards , I can't help but think that these awards are nothing but posturing by columnists to get in the good graces of A-list actors.  Now granted, Jack Nicholson is one hell of an actor; and granted, I haven't seen  urlLink About Schmidt  yet (I hear it's a great movie, and yes, I plan to get out to see it...tomorrow actually), but it is tough for me to believe that Nicholson could do as much with his character as Adrian Brody did with Wladyslaw Szpilman in  urlLink The Pianist  (and I'm not saying this because I saw Brody do a miserable turn in the equally miserable  urlLink Six Ways to Sunday ).  The Pianist  was the best Holocaust film I have ever seen; Brody's ability to capture the slow deconstruction from a well-to-do, misunderstood gentleman to a man without his mind, lost in a wasteland, holding a jar of pickles to be more sacred than anything else possible...it was the most gripping moment in the most gripping movie I've seen in ages, possibly ever.  However, I tend to believe that people are tired of the Holocaust, and that everyone wants Spielberg's  urlLink Schindler's List  to hold the title, and everything after it is just fighting for second place...including  urlLink Life is Beautiful .    Since this blog isn't about  The Pianist , I don't want to get too much into it, but I believe that it didn't win a Golden Globe and won't win an Oscar because in the end, there is no hero.  Oskar Schindler was a hero; he stars in a movie where we see someone working through the atrocities of one of the worst moments in the history of mankind; even though his country was on the side of evil, he fought for good.  The same can generally be said about Roberto in  Life is Beautiful ; a father working to make the Holocaust as care-free for his son is a man we can admire, so we leave the theatre on an up, in a movie that ends on a down.  However, no such hero exists in  The Pianist ; we want Spizlman to be that hero, but after missing the train to Auschwitz, his goal becomes to do nothing more to survive, and in fact we want him to do nothing more.  When he is given the choice to work for the Jewish Police, we want him to do it, even though we know he would thus be a tratior to his people, and it would just be an elongation of his imminent death sentence.  He grows old, frail, and tired in front of our eyes, and his weaknesses are evident, even though he is strong enough to stay alive.  Thus, when he survives, we are relieved, but cannot be excited; he is just one man who was as lucky as he was adept.  The traditional hero must grow out of hardship and flourish...Spizlman has no choice but to grow within his hardship, and fight for nothing more than survival; the status quo of what he had.  In the end, he is nothing more than alive and able to continue what he was doing...considering the circumstances, I consider him a hero.  But I can't emulate Spizlman unless I am ever in that same situation, and no one wants to put themselves in that situation, even briefly.  Last year, I was impressed with the addition of  urlLink Memento  in the Best Picture catergory at the Golden Globes.  This year, I was shocked that  urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien  (one of my  urlLink favorite movies ) was left off the Best Foreign Film catergory, much less Best Picture overall.  It's most likely the frank sexual nature of the film that kept voters away, but a movie so well-liked and well-reviewed across the world should receive even a mention from the Hollywood Foreign Press.    I look forward to the Academy Awards in two months, and the opportunity to see the other well-regarded films this year; it looks like a great slate of films will be up for the show.  However, I hope that the boys' club of Hollywood will work to make sure the best film, and not the best film with the most likeable or marketable actor, will win.

      I just happened across a pretty interesting website about the  urlLink Russian Space Program  and a myriad of problems that existed before Yuri Gagarin's launch into orbit in 1961.  According to the website, two Italian brothers manned a Ham radio and kept track of the goings-on with the cosmonauts.  There are a number of interesting tidbits on this site, as well as some bone-harrowing audio files of two people said to have died in space...one male launched two months before Gagarin, and one a female launched soon after.    The Russians were known to have tampered with history in order to purify their space program; in order to look perfect, and imperfections in the program were  urlLink erased  from history.  Had the Americans found out about deaths in space, or even cosmonauts-in-training with shady records, the poor press and subsequent media frenzy would have weakened an already frail Russian nationality.    I consider myself to be a quite trusting person, but only on an individual level.  The larger the corporation, the less room I give it to shake.  I don't trust multi-national corporations.  I trust local and state governments less than that.  I trust the federal government less than any local or state branch.  I trust insurance companies less than the US government.  And high on the perk, with little chance of being dethroned, is my complete and total lack of trust in the  urlLink press media .    Yet these conscious mistrusts of large organizations bent on keeping a status-quo designed to misalign the majority of people still get called into question due to my hegemonic training.  Everything I ever learned in school taught me that the United States was a country that worked for the little man, helped people and countries in trouble, and was the greatest place to live on Earth because it cared the most about the Earth.  God, the number of songs I sang in elementary school classes to show my pride in the U.S. of A is disgusting, looking back on it.  I view a website whose claims have vaild evidence behind them, yet I look at it in limbo because the message says that governments lie.  And I still have trouble believing that.  I've parused a few books claiming that the US flights to the moon were a  urlLink hoax , and while the evidence in those books is much less convincing than the Cosmonaut claims, I still leave it to Tom Foolery, because why would the government ever lie?    My grandmother and I both saw  urlLink Bowling for Columbine , albeit in seperate locations.  This woman is a steadfast Republican who honestly believes that the world is good, that the United States is a country fixed on helping the poor, huddled masses of the world, and that heroes are Heroes, and Charlton Heston and Dick Clark are both heroes.  When I try to talk to her about the messages of the film, her first point is always about the negative:  "He talks about all of the bad things the United States has done.  What about the good things to help others?"  My response is always the same: "We get the good in school and in the media; we never hear the bad.  Moore is balancing the equation."  Once we beat that down, and I try to ask her opinion on the film, she goes for the jugular:  "Well, I don't like how he treated Charlton Heston or Dick Clark."  Moore is a great filmmaker, but he comes off as abrasive and antagonistic, and in his interviews with celebrities where Moore's agenda is clearly stated, the celebrity never comes off in a positive light.  Thus, my grandmother's hero is hurled down in a less-than-alluring light, and she does her damndest to defend him.    I can despise the media and hate the world that they create for us (I am a firm believer in the teachings of  urlLink Jean Baudrillard  and his belief that television no longer mirrors society, but it is now society that mirrors television), yet I still put blind faith into their teachings.  One such example is the theory of matter, made famous by Isaac Newtown.  Newtown's thoughts on the structure of matter, mainly the atom and its elements, is written in every Science textbook today, and possibly the greatest staple of the field.  However, Ben Gray, a former physicist and aide to Robert Oppenheimer, opposes this idea of the atom and matter in general, saying that the proton and the neutron don't exist; it's all electrons.  Gray lived in Jacksonville, Texas up until his death last February, and through several intermediaries, my current roommate met him and was given a taped lecture by Gray about his theories of matter (he also wrote a pretty good  urlLink screenplay  around the theory).  However, rather than watch the tape, I castigated Brian for even believing the ramblings of this old man...quoting the time-honored traditions of science, and asking why the establishment would lie to us.    However, I know realize why the establishment would lie to us - SELF-PRESERVATION.  I'll get into what it means to lie to people more later.  Right now, I'm interested in watching that tape of Ben Gray...hopefully I'm old enough now to give it a try.

      It's about damn time...  After graduating from  urlLink Centenary College  in May 2001, I realized that in order to get anything done, I would have to take great strides in self-initiative...no longer was a professor going to be assigning topics, suggesting media to work within, and holding one of five letters over my head, dangling it precariously out-of-reach, causing forced motivation on my part to finish assignments, all the while playing me the fool for the grade.  But outside of college, assignment is a foreign word.  Thus, soon after receiving my sparkling 8 x 10 degree in English from  urlLink Kenneth Schwab , I sat down with a Holiday Inn Express notepad and began writing my goals for the next 12 months.  They were     Write a full-length, feature screenplay Create a new, post-Centenary web presence Find employment in the arts  Start a savings account  Live the bohemian life    Numbers four and five might sound conflicting; they are, but I was just out of undergrad, where all of my meals were paid, rent came from a loan I wasn't paying on, and the Bohemians were the people wearing the cool jackets and talking the same verbose language that I weave at coffee shops.    Now, 20 months after writing it, I can say that I've done everything on that list.  I have two screenplays, worked with an avant-garde  urlLink theatre company , ate a ton of canned tuna, at one point had a savings account, and now have the website.    Is there any catharsis in finishing a list?  I have friends who constantly write lists: to-do today, to-do this week, to-do this lifetime.  Often, the list is never finished...a new episode of Judge Joe Brown comes on at 3:30, pushing studying back thirty minutes and effectively pushing the dry-cleaning back to tomorrow.  If you have to put dry-cleaning on tomorrow's list, then you're most likely going to have to put something on tomorrow's list on a later to-do list.  And this is the easy part.  What about that In One Month list, where you have listed  Lose Weight ,  Volunteer , and  See More Art ?  I guess I should feel relieved that I took care of the list I wrote May 9, 2001, but really, rather than celebrate, I'll probably go grab a bagel, drink a soda, and waste time before I go out tonight.    And to be honest, most of the links on the damn site aren't up.

      For those of you wishing to paruse alternative media regarding  Showdown With Sadaam&copy; , here's a  urlLink link  from Abdul Kelani, my best friend from my days at UT-Arlington.    In Karin Wilkins' Developing Communications course (387C; Fall 2002 UT-Austin), the following question was posed:  "What is the role of Journalism?  What are Journalists striving for?"  The class was slient.  I hate silence in class; the uncomfortable looks shot from person to person, watching as each student tries with all gusto to avoid the professor's glare; a venerable feast of Corey McMullin face ensues often.  So I spoke:     I think that while the role of Journalism depends on the community which it comes from (Journalism requires a readership to follow it; that readership is community, whether it be a small town or a number of people who surf the web), but it is always striving for the essence of Truth.   At the time, I stood strong with my argument.  I knew Journalism, better than most everyone in the class.  I spent the first 17 years of my life training to become a journalist.  I've worked at four distinct papers in my life, bringing each one to a higher level of success in writing and readership.  While I no longer enjoy much about the field, I know what the field is about.    So the responses to my answer shocked me.  At least four people in the classroom vehemently disagreed with my assessment of the higher calling of journalists.  Yes, journalists were byproducts of the community, but that meant that community biases would be precedent in their words; in no way could journalists ever meet the idea of Truth, unless we consider Truth to be truth.  Only in Western Journalism, specifically America, do people believe that journalists live in a bubble of unbias, where they can ignore their personal feelings and the feelings of their communities to report the Truth of the day.  It makes more sense to believe that journalists serve their community, and in serving it carry out the biases and opinions of that community.  It's not a grand conspiracy led by political parties and oil barons, it's just how people are.  We like to be led.  The idea of a caste system in India was introduced by a conquering nation 1200 BCE, and it's stuck for the past 3000 years.  The concept of Hell was introduced by the Zorastran religion in 400-600 CE.  These things still remain around because someone who presents themselves as an authority says them.    Moral of the day - George Bush doesn't deserve blind trust.  Neither does Tom Broakaw.  Or the person who wrote the above link.  Cultural Studies father Stuart Hall has  urlLink a few things to say about this .   UPDATE  - More  urlLink good reading , this time from ESPN Page 2's Ralph Wiley, regarding the basketball player who turns from the flag during the National Anthem at basketball games.  You can love the country and love its freedoms, but that doesn't have to mean you like or support its foreign policies, and that doesn't mean you can't speak out against them.

       urlLink Fred Rogers  died yesterday.  And don't ask me why, but it reminded me of this  urlLink email joke  I received years ago.  Most likely because the only other funny email joke I ever got involved Mr. Rogers in a sexual tryst with King Friday and the other characters of the Land of Make-Believe.  Though it could be that I referenced this joke yesterday?    My spot in the CRC computer lab looks directly at a women's restroom with two urinals and a traditional toilet.    The TA in my Digital Doc class, Ted Gesing, is showing his documentary short film  urlLink Nutria  at  urlLink South by Southwest , a crazy phantasmagoria of short film, live music, and performance art.  Performance art.  Nothing beats the art show I went to in Chicago, which included two hours of experimental film where I got to sit inside a bubble room reminiscent of  urlLink E.T. , and also watched live as a woman stood inside of a big yellow bouncy ball and jumped around to celebrate being 40.    The most exciting thing I've done this week (except stay up past 3 am every night):  buying  urlLink A History of God ,  Steppenwolf , and  urlLink Introducing Eastern Philosophy  at  urlLink Half Price Books  yesterday.  The causes of my recent sexual drought are becoming more evident.

      For some reason, every time I check my email and see over 15 new messages, a little part of me dies.  I know that I am going to have to click the Inbox link, and see that two of the emails are about enlarging my penis (I forward all of those to Daniel Young), another two are about webcams that are supposed to act both as security cameras and cheap porno filmers, one about some silly shit regarding University campaign teams for Student Government.  At  urlLink Centenary's SGA , we didn't worry about parties.  If more than one person was running, the competition was celebrated!  You could always count on 15-20 freshman running for the four freshman seats...but only 6-8 sophomores would run.  Anyway, we're now down to nine messages.  One will be my mom telling me that she is going to call the hospitals to make sure I didn't die in the icestorm.  Another two will be from the RTF Grad Office, telling me that Maureen is going to be out of the office or I can try to get a Latino Studies paper published in some 'zine.  One will regard my fantasy baseball team, and I'm not afraid to tell you that.  Another one will be a joke forward from my dad, almost always a joke that I've already seen or I don't want to see.  And to save you the time, the only joke that I do want to see is the one about the professor and the paper asking if Hell is endothermic or exothermic.  Good shit.   So we're down to four emails.  One will be from Harge, telling me to level Chinua.  Another will be from Will Kordsmeier.  There's a good chance another will be from Abdul Kelani, talking about the problems of war (though he gives me some great info from newspresses around the world).  So it is bothersome when that one lone email that I don't expect to get goes like this:   Rolin, I was cleaning out my daughter's room (turning it into a hunting lodge) when I found a box of Kiss of Mint condoms and a tube of KY.  Using my beginner's detective kit, I ran fingerprints on both items and found your greasy smudges all over them.  You told me you loved my daughter for her mind.  And her breasts.  I can take that, but sex outside the covenant of marriage?  That's not you, Rolin.    I know you don't see my daughter anymore, but hate is a fire that is constantlly fueled.  Don't walk down any dark alleys.  And watch your back.  Remember, I still have the tube of KY.   I watched  urlLink Crimes & Misdemeanors  yesterda.  If I can spot flaws in Woody Allen's writing, does that mean I am good?  Of course, I can spot flaws in my own writing.

      Musings while class is cancelled due to an ice storm that I never thought would hit Austin:     *Last night, I got out of my religion class pretty early, and decided to keep looking for copies of  urlLink My So-Called Life , a great TV show from 1994 that deals with teenage angst from a female point-of-view; not only is this incredibly unique to a male-dominated television spectrum, but it was also cutting-edge in that there were no true resolutions to episodes; something happened, and Angela dealt with it, and that was that...we went on to the next epsiode feeling a lot like Angela: lost, confused, not sure who her friends were (also, I've had an incredible crush on Claire Danes ever since this show).  The script I'm writing at present calls for an 18 year old girl; I don't want a carbon-copy airhead like seen in American Pie, and I don't want a Nietzche-quoting bitch like in Ghost World.  So Claire Danes' portrayl of Angela is what I'm looking for.  I need episodes.  There is ice and snow on the ground; conditions are going to get worse, but it's still slushy outside.  So I decide to go pick up two episodes at the only video store in Austin that rents this: Vulcan Video.  I call, ask how long they're going to be open...they'll be open until midnight.  I warm up my car for 15 minutes, scrape the ice, and drive the three mile drive in 25 minutes.  As I get there, the guy is locking up.  "You closed?" I ask, quoting Captain Obvious.  "Yeah," he says.  "I just called you, you said you'd be open until midnight," I say.  "Things change," he says.  I pause.  I busted my ass to get out here for this damn video.  "Could you let me rent something?  I know exactly what I need.  You said you'd be open."  He pauses.  "No."  And he walks away.  Today everything is shut and the roads are worse.  Fuck.       *The past four nights, I have gone to bed no earlier than 3:45.  The times have been:  3:45, 3:30, 4:00, and last night's big topper, 5:15.  Trying to get my clock back to waking up around 9 am is not happening; I missed half of Days of our Lives not because I was out of the house (how I like to miss it), but because I hadn't woken up yet.  Of course, Kerby Lane Cafe serves a mean cup of decaf and a great bowl of chips and salsa!  And trying to walk the ice in the bleak of night last night with Brian was a great experience.  At one point he stopped and said, "Look, a snowman!"  And sure enough, Brian stood over a snowman that couldn't've been more than 10 inches high.  He smiled.  Someone had put a lot of effort into making a very realistic snowman.  So Brian kicked it, and sent the top two thirds careening into the air. It was beautiful.       *On my way from my apartment to Starbucks, I saw two traffic accidents and at least three dozen people slip and fall on their asses.  I nearly was one more a few times; this ice is some crazy stuff.  One of the accidents was amusing, I hate to say...the truck was turning left, and just never really turned, so it fishtailed into a streetpole at about 8 mph.  A small dent to both, and a giggle from me.  I hope I'd laugh if it were my car.

       urlLink Siddhartha ...good book.    It is sleeting outside, the buses are running incredibly slowly, so a substantial number of students are standing outside waiting for the bus to come.  As I was walking to my Religion, Health, and Mortality class, I saw a guy in short sleeves and shorts standing at the bus stop, using a small parasol to try to deflect the sleet.  He was utterly miserable.  I couldn't help but laugh...this guy is literaly stabbing at the sky, trying his best to keep his fair skin free from the cold shards of condensation surrounding him.  He saw me laughing, and he started laughing as well.  Good for people seeing humor in their idiocy!  The guy behind me in the computer lab does not share such inklings of humor.  He's playing some online game that looks like a cross between Legend of Zelda, Civilization III, and Killer Clowns From Outer Space.  The lab is packed; people are waiting for the sleet to stop (as Tripper Clancy told me today, in his best Harry Carry voice [not near as good as mine], "If the weather's bad in Austin, wait 10 minutes!"  That's the ticket!), and there is a huge line to get a computer.  But this guy is using the school hub to play this game.  I've been watching him since coming in...he just saw me look, and in order to show his superiority over his alien race, he just killed one of his subservients to flex his 64 bit muscles.  WOOT!    Nothing personal, but the blog is boring the shit out of me atm.  What else can I say about war?  My righteous indignation can only go so far.  When can I get back to talking about cute puppies?

      Got an  urlLink email today  from my brother-in-law regarding Oliver North's keen insight into Osama bin Laden back in 1987, effectively putting all blame of recent terrorist problems on the Democrats.  Reading this, seeing Ari Fleischer continuously blame other countries for their problems and any residual effects of current initiatives of American global domination, and seeing Tom Ridge and George Bush tell me what I need to do to stay safe because the infidels are out to kill freedom and kill me...it makes me realize that I no longer have to take responsibility for anything I do.  Oliver North spent $60,000 of government money on a security system...it was Osama's fault.  But Al Gore didn't catch this, so it is Al Gore's fault that September 11 happened.   And Bill Clinton's fault.   And Warren Christopher's fault.  And Yassar Arafat's fault. but not Benjamin Netanyahu's fault. and not Ronald Reagan's fault. and not George H. Bush's fault.    Seeing how we can delineate blame (if my President tells me to delineate blame, I sure as hell will do it!), I am embarking on a campaign of no loger accepting responsibility for anything.  Every action I consent to achieving is dictated by biology and social training, so it's societys fault.  Or it's God's fault.  Or God's will...God didn't want me to make All-State Band in 1997, so he must be the reason that I pissed on the seat today in the Sociology building.

      Looking for one-hit wonders?   urlLink This site  has probably the best archive of folks who only charted one song in the synthesized decadance of the 1980s.  Granted, a lot of these bands were cult favorites (Devo, Soft Cell), while others were side projects (Frida was from Abba, Joey Scarborough was a jingle singer who got lucky with The Greatest American Hero), and some of the names included are preposterous (Peter Schilling with only one hit?!  The Mary Jane Girls in the same way?!) but the collection of names that are so forgettable is amazing!  I mean, who remembers Rocky Burnette and  To'ing The Line ?  Or even Hayzee Fantazee?  Incredible!  More on my favorite music decade...I was at a Sam Goody on Wednesday with Brian when I saw  urlLink this  album.  I can understand U2, The Moody Blues, George Clinton & Parliament, hell, even Tony Orlando all on the Columbia Essentials label, but Twisted Sister?!  I hate to comment on items bombarded by the national media, but this Great White disaster in Rhode Island begets a question.  You're Great White, an 80s hair band that tours in small clubs.  Small clubs.  You get booked in the equivalent of a wooden barn that has maybe a 15 foot ceiling at the most, and you're on a stage 2 or 3 feet high.  Yet you set up Flash Pots that shoot flames 20 feet in the air?!  If I'm paying to go see Great White in concert, I don't give a shit about flash pots...there's got to be something else that is driving me to that concert.

      Interesting article at  Mindjack  today...apparently an MIT grad student  urlLink did research to discredit  the MPAA's notion that P2P networks allow people to transfer copyrighted movies at incredible ease.  I've seen movies transferred on Kazaa, and they look terrible and take forever to download, clogging up your usage and the other persons as well.    Edward Said, one of the most respected authors and historians of the last 50 years, has a short essay out where he points out the  urlLink endless contradictions  in George Bush's plans for war with Iraq.  This is getting to the level of preposterousness.  Few people want war...those who have stock in Boeing or Lockheed Martin I'm sure aren't upset about it, but most every person I've talked to is uneasy about war.  Yes, Saddam Hussein isn't a good guy, he treats his people like shit and lies.  Yeah, it'd probably be best if he were taken out of office.  But "shock and awe" in order to do it?  Diplomatic solutions seem so much more reasonable from every aspect; you don't kill innocent people, yet you show your care for the people of the Middle East.  Shock and Awe seems more inclined to show other Middle Easterners what is coming to 'em rather than a way to take Hussein out of office.    This has slowly become a catastrophic problem...for some reason Americans trust George Bush to act in the interests of people.  Why?  This was a guy who owned a baseball team...why should we expect some moment of transubstantiation when he is sworn in as the President.  He's still Junior Bush, the lightly educated guy who is way in over his head and grew up with a dad who believed in force and the Cold War.  Our foreign policy at present is downright pathetic, and getting worse.  We are becoming the rogue nation in the world.  And the people of this country don't understand it because we have a blind trust in all things Government...stand up and sing  America the Beautiful !    For anyone who is on the fence about war, and believes that George Bush will do what's right because that is what Americans do, I suggest reading Howard Zinn's  urlLink A People's History of the United States .  We don't need war, and don't let silly propaganda and duct tape scares let you think otherwise.

      I often wonder how many anti-abortion activists are also anti-war.  Same premise, right...it's about how much we value life.   These  would be the people to ask.

      My short documentary on high school debate tournaments is finished, and I am trying to figure out a way for people who want to view it to do so.  I can put it on TriggerStreet.com, but you have to get a membership and all sorts of crap to be on there, and if you're not a screenwriter it's really a hassle.  We'll see.    Speaking of debate, here's a list of people I lost contact with that I would love to talk to again.  If you know the whereabouts of any of them, send 'em over here.  They'll be tickled delicious to see their name on an actual web site that isn't dealing with automotive reposession or sex offender registration.     Bennett Ryel .   Cameron Clausing .   Kenny Lowden .   Melia Woods .   JD Livergood .   Gina Brown .   CJ Davis .  Really, anyone I played soccer with between 1993 and 1997 (even Mark Henry, how's that lazy bastard doing?).   Maura Wilbur .   Lisa Thurber .   Nathan Hamilton .   Clint Bruce .   Vanessa Boyd .   Home Clothes Hughey .   Ross Butler .   Saghar Talebi .    This is a snapshot of my days of yore: playing Super Bomberman on the Super Nintendo, hitting Waffle House or Joe's between visits by the ambulance, watching cheap porno clips in seedy Arkansas motels, providing an homage to Zeb Maxwell Miller in the place Zeb would want us to...  There are lots more.  These will do for now.

      From Daryl Burrows, quite possibly the most proportionatly funny individual I've ever known.    DarylBurrows50: It's good.  We are practicing on eachother.  I tried the Leal.  Didn't work so well on the older guy.   fattassomalley: you've got to work the Leal in...Crystal Byrd didn't just let him fist...he had to sweet talk her with his second band trumpet triumphs DarylBurrows50: Actually he was a third trumpet. fattassomalley: in first band? DarylBurrows50: No.  Sixth band at band camp.  They played Space Shuttle Rock and We've Got the Spirit.  If you didn't go to band camp, shame.

      I have a  urlLink friend  who is on his way to Syria in a few weeks to fight with the US Army against Iraq.  He tells me that he knows what he's fighting for, and that his training prepared him for this day.  I told him that I was as anti-war as anyone could be...not just this war, but any war, even if Iraq bombed the hell out of us, I'd want a diplomatic solution (that they haven't, and that there is no connection to terror and Iraq, except if we terrorize Iraq, we will be terrorized by al Qaeda zealots).  And he is cool with that.    This is anecdotal evidence, mind you, but I have a big problem when people say that once our boys head off to war, I need to support them.  True, I don't want to see American soldiers die.  But I don't want to see Iraqis die either.  And I don't see how that makes me anti-American.  I sure as hell am anti-American foreign policy, as I have been for ages...I first spoke out about it in 1996 back at the  Rogers Hometown News , as a acne-stricken 16 year old realizing that something was wrong with the way we treated others around the world, but not knowing what.  Anyway, here's a statement that should get me on a government list somewhere:  just because they are American soldiers doesn't mean I should value them more so than other peoples of the world.    Here's a quote from today's  urlLink Daily Texan  from a Republican protester of the Bill Clinton speech:  "I wouldn't give a piss about 100 of their people over ours. I'm concerned about Americans and American security."   So when a mother comes up to me on the street, knowing that I am anti-war, and says, "My son is in Saudi Arabia, gun in hand, ready to fight for your freedom, and you are not in the least grateful," I will look back at her and say, "I am grateful.  But I don't like the orders they are forced to carry out.  We think of ourselves as the greatest nation in the history of the world.  Can't we solve a dispute with a third-world country whose army is weak, who is saddled by strenuous sanctions, and whose defense system is already being destroyed by the UN through a means other than killing?  I don't want your son to die.  I don't want anyone to die."    So Will, best of luck to you.  Go do your duty.  But I'm not behind you on this one.  You've got to do your job.  But admiration will only come when the Commander-in-Chief changes the orders and thinks about humans rather than capital and elections.

      Looks like I missed a  urlLink good protest  at UT yesterday.  The campus held an  urlLink ant-war walkout  yesterday, the same day as  urlLink former President Bill Clinton  spoke about tax cuts and other Bush wrongdoings.  I missed it all due to an early wake-up call for substitute teaching because I need the money.    I can think of few things nicer than a life where I can go to a rally or protest in the daytime, get some writing done in the afternoon, listen to a former president speak in the evening, and edit my documentary opus that night.  I'm getting tired of giving a shit about posessions...and I still do.  I want a big office with lots of books and brickabrack, maybe some framed posters that hold significant cultural meaning...and a window.  I want a comfy couch, a comfy chair, and a big stereo system.  Throw in a big entertainment system too, what the hell.  But it's such a pain in the ass to get these things.  And what does it mean?  Our modes of consumption are so grossly inefficient that the only animal comparable to how we consume is the wasp.  Both do not consume for sustinence or livelihood...they consume to consume; to destroy in a sense.  I believe it was  urlLink Derrida  who said that at some point the aristocracy realized that the best way to keep the masses under foot was to let zem eat cake, basically to give them enough to keep them fat and happy...consumption thus became an appetite that could never be sated.    I have one friend in Costa Rica, another in Ecuador...both are living on the beach, doing God knows what, speaking spanish and enjoying the day, living to live.  It sounds damn nice.  I often wonder if the higher purpose that I like to think I have is egocentric romanticism or hegemonic brainwashing.

      Question - what is the point of blogging?  Recently, three of the blogs I frequent expressed dismay with the world of blogging, whether it be the petty griping of posters, the repetition of comments and lack of creativity, or the  urlLink ever-present social structure  that the internet was "designed" to overcome.  My  urlLink first blog  was more of a channel to review movies and literature than a running dialogue, diary, or discourse on anything.  The writing was great, but it was killing me to review things on a constant basis, and no one seemed to want to join in.  So I moved from there to the more activist-natured blog.  And while I don't believe that my comments here make a bit of difference to how our elected officials lead this country, at least people have the ability to read this.    I have no idea how else to put this, so I'll go straight out:  to everyone who is upset at the world of blogging, stop your bitching.  It's not the panacea it was made out to be; neither was the ham radio, cable television, or the furbie.  I probably check my email twice a day; when I was an undergrad, it was so much more, and when I worked at the library at  urlLink UTA  it was more than that.  But really, if this machine were taken away, I'd miss easier communication and little else.    It sucks for me to write about the redundancy and mirth of this message I'm writing, but fuck it.  I keep writing.  You keep reading.  You invite your friends.  Larry Faulkner takes me for a steak dinner, and someone sends me nude pictures of themselves from their iCam.  It turns out to be Jennifer Birge, and I vomit in my mouth.  Isn't that why Al Gore invented this mess?

      Hooray for Flash animation about  urlLink war with Iraq .  Good luck saving the region!    Man, I sure do feel safe going to bed at night knowing that George Bush is the guy with his finger on the button.  He knows that we're fighting people who hate freedom.  It shows that there are some people that are just bad people.  And suprisingly, most of them seem to look and sound very little like us fat cats in the good ol' US of A.  Don't I look like the cat's pajamas!

      I think we're still at war.  Aren't we?  The Academy Award Nominees were announced, so I saw all things indiscriminate murder pushed to the margin at  urlLink MSN .  Is Saddam willing to give us today to debate why  urlLink About Schmidt  didn't get a Best Picture nod, and how both  urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien  and  urlLink Talk To Her  could get Best Screenplay nods, but get jacked out of even Best Foreign Film.  Is there a rule that if you write a non-English film and get accolades in another category, you can't be up for the silly foreign award?    If  urlLink Chicago  beats  urlLink The Pianist  for Best Picture, I will indiscriminately kick people in the face.    More Academy Awards...I don't know whether I'm more excited to see Michael Moore on the stage where Charlton Heston stood years before (it's not the same stage, but play with me for a minute), or to see Eminem tell Meryl Streep to fuck herself.    How am I supposed to wait for the awards show?  I guess that's what war and terror and American fear are for.  Well played, George W!  Who is going to save the world?  The sociologists (capitalization left out because it looks too much like Scientologists), the cultural theorists, or Jesus?  My money is on  urlLink Cindy Pierson Dulay  and the  urlLink Cyberspace Racing Team  in the 5th at Santa Anita Downs.  10 furlongs on dirt.

      Stuck in America, my worldwide scope on news is often limited to Austin's  urlLink independent newspaper , and the silly networks that come up with graphics promos for war and terrorism... The Smoking Gun ... Showdown With Saddam ... America's Vigilante War on Terrorism .  So it's refreshing to see in other countries, there are newspapers working on  urlLink telling it like it is .  I'll be honest, the zealous rhetoric that Peter Jennings, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, and the Fox News jackasses stir can sometimes get me caught up in it...it's tough to emulate Stuart Hall and find the resistance reading in everything...sometimes you need help.  Thus, I'm looking overseas, where people might have a better perspective of the regime it looks like we're going to vote another four-year term.  The good part about Bush's shenanigans is that it's drumming up a lot of anti-Bush support from anyone left of fucking crazy.  The bad part is, the Democrats are too busy playing teabag to do something about this.  All I need is one Democrat who is running for President (and isn't Al Sharpton) to tell me that he's against war and he's got my undying support.  And none of this against war in the right circumstances backtalk bullshit.  I want him naked as the wind, both hands on the table in front of him, a bunch of sex-starved foreigners behind him who will pounce if he tries to weasel his way out of it, telling me that he is against war and can solve the War on Terror without fighting.  Yes, yes, it can be done.  And fairly easily.

      My letter to the editor was  urlLink published  on Friday.  At Centenary, this would have caused quite a stir; I probably would have received a phone call from Gene Gregory or Scott Greenwood, and accolades from my fellow students.  Hell, it might have gotten me laid (what private college girls found attractive always bewildered and pleased me).  Here, I believe it was read in all seriousness, judging by the number of people who emailed me and said, "You're not going to get a steak dinner."    Hey, I'll take Steak & Eggs at Waffle House.  I'm a whore for the free meal.    Terrorist Alert Orange (which is higher than Yellow, as ROY-G-BIV taught me), and Donald Rumsfield says this has nothing to do with war in Iraq.  Damn right!  Yelling, "Bomb the Iraqi fuckers!" at televised press conferences makes the Iraqi viewing public laugh..."He's funny, like Jerry Lewis!  And not retaining pounds of water!"  I don't believe that anti-war sentiment or North Dakota exist.  I never hear either mentioned on the news.

      Fun times with  urlLink Colin Powell at the UN  today, drumming up support for a war with Iraq without giving too much away, except for circumstantial evidence.  Granted, his rhetoric was stirring, but Journalism 101 told me a cited source is always better than an anonymous source, even if your anonymous source tells you that the sky is falling.  And by god, I'll believe Diana Kolman before I believe George Bush.    Many questions left to be answered, though I am waiting to hear the mass of business-clad, pump-wearing blonde twentysomething women who don't know what a good lay is tell me that the Bush administration once again provided the  urlLink Smoking Gun .   Confident Patriotism .  However, for once, the hegemonic-happy  American People (tm)  urlLink got it right .

      A concern in my department:  due to an expected Texas budget shortfall in the billions and subsequent cut of education monies by 7%, the UT System has instituted a hiring freeze, effective indefinitely.  This affects tons of people and organizations, but it hurts me at this moment because it will be much tougher to use the campus editing lab to finish my short documentary project.   While I don't really care about that (I'll finish), I realize that this is a huge inconvenience not just to the RTF Department, but to everything on campus, from the cleaners to the cooks to the techies.  There are a lot of other ways to save the money.  Thus, my first attempt to foil the system, through sarcasm:   Dear Daily Texan Editor,  The hiring freeze does not only hamper the hiring of professors, as bureaucrats have spun it.  All campus-wide jobs are not hiring, and people who were hired but whose paperwork was not processed are stuck, leaving many offices with a skeleton crew.   While this harms a number of initiatives, this affects me in regards to the RTF Editing Lab.  Due to the hiring freeze, there are currently only four lab proctors.  To compensate the loss, the lab cut 32 hours off its schedule; not hours when the lab is used by classes, but hours allotted for students to complete projects and homework.  The over 200 students who use these 20 machines now must work with 1/3 less time to do it.    Rather than raise philosophical questions of education outside the classroom and the importance of providing adequate resources for students, I’ll tackle the reason for the freeze:  saving money.   Of the $433 I paid this semester in technology and production course fees, I can deduce that at least $50 of my fees went to the privilege of using this lab outside of class.  Is the University entitled to this money?  This money was for a service that they aren’t providing.  Therefore, since the available hours were cut by 33%, I expect the University of Texas to reimburse me this 33%, $17.  The University is welcome to check my math.  Direct deposit will be fine, though if need be, I will substitute that for a steak dinner with President Faulkner.       urlLink Let me know  if you think I should send it.

      How could I forget  urlLink Lovers of the Arctic Circle , the 1998 Spanish film that  urlLink brought to my attention  the wonders of Spanish film?  Looking back it is no longer one of my favorites, but at one time it spurred me to action, and the palindromic characters of  Ana y Otto  were an interesting convention.    A favor to ask of you...would someone please  urlLink go here  and give this movie a terrible vote?  You might say to yourself, "That is dishonest, Rolin.  We haven't seen it."  Well, this is the one movie in the past seven years that I have walked out of, and I wasn't about to get action after it was over (a la my walking out of Jurassic Park II).  Looking through the booklet at the Austin Film Festival, we decided on  Beeper  to see Harvey Keitel.  Fifteen minutes into the movie he wasn't there, but the Indian subcontinent had been shamed beyond belief by B-list Hollywood producers, and the bratty child (who eerily resembles  urlLink Mick Foley ) in the film that is kidnapped is such a whiny bitch that we wish it was him rather than the teddy bear that gets two bullets to the head.  Or I wish it was me after watching that.  I just want this film to be in the bottom 250 at IMDB, and it needs more votes!

      The responses to my writing are flooding in!  Here's one from  Destiny , with the acronym GWM (what does that mean?):   Oat Willie wears those boxers because I like to cover him in  urlLink Malt-O-Meal  and call him Wilfred Brimley and tell him that he is a naughty old man.  I can do the same to you, funny man.  Coffee sometime?   Ummm...excuse me...it is  urlLink Wilford Brimley  (Debs, how could you be so wrong?!), and he is the representative for  urlLink Quaker Oats , thank you very much.      urlLink I'll light the fire , while you place the flowers in the vase that you bought today...

      Went out and saw Almodovar's newest vehicle,  urlLink Talk To Her , last night at Austin's  urlLink Dobie Theatre .  While I've spoken quite well of Alfonzo Cuaron's  urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien , I have to say that  Talk To Her  just took the cake as my favorite film of the past year.  Possibly ever.  And that's not just because  urlLink Leonor Watling  did an amazing job as Alicia, besting her landmark role from  urlLink Behind God's Back , where she won the world's heart with her characterization of  the First Prostitute.  I don't know what it is about spanish-language films, but three of my five favorite films of all-time fall in the catergory:   urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien ,  urlLink All About My Mother , and  Talk To Her .  I've always thought fondly of foreign film; not just foreign language, but British and Irish fare as well, though  urlLink Guy Ritchie  films don't really do it for me.  I'm trying to put a foreign spin on my independent-style writings, and finding it quite difficult to do...living in America, a screenwriter rebelling against Syd Field doesn't get much love.  But who cares?  Fuck Syd Field (btw, for anyone interested in starting a website, www.fucksydfield.com is still available).    Is my writing fresh?  For example, my most recent publication, seen by over 200,000 in Austin this week:   Oat Willie's Discount Tobaccanist Supply Store .  You:  girl searching for La Bomba pleasure toy; interested in using it for purposes other than smoking.  Me:  customer curious as to why Oat Willie chose those boxers.  I pointed you to the Ritchie Valens section at Waterloo; you laughed as a favor to my ego.  Why is a girl like you resigned to plastics?   Coffee sometime ?  Maybe if it was in Spanish...

      Here's a different perspective on  urlLink why we're at war with Iraq .  I don't agree with a lot of the claims, but I don't agree with a lot of the claims on Fox News either.  I'm well-read on the subject...I can see that George Bush isn't a visionary interested in democracy, and I can also see that this isn't a Jewish war.  However, the point on security in the region is important to note.  The Netherlands doesn't need security in the region.  Why do we?    And for those interested in the civilian casuality count in this war that the major news networks aren't willing to air,  urlLink here you go .

      WAR-RELATED - According to journalist Peter Barnett, the United States is  urlLink rethinking its war strategy  since, unbenounced to our God-fearing president, Iraqis are actually fighting back.  Like I said before, if Saddam Hussein came to America and said he wasn't interested in controlling our country...that he just wanted regime change, and if I didn't fight I wouldn't be hurt, I'd fight.  I'd protect America.  So how come our government didn't expect Iraqis to do the same?  Are we that vain?  The Pentagon chastized Al-Jazeera for showing pictures of dead coalition troops.  USA Today showed pictures of dead Iraqi fighters on its front page on Friday.  Today, USA Today points out that  urlLink those living in the Middle East don't buy into Operation Iraqi Freedom&copy; .  Unfortunately, it's obvious there's no going back now.  All I can hope is that the Democratic Party pulls its head out of the donkey's ass and comes up with any semblance of a platform that will beat George Bush.  Then, we go to work repairing all of the shit Bush and his cronies fucked up during his term.  And if you don't think Bush has fucked up, look at the economy and ask the world what they think.  PERSPECTIVE.    NOT WAR - Every once in a while I get down on my writing.  I am a hard-lined, deterministic writer who is hypercritical of his work.  And I've been stuck at the same point in my screenplay for two months.  The screenplay wasn't reading like I wanted, and my themes were weak.  I was questioning writing, something I do semi-often...how am I good enough to pursue this as a career?  But today was glory for writing.  I watched some Final Four basketball (Texas' win should inspire an essay about the personal crisis I have every time Texas plays sports), then went to Borders and wrote for five hours.  Maybe not great stuff, but I moved on from where I was.  It probably won't be what I end up with, but I'm past the hurdle.  Small victories.  Grand feelings.

      A MOMENT AWAY FROM WAR  It's interesting...I want this blog to be more than quick links to items, but with a society that churns an idea of nationalism that requires ardent support of the jester and his cohorts up in Washington, I feel obligated to show the other side of the story...Stuart Hall's idea of resistance reading...seeing the truth in hegemonic works.    But fuck it for tonight.  Tonight, I am drunk.  I drove out to Schulenburg, Texas (population 2699), shot some film for my documentary project, came home, took a dirty nap, watched an episode of Cheers, and went out drinking with Denton Heaney and Jennifer Girdish (last line mandated by the two so when you search their names on Google, they get more hits).    I'm moving to California this summer.  Two months.  I don't know where I'm going to live, or what I'm going to do for a living.  I don't know a soul out there.  But shit...I love the coast.  And I love meeting new people.  I am very lucky that I know so many quality people and have so many quality friends.  Maybe I'm selfish in that I want to meet more people and see who else in the world is just good.  A few months of getting tan on a beach, waiting tables, walking in the park, and not being afraid to start a conversation with the hottie in the bar should be great for the writer mired in self-doubt and questioning his ability to write a coherent screenplay.  I'm lucky that I can take the time to do this.  So I'm going to.  Fuck grabass.    If anyone wants to come, you're more than welcome.    Harr is an EXCELLENT powerleveler.

      And now for all that are looking for something besides the browbeating political crap so frequented here..  I, as I usually do, was day dreaming on my commute into work this morning and thought on a subject, so I will share.   When in a social setting and someone asks the inevitable question, "What do you do? / What do you do for a living?", I have now decided to answer in a different way.  A true way.  I have decided, as you might someday, that what I am is not what I do for a living.  It is everything else.  So, what do I do?  I, at least once a day, love to stand in direct sunlight. I enjoy rolling with my seat back and the windows down, weather permitting. I would love nothing more than to never have to leave the comfort of my home. Never having to make a phone call is happiness to me. I would call myself a writer, because, on occassion, I do write, or post at least. I am a dreamer. I Powerlevel.  Any of these, or a variation of, depending on the day, is now an acceptable answer, and one that you would get from me, if you dared ask what I do to Live.  And now, Moe, please follow this up with a link to something, so that we, together, will keep this a blog,and not a forum for my simpler minded posts.

      Things you won't find on the  urlLink website dedicated to stirring the waters of American hegemony ...  Bill Moyers, a well-respected journalist and aptly dubbed "Renaissance Man," has an article out talking about the  urlLink solicitation of the American Flag  by pro-war activists in an attempt to utilize the patriot vs. non-patriot argument.  Moyers' last line is brilliant:   Come to think of it, standing up to your government can mean standing up for your country.   While many will scoff at the source of this news, IslamOnline.net reports that  over 350 Iraqi civilians have died since bombing began one week ago .  The news is from Iraq, so it is to be taken with a grain of salt...but then again, remember that the  urlLink news we get in America regarding war  is also monitored by the government.    Another  urlLink article regarding news censorship , this one about the website  urlLink yellowtimes.org .  The scariest thing about all of this is that George Bush still has a high popularity rating, and the Democratic party is too busy giving Republicans rim jobs rather than create a platform that will encompass leftists wanting to vote but understanding that the difference between John Kerry and George Bush are a few shades on the environment, a different accent, and another month of negotiations before bombing occurs.  And while this last article does present an argument for why we're taking Saddam out now, it also makes sure to let us know that  urlLink this was well pre-meditated , and diplomacy was the last thing on George "Fuck Saddam, we're taking him out" Bush's mind.  Hooray for vengance!  I always sleep better knowing our government is killing people so I can buy shit I don't need.  MORE - I like how we can spin the blame of a  urlLink Baghdad marketplace bombing  onto the Iraqi government, because "given the behaviors of the regime lately, it may have been a deliberate attack inside of town."  Extreme leftists blamed the 9/11 attacks on the CIA and Bush's penchant for war and a missile defense system; I think that claim is ludicrous.  So is this one.  We're bombing the beejeesus out of this city, at least take responsibility when something goes wrong.

      John Pilger, a journalist and documentary filmmaker, does a good job of  urlLink refuting the American spin-job  regarding  Operation Iraqi Freedom&copy; .  Pilger has spent much time in the Middle East, shooting films and filing stories about the Israel/Palestine conflict, as well as Iraqi/US problems.  Once again, the message is clear -- the reason that the Iraqi people have suffered so greatly has as much to do with Saddam Hussein as it does with the economic sanctions placed on him by the US and Britain.    If we were fighting to liberate the Iraqi people, maybe I'd be for this.  But after watching us give the Taliban an out (give us Osama, keep breaking all sorts of human rights laws), I learned our interests have little to do with people, and everything to do with American justice and vengance.    Al-Jazeera is back in the news, in the same negative light it seems to find itself under in America.  The station, which was  urlLink banned  from the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, is also under fire from the US and Britain for its  urlLink coverage of the Iraqi conflict .  A new  urlLink english language website  that went public on Monday has already been hacked and seen major server troubes in the past 48 hours.   While the US likes to dog Al-Jazeera, it needs to be pointed out that the network is constantly lauded for its  urlLink groundbreaking coverage of conflict in the dictatorial-laden Middle East .  The countries that take issue with the paper include Britain, the United States, Iraq, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.  Why?  Because each says the paper is beefing up the opposition and making them look bad.  Interesting.

      ACADEMY AWARDS - While  urlLink Chicago  won for Best Picture, I am excited that  urlLink The Pianist  took home three big awards (Best Actor, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay), and that Pedro Almodovar won for Best Screenplay with  urlLink Talk to Her .  Kudos to Michael Moore for winning Best Documentary with  urlLink Bowling for Columbine , which if it were eligable for IMDB's  urlLink Top 250 Films , would be #2.  And anyone upset with Moore for using the stage as a bully pulpit, you haven't seen any of his work or read any of his books.  Good work on having large testicles, Michael Moore.    Speaking of war, interesting to see that MSN.com has a risque piece listed, regarding the  urlLink incredibly strong anti-American sentiment  in Iraq at the moment.  On Saturday someone tried to convince me that the Iraqi people were all for this regime change; while some might be, the numbers probably resemble those in America who would be estatic if George Bush was usurped from power.    My favorite article from today, though, regards Iraq's  urlLink serious deception  on the battlefield, and the breaking of War laws by fighting in civilian clothes and surrendering in order to bring the troops closer.  It reminds me a lot of how we fought the Revolutionary War, back in the days when armies would march to an area, look at their opponents, and then charge from there, not firing a shot until both sides were ready.  If I remember correctly, we hid behind trees and houses and structures in order to pick off soldiers as they were following the rules of war and marching peacefully through the streets.  "But they were marching through our streets," you may say.  Well, aren't we marching through Iraq's?

      A friend of mine who knows the girl who wrote this, Stefanie Shanebrook, her  urlLink account of Thursday's protest in Chicago .  This is in comparison to the account from the  urlLink Chicago Tribune .    For those who believe that the news media is interested in providing an unbiased Truth, I wish that  urlLink Fox 7 News  put archived clips of their newscasts on the internet so you could see blatant pro-war bias in news coverage.  For now, you have to trust me.  Last night's local Fox affiliate showed a piece on the anti-war rallies around Amercia.  It started with footage of the rally in New York, with the quip, "Rallies across America today as anti-war protesters came out in the thousands.  But not everyone was on the same page."  Follow that with a picture of a bearded, strung-out old man smiling and shouting, "Don't pay your taxes!"  Cut to a shot of police officers looking concerned.  Quote:  "But some fear that these protests are a detriment to national security."  Cut to a congressman talking about how paying these police costs money and manpower that could be used to fight domestic terrorism.  Cut to shot of people in front of a car racing track.  "And around the US, a number of groups have popped up to show their support for the President."  Cut to blonde woman holding baby.  "I support the President.  We're a military town, and of course we're going to support our boys in blue."  End segment.    So in that segment, they quoted one person from each movement; for the Pro-America folks, the epitome of womanhood.  For the anti-War folks, a buffoon.  They spent more time with the pro-America protesters, even though their numbers were dwarfed by the Anti-war protesters.  And they questioned the cost of these protests by saying it could fuel terrorism.  But they never questioned the cost of war.    A logical argument here would be this:  "Well, 75% of people support war. So don't you give 75% of the time to pro-America?"  You would, if stats were black and white.  But you have to look at the question being asked:  "Do you support President Bush in his Iraqi endeavor."  How I see it, there are 25% of Americans who do not support him and are willing to fight it; the 75% include those who support him as well as those who don't but are resigned to war because we're in it.  That's why the numbers shot up 25% since Wednesday.  It's not because we have more evidence now, it's because we're at war, and a lot of people don't think anything can be done about it, so why not get on the winning side.

      Since I can't find more than  urlLink party-line news  on the War with Iraq, I'll post some info on Austin-based protests.    As I mentioned before, there was a  urlLink campus walkout yesterday  that marched from the South Mall to The Drag, blocking traffic between 22nd and 27th streets on Guadalupe.  It was the most amazing sign of activism I've been privvy to, and while I had company in town who feels George Bush is doing the right thing, I was still able to spend 20-30 minutes with the protest.  A  urlLink more personal  account is here.  There are bad sides to protest as well...and Austin's had its share over the past 48 hours.  A UT Student was  urlLink bruised after an altercation  with UTPD officers...definition of "altercation" differs between both accounts.  And after a round of peaceful protests, a discrepancy in what to do with the night protesters left 30 arrested and many more suffering the effects of  urlLink pepper spray .  By the way, that photo essay from the last link is probably the best I've seen in a long time.

      There are two countries in the world where the majority of the population support war with Iraq:  the United States and Poland.  Now, I won't pretend to know what Poland is thinking (and I won't rehash the old 1995 love tryst with Julie Poland that resulted in me getting a hug...but no one remembers that Jesse Hopkins tried to *steal* her away from me at one point), but I can play grabass with the United States.  And there are two camps out there on why we're at war...      1)  We're at war because it is proven that Saddam has WMD/Saddam has ties to terrorism/Saddam hates puppies and freedom      2)  George Bush said so.    I am firmly entrenched in #2.  If you are in #1, I won't try to turn you to my camp.  All I want is the evidence that puts you in #1.    Protests in Austin today...about 2000 people showed up and blocked traffic near 24th and Guadalupe, chanting  1,2,3,4, we don't want your fucking war!   While I am not a great fan of American protests, this was the best one I've seen so far because it stopped traffic and caused people to recognize what was happening.  However, all they did was stop traffic.  How do we go from that to stopping war?    If anyone is looking for a picture of the Chinese activist I talked about yesterday, there is a link to a  urlLink blurb  about him...hit the top link.  Picture later.

      UT Journalism professor and well-known liberal activist Robert Jensen just published  urlLink his thoughts on war .  I haven't read them yet, but I usually agree with the guy.    Here's where we start to dance...  My favorite argument to hear from someone is, "Well, you're not there."  Just a few weeks ago, a friend of mine and I were debating the validity of the Bible; he believes it is the Word of God, I don't believe it is authentic in the way he describes.  We talk about ideas and processes for a while, and as I'm explaing the relativity of situations and the importance of understanding the location and timeframe that work comes from, he says, "Well Rolin, how do you know that George Washington lived?  The only people who know were the ones who were there."    That argument can be refuted by looking once again at history, location, peoples of the area, common practices and beliefs...whereas 3000 years ago the pursuit of Truth wasn't important at all, 300 years ago the documentation of an event as holistically as possible was paramount.  But since he wasn't willing to listen to that, I gave him two immediate responses to his "gotta see it" train.        1)  No shit.      2)  So what?    I just wrote a scene in my screenplay where a guy watches his girlfriend get killed.  I've never seen a loved one die a horrific death.  So can I honestly write that scene?  Yes.  There is no omnipresent line of sight existing in the world.  Film only allows people to watch a certain frame, but the cinematographer cannot stop the individual watching from looking at the work from his own personal perspective.    If I make my judgements based on what I read, you're damn right, Mr. Harr, that they are shallow and only capture what was given.  However, I do not make judgements based on what I read.  What I read is just a part of the judgement I make, which is why this death was, and still is, such a big deal to me...a bigger deal than most things that happen in the world.  Everything I have seen in life, everything I have read, every conversation I have watched, every eye tick, every flick of the wrist...they all come into composite and I make a judgement.  I often try not to judge, because there are multiple sides to all issues.  But sometimes, such as in this instance, I choose to have my own.    Rachel Corrie was not protesting war?  The Israeli army has embarked on a mission of genocide over the past 20+ years upon the indigenous Palestinian people of the area.  There are a number of national groups that protest these human rights atrocities, but they get little attention, because America's number one country for receiving aid is Israel. They're our unabashed ally; what Saddam Hussein is getting bombed for is what Ariel Sharon gets money from us for. Rachel Corrie isn't protesting for America.  Why does she have to be?  I often mention my distaste with protesting...it serves self-sufficient ends, is usually begun by rich kids, seems to be more about social interaction than changing the world, looks at things from one point of view rather than an open-minded approach, etc.  But for someone to fly to Israel and tackle this problem, that takes guts.  To stand in front of a bulldozer, that's a big ass deal too.  And when that Israeli decides to continue his mission, knowing he is going to kill someone, that's a huge problem.  That's something worth looking at.  Say it's a one-time deal, that it was an accident.  But are the murders of Palestinians in similar situations accidents as well?    One of America's favorite symbols for Democracy was the unknown Chinese man standing in front of the Chinese tanks at Tienneman Square...he just stood there to stop them.  We praise that picture, show the seeds of Democracy in  Red China , and show the power of the individual to overcome adversity.  Rachel Corrie is the opposite of that extreme.  Where we want to believe in the power of the individual to stop matters, we see a girl who tried and ended up dying for her effort.  Where we see the seeds of democracy, we see a "Democratic" nation that runs its army in a Stalinist manner.  Where we champion the strength of the Tienneman Square incident, the Rachel Corrie one gets pushed back to Page 5, because she's not fighting the infidels...she's protesting a government that we support full-heartedly.    I'm upset that she's dead, yes.  But do I feel that it's not her fault?  Not at all...she chose to go out there, and knew the risks, and while they might not have seemed evident to a 23 year old (imagine Matt Foley talking about wrapping the world around your finger and putting it in your pocket), with death all around her, she should have known that she was not immune.    What kind of war do you see?  Do you see all sides of war?  I hear about the 2000 pound cluster bomb that was dropped in Iraq near where Saddam Hussein was expected to be.  I don't hear of the "collateral damage" that was the result.  Another question:  what are you more likely to believe - Henry Kissinger's report on the War in Vietnam, or Oliver Stone's PLATOON (or Francis Ford Coppola's THE DEER HUNTER)?

      I am all about people protesting whatever they feel like protesting.  But, not to be the ass here, when a TRAIN is coming, I get off the damn TRACKS.  Protesting is one thing, but putting your life in danger to try to protest is another.  A strict investigation is underway means dick to me.  People stand in front of a huge bulldozer driven by a person that doesn't really care if you are in front of him or not.  Seems like a no brainer.  What do you think should be investigated here?  Possibly the intelligence of people in front of a bulldozer, shouting stop, instead of getting out of the way.  I truely do not think that stopping a building from being dozed over is worth the life of that individual.    Please do not tell me that this is what it takes to be heard.  Please do not tell me that this is the side of war we do not see.  That driver and that girl were not at war with each other, if so, she would have pulled a 9mm out and capped his ass.  She committed suicide from what I can tell.  She made a decision that what she was protesting was more important than her own life.  That is tragic, but that was not war.  The only people who truely see war are the people who fight them.  Everyone else sees what a blogger/news anchor/photographer/etc.. try to capture in a small sample of what that war is.  I am sure that on many points I have mentioned, that I might be wrong.  My opinions are only based on what I have read and heard, the same as the opinions you are making right now, about what you just read.

      NOTE: This photo is incredibly graphic...too much for me to look at more than once.  But it's the side of war we don't see.  Here's Rachel Corrie, the girl slain by the Israeli tractor,  urlLink minutes after being run over .  And a story about  urlLink her group dedicated to nonviolence .   The world is an incredibly fucking disgusting place at the moment.  George Bush, at Monday's facade of an ultimatum, you just shat on it even more.  No, I'm not an apologist for Saddam Hussein...he's pissing on the pile as well.  Why does this game of Who Has The Bigger Dick have to be violent?

      I had a great weekend where I did nothing but hang out with friends, throw the frisbee, and play EverQuest.  And I come back to reality to see that diplomacy and activism and  disagreements in foreign policy  haven't stopped George W. from helping Lockheed Martin's stocks rise and utilizing  Shock & Awe &copy; in order to depose Saddam Hussein.    I know I promised to stop talking war and write an essay, but I thought I'd have until March 31, Tony Blair's suggested deadline.  So blame him.  But the idea that we're saving the people of Iraq by inadvertantly killing thousands of them (which is what the US Government expects will happen as a byproduct of their war strategy) seems a bit off kilter.  I know that Iraqi life is not valued as much as Red-Blooded American&copy; life, but life is life, and if we are on a crusade of liberation, it would make the most sense to do this as quietly and pain-free as possible, rather than through a phantasmagoria of bombs that will destroy an historic city and render hundreds of thousands wounded or without adequate food, water, and shelter.    Since we're not concerned with the UN, and we aren't members of the International Court of Human Rights, why don't we just send in CIA cooperatives and assassinate Saddam?  Yes, state-sanctioned assassination is illegal, but so is unilateral war.  It's not deposing Saddam that angers the Middle East so much, it's 1)  the U.S seems to be as interested in flexing muscle as they are in deposing Saddam, and 2) a lot of innocent civilians will die, many many more than died in 9/11.    I'm tired of activism...we fight and fight and fight and our ally's military decides to  urlLink kill a protester .  They say on accident, but running her over with a tractor and then backing over her again somehow misses the idea of happenstance.  Nelson Mandela did not advocate terrorism, but he understood that signs and banners and rallies weren't enough...they could give you people for a movement, but public opinion means nothing when oppressed.  Terrorism is the next step; Mandela's group was interested in disrupting communication rather than War, and if it came to War it would be with militaries and governments, not civilians.  But how do we move past terrorism and to something else?  What is something else?  There must be something else?  We shouldn't have to kill people.    I think the reason we're going after Iraq (and Iran will be coming soon...mark that) is because we're afraid to look in the mirror and realize that our government treats the people of the Middle East in the same capacity (though modernized and covert) as South Africa treated the blacks during Apartheid rule.

      Please welcome  urlLink William Gibson  to the sidebar.  Gibson is the author of the revolutionary postmodern novel  urlLink Neuromancer , which holds a dear place in my heart as the last book I started and didn't finish.  I don't know...it was well-written, but the years and years of hype from  urlLink Bryan Alexander  and the rest of the  urlLink Centenary English Cabal  led me to believe this book was the be-all, end-all of literature.  It wasn't.    When I first started at the  urlLink Undermain Theatre , Kat Owens asked me what my favorite plays were.  I referenced some Mamet, some Shakespeare, some Athol Fugard (at the time I had never read Wallace Shawn)...she was impressed, but asked what contemporary playwrights I liked.  Fugard wrote in the 80s, Mamet in the 70s...the only playwright who I knew was producing works in the 90s was Christopher Durang and Douglas Carter Beane, but neither of them really did it for me.  Kat figured as much, and chalked it up to Univesity Bias.  Her theory is that professors and institutions set a standard for excellence in the past; that way, we don't have to reference the future.  It's why there are so many English students studying Chaucer rather than Richard Powers; if Chaucer got it right, why bother moving ahead?  The theory can be applied to so many other entities...for a different time.    I don't know if anyone out there plays Spider Solitare on the Windows XP platform, but the game is unbelieveably addictave.  I used to play daily, and got to the point where I could play two suits and finish off one suit before beginning the second suit.  But studies and semblance of a social life got in the way.  Now that I've been on break and spending the majority of my time in front of my computer attempting to write, I've resated the addiction.  Last night I finished writing at 2:30 am.  I figured I'd get one quick win at Spider the way I play it (one suit completely before the other).  That didn't happen until 4:45.  The worst part was, I got in this habit of looping Survivor's  I Can't Hold Back  every time I'd lose.  The only thing wose than that is I used to really enjoy that song.

      Somehow I ended up watching ten minutes of  Are You Hot?  on TV this evening.  That show is a spectacle of the highest nature.  No bones are made about looking to see the inner beauty of a contestant; it's all a celebration of the physical form, except rather than celebrate, there is much scrutiny.  While the people on stage are willing to put themselves through it (so I have no remorse for them when they're sad that they're not hot enough), it's amazing how many people are dying to judge others.  Of course, I was a proud surfer of  urlLink Hot or Not , so I am basically a hypocritical SOB.    Another beautiful day today.  I wrote ten pages, cooked myself some fish, and met a girl with the most beautiful wavy hair I've ever seen.  I'm working to stop overanalyzing present situations, so I went over and told her she had beautiful hair.  She was flattered, which was good.  She had very little to say about anything, which was not as good.  But I'll always remember the hair.

       urlLink South by Southwest , probably the most impressive festival to compile film, music, and interactive media, is in town all this week.  And I haven't been to a damn thing.  And I'm not going to go.  I had high hopes of catching some of the short films and maybe a band or two, but a number of things (including the ridiculous price for every event) have led me astray.  I was spoiled when the  urlLink Austin Film Festival  came through last October, and my department showered me with a free pass, mainly because this festival is a great one for screenwriters.  I attended several discussions (why are roundtable discussions always complete crap?  Two people who write for a living discuss their work like they're on  urlLink Charlie Rose , and they're asked the most ignorant questions by the public in attendance.  It's mass orgies of idiocy like this that make me glad I went to a  urlLink small college , where at least the orgies were smaller), but went to film showings every night.  And a lot of the films were terrible; I saw five films, and only enjoyed two.  But that was alright, because the films were free.  Had they cost $6 per, times would have been much tougher; you depend on a blurb and star power to figure out who you're going to see...every once in a while you get lucky and find one of your favorite directors has a  urlLink new film  out, but usually you're resigned to guessing and hoping you're lucky.    This festival is a great place to meet American indie directors, the exact kinds of people I want to talk to and sell my scripts to.  But therein lies the problem; I have no product I feel is adequate to sell.  Sure, I wrote  Three Strikes , a well-written piece about the paradox of the American Hero&copy; and threw in a nice Greek Tragedy subtext, but it lacked the breath of life that good films have.  My newest film,  Faith  is my attempt to infuse that life into a subject.  But it's not ready.  And I don't want to just latch on to some director without having anything of my own to reference and try to pitch.  So I work rather than play.    Buddhism is such an attractive religious practice.  I never really studied Buddhism nor the Zen side of it, and I still haven't read  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance , but studying the practices today, I can see a lot of value coming from it.  Is this an attack of Christianity?  Not at all.  But I've always had problems with Christianity, and everyone who has ever tried to answer my questions has given me the same rhetoric.  Problems in religion are perfectly fine, but when the religion sells itself as complete, the quandry is tough to ignore.  I don't think I can ever leave Christianity for a number of reasons, but ideas like Phil Jackon's Zen Christianity are incredibly interesting.

      My  Race, Media, & Cultural Studies  professor last semester, Craig Watkins, is  urlLink featured  on the  urlLink University of Texas  website today.  A few interesting comments on how hip-hop transcends music and provides a status and social outlet for black youth, and also a lot of white youth these days.    For anyone who watched the melba toast meeting that was President Bush's press conference last Thursday (which was scripted, meaning questions were submitted beforehand, and President Bush chose which he wanted to answer), here is a  urlLink list of questions  that  urlLink Editor & Publisher , a trade magazine, wished had been asked.  But considering Bush was asked 15 questions on Thursday and managed to answer the same three five different times each, I bet he could have worked his way into mentioning how evil Saddam is.

      Isn't it funny how articles like  urlLink this  don't seem to pop up in local news, do they?  Isn't that odd?  An article where the Elder George Bush shows disagreement with his son's penchant for war, and it doesn't get the slightest mention in national news.  Well done, American news media!  Rather than give me two sides of a coin, you play the game Bush Jr. asks and tell me  urlLink Iraq has more weapons , even though they consist of a drone plane similar to the one the UN used over America after September 11, and cluster bombs that could hold biological agents.  Unfortunately, it is evident they also could not hold biological agents, considering the ones we used in Afghanistan didn't.    I know I said no war.  NO WAR.  So today I'm pointing out the flaws of the unabashed trust we put into the local or national news.  We treat the news media like we treat God; their word is The Word, because why would they lie?  I understand about God, but if you believe in God, aren't you not supposed to deitize MSNBC?

      So a posting orgy it shall be.    I am very easily swayed by what I read and really do not have an opinion about going to war.  I thought for a while that we should just turn the whole area over there into one big sheet of glass.  And then I read something put up by Moe here and think that we have a person in charge that is slightly stupid and things are being handled about as badly as they possibly could.  Sometimes, I find myself wondering what kind of miracle it would take to call do-over and somehow change laws and what not and have Clinton work this shit out.  But alas, it is clear that I am somewhat uneducated on the whole situation and anything that has to do with it. So this is just a true perspective of an average American.  Anyway, you should do what will make you happy Moe.  And if spending time on the beach, writing and Leveling makes you happy, then so be it.

      The weather has been amazing in Austin the past three days; more so because of the crap we've had since February, but three days in the 70s with partly cloudy skies is nothing to complain about.  I played a round of golf on Sunday, shooting +13 with three pars, but having a terrible time chipping all day.  My driver was my best club, which is an odd statement; I hit four driver shots, and two resulted in pars, while the other two put me close enough to the green to chip over it and then back over it before getting it on the green to two-putt.  More golf this week.  And Corpus Christi!  First time to the beach since August.    Part of me wants to go to LA, get a job in the film industry, generate a sense of community with fledgling young filmmakers such as myself, and work my ass off with that internship and some job at Starbucks.  Another part of me wants to head up to Petaluma, get a job waiting tables or doing something menial, and spend a lot of time at the beach writing and living.  #2 sounds best.

      And Mr. Harr, I am glad that you are on board.  Which reminds me, if anyone else wants to post on here, please let me know and I'll sign you up.  Hopefully Yahoo!  will allow for CGI scripts in the near future so people can comment, but until then, we can all have a posting orgy.    I want to warn everyone that there will soon be a massive war-based essay on this site, to be followed by little or no mention of the Shodown with Saddam&copy; or the War on Terror&copy;.  I am vehemently against war, I think you guys know that.  And while the pestilence of our president irritates me, there is little I can say in a paragraph that will make a hoot of difference.  So I will put it all down into an essay, post a link here, and be done with it, except for passing various anti-war article links onto you, my reading brethren.    Those of you tired of my war ramblings, you can thank Barry Bitch Tits and Tommy Tucked In T-shirt for this revelation in my life.  But that story can wait for the essay.

      So I believe that there are moments in life when certain situations give people a little reality check.  Something happens to them or someone they know that makes them step back and really think about what is important to them.  For some people it is a tragic loss or an amazing victory, but either way, it is usually something profound to trigger the little process of evaluation of one's life.  This is the time, for a brief moment, that you take nothing for granted and live every minute for all it is worth.  Between these little moments is the grind that we go thru day in and day out.  With that being said, I am pleased to say that I have the honor to lay pipe on this fine board.    This is in no way a trigger for a moment of reflection in my life, but really a new part to my grind. May we all not take life for granted so much of the time.  Please do not expect to find me writing on literature, politics, drama, and all the other stuff that Moe enjoys.  I can only promise to write, which for me, is a major accomplishment.

      Interesting reading today...Former US Diplomat John Brady Kiesling  urlLink wrote a letter of resignation  from his post as US Ambassador to Greece, citing America's new unilateral position in the world, and how it is ruining foreign policy and international diplomacy.  And George Bush is doing a good job?  The  urlLink website  is slowly coming along, with the bulk of progress resting on the Essays page; if anyone is interested in seeing what I am filming as a final this semester, Daniel Abrego and I are working on  urlLink looking at whether people change once they win the money .  Interesting topic...tough to turn from abstract to concrete, but we're dealing with fun issues.  WOOT!    I'd say I am going to work on this website over the break and get more aspects running, but who am I kidding?  I'll write some screenplay, do some doc film, and drink a bit.  Maybe some RISK as well.  Everquest too?

      The difference in getting an A and getting a B on a documentary project might not always been in the content of the work, as I found out today.  My 90% A- project on debate became an 89% due to my failure to rewind the tape it was on.  Next time I'll pay the $1 fine.

      Good news, kiddos.  Summer employment is no longer an issue, as I was awarded a job at Duke's  urlLink Talent Identification Program .  I will work as a residental counselor (dorm dad) to incredibly smart high school kids at intellectual summer camps at Wake Forest and Duke.  My fan club at Bailey Middle School is forewarned, I should have a new one in North Carolina.

      For all of the shit wrong with Austin (elitist mentality in some art circles, tough job market, doubly so for non-Texans), this is the biggest city I know of where the mayoral candidates are accessable.  Election day for Mayor is May 3, and over the past four months I talked with four people running.  And not only are these candidates approachable, they are the craziest bunch of politicians this side of Palm Springs.    Most mayors I know are pretty crazy, actually.  The list:   John Sampier, Rogers, AR  - I played soccer with his son, and both of us played in the high school band.  The Sampier household was *not* one of the nicest in Rogers, though it was a treat.  Sampier was not crazy in his dialogue (a very calm voice, much like Bill Clinton), but more in his actions, such as bringing a call girl to the Mayor's Ball back a few years ago.  However, Sampier made the best speech at my high school graduation...very short, concise, and not full of himself:  "Love everyone."   Leo Kopecki, Schulenburg, TX  - Leo is one of the focal points for my collaborative documentary  Lotto, Texas .  Only two of the past 20 years have seen Leo out of office in the  Gateway to the Rolling Hills .  And while Leo looks to spend most of his time at his convenient store rather than City Hall, his rapport with people and ability to sell Schulenburg is what keeps him in office.  Now if he could learn math...   Sonny Bono, Palm Springs, CA  - I didn't really know Sonny.  My grandfather renovated a few rooms in his house before he ran for mayor, though I do have a great shirt from Sonny's run for office in 1988 (Sonny Bono for Mayor.  It's time for a change!) that gets me into trouble when I wear it (Have you no compassion for the dead?!).  I did sell Mr. Bono a raffle ticket for a youth baseball league back in the late 80s; he didn't win.  And my family ran into him in Hawaii a few years later, his arms wrapped around large boxes of kodak film stock.  His forthright movements did not stop my dad from engaging Sonny in conversation, though.    And now, there is a good chance that I can add one of the four listed below to the list.  Well, one really, because how the hell could anyone else win?  The candidates I know, in alphabetical order (guess who is going to win)  1)   urlLink Leslie Cochran  - The most recent to my cabal of candidates, Cochran approached me today outside of Tower Records with a wink and a "Hello, Sailor."  Most folks in Austin know Cochran; how many drag queens run for mayor and do little else?  Anyway, I said I wished her the best in the race, and was glad to know that she had some sort of a platform (basically, stop government subsidies to businesses and to Keep Austin Weird).  She wanted to continue the discussion, but I'm only interested in the candidates as politicans.    2)   urlLink Jennifer Gale  - I can't find a picture, so this link to her only endorsement for an election ever will need to suffice.   But faithful readers will remember Jennifer under a different name:  Barry Bitch-Tits.  Yes, Jennifer Gale is everyone's favorite Meat Loaf lookalike, except she is also a cross-dresser, and takes a bit of hormone....but still pre-surgery transgendered.  I will say that she is the only mayoral candidate who laughs at The Fonz's shenanigans on Happy Days reruns.    3)   urlLink Marc Katz  - Every mayoral race needs a deli owner.  Katz's Deli never Kloses, and Marc can't help it he's gotta tell ya!  I ran across Marc on campus on Friday; he was at a booth answering questions at the West Mall.  I stood in line for a while, and when I got up there told him I loved the restaurant (who didn't?) and asked about local business protection in the wake of national industry needing to surface to create jobs (I can BS questions really good).  He BSed a good answer, and told me if I voted, to find him and he would give me a ticket for a free dinner!  I was so excited, I gotta tell ya, until I got a mass email for all of UT that said the same thing.  I don't have to vote for him, though.    4)   urlLink Will Wynn  - The lone city representative running for this office.  I met Wynn while a boom operator on a film shoot; Wynn was the keynote speaker at this Tree Day celebration, and while the people milled about, I stopped him and asked him about the city.  His information on the city was astounding, and his interest in civic organizations and the arts was a dream come true to this bleeding heart, bedwetting liberal (and to think he's considered the most conservative person in this race...that happens when you run against transvestites and the quirky all-night deli owner).  He holds endorsements from almost every city organization, and he reminds me of Dawson Taylor.    If you're interested, the most recent transcript of a debate is at the  urlLink News 8 Austin  website.    So who to vote for?  The guy who hit on me, the guy who I love to make fun of with Brian, the guy whose restaurant I adore, or the guy who wold make a good mayor?  Too bad I'm not registered in this city.

      Changes to the blog:  I'm in the process of moving my web sphere to a free site via the University of Texas.  This is only because I don't have the time at present to really get etaoinshrdlu.net cooking; it sucks, because this is a domain I've wanted for years (I'd rather .com than .net, but whatever), but is there really a reason to pay $12/mo when I get a site for free?  There might be, because UT has such strict FTP and cgi-bin access that I spent two hours today trying to set the blog up over there, to no avail.  Also, I might have signed a 1 year contract for etaoinshrdlu.net, so I might be stuck here.  And it's not bad; I just want the site to be so much, and while it's not, why pay for a full-out domain?

      Grad students really don't get weekends; we think of them as days we can catch up on our work.  So I'm here at Spiderhouse Cafe,  urlLink writing a review  of a documentary I just saw,  urlLink Hecho A Mano:  Tres Historias de Guatemala .    Between outbursts of gainful work betwixt hours of grabass, Clare, the sound engineer on my first short project about debating, mentioned a Johnny Cash cover of Nine Inch Nails' HURT.  Cash has been a favorite of mine since 1997, when I first listened U2's  urlLink Zooropa  (he provided lead vocals for  The Wanderer ) during make-out sessions with Melia Woods.  The love for Melia was short-lived, but I still go to bed with the Cash man on a nightly basis.  This love was reaffirmed when Stig Nielsen, Centenary's greatest drunken Danish exchange student, sang three Cash songs at a talent show in 2001.  This was before he fell through the ceiling of Cline Hall after exploring the attic.    So I hooked up to  urlLink launch.com  and had a gander at the video.    I was floored.    I think Cash is a great singer in the many genres he has surfaced in.  But this song's simple refrains and chords turn into such complexities when Cash provides his despondent, soulless vocals.  Cash looks less like the hunk he was known as in Dukes of Hazzard circles and more like a modern-day Kirk Douglas, which accentuates the difference between the Cash then and the Cash now.  I wish I knew more and had the time to really talk about this, because it is truly amazing.    I heard the song before I saw the video.  I loved the song by itself.  With the video, it is more than incredible.    Daddy sang bass, mama sang tenor.  Me and little brother shared my empire.  of dirt.     MORE:  Who knew MTV would be a  urlLink source for Johnny Cash news ?  MSN.com's usually poorly-written urlLink Slate  magazine talks about Cash too.  And a  urlLink blog reference  that is better written than anything I'd produce.    FYI, I've spent the past two hours looking at this and listening to Hurt.  I don't know who doesn't know about this, but it is one of the most amazing songs I've ever heard.  And it is a cover.  Incredible.

      Ahhh, the power of cross-sectional data.  I am working with the  urlLink General Social Survey 1997-2002 Codebook  in trying to figure out what kind of people draw negatively from religious coping.  I can't post my variables, but go in there, play around a bit, and see if you can come up with something.  And NEVER tell a graduate professor that you can write a stats-based paper when your life in the field consists of a general course where you dicked around with a calculator and booted up SPSS once or twice.    JOB SEARCH UPDATES - Things started off with me casting my lots and moving up to Northern California, where I would rule the surf and women through charm, wit, and uncanny ability to reference episodes of Perfect Strangers.  But money got in the way, so to San Diego it was!  But money is still in the way.  Grad students just can't really save money; you get some cash for school, and some loans to pay for the semester, but once the semester is up, that's the end.  Somehow I've staved off enough food and necessities to where I can pay for most of the month of May, but after that I'm greasing in shitter's canyon.  So I'm looking at the dirty Arkansas for two months; get a decent job, make some decent money, pay little or no rent, and hang out with some folks I haven't seen on a day-to-day basis since 1997.  Can my name and clout as Rogers' most eligible High School Student (1996) get me a job teaching writing at NWACC?

       What I Learned This Weekend :       - The  urlLink Power Hour  isn't the name of Robert Palmer's  urlLink group  in the early 80s.  Also, some people prefer to play the "sleazy 50" or the "pansy 45" rather than the whole 60.        - There is a  urlLink double helix  that defies science and genetics.      - Golf, golf.  Golf golf golf.  Golf golf golf golf golf golf rug.        - In Austin, there are nightlly guitar circles at a plethora of venues, strumming out Ani DiFranco and The Indigo Girls, among others.  And unless there is a new Pro-America Ani album out, I don't think the guitar circles in Rogers, Arkansas play the same things.        - Cover bars suck in most college cities.  But people still go to them.        -  urlLink Showtime  is one of the best television networks out today, and while Penn and Teller's show  urlLink Bull Shit  didn't have the zest of any Michael Moore-led comedy documentary,  urlLink Family Business  could be the greatest show ever.  Well, except for  urlLink The Tortellis .      - I am the only person in the world who would TiVo  urlLink 227 .      - The green on hole #9 at The Links in Lowell is shaped like the State of Arkansas.  Favorite pin position - Forrest City.  Most balls land closer to Vicksburg, Mississippi though.

      The Pro-America camp likes to argue against protesting with the following point:  "Your ability to protest and think the way you do is supported by our government.  We are fighting for that."  Well, we must not be doing too good a job of supporting freedom at home when organizations like the Baseball Hall of Fame  urlLink cancel a tribute to Bull Durham  because actors Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon are anti-war, a stance that the President of the Hall says "puts the men on the battlefield in danger."  That quote - fascism.  Exercising the right that Tim and Susan are - democracy.    I mean, doesn't anyone find it odd that the anti-war people are the people who have protested our government's inability to usurp dictators who violate human rights?  Governments in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Yemen, Uzbekistan, and other places treat their people much worse than Saddam did his.  Yet the Pro-America folks are willing to look past that lack of action and instead rejoice in Saddam's fall.    The push for war truly started in September, when Bush cited Iraq as a threat to the United States.  It was about disarming Iraq.  Then it was about regime change.  Now it's about the liberation of people.  Why?  Because the weapons aren't there.    I want a government that doesn't spin itself one way when it suits them, and then goes another depending on how the wind is blowing.  If you want to liberate people, stop supporting dictators in Saudi Arabia and those other countries.  Stop supporting Israel.  Work it across the board.    If we would just sit and think about things, they would make sense.  Why is the majority of the free world (and almost all of the dictatorial world) against this?  Party line answer = because they don't have the balls to do anything.  Does that really make sense?  If Iraq was a viable threat, wouldn't every country want him gone, as to not repeat World War II and Hitler.  Ahh, Hitler.  He comes up so often in conversation.  Anti-war folks calling Bush Hitler.  Pro-America folks saying that we have to act so we don't have another Hitler.  Both are wrong.  Bush isn't Hitler any more than Clinton was; Bush is just a little more mindless than the quite mindless Clinton.  And considering that Europe went to war with Hitler two years before America did, the argument that Europe is afraid of this guy doesn't hold shit.    Objective viewpoints.  This  urlLink blog entry from Harvard  is supposed to be ironic.  At least I hope.    Who is to blame?  How about we take a page from  urlLink Bowling for Columbine  and say THE MEDIA.  It's all about perspective.  The media doesn't give us any.  They spend six months talking about Iraq and its disarmament, and suddenly, when the United States decide to go to war and label it OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM&copy;, the media steps in line.  And that's what they think is right:  "We're just calling it what they call it."  Well, by doing that you're immediately slanting the coverage to an American standpoint.  And you're pretending that past history didn't exist.  The rhetoric about "Iraqi Freedom" only started after Bush realized that disarmament didn't hold water.  But after a month of Operation Iraqi Freedom&copy;, people forget about that and see this as a vigilante mission, or a freedom fight.  The media is bias because of its penchant to be unbias, and report "The Day's News."  But the day's news means nothing without perspective.

      I am still anti-war, but I am not trying to change the fact that we are at war.  We're there.  It's wrong, but we're there.  Hopefully we can get out ASAP and let the UN do their job.    Notice how tired I am of war rhetoric?  My verbose, elitist vehicles of discourse were abandoned in the last sentence just so I could get the shit out.

      Texas is going to the Final Four for the first time in 56 years, and  urlLink Page 2's  Jim Caple  urlLink has the scoop on this football town .  I think I've talked about my problems cheering for Texas in anything.  I can't bring myself to do it.  I've been pushing upset every game so far, and I'll be cheering for Syracuse tomorrow.  There's support for the notion that we spend our adult lives reconciling childhood issues.  I can't cheer for my current institution.

      I was going to take today off from war blogging, but I can't seem to get away from it.  I'm lucky in that I can even try...America allows its citizens to forget about the world around them.  For those who believe the US Military to be pristine, turns out a Human Rights Organization is  urlLink concerned about the 84% accuracy of cluster bombs  used in the war effort.  Also, Switzerland, home of the Geneva Convention office that documents POWs and civilian casualties in war times, is going to  urlLink document US and British war crimes .    In something that can only be described as embarassing, Austin isn't only known as the Live Music Capital of the World&copy;, but also as the home of  Texas pro-America zealots .  It's funny that at the end of the article the fellow quoted says that he believes the media to be anti-war in scope; I feel it's the complete opposite.  Someday I'll discuss Statistics 101 and how a Yes or No question denies allowance to answer a question honestly, thus upping a certain side that gets the swing votes.  Making a long story short, when 72% of people support war, it doesn't mean that 72% support war; it means that 28% are vehemently against it enough to not fear retribution or social unrest for saying so.    Dan Wearsch, Diana Kolman, and I can tell you that the news is never the truth.  The  urlLink differing accounts of the seven dead civilians at the army checkpoint  should help prove that.  Also, there are differeing opinions on what will happen in post-Saddam Iraq, including reports of  urlLink secret US-backed initiatives to keep control .  Both  urlLink Belgium  and  urlLink Germany  have expressed recent outrage at the US-led war.    George Monbiot of the  urlLink Guardian  gives a  urlLink less-than-stellar prognosis  of what war will do to the Middle East, and to the world.  This war did not have to happen.  At least not like this.

      My grandmother and I ate lunch at Sherman's, a jewish deli on Tahqueitz Canyon, just off the beaten path of tourists and art galleries.  Sherman's is one of my favorite places...a low-key Katz's, with comparable prices, larger plates, and better lox.  We ate on the patio and talked about life in Palm Springs, my sister's attempt at buying a house, and plans for the rest of my vacation with her (she loves plans).  The check came, and my grandmother tipped $3, less than the requisite 15%...for someone who experiences no economic hardships, it wasn't a glorious move.  The waitress came by, picked up the money, saw the tip, and thanked us greatly.  She looked at me and said  I've waited on you before .  It's quite possible, I said, I come into town twice a year.   Oh, wow...I thought it was a lot more recent.  How time flies.   I smiled, laughed, thanked her for her service.   You are so great to spend time with your grandmother...that is so kind.   I don't do well with flattery, so I tried to schlepp it off, saying it might have as much to do with the city as it did with my grandmother.   Poppycock!  You are a great boy.  More kids need to be like you.   She smiled and left, making sure that I would bring my grandmother back for another Sherman's feast next time I was in town.  Before the awkwardness wore off, my grandmother commented on the situation:   She really liked you, but she didn't even look at me!   So am I going steady with the waitress?  Her salad days are behind her...probably her entree days too.    When I think of Palm Springs, I think of two distinct times in two distinct places at two distinct points in the year.  One happened again today.  I went with Frank to the gym this afternoon...it's a bunch of geriatrics out there who go more to chat than to work out, and I know most of them, and we talk about what's new in school and life and with the family, and usually what's new with the girls (it's funny how far the phrase  you know  can take you with naked old me in the shower).  I pull 30 minutes on the bike, hit the upper body weight machines, and then get in the outdoor pool for a while.  The gym connects to the old Oasis Water Park, now a subsidary of Knotts Berry Farm.  I get in the pool, create a floatation device with several noodles, and lie down on the raft, head mostly in the water, listening to the jets of the pool and looking up at the sky.  After five or ten minutes, I look up at the mountain skyline, and then out at the folks at the water park, often trying to catch the bikini beauties floating in the lazy river (I truly believe that I'll meet my next serious girlfriend in a lazy river...only because I plan to spend as much time as I can in life immersed in whatever lazy river is available).  Then back to the pool and the raft and slowly floating around in the solitary water.  The view is spectacular, the sun cooks you a beautiful unhealthy golden brown, and nothing I know has ever brought me more relaxation.  Last summer, I lost 90 minutes in the pool doing this...never again have I matched that output, but only because I am looking for it.    I would be much more productive if, on a daily basis, someone reminded me of short film festivals.  Palm Springs puts on a great short film festival in August, something I always try to time my visits with.  Because of TIP, it's a no-go this year, only my second miss in seven years.  Thinking about it today, I found inspiration to write on some of my short subjects.  The goal is to get in this, have my work up for viewing for a public, hopefully get some people in the audience as excited about film as I get when I go.  Last year I saw UT alum Steve Collins' great short LONEYLAND featured there.  To make my own LONEYLAND, I need you all to pester me.  Or I need someone to horsewhip me.  Oral sex wouldn't hurt either.    Imagine getting oral sex because you asked for it on your blog.  And then as you write your blog.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 3a - Palm Springs, CA   Last night my grandparents took me and my dad out to dinner at Atlas, a ritzy retro restaurant/disco in prime position on the Palm Canyon Drive strip.  Thursday is Street Fair night, and all of us on this side of the family enjoy people watching, or "the festival of the passing parade" as my grandmother oft mentions.  Since it's summer, most of the tourists are out of town, meaning a number of merchants didn't show up...so the fair was pretty low-key, maybe 1000 people out, looking at pottery, art, glassware, or learning about what the Shriners do for the kiddies.    I love all of the people in California who shamelessly promote themselves and their wares.  After dinner, my grandparents and I walked the fair.  Our first stop was BELLANDO, a muscle-bound man with Whitesnake hair, wearing Fabio's wardrobe and armor left over from the shooting of Gladiator.  He played an electrical violin, soundtracked by canned synthesizer.  He stood on a foot pad because in front of him was a mix of mood lighting shining on his cherubian face, as well as a mini-fan that gave his hair the windblown look needed by any synthesized violin player at a street fair selling Yanni meets Harlequin Novels CDs.  His wife was the one selling the CDs; there were four, all with the same cover design, just in different colors.  I thought they were all the same CD; she said no, and turned to fawn over her musician.  I don't see how they couldn't be; the guy had one riff he could play, a Berlioz meets ELO A major scale that haunts on the final A.  I heard it at least 20 times.  I also heard him play a B flat scale and a C major.  When he adds a few minor scales to it, I'll consider buying.  Or if he switches to chain-mail armor.  Or lambent.    The little girl in the Welch's Grape Juice commercial looks like my aunt Phyllis.  Phyl is not asian.  She's a short 65 year old woman with the same facial structure and haircut as the girl.  I can't help but imagine her selling grape juice every time I see the commercial.  Someday I will ask her to pitch me a glass of grape juice.  Maybe if the girl goes down with the gout or some other fetid injury, my aunt can be her fill-in.   We got into Palm Springs yesterday afternoon, driving down the canyonside, listening to my dad tell stories of his youth, when he felt like he owned the city.  Several times he was arrested for his tom-foolery, such as stealing flags from the courthouse, trespassing on private golf courses, and sneaking into drive-in movies.  It's always the best part of the trip with him; his eyes light up, he gets excited about where he is, and his stories move, they don't meander in purgatory for minutes, instead punctuated by other memories that require quick telling before the next memory takes over.    All of this energy dissipates once we get back to my grandparents' house.  For the past seven years, the routine has been the same.  We walk in, to boisterous talk, hugs from me, and a few silly jokes that I tell, hoping to avoid the fated instances soon to occur.  I put my stuff in the guest room, and then the trouble ensues.  I end up going into the bathroom, my favoirte bathroom ever.  I usually sit in there for several minutes, just looking around.  When I get out, the family is in the sun room; my grandmother at the table, my dad in a rattan chair, and Frank (my pretty much grandfather) on the couch.  At this point, it is too late; positions are taken, and they're waiting for me to get into the blocks.  I meander for a while, but they sit quietly.  Finally, I succumb and sit down.  My dad then gets out a manilla folder, opening it slowly as he provides the unnecessary background:  As I work on the computer, I come across these emails and other bits of fun from friends like Big Al, Frank Farmer, you know.  I don't know, I just think they're fun.    My dad proceeds to read 15 or 20 email jokes, some witty, most not.  My grandmother laughs at each one, Frank doesn't really pay attention.  After the jokes are the newspaper clippings...my dad has piles for each of us on articles we might find interest in.  To this day, I have gained insight from one article he cut out for me, and it was a movie review on the back of the article he wanted me to read.    I'm flying through this because I want to get to the killer...my dad's assortment of kitsch.  After the newspaper articles (always prefaced with  read these if you want, I don't know, I just thought you might be interested ), he pulls out the odd stuff...fortune cookies, postcards, religious pamphlets...this trip it was a place setting from a chinese restaurant, the kind with the Chinese Zodiac on it, giving the years for each and theory on the people born in each.  He gets it out, and my grandmother immediately laughs; oh, look at that!  My dad smiles, and explains to all of us how the Chinese Zodiac works:   China is a land of superstition...there are twelve years in correlation with the twelve animals of the continent...   When I question the historical accuracy, my dad mentions that this is all in good fun... c'mon Rolin, this is fun, don't be so serious.   He then places the menu in front of me.  There are notes on it.  Sections are highlighted.  He points to one highlighted place.   Read that .  His index finger is in the air, holding attention, waiting for me to mechanically relate his point.  I refuse.  The highlighted section refers to his former girlfriend/ex-wife (long story) of five years ago; turns out this menu says they were not compatibale...year of the dragon versus year of the dog.  Written above year of the dog is SHARON; above year of the dragon, AL.  Highlighted under each is DRAGON IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH DOG, or vice versa.   It was written long ago that this wouldn't work out  he says.  When I mention that my mom is listed as a compatible mate for his animal, he puts the menu away.   I was just wanting to have some fun .     I will sit at the pool a lot today.  Probably go to the gym.  Enjoy the area.  This place can be a great haven.    I watched some CNN this morning...there was a 40 minute segment about Iran.  Are we going to war with Iran?  Wait, I thought Bush said we wouldn't go to war with them, they hadn't confronted us, they hadn't attacked before, there was nothing to show that they were against us....Axis of Evil, but not perpetuating.  Now they are.  I plan to protest until I am silly once this new band of shit starts.

      Fuck this...an hour-long post about my dad just got deleted.  It sucked anyway; quite honest and telling, moreso than a blog should be, but something so important should never be shown in first draft, and once it hits second draft, the honesty is gone.  It's the folly of writing.  It's why I am struggling at the moment.  Hopefully I can pass that problem and make this shit happen again, because a screenwriting grad student who isn't writing screenplays is just another grabass jackass.  So why am I not writing a screenplay?    Padres lost another heartbreaker.  Two losses in three days that were decided in the last out of the game.  It's almost too much to watch.    Tomorrow is Day 1 of Honesty Relationships.  I should copyright that, sell it to power lunch business gurus in LA, put inspirational phrases and quotes from people with funky names from funky times on colored index cards, pass them out near the smoothie stand, smile a lot, wear suspenders, and talk in the energy meets radio voice about feelings.  What is funny is I'm embarking on a road of telling people to fuck off.  I love people...I have a lot of friends, and a lot of great friends, and some good friends who hopefully will become great friends...I live to inspire others.  I don't live for the bullshit.  Bullshit equals fuck you.    I want to rewrite my entry, but I'm tired and I promised myself that free internet porn would be my reward if I posted tonight.  Most nights, the writing wins out.  Tonight it's porn.  Who is walking the plank at Captain Lust.com?

       No witty title this time...except the other titles weren't witty either...   I talked to three high school girls at the pool today...it was just 2 pm, so I figured they had to be older than high school, as their body development solidified community college types, in my mind. Nope, 18 and ready for graduation from Orange Glen High School. But any thoughts of illicit doings with them ended when one confessed that she once dated my former stepbrother. My former stepbrother who is five years younger than me. My former stepbrother who is one year older than this girl.  I lie. They were hot. They had energy. They wore bikinis. Now I sit with a phone number and a dilemma. FEAR NOT, blog readers! I won't call. But if I see them at the pool again...  My dad and I had the talk. He didn't listen. He never does...were he to listen, he might actually do something about it, and then he can't blame my mom, my former stepmom, his mom, my sister, or the Mexicans for his joblessness, poor health, and low quality of life. I mentioned that our lack of communication for five months was a telling sign in the weakness of our relationship. "We were busy," he said. Somehow, I talk to my 40 hour work a week mom probably twice a week, but my 40 drink a week dad I don't? "We're talking now," he says, sipping the house red. "So you can finish your wine," I reply. "How does this fit into a script?" he retorts.   I want to write about porn. But how do I go into a video store and seriously ask for Girls Gone Wild? I honestly need to see Girls Gone Wild as research for this script. Regardless of your questionable thoughts regarding my content, this makes writing more exciting than researching something for an agriculturally-based plot sequence.  Bob Jensen doesn't believe in porn; according to several who witnessed a presentation of his on the subject, he finds conventional porn to belittle women. No argument there. But what about showing female pleasure in porn, or female power? What about porn produced by women? What about fetish porn, where both parties succumb to any odd trial? There is a lot of porn that questions the moral feminist argument against porn. But the main point is, porn is almost completely consumed by men (how many girls have an "other video" folder on their KaZaa desktop?). That makes porn the only consumable where the consumers hold more power than the producers.

       How is it hotter here than it is in Austin...   10:35 am PST:  Starbucks avoidance ends.  decaf grande americano, three sugar in the raw, and a smattering of half and half.  de-lish! 10:36 am PST:  Realization of weakness begins.  Howling and renting of clothes ensues.    Great moments with mothers of childhood friends - Elma, the mother of my friend Mike, kicked her son in the shin, used profanity twice, and let Mike know that "I could still kick your ass" this morning.  When we were six and seven, this woman regularly put the fear of God into me.  Like no one had, or has yet to do again.  Just the mention of the Three Cub Scout Bites causes gagging and loss of bowel control.     Dreams the past few nights both happened in Grand Theft Auto-designed cities.  Last night's was in Galveston; there was some time-share that me and a bunch of friends had, and we were hanging out in the hot tub, but I was supposed to be working on a website with Brian Thomas.  I went to help Brian, but started playing grabass with a few girls downstairs.  Time passed, and I ran into Lauren Jackson, who invited me back to her apartment, but with ten other people.  There I found out that my grabass stopped me from seeing her in a bikini.  And I was upset.    I woke up this morning with that dream full in mind, remembering specific sequences and events.  Immediately, I wanted to grab a pen, write it down, pull a Leonard Shelby.  But the couch I was on was comfy, lived-in (probably fornicated on, but I can ignore that), and too soft to move from.  I switched on Sportscenter, and now, hours later, all I have is that dillapidated (and poorly spelled) account of what was an envigorating dream.  Damn you, blogger, for requiring a logon prompt and internet access!

       Southern California...where Carl's Jr. is Carl's Jr. and not Hardees...   The newest beer to grace my holy list of thrifty beverages -  urlLink Lucky Lager .  It's actually not too terrible; I drank two before the euphora of new cheap beer wore off.  The best thing about Lucky is its container; there are no cans of lucky, just Red-Stripe bottles, and the beer comes in an industry-standard cardboard box, making the purchaser look like a party thrower or conissuer of fine things that are best bought in bulk.    Of course, if you've ever tasted Lucky, you just think this person is a cheap ass.    The cheap beer story - I really don't have anything specific.  I remember one instance where Daniel Harr and I were talking beer, and he mentioned Stroh's, at the time the shittiest beer he had tasted, a concoction so vulger its can was half red, half blue, with the word STROH'S on it.  My beer of choice at the time was Sapporo, an expensive Japanese brew found at sushi restaurants that makes a good double-switch with saki and california roll.  Anyway, while the conversation went on, I sat in wonderment of this famed shit beer that only Harr truly knew.    Today, I don't drink all that good of beer, and when I do, I really don't like it.  High Life is the standard; I like how the tall boy feels in my hand, I like how I look when I'm holding one, I like how I talk to people as I sip and smile...I just need the wife-beater, chaw, farmers tan, and pot belly to get in one of those commercials, slapping brisket or changing up the ring in a toilet bowl.  But when I can find something worse, I go for it.  Worse is Pabst Blue Ribbon, Extra Gold, or the Beast.  Busch doesn't really get any love in my court, and if you try to be cool and mention Natty Light (when I get on a cheap beer tirade and someone says "Hey, I drink Natty Light," I want to kick them in the face indiscriminately...have you no adventure?), I won't even smile and nod...it's straight onto my fical roster.    But the truly bad beer seems to be regional or specialty; it's as tough to find the crap as it is the love.  And those who are willing to look can find gold:  Stroh's, Olympia, Hamm's, and now Lucky.  These are the beers that sell cheaper than soft drinks, the ones that get you the, "alright, chico, you go have that party and i'll stay right here" look from the 45 year old counter attendent who was checking you out once you walked in, wetting her lips for a rendezvous in the backroom on top of a crate of Corona.    At Trudy's on my 23rd birthday, I was offered the customary free birthday drink.  I asked for the cheapest beer they had.  A seductress who now dates a good friend conned me into getting some sort of margarita with lots of alcohol, but when that was tapped, it was on to the crap.    When I worked at UT-Arlington, I was clocked at 93 words per minute.  It was the fastest time ever clocked by human resources there.  As I work on my writing and film and self, I realize that I am better at typing than I am at anything else.

       Living the San Diego life...   My friends live in Rancho Bernardo/Poway/Escondido...an assortment of suburbs and cities on the outskirts of San Diego's North County.  Whereas Austin is Austin, Round Rock is Round Rock, Arlington is Arlington, and Fayetteville is Fayetteville, most everything around San Diego is part of San Diego.  Mesa, El Cajon, Carmel Mountain, La Jolla, Del Mar...different school districts, and I'm sure there is issue with public service and the like, but it all goes into the San Diego census.  So San Diego is the sixth largest city in the US, but there is no true surrounding area to talk to; its metro area is a small bit larger than its city, so it's honestly maybe the 20th largest city in the US.    We went to a bar in RB called the Instant Replay; Colin and Mike say it's always been there, right next to the Edelweiss Bakery and Dicrenzensio's Deli (two Westwood Shopping Village favorites of mine from the 1980s; the RB Sports Shop on the other side of the fashionable strip mall used to make the best knock-off gatorade to touch human lips; I'm sure they mixed in quaaludes).  But I'd never been.  The place looks like a small version of Austin's Showdown Saloon, and the bartender just moved from the 183 area (working at a bar called the Castrated Cattle or something).  Both Instant Replay and the Showdown feature Big Buck Hunter, one of the greatest drunken video games available to play, where you grab a sticky orange gun off the console and fire at deer on screen; when you hit one, you get an instant replay and even commentary from a "pro hunter" or something... that deer had no chance, shot right in the neck with precision .  Some guy who I don't remember, but he makes money in the internet world and wants to start a website to sell knock-off Starbucks items, owned the game, with finesse shooting and conservative bullet usgae.  Colin and I sucked, with Colin the better of the bad.  "This is why liberal arts folks shouldn't carry guns," he said, and we drank to Karl Strauss, San Diego's version of Shiner Bock beer.  I always want to explore San Diego when I come into town; nothing against the family, but at 23 (or 21, or 16), I'm not too keen on heading out to the Gaslamp District with my dad or grandparents, looking for drinks and conversation and unattainable action.  But my friends don't know the city.  They know Rancho Bernardo/Poway/Escondido.  I'm impressed that they've opened their eyes to the wonders of Mira Mesa, but we're still talking 15 miles north of SD proper.  And while all of us have expressed interest in seeing what San Diego has to offer, we've never done it.  Pool at Instant Replay or any other 50 cent table bar in town seems to win out, not to mention that Colin owns one of the greatest video game collections known to man, and he lives in one of the few white trash sections of San Diego, which is just worth visiting to wash away the skin of SoCal pretention that comes with any visit.    I am on the internet at this late point in the morning because when I woke up to log on, the phone service was disconnected.  My dad is a fan of living a high class lifestyle on a workless budget; we ate a $30 lunch yesterday, but he doesn't have phone service today.  We'll probably play golf today or tomorrow, but his debt is much larger than I'd ever like to admit.  A witty comment would fit here, but I'm not sure if this is witty or just sad.  And it's neither...it's just the way things are with him.  I see my parents both twice a year, during the summer and during Christmas, giving one two weeks and another one week.  This allows them to grow quite old while I'm not around.  I used to come and visit and want to lounge around, take time off and not worry about working or doing anything strenuous.  These days, I want to clean, paint, fix problems, and get both of them on some sort of course, rather than the obligatory "I need to get to that."    Too nice outside to be on the blog...a crazy dream about my roommate getting stoned and drunk and driving me around, and driving into a Vice City-esque Little Haiti (but Chinese), expecting me to get the car out of there.  He told me to go inside the house and I did, and I fell asleep, and woke up and he was gone and I had to run six miles home.  I was pissed when I got there, probably because I didn't have the Uzi-9 in case I ran into the Cubans.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 3 - San Diego, CA   I don't think my parents ever moved past their divorce.  Sure, my dad married and divorced again, but both mom and dad live life in a holding pattern, spurring large chances and settling for excitement in more of a "merge without checking the blind spot, but the signal is on...who would even think to merge without the signal on?" fashion.  I've felt this way for years; every time I visit one, the other parent is mentioned frequently by the parent I am with, and I sit and listen to bitching about alcohol or money or sex.  But walking into my dad's condo is an enterance into a life that doesn't move forward, yet isn't stuck in the past...just kind of a life that is there.    In 2000, my dad's door knob on the front door broke; he took it out and bought a replacement knob.  Today, the knob sits on a stack of 1970s Life Magazines in the entryway (first moved to entryway = August 2002).  "I need to get that done," he says.     In 1999, my stepmom left my dad.  This created many areas of space in the condo, most notably the garage.  My dad collects historical artifacts; he planned to make a faux office to put these in...his current office is already full of brickabrack and kitsch.  Today, the new collectables sit in a pile in the garage.  In 2001, my dad's guest toilet went on the fizz, requiring a new stopper.  I bought it with him.  Today, the stopper sits in a bag in his office.  Anytime I want to use the crapper, I have to fill the back of the toilet up with 15 jugs of water just to get a weak flush.  Floaters are always precarious; the weak drain always presents a possibility of remnants, nothing anyone wants in the morning.   Since I'm so open about my shits here, I feel no embarassment in saying that shits at my dad's house smell different than anywhere else.  I make this realization every time I visit out here; that first BM comes, and within seconds I'm sniffing around, wondering where the mix of ammonia and old death is coming from.  And I always realize it's me.  Can it be, and that bathroom just holds smell like no other?  I want to believe that there is something else wrong with the toilet, and everything that enters is filled with putrid putridness.  On the flight this morning, I looked through the window at the vast farmland outside of Phoenix; miles and miles of irrigated land, surrounded by a moat of pavement, keeping the traditional desert at bay.  If I could paint, I'd paint flyover farmland...the geometry of sustenance, soundtracked by Delta Airlines'  Easy Listening &copy; favorites...a box maze of greens and browns and yellows.  Today, as we passed over, I saw several sectioned off plots dusted with sand, some fully covered by it.  Nature wants its moxie back.  I wonder if the makers of  urlLink The Core  know something we don't.

       More from Houston...   I wrote a letter to my ex-girlfriend while driving to Houston.  I steered with my knees and wrote childish scribble, against the linear system suggested by Mead, forging sentences and paragraphs in a fashion similar to Texas legislature redistricting.  I don't know if it's healthy to write letters to someone I haven't dated in over two years; this often happens once a semester, towards the end, where I take stock of my situation and decide to let her know, write a letter that describes more of our break-up (for those who don't know, I broke up with her without giving her a reason, one of my shittiest displays to this day), produce honest-thought rhetoric that is taken the wrong way, and we get into an email war, rectify the situation, and then she wants to be friends and keep talking like we used to, and I shut off conversation again until the next semester ends.    The nugget that got the ball started was a fine epistle to obviousness -  I wouldn't be where I am today if we were still together.   And I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for her.    I think I got bored, and I hate to say it, because she was great fun.  Maybe it became too easy; we spent the summer of 2000 with nary a sour word or sour face exchanged.  Maybe her exile to Denton for the fall while I was in Shreveport was too much; it hadn't been before though, which means I was just tired.  Whatever happened, I lost interest quickly and completely, something I still don't understand, and something I still haven't forgiven myself for.  How do you forgive yourself for breaking the heart of the one person you've cared more for than anyone else?    Driving through Houston tonight, I was bored.  Matt Bowden took me through the Montrose district, past Rice, and through the Galleria.  When I was 15, I went to Kansas City on a school trip and was fascinated by its glamorous, cosmopolitan downtown area.  I remember when we shopped the square downtown (it's got some funny regal name), and I ran up and down the stairs in this outdoor arcade, filling my lungs with the air of consumption, blown away by the possibilities of city life.  Houston is bigger, the architecture is more impressive, and the amount of shopping is massive.  Yet I sat in the car, chin tucked into the palm of my hand, almost begging to be inspired.  Nothing happened.  It might be because I'm older, and once you see your first Pottery Barn, you're just disappointed the next time.  It might be because I have no one to share it with...there was someone I wanted to share Kansas City with (imagine how excited that girl would be to know we were going to Kansas City!  Everything's up to date in Kansas City!), and I could imagine her there.  Or maybe I understand my economic situation, see my staggering debt, and realize that the Ray Lynch CD I bought today is probably the last splurge until July.    I'm not comparing Katie to Houston...I've never really enjoyed Houston, save a few coffee shops near Rice University.  Maybe I am comparing Katie and Houston, even though I truly enjoyed Katie, save a few petty instances.  I do know that, save the Astros game on Saturday and the hours of Grand Theft Auto, I didn't really enjoy Houston all too much.  And I don't know whose fault that is.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 2 - Houston, TX   Driving home from Birmingham last weekend, I had a conversation with JW and Matt Bowden about corporations versus the local business...Austin is more excited about it's own local flavor than any city I've previously encountered, and its zest for helping home-grown shops and shopkeepers is refreshing in a society seemingly dominated by the 30 second commercial advertisment.  We discussed Sears/Roebuck, Wal-Mart, the Olive Garden, and Blockbuster Video, but the crux of the argument revolved around Starbucks Coffee.    One of my favorite South Park episodes is the one with Tweek, where the kids come over and the underpants gnomes steal Tweek's underwear for profit, and Tweek's dad owns the local coffee shop, and the Starbucks rip-off wants to come in, but no one will go and they pester the site manager and pelt him with human waste.  Once they try Starbucks' coffee, they find that it tastes better than the stuff Mr. Tweek was shelling out.    I first started drinking coffee when I was 16, thanks to Jessica Zeitler.  Jessica was the Rogers High School cross-country phenom; a red-haired hardbody with a soft smile and sexy attitude.  I met her at a Model Congress in Bentonville; I argued against her bill, something to do with affirmative action or gun control or abortion or taxes...we talked about it after it was over, figured out that we liked one another, and decided to start dating a bit.  She took me to downtown Fayetteville, we shopped the alternative shops, talked about art in philosophical terms, and drank coffee at Arsaga's, the angst-ridden hangout for the University of Arkansas' desolate suburbans.  Later that summer, I explored three or four coffee shops in San Francisco, solidifying my love for chocolately espresso drinks with glorious girls and glorious prices.  One 22 year old in particular caught my eye and introduced me to the delectable world of foamy milk; I wanted her to introduce me to much more, but my adolesence blockaded me (as did my shirt and tie...according to my dad, you always dress up to go to San Francisco...I hope they got a kick out of my big boy pants).  This is only important because from 1996 to 2002, my coffee career revolved around corporate shops, save one or two dozen instances.  Starbucks is everywhere, and it is good coffee.  Outside of San Francisco, I had never tasted better coffee than I could get at Starbucks.  I even spent nine months as a barista, pumping mocha, foaming milk, and making polite conversation with dirty whores who bring their poodles in with them but can't tip you more than a quarter.  I didn't think of Starbucks as a problem, because it tasted good; yeah, its power resembled Wal-Mart, but was I going to get a vanilla pissachino at Circle K instead?  I have a pretentious image to uphold.    I only write about this because I recently vowed to boycott Starbucks.  It was a fit of anger and inspiration; the intrepid traveller, searching out culture and creativity, spurring the black-line world of the carbon paper cafe, finding good conversation, good looking people, and a good double americano on his way.  I was doing it in Austin, why not do it indefinitely?    Yet already, I struggle.  Last week I stopped in at the Arboretum store, talking to a former work friend, and drinking a free cup.  This I talked my way out of; it cost the corporation money to produce my free drink, so in effect, I was hurting Starbucks, and should be heralded for my guerilla tactics.  But today, in need of a comfy chair and a steaming mug of bean water, I walked into the 'bucks near Memorial Drive.    Just parking, I felt dirty.  I quickly walked in, head down, avoiding the glare of the baristas.  My eyes focused on the wall and floorboards...I could still get myself out of this if they didn't have internet connection.  I quickly scanned the lower quadrant of the room, a smorgasboard of vericose veins and Keds, pumping and tapping to the rhythm of Yo-Yo Ma.  I choked.  I gagged.  No internet.  I turned and quickly muscled my way out, bumping into an eager churchgoer on my way.  No Gideon's Bible traded hands.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 1 - Austin, TX   I can't even get out of Austin, dammit!  Today was lined up: hit golf balls, get CD, get documentary VHS dub, eat a dirty lunch at the dirty Panda Express, get some bank stuff straightened out, and be out.  By noon.  90 minutes later, I'm in the midst of a grand game of grabass at my least favorite coffee shop in town, Java Express.  My 20 ounce Oak Farms Orange Juice sits on the table, unopened, sweating, anticipating its appropriated demise.  Lay in wait, little OJ.  Your death will not be in vain; instead it will go towards my faux health diet, establishing a conscious allotment of fruit for the day, and establishing cultural capital with other health nuts.  Though Odwalla is respected more; Oak Farms makes me look like a cheap bastard.    From Dushyanth S., Amazon.com's customer service representative:   I've checked into your Amazon.com account and found that the current balance on your gift certificate is $20.00.    To view your gift certificate balance, click the "Your Account" link in the top right corner of our web site.  Under Payment Settings, click the option to "View gift certificate balance" and sign in with your e-mail address and password.  The following page will display your unused gift certificate funds.    When you place your next order, on the payment section of our online order form, you should see that the gift certificate funds have been automatically applied to your order.  If this is not the case, make sure the radio button is selected under the words "You have $xx.xx in gift certificates or promotional credit available for use toward this purchase.  Would you like to apply it?" We will then apply the balance in your gift certificate account.  You do not need to enter your claim code again, as it has already been redeemed.   In case I forgot what I did to use my gift certificate, I was kindly reminded!  Maybe the first time was a stroke of luck that I followed instructions and applied my gift certificate to the order.  Anyway, at the end, our service industry friend let me know why I didn't use my gift certificate...I bought something from Amazon that didn't take gift certificates.     I have also summarized the Fine Print associated with our gift certificates below my signature to assist you further.   Ahh, to own a gift certificate that you must use on a specific product.  I know it's going to make me buy condoms and douche.   I left Austin in January 2002 due to circumstance of others; it turned out to be a nice move, and refreshing to get out of the toil of the workaday life in a city where my social life revolved around the Arboretum Starbucks and Mocha John, Make-up Shanah, and Quad Latte Christine.  Leaving was fine; I needed money, and I could make a smidgen of it in Arlington.  I knew I would be back; getting into UT seemed quite likely, and while I didn't get into the program of my choice, the end result is no different.  And now, as I look at Dean Keaton/Medical Arts, watching people cross to the Fine Arts Complex in a similar fashion to the girl I knew from the past and scampered to hide from as she looked my way, I start to miss Austin.   Not the Mo-Pac, not the pestering for pocket change, and not the woman who is in such a hurry to get to Starbucks that she honks as I slowly pull into a parking space too tight for my compact...the city isn't too beautiful, it's hot, and there's too much ego for a place this small.  Yet I don't want to leave.  I'd be to Giddings otherwise.  I want to sit in the coffee shop, sip an Americano, take notes for my ode to Ms. Pac-Man, look over my fantasy baseball team, and play extreme amounts of grabass when reading the blogs of others, knowing I can get up and head back to the apartment for a game of Ball or a dirty nap.  I can do this in other cities, and I'll enjoy it once I'm there.  I'm not ready to go just yet though.    Driving to the bank, I passed my first Austin apartment; a rottenous 40 unit complex off 31st where the landlady used to ask me for resume advice whilst lounging in her mumu (I wish I could spell that) on a rusted lawn lounge chair.  Walking out of the apartment was the first woman I saw when I moved to Austin in June 2001, a short, leather-skinned woman in her late 50s, sporting a backpack and comfortable shoes.  She reminded me of my mother (short and comfy shoes, not leathery skin) in that she was older and living in an apartment, a fate I wish on no one outside of a bustling metropolis.  When I moved, I forgot about this woman who was always up at 10 am, walking out of Apartment 14, backpack on, doing the stoop shuffle on the path by the palm tree and to the back door.    I ran into her today as we were passing DoubleDave's on Duval...part of the path from the backdoor to her destination, a destination I don't know.

      I smell like old  urlLink Mickey's .  Two-month old Mickey's, backwashed as any final six ounces of a 40 must be, discarded carelessly in a damp, dank cabinet used to show those who visited my apartment the glory beheld in cheap tall boy cans and cheaper glass bottles.    Rule #1 - No amount of Febreeze can get rid of the stench of old, tepid malt liquor.  The mix of the two resembles the smell when you're on a barstool next to the stage at a strip club as dollar cooch is paraded in front of your face whilst a girl who doesn't even look good under dim lighting smiles that "You know you want it, big boy" smile...all the while you're wondering why this seemed like a good idea for so-and-so's bachelor party, considering it wasn't a good idea for the three bachelor parties before (thanks to Dan Wearsch for noting  urlLink how hot they are at Missouri Hots ).  I won a $20 Amazon gift certificate today by hitting the Apartment God with a small stuffed soccer ball.  The god and the certificate were Brian's; the place was packed and moved, save a lone mattress delivered by Brother Mike from Stillwater, where our amphibian deity was perched, keeping watch over our games of grabass.  The games he presided over were countless, always employing some sort of object to be thrown or kicked or hit or missed or pelted or grazed or knocked off or knocked on.  So it was fitting that our final game in the apartment that, until today's Mickey's episode, smelled like the Holiday Inn was to take Soccer Ball (a small plush soccer ball) and hit the god with it.  My spoils look to be in the make of Laurie Anderson, James Baldwin, Johnny Cash, and Charles Bukowski.  In no way am I fucked up.    I cut Bukowski because shipping was a bitch; buying used stuff from people all over the world means each has to put down $4 for shipping, and I can grab some dirty Charlie B. for pretty cheap in other places.  But even though I asked for my new gift certificate to be used, it looks like Amazon fuckered me and I paid for it all.    Why are help sections on websites so completely helpless?  I clicked the box that said APPLY GIFT CERTIFICATE, and to email someone to ask if it actually happened (because it says it didn't), I have to go throguh some sort of demo reel where I am told how easy it is to pay with a credit card.  No shit, I just did it; give me the fucking address so I can email someone.  I used to design websites for Centenary; Help sections were the most fun for us to work on, because all a help page does is redistribute the links on the other pages; the Help section never takes you anywhere new; it's an index for jackasses.  Yet I still go there, looking for that  mailto:  hyperlink so I can create discourse with a benevolent woman from Kentucky who is pleased that I shopped Amazon.com, and wants to make sure that my shopping experience was stellar!    (The glory of writing...I've spent the past 30 minutes working through this shit, yet you are blissfully unaware that my face is red, my teeth grinding, and I am shouting obscenity at replicae of Star Wars heroes...by the way, before I settled on the etaoin shrdlu monicker and solidified my position as the gayest straight man ever, I considered the apt phrase from the days of Nero... bellum plus quam civilia ...special thanks to Steve Clark for introducing me to that, Argus the dog, and information about the decapitation and parusal of Cicero's head for a general public...all my heroes were shamelessly killed)  As I was handing my keys and parking tag to the woman in the apartment office (the general manager is new, and the assistant is still the same woman, and the first thing I thought was that this was a perfect example racial discrimination and/or the hegemonic institution of Marquis Relators was practicing nepotism or Southern/American pride...I think this makes me a grad student more than my want to sleep with undergrads), I asked if there was anything we needed to sign, any paperwork that needed to be completed, or any hugs for the staff, because they always affectionately called us "The boys from E341." (just that brought me close to tears).  She said no, we were good to go.  "So I can just throw up the deuce?" I asked, grinning as my index and middle fingers readied for upward thrust.  "I'd rather you not throw up in here," she said.  I learned this afternoon that a hero of mine vomited after a night of heavy tequila drinking.  I am waiting for them to parade his head on a stick through via Consulare.

      Fun links to brighten the soul:      urlLink Staffordshire Government Page ...Aargh, matey...where ye business be?     urlLink Ju Jitzu ...private training from a master in the field.     urlLink The Last Hope ...Jedi in training.     urlLink HomeStarRunner ...check out Teen Girl Squad!  I'm tired of news.  I'm tired of drama.  I'm tired of fighting losing battles for inconsequential shit.  I want to talk about shit.  In the past two months, my scat has gone from ordinary crap to abstract renderings of art and language.  It started after Matt Martin's wedding in April up in Arkansas...which is amusing, because in no way can Matt Martin create a bowel movement to emulate anything other than gruel.  Anyway, the day after the wedding and after playing Power Hour and after vomiting all in the driveway and grass (not the bathroom, Daryl Burrows), I woke up at Dan Young's house I think, and drove to Wearsch's (why didn't I stay at Wearsch's if I was going to go there in the morning?), and took the beer shit.  Four minutes later, I got up and marveled at my creation.  Now, my high school friends are the kinds of people who play swords and compare penis and testicle sizes in front yards of homes in Dallas suburbs, so brevity is lacking.  However, we never really compared poo.  So I asked if we were the kinds of friends who compared poo.  Turns out we are, and it marveled the two Dan's.  Estimated length was 18-21", and it was shaped like the Oron, or the symbol on the book in  urlLink The Neverending Story .  Today's shit wasn't as great, though it was a perfect representation of the roman numeral "7" drawn in calligraphy.    Why is shit disgusting?  Everyone shits.  Everything shits.  I have two friends whose large intestines were removed because of ulcers similar to dyspepsia or peptic ulcer disease, so they can't really shit, but they still excrete waste.  Why should I be afraid of it?  Why do Brits refer to the Water Closet behind closed doors?  Why did my ex girlfriend turn the water on every time she took a dirty dump...she didn't turn it on when she peed, so I knew what was going on.  One of my best friends has over 30 distinct armpit farts, and my roommate can emulate each through his ass.  It is hilarious.  Both make me laugh uproariously.  The only time I ever heard anyone laugh harder than at one of Dan Young's armpit fart concerts was one time when I told the story of me battering my pants up at Borders in South Austin, but that instance also included one person rolling around the floor in a pool of his own drool, and another girl so sickened she contorted into Carol Channing during the anecdote.  Eddie Murphy's best comic routine was all about shit.  Poo is fascinating!    Shit aside, I give you the glory of  urlLink The Nub .  As one of my friends said, I just want to suckle it.  Me too.    There is no drama at The Nub.  No bitching, no stupid belabored instances.  All is forgiven, all is forgotten.  The Nub is in the moment; a present phantasmagoria of camraderie and kinship, echoing out to the poor, huddled masses entwined in the day's folly.  Everyone is bedazzling.  Everyone is important.  Everyone has a soft hue of radiance, enveloping the perimeter into a radiance unsurpassed by neon lights and Fanta billboards.   I want to share Montreal with a girl.  She doesn't have to be my height; the head fits against the shoulder better that way, but as long as the arm can rest on her shoulders, and I can tilt my head just the right way to smell her hair and her essence, and we can look at the same city and talk about how we see it differently, it will work.  A small hotel on the outskirts of town, with a bedroom painted in warm colors and a bed with warm covers, is all we need.  We spend days walking the pier, taking bicycle tours and viewing botanical gardens and museums, and we spend the nights in coffee shops, talking to locals and tourists, eating a six-course meal at a restaurant that only has one seating, where the music is provided by a Greek accordian player who speaks Spanish, French, and English, and plays  urlLink I'm Just A Gigilo , and the chef comes out and sings, and soon the entire restaurant is singing in chorus, language not a barrier, and everyone goes home after a round of hugs and toasts and laughs, and we get back to our hotel room, and create some of the most passionate energy we've ever known, and we lie in bed, together, not talking, just listening to short breaths punctuated by the rare deep, and, for us, that is Montreal.    Fuck you, Donald Rumsfeld.   urlLink Fuck You .  Today...you can't ruin it for me.  I've got jedi and shits and nubs and Montreal to make me happy.

      I'm packing up the apartment today, and tomorrow, and Wednesday and Thursday I'm sure.  There's not much, but I'm going through and looking at all of the shit I didn't unpack and wondering why I keep hauling it to places if I'm never going to use it, and once I get it out I see it's all notes from the past:  journals, stories, film ideas, even some music.  And I read it, and look at the pictures, and feel it in my hand and try to remember where I wrote it; the only one I can remember is a silent play I wrote in 1998 on a Delta flight from Dallas to San Diego that involved Ken Scruggs as a jealous boyfriend, acting to the tune of a Kitaro masterpiece.  Seat 24F, and I didn't write that down on the cocktail napkin.    I found a shoebox full of baseball cards I collected years ago; at the time I took all the good ones and gave them protective sleeves and put them in one box...these were the leftovers that mingled freely with the other dregs.  Every time I run acoss these, I look through them and see if I recognize any of the names; if I do, I take them out and save them.  The last time I did that was before I went off to college.  I remember at the time looking at the cards, most from 1991 or 1992, and thinking that they would never appreciate.  I found 10 cards of current superstars as I dug through the cast-offs today; at the time of the card, these players were beginners.  Today they're thinking about retiring.    An attractive girl from Singapore was at the apartment this evening, discussing the heterogeneity of rural Wisconsin and assuming that the Japanese girl across the way from us was more Oriental than she.  We talked about school and Singapore and roommates whose boyfriends wear speedos, and got around to my time in undergrad and what I was doing now at 23.  "How old are you?"  I asked.  "20," she sighed.  "I don't want to be older."  "23 isn't that old," I said, suddenly panicked and looking for reassurance.  None provided.  She stood, lean and energetic.  I slouched, fat and ready for a beer and nap.    The key isn't fighting to reclaim youth -- I watched some PBS Kids show today where the kids designed wood cars and rockets and raced them at national competitions; I never got to do that, and I'll never have the chance -- but to work to make these days better than the ones before.  I read some psychology article saying that our adult lives are spent reconciling childhood issues and abandonments; if I am to believe that, I need to get out and reconcile rather than lament the issues.  I go into every year saying that it will be better than the last one.  The first year where that wasn't the case was May 2001 - May 2002 (my life revolves around the academic calendar).  This past year was about as good as 2000-2001, maybe a bit less.  I'm determined that this next year will break the streak.

       Dana Beyert  –  Centenary, Senior year .  Two memories from the 1st Annual Centenary Film Festival -  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)  Jeff Hendricks chewed cinnamon gum and wore a horizontal striped black and white T-shirt that was too tight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)  When  urlLink Clubbing  showed, Dana Beyert held my hand.  She didn't let go until the film ended.

       Summer   Summer kicked off for me this weekend, when I went with four  urlLink Centenary  friends to Birmingham (Birmingbeef, if you believe  urlLink Arby's ) and volunteered for an  urlLink ultimate frisbee  tournament.  16 hours there, 15 hours back, and more laughs and foul odors than deemed acceptable by the FDA.    I love a dirty road trip (or a big old bag of dirty road trip), where you get on the road, talk for a few hours, and next thing you know every third sentence is an inside joke, the car is constantly laughing, and every statement is knocked up a notch by the next statement, causing mass joy and exaltation.  I slept maybe 20 minutes in the combined 31 hours I was in the car because every time I might start to get sleepy, someone would say something crazy or start a new joke or throw out an old one, and we'd be laughing at business or Philbrook's dampness or the Chinese shit candy or a bad case of the lies.    Last summer I really didn't get a summer.  I wasn't working a hard job, but I was working 40 hours a week, living in a fairly boring place, and trying to stay ahead on finances until I got to school.  This summer bears the burden of making up for last summer's apathy.  And with that, there is a lot I need to do for myself and to learn about myself.  2002 was about money, cash in hand, paying off bills (that didn't get fully paid off) and living on budget.  This summer is about me, trying to remember the person I think I was and reconcile it with the person I've become.    California, Arkansas, North Carolina, Florida, Louisiana, Texas.    It should be better than submitting Interlibrary Loan requests.

      I'm happy about  urlLink this ...where is our terrorism money going?  I'm not happy about my ability to stick plethorae of feet in my mouth and ass.  I passed on a chance to go see the lunar eclipse out at the LBJ state park near Johnson City tonight.  It's a beautiful night, two good friends were headed there, and I threw up the deuce, even after taking a three hour nap this afternoon spurred by good but early golf and poor sleep quality last night.  I stayed here because I didn't want to waste time, yet I am wasting time here...I was before writing on the blog.  The blog is not a waste of time.    The screenplay that got me into UT Screenwriting included a great composite character based on two friends.  One of the friends constantly asks me to turn this character into a full-length screenplay.  I don't write romantic comedy, and this is what he wants, even though his ending is anything but commonplace.  Yet I feel compelled to give this a go...much maligned from his suggestions, but every good adaptation is unique to itself.    At a party a few nights ago, a girl asked me and another screenwriter about our feelings regarding the artist as a businessman; can someone who makes a living from art truly be an artist?  I said I hoped so, and while I understood her position that money jepordaises creative content, the ability to live when not producing art is what the artist needs rather than making money when not working.  Denton had a similar answer, but the tone was different; he knew he could and he knew he would.  "You can't let doubt enter in," he said, "or you'll never make it.  I know I'm going to make it.  I have to know."    I don't know.

       Drunk & Bored   Some fun shit to look at if you're drunk, bored, or in an extended game of grabass...  1)   urlLink An Open Letter to Ron Palillo  - by  urlLink Elizabeth Kelso .  Incredibly funny whilst drunk or otherwise blitzed.  Quite sad otherwise.   2)   urlLink Oolong  - the rabbit that balances rice cakes and film canisters on his head. 3)   urlLink Bill & Erik  - my favorite  urlLink Daily Texan  comic. 4)   urlLink Bitter Films  - home of the Academy Award-nominated  urlLink Rejected , quite possibly the best spent nine minutes of my life. My spoon is too big!   MORE  - watch the  urlLink first bit of Rejected  here.

And since you were upset that I deleted my last bit of honest dialogue, here's one just for you -- your roommate is  urlLink bedazzling , even drunk. Definition #1 is good, but anyone who owns  urlLink Ordinary People  deserves definition #2.

       JOIN THE CHAT!   If you're reading this, wonderful.  But you should be posting too!  The world is all about discourse, and while Daniel and I have a great time, it is tough to write when only the two of us are having a conversation, and a little daunting (you can't hide in the fray; what you post is what is out there).  I'm working on a new design, and I was working on comment pages, but I think it would be more fun if everyone who wanted could be a full-fledged author.    So you want to write, but you don't know what to write about?  Really, this is for anything...I love the sound of my voice/look of my text, but moreso I'm interested in sharing opinions on shit I know, and learning about stuff I don't know.  I use this forum for two purposes:  airing political laundry (I'm hopelessly liberal, and don't see the people who agree with me aired in mainstream media), and experimenting with writing (the recent crush entries are an attempt to find form/voice for a hypertext retrospective I want to work on this summer).  It's also updates on life, though more overarching and less day-to-day.    So get in on this...email me at  urlLink rolinmoe@hotmail.com  and we'll make it happen.    You're welcome to write what you want, when you want.  The hot tub is always fun with more people.  Daniel and I are sitting, backs up against the water jets, sipping Stroh's and enjoying the atmosphere.  The only problem is that it's a big hot tub, and if I keep having to look at him across the way, with all the sudzy effervesence and Barry Manilow muzack, I'm going to wake up in a bed I don't recognize with a pain I've only known from nightmares.

      For the first time in years, I am  urlLink proud of the Democratic Party .  Abraham Lincoln once jumped out of a judicial house window in order to miss a vote; this is just as good, and for just as good of reasons; in no way should Austin's congressional district stretch 200 miles to near Del Rio.  Tom Craddick says that the redistricting would allow Texans their true voice.  Well, considering how Republicans bitch-slapped the Democrats in November, it would stand to reason that, for him, Texans have their voice.  And for us liberals in Austin, we're glad we are districted so we can vote someone in who is interested in our voice.  We don't mind losing votes to the rest of Texas; we do mind losing our voice in Congress.    Patrick Rose, a friend of a friend who is somewhat of an inspiration to my Spring 2004 screenplay (I think that far ahead in this program), looks like he  urlLink won't be heralded  for his move.     Sorry that this is coming from the Austin-American Statesman, a paper I don't hold in great esteem.  The Austin Chronicle doesn't come out until Thursday, but I'm sure its content on this issue will be much richer.

       Nicole Kruse  -  6th grade  - I believe all of my crushes are/were harmless, but Shelley and Emily were moreso, finding kinship in the Ralph Wiggum "You are pretty, I like to eat paste" style of girl-crazy, look-that-is-neat-and-colorful elementary school life.  I was interested in Shelley when she was sitting across from me, and Emily when she was wearing boots and sitting at the lunch table with the plaid tablecloth, but if I was out playing handball, I was interested in handball.  Not the same with Nicole.  I remember one Novembwer where me and some friends were playing Butts Up or something, and Nicole scampered by, and I was totally lost in the game, to the point that I got the last two letters, allowing Nicole to scamper back past right as Mark Joya slammed a tennis ball between my shoulderblades.    Nicole was popular, but it was more because she was good looking and a free spirit rather than because she played by conventions.  She was confident in her voice, acted older than who she hung out with, and wasn't afraid to show that she was smart.  She also had beautiful brown hair with natural blonde highlights, at about shoulder length, and when she'd practice tennis, it would bob from left to right, or right to left with a backhand shot.    It is terrible that the memory I vest so much confidence in lets me down at this moment, because I honestly spent August 1990 to June 1991 totally invested in Nicole Kruse.  Two events can testify to this; one relates back to her tennis; we would hold basketball practice where she had tennis lessons, and if we missed a lay-up, we would have to run the length of the practice facility; I missed countless lay-ups just to run down past Nicole; it made no sense to me that she wouldn't be interested in someone that would miss 9 out of 10 lay-ups.    The other is a lot greater, and no matter what will sound trite, but I wrote my first screenplay about Nicole Kruse.  Actually, my first two.  For a kid who spent most of his adolesence as a klutz with a funny last name, popularity seemed impossible to reach.  There was no way I could ever go out with Nicole Kruse (she was dating Luis Lopez, a hard kid from Rancho Penisquitos with a reputation for gangbanging...I remember in March 1991, I was doing the musical  Grease! , and we were trying to drum up viewership so we sang three songs at a local elementary school carnival, and Nicole was there, and she watched and smiled as my solo number passed, and when the next song started, she and Luis walked out, and I stood and watched, pathetically providing "doo-op" at the necessary juncture), so I would conjure up ways that we could get together.  The first idea involved two kids with divorced parents (much like me and Nicole; what a convenience!), and our parents getting together, and how our relationship would blossom because of it (with the inevitable hardship lurking, her being popular, me not, and then the stigma of us being stepsiblings).  The second,  Japan , actually involved me writing ten pages; a class flies to Japan for a field trip of some sort, magic happens, and at some point Luis ends up proposing to Nicole, leaving the Rolin character standing in a Tokyo intersection, pulling the timeless fall backwards faint.    Nicole Kruse...I left out so much...the story of the tidy whities in my backpack that she found, my posturing for a position in a school play where she would have to kiss me, every sly move I pulled to sit next to her when seat assignments were changed, and 6th Grade Camp&copy;, where I somehow ended up in every group activity that she took part in.

      1)  Perl and CGI and blogging to allow feedback sucks terribly.  I spend a few hours most days trying to get a damn template I like in working order so people can comment on my blog, and it's terrible going.  Because of that, I don't write on this blog.  And I spend so much time grabassing with it.  Grabassing...a great verb.  Someday it will come along.  2)  Grabass is the order of the day for the next two weeks.  Yes, I ought to sub and make some cash, and I ought to pack, but it's more fun to go out like I'm going to write, and instead dick around with my website or, better yet, not dick with the website and rather play EverGrab.  Chinua is 30, Xhosa 20.  BTW, my characters are all black martyrs, political movements, or representations of the struggle against Apartheid.  The kiddies who play games have got to learn somehow.    3)  Odd dream a few nights...actually, a lot of odd dreams...I'll briefly describe those I remember:        A)    I'm driving past Marjorie Lyons Playhouse at Centenary, when Bob Buseick runs outside to his car.  I try to avoid him, but he sees me.  He is wearing a Dignan jumpsuit a la  urlLink Bottle Rocket , and suddenly we're in the green room at the playhouse, sitting Indian Style.  He looks at me and says, "You are a great talent.  I never want to see you again."  I shake his hand, and he leaves, with me asking him why.        B)   I'm in Melia Woods' dorm room, a la February 1998 when I travelled up there to make out with her and see if we had a future together.  The relationship was never consummated, and she mentions this.  So we decide to.  But as we start, her old boyfriend Ronnie Crupper walks in.  Melia says, "Why not a threesome?"   And they start going at it.  After a while I get tagged in, and we start, but she doesn't enjoy it, and asks for him again.    How many people put that kind of honesty in their blog?          C)   Well, I had a third, but it just floated away.  Fuck it.

      Tripper, Evan, and I (some other guy was there, he wore a white T-shirt and laughed at my Houdini reference, but his name elludes me and is unimportant nevertheless) stood outside Room 207 at the 31st Street Condos, smoking cigarettes and finishing off bottles of Miller Light.  Evan, a energetic guy who comes across as vulgar, meek, and idealistic all at the same time, was talking about some girls a few blocks down at the Crown & Anchor.  I think there was talk about heading over there for the "hook up," which inevitably turns into the "walk over to the bar where the girls are, stand there like jackasses, flail aimlessly with a plethora of witless phrases and quips, and go home depressed because you blew a shot to get laid that you never had."  He wanted to go, and I think white T-shirt Houdini man was interested to, but Trip and I didn't really care.  This stopped Evan from going, but not from thinking about the possibility just two blocks down.    "I don't know what it is," said Evan.  "There's something about girls.  99% of the important decisions I've made involved girls."  I smiled, nodded, probably chuckeled, gave him the thumbs up or the ol' Shooter McGavin "it's okay that you broke my heart Julie Poland" finger pistols, and thought that he was a complete dick.  Who bases their lives around girls?    ---  Putting my mind to it, I think I can list my history of crushes:    Shelley Callahan.  Emily Everett.  Nicole Kruse.  Laura Odeh.  Heather Slinkard.  Stephanie Farrier.  Alicia Parker.  Melia Woods.  Lisa Thurber.  Maura Wilbur.  Laura Fine.  Christian Speegle.  Dana Beyert.  Lauren Jackson.  April Landry.    I expected more, and I'm sure there were more, technically.  But these were the ones I fantisized about.  Not sexually per se; I can't utilize a crush in order to fulfill my self-serving obligations...these fantasies were much more benign.  Compassionate.     Shelley Callahan  -  1st grade .  We were in school together from kindergarten to 6th grade, with a one-year hiatus in second grade.  I lie...third to fifth grade was Carrie Scott, who looked a lot like Shelley Callahan and was basically the Chaparrael version of Ms. Callahan.  But everything started in the first grade, when our teacher Mrs. Scott presented each student with a animal made of yarn and foam called a  warm fuzzie .  Mrs. Scott would give out one warm fuzzie a week, and that week each student would draw the warm fuzzie winner a picture.  I had dysgraphia and was terrible with penmanship, so my pictures were the worst of crayon scribbles and abstract representations of playground games and lunch banter.  Joel Bass, a recent fuzzie winner, was disturbed with my seemingly lack of effort on his picture, and he vowed to exact revenge.  He did when my turn for the fuzzie came up weeks later, and he drew two blobs and a large red X on the page and gave it to me.  Shelley, my table partner at the time, saw this and decided to draw me a beautiful picture of a sunrise with the two of us holding hands in a meadow.  That day I vowed my first date would be with Shelley Callahan.  It didn't happen; she was always taller, and by the time I moved, her breasts had still not developed.     Emily Everett  -  2nd grade .  Emily was the first unique girl I can remember; she never seemed interested in the jollies of the other second grade girls...granted, she was no Anne Woodward, whose ability with crayons and Greg Beaumont's package was unsurpassed, but the blonde with the ponytail and no-nonsense attitude was just sexy in that second grade way.  At one point in the year, we set up a square dance, where the second grade would all perform some sort of hoe-down for the school, and we broke off into teams for the dance.  Well, I was not a hot commodity for the dance; not only could I not draw, but I sure couldn't dance.  So while groups were formed and people paired off, I sat the bench and would sub in for people who were absent.  It meant a lot of dancing, and a lot of watching Emily dance.  I even remember the song that she danced to (join hands now, and circle left around somehow...around the ring you go, keep going, take a little walk on a hill and toe...now the other way back, going single file, girls in the lead going indian style...the boys step around and back track, turn around go the other way back, and pass her once coming back, second time you meet do-ce-do your partner now, and promenade somehow, and sing  The First Thing, Every Morning, and The Last Thing Every Night ).  Anyway, I watched and watched and watched that dance, knowing some day I would make my move.  That move would come on the day of the school show.  I did what any self-serving second grader would do...when her song came up, I stood up and walked into the fray, looking completely lost.  Raul Garcia, her partner, was slow getting up and the music started.  I was caught up in everything, Emily's partner was not in the square, so she grabbed me and said, "Pay attention!"  The next three minutes were glorious, holding Emily's hand during the promenade, looking at the school, showing off the girl on my arm.  She didn't talk to me after that, but she hadn't really talked to me before that, so I wasn't losing much.

      BLOG CHANGES!  In the next few days, this blog will hold the ability for reader comments!  Comments first, design second, so it will look pretty shady for a while.    Two quick responses to my esteemed co-author...first, Chinua hit 30 again, though he is not out of the danger zone with it...but he will be soon.  Second, I heard about this Florida guy (Bob Graham?), but only in passing.  My guy is Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont.  His beliefs are actually a change from the hegemonic shit that moderate Republicans and Democrats spew forth today...that means that he holds no chance of election, but at least he's not a yes man, like John Kerry and John Edwards.

      Alright...the semester is winding down, I'm basically done with my work, so I'm back on the screenwriting bandwagon.  But I took today off to play some EverQuest.  Yes, I play online games.  Just this one, and not too often, but some old HS friends play it and we have fun doing it.  Anyway, I figured I'd log on for an hour or so, get my character up to Level 30 (if you don't understand leveling, I'm not going to try to explain right now), mem spells, and get a bub or two into 30 so I wouldn't need worry about dying and going back to 29.    It started out fine, got 30, got spells.  Practicing them, I got assaulted by a goblin; I had him down, but as he was walking away, he stopped right next to two large giants.  Had I fought there, the giants would have smoked me.  So I tried to cast on the gobby, but I ran out of mana.  It was up to my pet to get this gobby from 3% down to 0%.  The gobby was casting spells on me, weakening me.  The gobby was at 1% when he killed me.  So, I went on a corpse run, got a rez, got back, hit 30 again, and as I was meming the new spells, I got another mob on me.  I tried fighting it, but I didn't have my buffs or anything memorized, so I started shouting help.  The group next to me failed to help, and I died.  For the second time.  So I got a KEI (really good buff for casters) and made the corpse run back to Frontier Mountains.  The corpse run is about 20 minutes or so, not fun.  As soon as I got to my body, a goblin was there to wipe my ass.  I killed him, but only after he had cast malaise on me, a Death over Time spell.  There were no healers in the zone (only three folks around), so I died once again.  For the third time.    Notice I didn't hit 30 the last two times.  WHen you die, you lose experience that moves you to levels.  I started the day 3% away from 30.  I ended it 17% away.  I got my body, gave Cazic-Thule the finger, and was out.  It'll be a while before I touch Chinua again.

      I could go to  urlLink Bojangles  and grab some dirty chicken, or I could stay here and get to sleep so I can wake kiddies up for breakfast and research.  I used to be a Bojangles guy, but tonight it's quick blog, a bit on existentialism, and bed.    I get a day off soon.  I think.  I should.  I'm the only person left who hasn't taken one.  I would take tomorrow morning, but I've got to run errands and pick up a seven foot sub sandwich.  I'd rather buy books and sit my happy self at Borders or Barnes & Noble, possibly looking over new Harry Potter, but more likely reading up on the Introducing series from Totem Press.    I taught  urlLink Bowling for Columbine  tonight.  I love Moore's message, don't like his idea of vigilante celebrity, but am glad the left has a leader like him, even though he only incorporates the leftist of the left, but they need a leader, and while I don't like him personally he's a great leader for me.  Odd.  Anyway, really diverse and good comments from the kids, especially Kevin, one of the kids who thinks he's too cool to be here and too cool to learn.  Very smart, and made some great comments on the film.  Noah tried to get Forest to open his perception up and look at the possibility that Michael Moore was making some good points, and it worked to an extent.  The most impressive comment came from Adya, a camper I have yet to really talk to and feel bad that I haven't.    I throw about names here...Noah, Forest, Kevin...and no one knows who they are.  And I'm not about to explain it to you.  They're campers or camp staff or something or other.    It's a constant barrage of memories...so many of them remind me of people I know or knew or had contact with and the contact was memorable.  Daniel is a spitting image of Marshall McCammon, less the elongated beer belly, but just as clumsy and staunchly conservative.  Andy walks like Mike Maury.  Ryan is a short 20-20 visioned Tom Horton.  Student Noah is a louder version of my documentary partner Daniel.  Holly reminds me of my sister.  Victoria is a less obtrusive Laci Adams that I would enjoy hanging out with.  Seth looks like Knox Overstreet and acts like Daryl Burrows.  Cami has Katie's laugh.  Megan has Bonnie's wit.  Kevin is Dave McCormick who hasn't grown the human compassion.  Patrick looks like one of the Fell children but reminds me of Nick Dorothy.  Chris is a cross between Dan Wearsch and Leif Sherry.  Amanda is a pleasant Joy Mettam.  Forrest reminds me of a young Daniel Young.  Kallie looks like Demi Moore, but acts like Beth Carter, minus the religious indignation.  Lauren is Crystal Carter mixed with New Jersey.    All you do is ask them to never grow up, to keep the idealism, to keep having fun, and to save the world.  No pressure.

      Tough weekend...  I wrote a screenplay tonight...a four-page piece in the span of an hour as the group debated giving money to the needy of the world.  The postulate was this:  For $200, a child can be clothed and fed from birth to age six, as well as given immunizations and the like.  Do you give $200 to UNICEF, or do you keep the money yourself?  Since this is an honest-to-goodness question (a person can be clothed and fed for six years if you give $200 to UNICEF), we played the game with big stakes...Noah took $200 from the petty cash and left it up to the students how to spend it.  A lot of really good points were brought up, both practical and philosophical, looking at why you would spend the money on the person and what reasons you wouldn't.  I was afraid that I would need to bring up a reason not to spend the money...play a little Devil's Advocate...but they were on the ball about it, which might not be a good thing, considering the money is still ours to spend and a pizza party was discussed.  I don't know how anyone could eat pizza with that $200.  But I wrote a screenplay about the pros and cons of giving the money.  I doubt it's any good.    I'm not as good at answering my question as I hoped to be.  We have cliques...and shockingly, the nerdy clique of RISK players is the elitist clique.  There are soccer players, pretty boys, and overall popular kids at this camp, but they're not having the most fun, and thus they get jealous when the RISK kids are yelling and creating hoopla.  Anyway, I get along best with the RISK clique for a lot of reasons...the easiest would be because they are around (during the afternoon some folks hit the library, some the store, some the basketball court...these kids stay in the place and play RISK, and since I'm on duty, I'm there with them), but also they are just like I was in high school -- interested in their things, and not really caring otherwise.  I gave up my sophomore prom to play RISK with Paul Jones and Daniel Young, and it was one of the greatest nights of my high school career.  I ended up popular in the end because I did my own thing, and somehow the popular kids realized they wanted to do those things too.    Anyway, these kids were shocked about being the elite group, and they felt awful about it.  And it's not their fault...they don't mean to be elitist...few people do, I think.  And as I talked them up and gave them pep and tried to raise their spirits, I realized that I was a member of their clique.  And not in the terms it may seem...I talk to everyone in the camp, I eat with everyone in the camp, I drive everyone in the camp, I tell everyone in the camp to get into bed...but I was being elitist to others, specifically the pretty boys most would consider the elite group.    When this started, I wanted to be that guy who you could grab for a game of something or to talk about something or whatever.  I knew I'd get groupies, and I knew I'd have to fight to hang out with everyone.  But there were three students who set themselves up as too cool for this camp, and started acting snobbish about things.  I'd walk over to them and they'd give me a look, a smile, but also a wonder about why I was there...am I spying?  I wasn't, I just wanted to know what was going on.  So after a few days, I stopped walking by.  And now, I only really talk to them when I need something or when it's discipline time.  And that's not the way to forge a relationship.  I hold power over these kids, and I can't abuse that to favor one group over the other.  I have to at least let these other kids know why I've acted the way I have, and if they want to hang out or play games or whatever, I am completely interested.  I am.  Granted, I don't have as much in common with Seth as I do with Chris...it's just how it is.  But I don't have a lot in common with a lot of my best friends...it's what makes them interesting.    I have my favorites...I won't lie.  There are eight campers or so that I really enjoy, who cheer me up and make me glad that I'm here.  I like all of the guys, and I'm sure I'd like all of the girls if I knew them as well as I know the guys.  But everyone has a few people that they enjoy more than others.  Stephen, Forrest, Chris, Cami, Jackie, Lauren, Lauren (two of 'em), and Ryan.  That list will probably change a bit over the next week.  It's my job to try to add more to that group, and to at least give everyone the opportunity to get on the list.  And when I say job, I don't mean in the sense of getting paid for something...I need to do this because it is the right thing to do.    I wonder if I can make it as a writer.  Much of writing is the reconciliation of thoughts or visions in your mind.  Some stories require writing, but a lot of ideas I've had over the past week or two get talked out because I'm around such a nurturing group of people and we're always talking.  Maybe it just hurts the blog.  I'm sorry, blog.

      Kids gone, and I can look up bowling prices and karaoke rentals.  The word I had to kill my target in the Assassin game was Karaoke.  I was killed well before I had the opportunity to do this, via the word Frisbee.  How fair is it to kill the RA with Frisbee?    Scorpions - Winds of Change.  I am pathetic.    There is an inherent amount of flyshit drama that comes with working at a summer camp.  A lot of the staff gets upset with some shenanigans and tom foolery that happens with kids.  A few of the kids are jackasses, a few apathetic jackasses, but this is honestly a really good camp.  When I went to my first band camp, Jackson Jennings poured tabasco and other sundries on his cherry jello and then vacuumed it into his mouth so he could regurgitate it onto his plate.  We loved it!  But when Kevin decides to see the scientific reaction of pouring water onto Shepard's Pie, he gets admonished.  He didn't make a mess though.    I feel no need to write on a screenplay at the moment.  I finished a short two weeks ago that I am quite happy with, some of my best work to date.  Maybe that's enough for the summer...this is a nice break because I am working, and it's not just sitting in Palm Springs drinking cokes with the old folks at home and wanting to be productive.  I'm productive in some manner.  My dreams are productive.  I was in a WWE show last night, thrown through a table in a ten man tag match.  There was a girl too...don't remember who.  There's always a girl.

      Slowdown in the blog again...the job is great, but I'm not about to tell you about the kids' day to day activities (though Stephen played an incredible game of Monopoly today, finishing 2nd out of 8 while only owning one property the entire game, the electric company).  We do camp stuff.  I enjoy it.  I am very tired at the end of the day, but it only hits once the kids are in bed.  Or at least with lights out.    A fantastic rainstorm tonight.  I rarely love rain like I do tonight...usually it's just rain, and I'm near a storm drain or something, but tonight, at camp, feeling inspired and nostalgic and alive like I used to all the time and like I hope I can get back to, it's wonderful.  I stood in it for a minute, just basking.  I'd love to fall asleep in it.

      In the middle of a pretty poor mock trial...for as smart as these kids are, they can't oracize an argument.  The last trial, putting George W. Bush on trial, turned into a not guilty verdict only because the prosecution didn't debate the right points...they were better debators, but they failed to answer any of the questions asked of them.  The current trial is against Saddam, and it's pretty weak as well.  Hopefully they can write.    Yes, that is cruel...they're 15, 16, or 17.  They're not listening to the conversations, they already know what they're going to say, so they don't listen to the testimony, and thus their cross-examination is pointless.  I've seen much better...I don't expect them to get up and do it at a level I can, but at least at the level I did in 1996.    The expectations that these kids will have over them over the years...30 percent of them will fail to learn a work ethic, and another 30 percent will become downtrodden because of their inability to meet the hype.    Someone call for a sidebar!  I was a vicious debater.  My first year was spent arguing incessently about moral codes and what was right, becoming quite unpleasant when someone would speak nonsense.  I mellowed my second year, allowing me to become a greater jackass.  I could tear apart any weak point in a case, even if it revolved around the use of a pronoun in the resolution.  I defeated a case on sending aid to China to assist with water purification because I used their definition of China to look at a specific entity recognized by the UN, and not Tibet, Hong Kong, or western areas that are often disputed with Russia.  I don't know if we even discussed the case, just what was meant by China.  We won.    I loved cross examination, not because I was a good questioner, but because any wavering of theirs I was able to belittle vehemently in later speeches.  One girl said, in response to a plan of mine to bring the age of drivers to 18 (thus eliminating all "juvenile" drivers), "C'mon, this isn't important.  It isn't like kids having knives."  After rebuilding the little of my case she tried to attack, I brought up an opinion article from the Philiadelphia Inquirer where the author lamented over the day "...where all we had to worry about was a kid drawing his initials into the desk with a pocket knife."  It was better if you lived through it.    The kid up there right now is talking about what physical pain is.  I am the embodiment of it right now, listening to this trial.

      At 9:04 this morning, as I stood in the Wake Forest copy center, I realized that I made the right choice.  On this blog I mentioned the need for a summer on the coast in California, writing and relaxing and waking up late and working at a restaurant and finding myself.  But as I copied affidavits for a mock trial of George W. Bush for war crimes, I knew that I was where I wanted to be.  No doubt.  I will get paid $1600 for the six weeks I spend working at these camps...that is my bills and an extra $800.  That's $800 more than I need for this.    And I don't even have to be ambiguity.  or ambiguitous.    The kids love  urlLink HomeStar Runner , though the girls don't really understand why Teen Girl Squad is so funny.  Or Trogdor.  TROGDOR!  and the THATCHED ROOF COTTAGES!    No dreams...where have the exes and other sundries gone?    Strom Thurmond died?!  Really?  I know I wasn't funny before, but he was the part of my act that was funny.  People just don't laugh at the Paula Poundstone jokes like they did with his.  Or Phyllis Diller.  Thank God she's still here.

      Any dream that includes me chasing someone takes place in a virtual Little Haiti from GTA Vice City.  It's not a pixelated scene, where I wear a dilapidated light blue and green Hawaiian shirt, looking like Adam Carolla and talking like Ray Liotta...and there aren't Haitians and Cubans and Mistress Cleo with the big boosoms telling me to kill the Cubans to save her Haitian boys...it's just the homes and the streets, and I'm running, and I'm always chasing old girlfriends or old crushes.    It was Lauren Jackson last night.  Probably my worst screw-up in having a chance and talking myself out of it and not taking it, and then talking myself into it only when the moment is well past.  There's a monologue about her in a one-act I wrote last summer or so, talking about jazz and tenor sax and a sultry voice crooning out lullibies with stand-up bass, smooth piano, and brush drumbeats.    Why did I need to get ahold of her?  There was a reason, but reasons are never to be remembered...Tom Clancy writes novels about events, while Stanley Kubrick made movies about people.  Watching Dr. Strangelove, it is evident that his initiative is to show how the people at the time were dealing with the situation, rather than the Cold War itself...compare that to The Sum of All Fears, where Ben Affleck gives a hollow performance of a hollow character, because Clancy is interested in the event rather than Jack Ryan's growth and individual foibles.   But Jack Ryan is a great character...I feel like I know him from all his books.   I know, but I also felt like I knew Zach Morris.    I dream like Kubrick.  I was running after her.  It was imperative that I talk to her.  I think she had some info on two people I was looking for.  But Lauren didn't want to talk.  She didn't run away from me, but she quickened her pace...so maybe she did want me to catch her, because Lauren can run.  She can also throw a water baloon sidearm at a small hole in a concrete structure and fling it with such force that its whistle through the air causes tritones.    I caught her.  She looked at me, tired, beaten, in no way interested in holding a conversation with me.  And I just started apologizing, not carrying on the conversation with her, keeping her there much longer than I needed to because I needed to apologize for keeping her there.  I have nothing to apologize for.  I apologize every time I seem to speak to her.  I saw her at Centenary's graduation, and I'm sure she saw me.  We didn't talk.  We didn't say hi.  I won't even contact her roommate, a friend of mine before Lauren, because I know that I was mentioned and probably defamed for my overt stupidity.  She looked wonderful...healthy, fresh, excited...personified success.  I felt short and fat and muggy.

      Tomorrow is the Breakfast Simulation.  Every kid has a country on their nametag...someone is the United States, someone France, someone the Comoros Islands.  Depending on the country you are, you will get a certain amount of food for breakfast.  For the United States, this is akin to a dozen donuts and a gallon of orange juice.  For Tajikistan, this means two spoonfulls of grits.    We tried this in high school once.  The Spanish department worked to teach a bit of economics, considering the chair of the department was getting his Ph.D in Econ.  For one week, we were to play the part of either a Mexican nobleman, a Mexican working man, or a Mexican impoverished man.  There were 28 in the class; 21 were impoverished.  One was rich.  The rich guy dictated what we did in class, sat in the comfy chair, ate Snickers bars during class, and had a hall pass to do whatever he wanted for the day.  I was one of the middle class guys...it was class as usual for me.  The 21 impoverished sat in a corner right next to each other, some having to stand because there was not enough space for all to sit, and at at times they would be told to do some ridiculous task.    This lasted two days.  The first day was the introduction day.  The second day was the first day where we played the roles of our people.  Casey Young, the Student Council President, was one of the impoverished.  Casey was the first bit of drama I ever got to know...usually chipper and friendly, I slowly realized that her statements were usually to get herself noticed, and the gossip was always glorified...but she gave me back rubs and had great boobs, so we were cool.  This day, however, her cakehole never shut.  "Mr. Wesson, this is unfair.  He gets to sit in your chair and I have to stand here?  This is unfair!  Unfair!"    The Student Council president bitched to such a degree, both in class and outside, that before the end of the day the simulation was ended.  Whiny high school students in Rogers, Arkansas beat out the first initiative by the language department to work in an interdisciplinary manner rather than teach from the book.  We returned to bookwork the next day.  Casey still hated the Mexicans because they lived in ugly houses.

      I've been a harsh critic of Centenary's for the past 12 months, noting the many inefficiences in its academic coursework.  I entered graduate school as a writer, and was told that my writing was very good, and would be much better if I knew how to write an adequate term paper.  Usually I would blame myself (I don't like blaming others...I can't control others, I can only control myself...I never have a problem falling during the trust fall, and I never have a problem catching either, but it is the catching that I worry about), but I was constantly given high marks on papers my last two years of college, and even encouraged to look into publishing.  There were other various sundries as well, stemming from diversity in a cultural and academic realm, as well as the community's distaste for any competition and parade of effort above all other variables (including content).  But I want to thank Centenary tonight.  Not just for four great years of social life (arguably the four best so far).  But for small group communication skills.  I worked so many offices, committees, classroom groups, student/faculty groups, and other hodgepodge notions that the ability to interact with and grow into a small group is strong in my mind.  Honestly, it feels good to do this.  Very good.  If writing doesn't work out, I know I want to teach.    The kids are great.  Some problems, but if there weren't I'd be bored and wonder what was wrong with all of them.  Quite intelligent.  I know more than they do, and could possibly be smarter than most of them, but to say that would be to say a lot, because these are some of the smartest folks around.    My mom is very smart, and so is my dad, all personal problems aside.  I suffered through a few years because of divorce proceedings, and my academic curve was slowed greatly, but it came back together over the past eight or nine years.  And I can thank my friends for that.  I am fortunate to have incredibly bright and intelligent friends, few of whom think inside the normal plateau.  I was talking to Ben, one of the TAs, about globalization today, and he mentioned The Nexus and The Olive Tree, a pro-Globalization book.  I'm not anti-globalization, but I'm definitely not for it, and most of my readings and study come from the anti side.  "I like to get the other side," I said.  "It's tough to think that way," he said...Ben is one of the more positive folks I've met in a long time, especially for his age and knowledge level.  "Not so much," I said, "most of my friends are conservatives.  And those who aren't don't think about things like I do, or like most people do."    I should give Centenary and my friends a kick-back for enabling me to handle this job.  But I won't.  The knowledge of a job well done should suffice!  =)

      The dream was lucid and shocking, maybe due to the long hours of this job, maybe the lack of sleep for the past week and next five weeks, maybe because she called two days ago and left a message, and I left a three minute message back.  But I had a dream, one of the craziest I can remember.  It was about an ex that isn't an ex, someone who I had a moment with, and who I hoped to have more with (and somewhere in my mind, I'm sure I still do), but things never worked out and drama ensued, and the moment is in the past.    We were at a wedding.  Her wedding.  Maybe we were at a swimming party before that.  I don't think so.  I drove out to a ranch to see her marry a guy I didn't know, but I knew he was uglier than I am, kind of tall and skinny frame but fat person.  She was in her wedding dress, a drugstore knockoff that was probably worn by others and will be worn again.  She had a cropped haircut and blonde hair.  Trailer park queen.  But it was still her.  And in a way, she was more attractive, cheerful, enjoying one of the biggest days of her life, no matter the cost or style.  Maybe she looked so happy because I was so sad.    So there was a wedding, but I don't remember that.  I remember her walking around the guests rather than down the aisle, without her father, alone, confident.  She stood there, picturesque view even though the wedding was on a cow pasture.  And then it was over, and I was trying to get ahold of her, but she didn't want to talk to me.  Her friends did...they were happy to stop by and chat it up, but I didn't pay attention.  I was looking for her.    I ran into her stepfather, who I know briefly from real life.  He was eating off of a chocolate ice cream groom's cake.  I wanted the vanilla one, but I was willing to settle.  "Rolin Moe," he said, in a regality I never knew from him, "thank you for this day."  I smiled, not wanting to ruin his memory even though my part in his stepdaughter's wedding was less than mentionable.    Then the tornado came.  Quickly.  It started raining, but he remained with the cake.  I ran for the barn, an area I was never allowed to go before, but everyone was congregated here, watching CNN.  She was there too, with the new husband, holding hands, wearing a T-shirt and daisy dukes.  She smiled at me.  I had a conversation with her.  All filler.  I didn't ask her any of the questions I wanted to, tell her any of the things I wanted to.   Why?  You should be with me.  C'mon.  This is just silly.   I smiled, made the pleasant conversation, maybe even shook his hand before I woke up.  And then it was morning, and I had coffee to make and kids to wake up for breakfast.  But I wanted to return, maybe have the chance to see if I could ball up and say it all.    The kids are in the middle of a nuclear winter scenario where they're fighting for Skittles.  It is complete bedlam out there.  An hour long, where they find all of the skittles and then are given chance cards to tell them what provisions they take from there.  Half are dead now, and the other half are fighting like dogs to stay alive.  I can't talk to any of them.  Incredible.  All treaties are broken.

      Long, introspective blog post lost due to last-minute errand for Noah to grab ziploc bags and starburst.  I don't ask questions.    Instead, a tale about my time at band camp.  I went to the University of Arkansas summer band/orchestra camp (politically titled Music Camp) for five years.  The camps were large, with 100 people in each band and orchestra, and anywhere from five to sometimes nine ensembles, totaling nearly 1000 people.  We took up two wings of Pomfret Hall, an athletic dorm near Bud Walton Arena and on the west side of campus (which means nothing...I don't think the U of A is divided into segments, and if it is, who gives a shit?)    The student leaders of the camp were known as captains; they were brown-nosers of the highest order, folks on half scholarship to the camp who worked as proxies for the couneslors.  Their job was to knock on our doors in the mornings, and yell LIGHTS OUT at lights out!  However, every day one of the dorm rooms would be qualified as an exemplary room, and was given a 30 minute extension.  The extension had a specific name, but it was hokey and only worth remembering for the purpose of wishing you could forget.    For four years I toiled with roommates.  Kyle McNitt, Daniel Young, and Jerromy Falk all shared a room with me, sitting up into the late hours of the night (sometimes past midnight!), quietly talking about girls, sports, girls, or girls.  "You don't know what it's like when you're just inches away," a wisened Jerromy offered to me during the Summer of 1996.    And for four years, no sign of the late lights (maybe that was the name.  I hope it was something better, stupider, more regal and pomp-driven).  We'd come close...a room next to us, a room down the hall, but never us.  And it always sucked that it wasn't us.  Every night I would bemoan not having the extra half-hour, wishing on the farthest star that the counselors would bestow upon us the honor and priviledge of the extra wattage.    It was a Thursday in 1997 when I got the news.  We had two days of camp left, and the last night was traditionally a lax night, so late lights would end on Thursday.  I sat on the tile floor, listening to Robert Bright oratote the afternoon meeting, and Joe Raybourn pass out the mail.  Then came the yell for the two rooms with late lights.  116 and 324.    We were 324.    Inside, I smiled.  Five years of perseverance and good behavior paid off on the last day of all days, the penultimate night where I could finally revel in my glory and enjoy an extra half-hour of rambunctions actions and folly with Mr. Falk.    The time came.  10:28.  10:29.  10:29 and 30 seconds.  Jerromy and I waited paitently for the call...  LIGHTS OUT!    We kept ours on.  WE KEPT OURS ON!    10:31.    We kept ours on!    10:32  We kept ours on!  10:33  What the fuck is there to do?    Thus, the dilemma of ages:  when all of your friends go to bed at 10:30, and you have to be quiet for them, but you can stay up until 11, why would you stay up until 11?    I think we left the lights on until 11, but only as a matter of principal.  The 30 minutes sucked.

      Noah asked the kids a simple question at orientation today... who do you want to be for the next two weeks?   Ben, the contagiously excited TA on staff, took a sheet of paper and answered it along with the kids.  The other staff members whispered and made less-than-emergency level comments that could wait for other venues.  I sat, watching the kids, looking over who was shedding their protection and opening their inefficiencies for public display.  A few did.  Many did not.  One girl did, but often looked to see if I was noticing her deliberation.  15 year olds trying to work their moves are funny.    Anyway, I'm answering the question.  It's silly, but fuck you, even though I'm basically a fairly well-read nihilist, often I can get inspired.  It's the folly of life...a cultural nihilist who wants to save the world.  And Noah Bopp was inspiring.  They make bad movies about people like him, only because no one can capture the energy like Noah does when he teaches.    WHO DOES ROLIN MOE WANT TO BE FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS?    I want to be compassionate.  I want to be a good listener.  I want to get to know all of my students.  I want to be firm when necessary.  I want to be firm when my fears want me to keep quiet.  I want to work hard.  I want people to enjoy their time.  I want people to feel comfortable to talk to me about anything.  I want to learn.  I want to be as excited as I am today every day.  I want to be sad when the kids leave.

      I woke up at 8 today, no problems, sans alarm.  7 Central Standard, 5 Pacific Standard.    I usually wake up after Eastern Standard eats lunch.  And I'm groggy.  Today it was wake up, decent shower, coffee, and email checkage.  The kids are coming in today, and I've got stuff to do, so there's incentive...but is that it?  Or can I pull the next five weeks on the same schedule?    Probably not.  Don't mind if the blog slows a bit, or becomes politically-oriented again.  I'll get back to talking about shit.

      The dream I had last night involved me living in a dorm room with a smattering of friends from the past and present, and I was their hall monitor.  Except in the corner of the dorm hallway was what looked like the carcas of a cat...no bones or blood, just kind of the job of a fur trader or scalper...the back hair and the tail.  And I wouldn't touch it.  I just let it sit there.  No one else noticed; I was consumed by it.

      When I began the blog, it was quite like my undergrad radio show at Centenary.  There, I played an eclectic taste of 80s synthesized rock for two hours on Tuesday, finding rhythms, climaxes, tempos, and trying to create a retro trance for the duration.  I worked my ass off for my audience, realizing that my audience was inconceivably small, if at all existant.  Rarely do I believe more than 10 people were listening at one time, due to the lack of KSCL publicity, lack of KSCL range, and lack of KSCL quailty for most shows (you could hear Christina Aguilera twice a day, and Pain's  Fight  five times a day, usually during a show from a Kappa Sigma).    When my second round of energy on this beast occured about six weeks ago, I stopped looking at the site statistics.  Before, I would weekly check the site to see when my hits were, and how many hits there were on what days...if I hit the site more than once, it would distort the numbers, so I had to post, look, and be done.  Usually there were seven or eight hits, not too bad a ratio, but really solidifying the masturbatory nature of such a weblog.  At the renaissance, I started writing rather than just commenting...I wanted people to read, but fuck 'em if they weren't.  If I were to depend on my statistics for morale, the first day of low hits would be the last day of the blog.   But few feelings are better than the old, "Hey, I stumbled across your page..." emails that come after a site is up, stays up, gets bandied in a circle of folks as an off-color comment, and then someone working in a cubicle gets bored and decides to check out that site they remember but don't know why, and here it is, nothing but text, but not bad text...not too good of text, but better than a lot that is out there, worth reading because it's this or solitare and you've got six hours left in your day and the work is done and if you're not grabbing ass you're going to start sticking objects up it.    Three such emails in the past two days.  I was skipping on my way to the cafeteria this morning (I eat in a cafeteria.  I live in a dorm room.  I will live in a dorm room for the next six weeks.  It doesn't feel odd.  It strangely feels right.  Too right.  I like this too much.  I feel too comfortable.  More comfortable than I felt in any apartment or house I've lived in since I graduated Centenary, except the Brian Thomas apartment, which was more rooming with Brian than the shitty apartment with high rent and pidgeon-infested storage units).    Yet it gets better.  Two emails were from old friends.  Really old friends.  Friends I haven't spoken to in six years.  Somehow, they found the blog.  And somehow, each found a section from February where I listed all of the people I lost contact with that I really wanted to have contact with again.  Both were on it...well, one was on it, while the other was a member of a 10-12 person group (but an important group, Heath...an important group!).  The emails were brief...it's been six years, what do you talk about?  But they arrived in the inbox, with a name I recognized from long ago that I didn't expect to hear from, and it caused me to smile, and to click the name with enthusiasm, and sit fixated on the message, and ponder it and them once through.    And now, the problem.  I spent a lot of time with these folks at one point in my life...it's why I miss them, and why I want to get back in touch.  So, how do I do it?  I've lost touch with people before, and started it up, and it goes fine for two or three emails, and then you're out of things to say because you've remembered the past, caught up on the present, and realized the future doesn't readily include this person from the past...you might want it to, but only in a way completely convenient to your current situation, because you've done just fine without this person in your life for however many days, so what's a few more, or all of them?  The emails stop, you sit with a message from them in your inbox for months, finally delete it, and two years later put their name on a weblog hoping to get in touch with them again.    And I don't want that to happen, because what is the point then?  I do miss these people.  I think about them ever so often, more than just in passing sometimes.  It would be great to see them again, catch up and then continue forward.  But how when we're most likely subjected to email?    This doesn't mean you shouldn't write me if you're an old friend.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 7 - Winston-Salem, NC   I missed you, sweet sweet weblog.  72 hours is too long a time.  Let's never fight again.    Three days of grabass, travel, sweet redemption, travel, and new beginnings.  But I do get ahead of myself, because the story I want to tell is    Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 6 - Bessie's Bend, KY   Family time on Monday set my trip back quite a few hours, enough so that I didn't arrive at Tiptonville, TN until 2:30 pm.  I was to New Madrid, MO at 1:30, but while New Madrid is closer to Bessie's Bend as the Crow flies, one must drive through Tennessee to get to this bit of Kentucky glory (my favorite bit of Kentucky - the sign as you enter that says KENTUCKY IS EDUCATION FIRST!)  What the hell am I talking about?  I'm talking about the geographical anomoly once mentioned on this blog, an oft-flooded area whose terrain was changed forever by the New Madrid earthquake of 1881, a former confederate stronghold that is now home to corn and odd men in trucks who wave at strangers.    Friends, we went to The Nub.    The Nub deserves a documentary film.  Its main claim to fame is that while other states either have waterway boundaries or quite straight lines, this bit of Kentucky is on the Tennessee side of the Mississippi River, almost an islet away from its mainland.  Kentucky paves the roads, provides the electricity...I don't know how schooling works for those kids in the three homes that are part of Bessie's Bend (the town of Bessie is a rusted-out shed and a turn in the road).  Its significance comes from a supply depot the confederates used when needing to ship goods to New Madrid.  Today that area is flooded out, due to the New Madrid earthquake.  Kentucky owns it, Tennessee uses it basically, and its history is with Missourri.  That, and freaks live out there.  A fat kid in a sleeveless black T-shirt pointed a gun at me, Bowden, and Missios.  We ate Godfather's Pizza at one of the nicer restaurants in town, a Amaco food mart.  An old woman offered to sell us moonshine at her shack liquor store.    Three hours is enough to get all of the Nub...from the levy to the mosquitos to the road signs to Tony's Chute (not Tony Shaloub).  But it's three of the best hours life can offer.     Back to Winston-Salem   I'd say I'll tell more about the road trip, but I won't.  A ton happened, I thought about a lot, I listened to a lot of Justin Timberlake.  I saw a lot of foliage and confederate flags.  But if I don't write about it today, I won't write about it at all.  And I am quite pooped.  I woke up at 3:30 this morning to drive out here.  No sleep since.  I will crash and enjoy it.

      Jean Baudrillard is a genius...a tough to understand genius, but genius nevertheless.  Whilst playing grabass at Barnes & Noble a few days ago, I happened across his latest testament,  urlLink The Spirit of Terrorism .  Baudrillard is a cultural theorist who is lumped into postmodern, poststructural, and nihilist camps, but his ideas are similar and different to all three.  He believes reality ceased to exist long ago, and was replaced by virtual reality, or hyperreality.  His opus,  urlLink Simulacra and Simulation , outlines the loss of symbolic interchange, and rising global tendencies.    In college, I was introduced to Baudrillard on a whim, and fell more in love with his theories than any other camp of thought or person of note ever.  This brought about a  urlLink poor photo essay  based on my wrong interpretation of his ideas, and later an emulation of Baudrillard's thoughts and style in  urlLink a paper about MTV's The Real World &copy;.  His writing is sparse and fragmented, coming across as off-the-cuff ramblings of a savant, musings so eloquant you hate his ability to provide them so effortlessly.  It took me over a dozen readings of  urlLink Introducing Baudrillard  to finally understand his most basic points, and to be honest, the entire book still doesn't make sense.  I first felt comfortable with Baudrillard when I read  urlLink the gulf war did not take place , three essays describing the hyperreality of Bush Sr.'s initiative in Iraq and its lack of honest consequences...honest in real, not in moral.   I hated myself for thinking this, but I know I'm not the only person who wasn't immediately horrified, so I'll say it:  as soon as I heard about the terrorist attacks in NYC, my first thought was "This means Baudrillard is going to write again."  Granted, I heard on radio first...the images weren't readily avaibale to me until noon, and those changed my outlook, but only to a superfluous extent...I saw horror, but, as mentioned by many pundits that day and many other days, the horror was terrific.  And while terrific is a derivative of terrible, it also holds close meaning to fantastic, or a more positive, awe-inspiring in a good way tonality.    This is what Baudrillard talks about here.  I don't want to explain it, because until I read it five or six more times, I won't have it down.  But he looks at 9/11 from a global perspective, as the start of the war against globalism, and how globalism is the matrix of humanity.    One interesting point...when I saw the Iraq situation this time around, and the call against Weapons of Mass Destruction&copy;, I wondered how that would affect Baurdillard's call of the first Gulf War as a non-event (he doesn't say that it didn't happen, but that it wasn't war in the way war is, it was smoke and mirrors for the people by building up a poor opponent, pummeling him, and reveling in the glory of a best man wins when the winner was never in question).  Looking back, his book works just as well, if not better, the second time around.  Who really thinks we were afraid of WMDs?  Or that we wanted to liberate the Iraqi people?  We needed a show of might, and for 12 years, Iraq has been our canvas to show the world our power.

      Floated the Lord's Elk.  Had a great time.  I don't know who else did.  We're not going out tonight...everyone will sleep, watch their shows on television, or work on their flat tires.  I'm not upset...sunburns, hangovers, and lost sunglasses and wallets were the order of the day on a part of the river we didn't know, with tighter turns than our inebriated bellies could stomach.  But it is depressing to realize that we probably will never go canoeing again all together.    I've stayed too long.

      Wrote a short screenplay today.  It includes a scene where a woman prepares her dead boyfriend and current fiancee for a threesome.    My grandma is about to become a regular reader of the blog.  I tested her this morning by telling her my infected testicle story.  She passed.  Pretty incredible.  My mom doesn't know this exists, and that is the best.  If she did, she'd cry a lot.    PB Sandwiches and beer tomorrow, as we float the Lord's Elk.  I'd take pictures, but I don't want to buy a waterproof camera, and anyway, it's just lush vegetation and ugly people on the sandbars.

      Why so nostalgic?    I was reminded yesterday of one of my lesser moments...even though I remember many great moments of my idiocy, living them out in the solitude of my own room and showing no one my weakness, the death rattle comes when someone reminds you that they suffered from your actions.   ...  She only asked for one thing, for me to be on time.  "You'll be here at 5:30?" she said, holding my hands, eyes fixed straight at mine.  Her eyes were my favorite part of her...large, bold, soulful; the kind my mind would shed layers and swim in.  A word was a word, a touch a touch, but her eyes covered all.    This meant she couldn't lie.  "Are you mad?" I would ask her, in the spirit of redundant banter inspired from fear of truth.  "No," she'd say, directing her falsity at me, playing her part in the same game.  I'd ask again.  Same answer.  Never did I trust the honest look consciously, because truth was always described to me in ways of oral language that often contradicted body carriage and physical intangibles.  But I always knew.  And it always upset me.  Truth was Truth and Lies were Lies, and even though I often lied to myself or lied to protect myself or lied to protect others, I had no patience for those who committed the same transgressions.  The repressed energy and misunderstood hormones of adolescence were a similar hurdle; I interpreted her actions from a purely selfish point of view, constantly blaming myself and creating a distemper of distrust.    But when I would show up at marching band practice, or we would pass each other in the hall, or she would open the door to find me on her porch with some random bric-a-brac in hand, everything sped up after the first look.  I breathed faster, moved quicker, thought more, smiled brighter.  Her gaze was an energizer, a constant emotional enhancer, a reminder that she saw something special in me.  I could tatto  Whipped  on my forehead and parade around the high school, flashing a lovestruck grin and expressing my undying admiration and feelings for her, but it couldn't match her look.  The only time the look would sour was when I asked her to verbally express her feelings for me, stemming from a personal lack of understanding the feelings of others, and the need for positive reinforcement on my own terms.  That would turn the energizing look into a purgatory look, which often resulted in my questioning her attitude of the moment, and led into the looks of lies.    I squeezed her hand.  "Of course," I smiled.  Maybe I kissed her, rubbed her shoulders, ran my fingers down her back, held her close and led her head onto my shoulder.  Or maybe we just looked at each other.   "Are you sure?"  she said.  "Of course!  If I want to get up for something, I'll get up for it."  She knew that I had trouble waking up.  Throughout my whole life, nothing has caused me more strife than an inability to wake up in the morning.  At the beginning of a term, or a job, or a schedule that requires a timed rise, I will get up on time, get ready at a lacadasical pace, and make it to my destination.  But after one or two weeks, I would start to sleep longer, soon so long that it affected my arrival at any destination.  I could set two alarms.  Three.  Once I set four, in each corner of the room.  But a need for sleep would take over, and I would turn the alarms off and return to bed.  Charm and work ethic made up for my tardiness on all fronts.    This is still a problem.  In college, my GPA for classes 10 am and after was 4.0.  Classes before 10 am, I had a 2.9.  At the library, I would show up later and later, until for the last month I didn't get to my 8:30 start time until 9:30 or 10 usually.  I used to shower at night in case I slept through the alarm, but I thought if I didn't shower I would have to get up on time.  Instead, I sometimes sleep and go to wherever stank and nasty, loathing.    She knew I was going to sleep through, even if she didn't want to believe it. I thought I would get up.  I wanted to get up.  I set two alarms.  I don't remember them going off.  I remember getting up at 6:00, cursing as I violently got my fishing gear together and threw on my clothes.  Maybe she was still asleep, I thought.  I wanted to call and explain, but I didn't want to wake the family.  It didn't matter...the phone rang as I was leaving.    I arrived at 6:25, wearing the facade smile, hyped up on unreal energy, trying to hide the pain and hurt and sadness for letting her down.  I pulled the Volvo up, jumped out of the car, and jogged up to the porch, smiling.  She was sitting on the swing bench, stoic.  She looked up at me.  I looked away.  I didn't want the truth. ...  I don't come here often at all.  And I spent a lot of time and energy in this community.  The nostalgia isn't a longing for the past, wishing that things were different.  It's a vault of old memories I didn't have access to.

      Awake, sober, and not too ashamed of anything I did/wrote last night.  A few things I said at the bar that probably would be best left unsaid, but they involved others, so I'll throw it off as catty gossip and hope I never feel the repercussions.    I watched HIGH FIDELITY again (folks, as long as I'm on dial-up, you're not getting any links).  I was in Chicago when they filmed it, lived a mile from the area where it was shot, can tell you exactly what direction Cusack was facing every time he is on the El platform...and I didn't like the movie the first time.  Not at all.  Many friends came up to me and said it was going to be my kind of movie...an introspective look into personal psychoses, using music as a backdrop to life because music is the backdrop to life, at least it is in the movies.  I didn't get into it at all.  I didn't like the girl the movie hitched on...why get so attached to such a fruity bitch?  Cusack came off as overtly whiny, and in the end he gets back together with a girl that I never really felt any pathos for.  Go for the music reporter!    It wasn't so bad the last time.  Cusack was still happy to just complain, and I still don't like the chick, but I appriciate the search, and the silliness and folly of it, but the knowledge that he has to go on the search.    A girl  cheated  on me a few years ago...not in the grandest definition of the word, but enough to warrant speculation and get me upset.  In response, I got ahold of the girls I had dated to that point and asked them all if they had ever cheated on me...not to accuse, but to see why they did if they had.  None of them had.  In retrospect, I can see that writing a letter saying "Did you ever cheat on me?" is not the most strident way to extend friendliness with an ex, but I was a sensetive world-loving guy at the time who only really cared about himself (most of the world-lovers do, and it's a terrible realization), so how else did people live but in relation to me?  Anyway, I wasn't looking for answers...my mind was made up, and I just wanted to know if they agreed with my choice without telling them what my choice was...because the greatest thing about an ex-girlfriend is that honesty can abound in an exes relationship.    I don't think I'm looking for answers now either.  I'm not asking questions really.  John Cusack's problem was that he asked questions like why and what and how come.  No good can come from that, you just get saturated in the past, and your questions just become mechanisms of nostalgia and attempts at reconcillation.  Catherine Zeta-Jones isn't going to suddenly embrace him and they can move on from where they once were, listening to Anthrax and making the headboard buckle.  You can just watch, listen, see what is different, remember what it was before, try to track where they went, smile about it, enjoy the time, and wonder why their strengths seem to be your weaknesses.    Everyone needs to read a Richard Powers book.

      I'm drunk.  On six beers and a gin and tonic.  More likely five beers...sucks that I lost count on such a shitty number, especially since two were Coors Light.  But I'm drunk...sobering up, but keeping myself drunk mentally in order to write this.    Color Day 1997.  Mr. Krueger came out onto the dance floor after a 15-minute 80s block of music (where, because of my fond love of 80s and dancing, proceeded to throw my jacket and tie off, ride around on Daniel Harr's shoulders, and make out with Bonnie Bridges on the dance floor...all whilst completely sober), pulled me aside, and talked to me about Joe Rodriguez, who was drunk and at the dance, and who was about to get kicked out.  He tried to compare myself to Joe, not wanting me to become the drunk guy at the Rogers High School Color Day Dance (which honestly sucked, except that my girlfriend wore a bodacious dress and they played 15 minutes of authentic 80s in a block between other shit).  I didn't listen.  I was just happy to be there, naive to what drunk was.    The last paragraph was edited for spelling.  I am pretty blitzed, so this next paragraph will be typed as is...  I lied.  Maybe this one, if I don't sound like a total ass.    I hadn't seen BOnnie in over )(actually almost_)six years.  We dated for eleven moths in high school ()though she'll tell you ten, but i'm better with dates)_, fighting a lot but usually having a damn good night when we were together.  I don't know why we didn't talk before....out break-up was pretty bad (actuall yreally bad, just that I hada worse break-pu with someone else, so I never consider the one with Bonnie so bad because it was six years ago, but it was stilly righteously bad), and wby the time we were cool with each other, she was in school, i was in school, and i no longer came to Arkansas when i was onv acation.  So this was the first time since she was a junior in high school.  Now she is perparning to be a second-year law student.    Teh thunderstorm outside is glorious.  I stood in it for several minutes before coming inside, just watching.  The knowledge of security, yet the ability to compromise it, is the reason a storm can be so wonderful at night.  You are palying with fear if you go out, but you can just sleep with it raging, knowing wit will never come to get you  You are safe at home, it is just thunder, beautiful and melodic.  Thunder won't take you away at night.  It won't do mchu to your house.  You can jsut listen, see the periodic flashes of light, and cuddle up in the blanket, smiling about how you can overcome nature.    Too druynk to know what i'm writing, but still coherent enough to realize not to edit this thing for grammatical errors, and hoping all readers will overlook my atrocious content choices.  Bonnie looked great tonight.  Katie looked good yesterday at lunch, but there was something about Bonnie...maybe it was because Katie had a sinus infection, maybe it was because I hadn't seen Bonnie in so long, but I wasn't too attracted to Katie yesterday, whereas Bonnie embodied attractive at the bars we were at.  And I'm harmless, for the most part, and that is a total lie.  I consider myself harmless, and I really am, but I live with my thoughts, and in the back of my mind I wished on a star that for one night we could forget about six years of life that brought us to where we are, forget about the six most important years of my life, the six most formulaic years of my life that weened me into the conscious, independent, considerate, kind-hearted, all-good-cliche person that I am today...I wanted to forget that, and for one night be back in high school, knowing what i know now, with a Bonnie who had the same righteous indignation, the same bitchiness, the same strong attitude...i wanted one last night of that.  in the storm.  enjoying her.  forget physicalness.  just a night in that old room off of raven st, listening to the rotund one on magif 107.9, candles lit, both of us on the bed, her head on my shoulder, arm around my wasit, slowly scratching my side and belly, talking.  Sex would be glorious too.  But it's not about that.  I'd get sex if I truly needed it.  Maybe I wanted the past again, the times when I was innocent, when I protected her and she protected me, and I lived in Rogers, and Rogers was the world, and everything outside of Rogers didn't matter, because what was outisde of Rogers?  What I saw I knew, and I wanted to change the world, and it didn't seem that hard because the world was less than 100,000 people packed into 60 miles of land between Misourri and Fayetteville.  Those wer ethe days of true idealism, and I spent that with Bonnie.    It wasn't just idealism, though.  I wanted a part of me back.  A part that she has.  Flann O'Brien wrote a great book called THE THIRD POLICEMAN (too drunk to link), where he philosophized that people and their possessions became one in the same...if a man rides a bike for years, part of him ends up on that bike...molecules trade places...part of the bike enters him, and he enters part of the bike, and the two are interchangeable, and he and the bike will always have a kindred relationship...even if the bike is stolen, the vagrant will not get far, because the bike will not react well, considering the man he stole it from is part of the bike.    I feel bad, because eerything i remember about the relationship is selfish...a side people show after years of hiding emotions, putting things away, considering life with an analytical lens.  But here's the moment of kindness:  I was sitting on the Empire State Building, floor 88, looking over the ledge at the world below.  I was 17, with a few friends, living the dream of any teenager...freedom in one of the world's greatest cities.  I reveled in it, walking aroud the parameter, wide-eyed, taking in the glow of flourescent nightlife everywhere I could.  At one turn, I ran into a young couple, the age that I am now.  He was holding her, and they were looking out at Staten Island, a small light in the distance, surrounded by Lady Liberty and nothing but black.  He slid his hand down her shoulder and locked his hand with hers.  At that point, I missed Bonnie.  I had missed her lots before, owing most to insecurity of myself and my low self image at the time, but this was the first time I missed her because I wanted her to see something, to share something, to be a part of something that I was experiencing.  It was sad that she wasn't with me; it was a travesty that she couldn't see the view, not only of the ocean, but of the couple, and the couple with the ocean.  I turned on my tape recorder I had brought in order to take notes for a newspaper article, and wrote Bonnie my first impromptu letter about the view, only talking about what I saw.  Heather Decker listened to the tape in order to write the story, and never gave it back.    i'm not mourning, and i'm not living in the past.  i wake up tomorrow, and it's a new day, i've got lots of things to do.  but there are a few things.  one, it's both great and tough to see an old friend grow up and do so well and seem to have so much under control when you feel like much of your security is a facade; two, you wonder why you haven't found the happnies while they have; three, you wonder why ever girl you ever dated is now dating a guy named Chris; four, you had a great night, you are sitting up at a comuter, with a little time to talk, a little drunk, a lot ready to pass out, and you are mixing the past memories with the present desires and future plans, all because that's what you have in front of you.  The funny thing about seeing an ex is that while you can remember all of the good, find all the nostalgia, and wonder what may have happened (maybe even wish for it), at the same time she is throwing at you all of the things you like to forget...all of the low points that you pretend no one saw, that were just you dicking around alone.  In many ways it's good to be reminded.  In others it's not.

       Eating Crow (not quite a Hawk but still hard to swallow)        Ok, right, so that earlier post about the shitty job that I dreaded going to. I'm retracting that. I hated my job for a few days, but yesterday I designed and created an owner's manual and then today started rebuilding the website for the company. The boss man was so happy that he now has lots of design and publishing work for me to do! It took a week or so before he could start trusting me with the bigtime stuff but now its full swing baby! I got to edit photos and play until my heart was content in Photoshop yesterday and then today drive myself into a frenzy in Dreamwaver. Next week, I'm going to develop a new ad campaign for him and rework all of the previously created owner's manuals that leave much to be desired.  Man, I am starting to remember how truly happy this kind of work makes me! If the whole acting/directing/getting my own sitcom thing does work out, I know I'll atleast be employable and highly desirable as the Marketing and Public Relations Director for a theatre company. And I won't be unhappy about that. Of course, I'm not going to let go of my greatest dreams for it, but it's certainly a backup plan that I can live with if the dream doesn't become a reality...

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 5 - Rogers, AR   20 hours awake, and only four hours of sleep last night.  I should go to bed.  But I'm in Rogers...the high school hometown...area of some great conquests that were forgotten quickly, replaced by the smell of chicken pellet and Wal-Mart.  And yes, Wal-Mart smells.  When you face contorts, and you sniff the air, unable to discern what the problem is, but you know there is a problem around you, that is the evil of Wal-Mart.    The trip up should have been incredible.  Some of my friends hate flatlands...they tie it to a need for physical harm or suicidal tendencies.  I love a good flatland drive, where the road is straight, the grass is green, the sky blue, the clouds white, and there is nothing remarkable on the canvas except you and your thoughts.  My best writing is done in the car, and the drive from Dallas to Rogers is usually the best drive to think during.  Not only that, but I knew I would be stopping in Muskogee, OK, home of some of the world's shittiest liquor stores, where I am able to buy some of the world's shittiest beer.  Since some readers of this blog will be drinking some of this beer, I will withhold the names of said beer found in Muskogee until after said beverages are consumed.  I will say that I outdid myself, and for cheap.    Northwest Arkansas has a pretty good 80s station now; since I didn't bother to hook my portable CD player up before I started driving, I was tickled delicious when the signal was clear enough to listen to Madonna, Toni Toni Toni, and Human League.  The sun was shining, my arm was crisping golden brown, I was cooking at 78 on the Cherokee Turnpike, 54 cans of god-awful beer lay in my passenger seat, and so when the hawk darted out in front of the car, I assumed it would do its usual bird thing, and glide out of the way of the car at the last minute.  It didn't.    You can see the wingspan of the beast on the roof of my car...you can see the mark of the entire bird on the car, in what eerily resembles a white chalk outline.  Ten inches lower and the bird comes through the windshield, and the worry about what was just a misaligned oil filter would be trite compared to replacing an unwarrantied winshield.  And it upset me that one of my first thoughts, after a few minutes of calm deliberation, turning off the music, and driving stoically along the turnpike, was that I was glad the bird died the few inches above my windshield that it did.    Two years ago, I hit a dog in Shreveport.  I was in the yellow Volvo with Jessica Stewart (no one more than a friend), driving back from an IHOP meal of grease and carbs, when we passed through the Southwood light.  I was crusing at 40 when two dogs ran out into the road.  I put on the brakes and swerved to the left, avoiding one dog, but plum smacking the other.  I slowed down and watched as the dog I hit got up and pitifully limped away.  I wanted to turn back, but Jessica said no.  She was too busy laughing.   You hit it!  she kept saying, chortling sounds and shaking in the passenger seat.  When she'd calm down, she'd remind me of the look of horror on my face and start laughing again.  Months later, when she confronted me about my lack of interest in her sexually, I felt no shame in letting her down hard.    Remind me to talk about a wonderful musical number I saw in a movie today.  Not in the mood right now.

      I was up at 7 this morning.  5 pacific time.  I wasn't going to bed until 3 pac time all last week.    But this is what I expect out of vacation.  My best vacations are the ones where I don't sleep...where five hours a night is a long time...where I'm grabbing a late night breakfast with friends, and then up for an early morning breakfast with other friends.  When Daniel Harr picked me up at DFW yesterday, he asked how the trip was.  "Really nice," I said, because it was.  "Oh," he said, taking the loop to get back to 183 South.  "It sounded pretty boring."  To be honest, it was.  Well, the last four or five days were.  You can only sit at the pool so long, eat out so many times, watch so many baseball games (which, as I learned this past week, is quite a few) before the need for productivity takes over.  I demand productivity from myself.  It's why my EQ characters are so low considering I've played the game for two years...so often I prepare to log on and get a few hours in when I realize I've got writing to do.  There is always writing to do when you're a writer.    I had a real tough time writing on the screenplays out in California.  I do a lot of good thinking out there...I've got plenty of time to think when I'm there, especially in Palm Springs (something about a city you know...not needing to pay for anything when you're there helps too), where I can sit by the pool, sit in the pool, work the stairmaster, watch a movie, drive the old folks around, all the while looking at the majestic San Jacinto Mountain.  But getting into the mode to work festidiously on a script can't really happen.  The family wants too much from me.   You do your writing  they say, meaning well, but haraunging me about where we're grabbing lunch, of if I'm going to drive someone somewhere.  The freedom of a California vacation is the freedom of Weber's gilded cage.    My grandparents assume I'm helpless, mainly because my father is.  I live off $1300/mo, and they think I'm a fast spender because I pay atrocious car insurance premiums (fuck car insurance, by the way...I think waylaying marriage at this point is the most mature thing to do, and I pay out the ass for it...that and I have a dick...my lack of menstruation costs me $100/mo).  I'll be the first person in my family to get a post-grad degree, and they think it's because I'm lazy.  I can't blame them, though...writers are fascinating because you don't see them work.  If you see them working, you're going to ask  What are you working on?  and then they're not working anymore.    I'm at the auto dealership.  I won't write here.  I might play some EQ.  I bought a New York Times, but they had internet connection.  Your average debutante walked in an hour ago, leathered fake tan, but still good looking.  She stood next to me for a few minutes, looking at what I was doing, unable to ask though.  But she was just standing there...any conversation starter from me would be a come-on.  So I offered her the New York Times, just to get talking.   Oh no  she said.   I'm sorry.   And she left to read a magazine.  Granted, we weren't going to run off to Garland to copulate and work finance jobs, but 20 minutes of chat about the murky weather and school is never too bad.  And maybe she needs an escort to the next ball.  Sunday, in La Jolla, standing outside, breathing in the saltwater air, I didn't want to leave.  For that moment, I wanted to stay in California for a very long time, just living on the beach, growing my hair out, surfing a lot, picking up acoustical guitar, getting some silly job and having a lot of fun for a few years without any semblance of responsibility.  Today, early in the morning, sitting at an Arlington car dealership, playing grabass until I can go visit a lot of friends, I'm glad I'm here.  But that's the funny thing about me.  No matter where I am, I'm always happy that I'm there.   Dan Harr...the shit revelations are in the May archives...first one around May 19 I think, second a week after.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 4 - Dallas, TX   James Baldwin is a fantastic writer.  I was disappointed with  urlLink If Beale Street Could Talk  at first...slow pacing, simple word choice, and a plot that I figured out within ten pages.  I assumed this book caught up with time; his vision became cliche.  At page 100, I took it all back...Baldwin was writing in three or four styles, mixing words with rhythms, creating certain characters through the words he used (everyone spoke in the same tone, for the most part), and creating moods for certain moments (same sentence structure in jail, in Puerto Rico, at the loft of Tish and Fonny's dreams).  But Sharon's trip to Puerto Rico was the apex of briliance.  After finishing it, I was reminded of John Grisham.  But only in the sense that John Grisham wants to write like James Baldwin did...he just can't.    Late plane.  Lots of turbulence.  I enjoy people who do not ask me "How was your flight?"  I can't think of a less original way of starting a conversation.  With a complete stranger, or rare acquaintance, I'm willing to forgive.  But family seems hell-bent on starting my trips with "How was your flight?"  "Fine," I used to say, quickly pushing to the next topic of conversation...I know these people, and there is no reason to reacclimate to each other; I know my hours out will be scrutinized on a nightly basis, so you should know what to expect when you see me.  So nowadays I answer them truthfully.  No one asked me the question today, and it was so pleasant.    One day in Dallas.  Not even that, really.  Played a lot of EverQuest with Daniel Harr this evening, out hunting a Plane raid to get him experience and a sweet earring.  My favorite times playing EverQuest are usually with him, sitting in his office, the dimly lit office with a flat-screen monitor and large view window to the right of the desk set-up...life stops in this room for EverQuest.  We grab beers, tell each other that the other doesn't know how to play the game, and regail each other with stories of our addictions to this whored out gaming device.    Tomorrow I get up, get the car looked over, get it serviced, grab lunch with an ex-girlfriend (really, The ex-girlfriend...I think everyone has one that stands out above the others, and as long as you don't date someone for a longer period of time on a grand scale, The ex-girlfriend stays the same, sitting on a less than boastful perch until thankfully usurped), grab some real shitty bear in Muskogee, and hit Arkansas.  Golf tourney at a little Par 3 where I might win some cold bank...maybe.    I can't get that excited about this stop, really.  Maybe if I had found Dana Beyert's number, called her, set up a lunch date to catch up, see what happened with Willie, hear her laugh, see her smile...but I've got an old number.  We ended on pretty good terms.  We were walking back to her loft, holding hands even though her boyfriend was behind us, remembering the past and enjoying the present.  As we crossed the street, I wondered if anything could ever happen with her, if I really was interested in making something wonderful between the two of us, or if she was nothing more than the ultimate notch on the belt...the one that is within reach and out of reach, where you can touch it with the tip of your finger, but when you try to grip it you tip it over and it spills all over.  But I knew I wouldn't find out.  She had Willie.  Willie was an incredible guy.  I could write and make her laugh, but he could make her laugh and he had abs.  She liked me, I know, and those friends who think I was pining for someone out of my league are wrong...a friend can't notice the simple touch at the right moment, a spontaneous smile at first glance, or an unsolicited back rub just because you are you.  I came along at the wrong time, and when the time was right, I wasn't there.  When I left her that night, I knew I wouldn't talk to her or see her until we ran into each other again, per chance.  Calling her Shreveport cell phone wasn't the per chance I hoped for.

       Observation:  When you sit down to watch a great film (Pedro Almodovar's  Talk to Her  ) with a good friend and you look at the clock on the Cable box and see that it's 8:00 and say, fuck I have to be at work in 12 hours, maybe you shouldn't be working at that job. But, when that shitty job is the only thing keeping you from being homeless and it's only going to last three months, then maybe you should just shut the fuck up and stop looking at the clock so much and enjoy the time you don't have to be in the stinking hellhole of a temporary career...

      Hello again, restless blog!  Here I sit, in my Escondido room, with none of the trimmings of a room of mine...I never lived in this room when I was a kid; it only became my room three or four years ago when my stepmom left my dad...it's really just the spare room, but I'm the only person who sleeps here.  Whatever.  I'm in this room.  I'm writing.  On the bed next to me is a plate with the remenants of the remenants of this afternoon's Outback Steakhouse Prime Rib.  Mmmmmmm, Prime Rib.    At Centenary, I made a big hullabaloo about eating as a vegetarian for two weeks.  I had sizeable clout with administrators, and vegetarian friends of mine were complaining about the choices for them at the caf.  So I went a go for it!  It lasted four days.  Day one was salad, bagel, some awful vegetarian casserole medley, more salad, cereal, and cheese pizza.  Tuesday was salad, cereal, salad, salad again.  Day three was a stuffed tomato that must have meant stuffed in several senses of the word, salad, cereal, bagel, toast, and more salad.  Day four was the beginning of the end, as salad no longer looked good, so it was cereal and bread and a grilled cheese, but with american cheese, and I don't know but I just can't get all hot about american cheese...it's just processed shit that is neat because it comes in shrink wrap.  You never see a block of american cheese that you saw off of...when you do, it's either "american cheese product" or "nacho cheese," and that's spicier.  Friday should have been the easy day to eat regular, but the salad bar was wilted, they were out of Special K, and the only bagels left were cinnamon rasin.  I ate fish and red beans & rice...the red beans had sausage.    Today at Outback the meal for two of us cost $54.  Two $17 entrees, an appetizer (my dad loves appetizers...he also nearly collapsed on the golf course today at hole 12...when golf becomes strenuous exercise is when denial should no longer work), and a few glasses of wine'll do the trick.  He gave her $60, and told her to keep the change.  I was upset with his cheapskate ways, so he dropped another dollar.  I threw it back at him and put down $5 of my own...it had been a nice meal, she was a fine waitress, and I had the money to burn.  As we were leaving, he stops the waitress and says, "I don't want you to think I stiffed you on tip...there's another $5 on the table."  She smiled and patted him on the shoulder.  "Good of you to take the credit for that," I said.  "What good would the credit do you?"  he said.    Ironic if that $5 had gotten me laid.  Scary as well.    I wrote a heroically terrible blog entry while at a coffee shop in La Jolla this evening.  I was bored but knew I needed to write, so I headed out to find the penultimate coffee shop.  I would have settled for a bookstore, but they close at 9 on Sundays, and it was 8:45 when I passed the two closest ones.  So I drove into downtown San Diego instead, and spent the next hour and a half searching for coffee canaan.  I got lost half a dozen times...in Point Loma, in Point Loma again, in Mission Beach, in Pacific Beach, in Seaport, and in Mission Beach again.  Once ready to give up, I found gold... Cafe Crema .  I did a fantastically tidy job of parallel parking the Volvo S-Wagon, and walked the two blocks in the cool breeze (not referring to a easy breeze on a warm July day...this is a breeze off a 60 degree ocean in 60 degree weather...I am a jackass for leaving my hoodie in the car in Dallas) to enjoy the rapture of this, my beverage salvation.    The place was packed, the conversations less than inspiring, the kids too trendy, the coffee shitty, the internet not available, and the televisions on The Man Show.  Cafe Crema is a reason that Starbucks does so well.  Since lots of people like honest writing, here's an exerpt from what I title  More Uninspired Shit :   There is a glorious girl here in a tight blue cotton long sleeved shirt and the glorious black pants that make any ass look like ultra ass who looks like a lesser-endowed Christina Ricci.  I’ve been here for 20 minutes, hands in the hair and over the mouth and in positions reckoning ponderment, and she always seems to be laughing.  She and her boyfriend are studying, and she’ll write something and laugh, or say something and laugh, or write and say something and laugh, or just laugh after laughing.  I can get away with looking at her because she is just underneath the line of sight to the television, which carries a marathon of the Man Show.   I'm sure she got laid tonight.  I got prime rib instead.  The sex would have been nice, but the leftover prime rib was damn good...better than the first time, a leftovers event akin to hitting for the cycle in baseball.   Of course, the best sex is better the second time around.  Had there been sex and prime rib?  I wouldn't leave San Diego.    It was only this good because I left the best part for this encore...I went after the regular steak-like part of the meat, saving the fatty tenderloin outer edge for now.  The fat keeps in the flavor, and when the meat is cold, you can work the steak knife like a whittling tool, get the fat away, but you've still got tender meat with all of the flavor.  My mom taught me how to whittle, but not with soap or wood or any other cub scout apparatus...we used steak knives.  I once said that my best trait was typing...my mom's is her uncanny ability to find meat on a chicken bone.  I invite everyone on this blog to come to Naples so my mom can cook chicken.  Eat as much meat as you can off one piece...wings are unfair, but try a breast, thigh, or drumstick.  You'll put it down, content with your finish of said meat.  She'll look over, contemplating, then look up at you, back to chicken, back to you, chicken, your eyes, chicken, your eyes, chicken, distance.  "Are you going to finish that?" she'll say, pretending to be distracted by something in the distance, though there is nothing in the distance but boxes of unpacked books.  "I did," you say, upset at her accusation that you didn't eat your chicken.  "Can I take that?"  she'll ask, nonchalantly but with an aire of pompousness.  And she takes the chicken, and gets out the steak knife, and within two minutes has enough chicken off that bone of yours to cover three side salads and feed the cat.    Looking over the afterbirth of my prime rib, I know she would be disappointed.  Which is said, because I was impressed.  I could write the greatest coming-of-age story ever, win Academy Awards, make millions and buy her a house...but she wouldn't be as proud as possible until I cleaned a chicken bone down to the marrow.

       The ______________ Show, Starring.....   I currently have a job in marketing, but I would not call myself a Marketer. I am also a student in Directing at the moment, but I'm not really a Director. Today, according to an old professor of mine, marks the first day that I can truly call myself an Actor. I am an Actor. It feels good to say it. My first theatre professor in college told us that we are not actors until we've done it for ten years, and only if we've also done it outside of an academic setting. Only then are we experienced enough. Only then do we earn the title.   Well, on this day in 1993, I made my stage debut outside of the academic world in Aurand Harris' A Toby Show , a play set in the vaudeville era that retells the Cinderella Story with a Southern twist. I played the title character, Toby, a country bumpkin ranch hand who narrated the play and acted as the fairy godmother to the would-be princess. So, it was community theatre, and it was a shitty play. Either way, it opened the door for me, and I'm thankful. I'm sure Anthony Hopkins first gig wasn't playing Richard III in the West End. I'm sure he started out with a Toby. Hey, atleast my first real theatre experience wasn't playing an extra or a bit part like so many others. I was the lead!   Ten years and about 25 roles later, I have earned my wings. I am officially a professional Actor. While I am going to continue on in the MFA Directing Program, I will consider myself an Actor first and foremost. I've actually started auditioning for roles in the city. I'm acting in a workshop production for Triangle Productions this summer (just so that I can get an opportunity to direct one of my favorite plays there in November), I've got callbacks scheduled for the Northwest Children's Theatre season, and I'm doing PATAs in August to audition for all of the Portland Area Theatre Directors. I blew away Triangle and Northwest Children's Theatre with my auditions, and I will do the same for PATAs.   Very soon, I will be a gainfully employed professional actor with regular gigs. I'm also joining an agency, because It's time I started taking the steps to live my dream instead of settling for something that will give me a little more security. I'm tired of seeing people my age make it in the business when I am confident that I have just as much passion and talent to do the same. The difference between me and Hollywood actors my type is that they've gotten off their asses and taken some risks to get where they are. I've got to start doing the same if I ever want to get out from in front of the TV and get in front of a TV camera. Call me crazy, call me cheesy, but I want to be a comic television actor with a successful series, variety or sitcom. Yeah, so it's no art house, Independent, fine film. Fuck that! I want to use my god-given talents to make people laugh and enjoy themselves atleast once a week, 5 times a week once we're in syndication!....

       Hot Town, Summer in the City, Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty....   JESUS H. CHRIST ON THE BLOODY CROSS! That was a bitch of a heat wave! I just wasn't used to it anymore. I spent most of last summer in Chicago, so I really hadn't felt a truly hot summer for some time now. Yeah, so although I spent 22 years there, I was never really a Louisiana boy, and my absolute hatred for heat (including spicy foods) pretty much confirmed that. Me and the Sun just do not get along anymore. The Sun is like a big dodge ball for fat people. It's inescapable, it causes a lot of pain and misery, and it makes a fatty feel trapped, weak, and uesless in the game of life. I'm a polar bear fatty. I sleep with my windows open and the fan on in the dead of winter! Speaking of which, be right back...... Oh wow, I just opened the windows, and it's 60 degrees outside! Now that's what I'm talking about!   I think I want to move to Alaska to make sure I never have to experience heat again. I can deal with the blistering cold wind if it means I don't ever have to sweat anymore. It's deceivingly cool right now, and I feel paranoid. While it feels fandiddlytastic, good neighbors, I worry that with our shrinking ozone that this heat wave will not be the last for Portland. OK, so for the people back home in the Dirty South, 93 degrees with 28% humidity would be a blessing, but this was a heat wave for Northwesterners. Air Conditioners were sold out everywhere this week. I'm going to wait until it gets cool next week and the stores have restocked and dropped the prices back to normal, and then I'm going to make my budget conscious purchase to protect me from any future discomfort.    One day, I can tell my kids that Sears made me a Canuck     Actually I could have bought a 5000 BTU window unit on Sears.com and had it delivered for free within 5-7 business days for only $88. That wasn't soon enough for me, because I was HOT and I could not take it anymore. So, like the mad crazy weak bitch I am, I roughed the massive crowd and went into Sears on Thursday. Although miserable and sweating like everyone else, I walked out empty handed. See, to my surprise, the price for the same unit online was $160 in the store. I told the sales person about the sale online and he said, "Well, that will take you 5-7 days to get. By then the heat wave will be over. If you really need it now, you'll pay more. You won't find a cheaper unit in Portland...." I told him to fuck off and walked out.    Fucking pigfaced capitalism! Instead, I went to a dirt cheap motel and spent two nights with truckers and transients in a small box of a room with 70s wood paneling, lying naked on my own comforter I brought to cover the nasty, rickety bed. Sweet Satisfaction among the filth! I put the air conditioner on full blast until I couldn't bear it and ignored the possibility of pestilence. Thank you, Holiday Motorlodge for helping me beat the heat for only $15 per night. Fuck you, Sears for helping me realize how fucked up this great money grubbing nation really is! Screw Alaska, because even though it's 1000 miles away, it's still in America. As the temperature drops outside, I wrap my Canadian Flag sheet around me and dream of Calgary...Some day, it'll happen, someday it'll all come true, ay....

      A Saturday night in.  Kind of nice, to be honest.  Two weeks of vacation can start to drain...the more people you know when you visit somewhere, the more time you spend out, wearing collared shirts and cologne and sitting on restaurant decks, talking the same conversations and watching the same people.  I'm not bitching about this...few things are more enjoyable than a meal and beer during a sunset when your company is a group of people you truly enjoy, much less a month of traveling and seeing people at their best.  You just can't do it every day...repetition ruins enjoyment.  12 days in a row, my sunsets were that.  Tonight was my night off.  I will enjoy tomorrow's sunset, sitting at Islands, eating a portabello sandwich and talking to Mike or Mark or Fish, grabbing ten games of pool after that, drinking a bit, joking a lot.    I travel a lot, mostly because I'm homeless.  Is San Diego my home?  Is Florida my home?  Is Arkansas my home?  People from those places would say each is.  But I am a Texas resident with shit in Texas storage.  But I don't plan to stay in Texas after I get the Masters, even though I enjoy a lot of the folks there.  When I graduate, I long to try something new...specifically coastal living (I lived 30 minutes inland in San Diego...important distinction, because when I was a kid it was more likely we'd go to Disneyland than the beach).  So I move around a lot.  I can live for a month out of a red adidas soccer bag, holding two pair pants, two pair shorts, four t-shirts, three collared shirts, a jacket, two pair socks, seven pair underwear, one pair shoes, and my sandals.  It's second nature to live out of a suitcase...so much that I spent my first month in Austin living out of my boxes, only taking stuff out when I used it.  By the time I was unpacked, I was fed up with my roommates and moved.    When you travel, you are at the discretion of the person you are with.  Most of this is no problem:  I'm more extroverted than not, so I'm cool with going out whenever and usually with whomever...I can adjust my sleep schedule to appease my housing coordinator...I only require a couch and a sheet or blanket (not both, I won't use both)...I can go a day without a shower and I won't smell bad (probably my greatest trait)...I get along with roommates and parents swimmingly (as long as I'm not trying to pick them up)...and when you need time off from playing housemaker, I'll entertain myself.  But to be a good houseguest, you can't take more time off.  To thank the person you're with is to go with them on every decision they make.  They're hungry at 10 am?  You're hungry too.  They want to stay out until 4.  What luck, you do too!  They want to visit Sarah Trotter and Nikki Pharr...no shit, those are the honeys you were hoping to see this trip!  Free time is at the discretion of your travel director.  Only when they need a nap or a study break or some sort of moment to themselves do you get your own time.  And you have to use it wisely.    I use it to write on my blog.  Usually poorly.  Dad and I went to La Jolla today, the ritzy side of ritzy San Diego coastline, home of one of the best theatre companies in America, Des McNauff's La Jolla Playhouse (too lazy to link...find it yourself if you're interested).  The shopping district is on a cliff overlooking the ocean, and since my dad's favorite decisions revolve around where to eat, I figured we'd eat somewhere where I'd get beach and he'd get drinks.  Our waitress was fairly plain, slight British accent, no one I would remember except that she was the fifth waitress in a row that I noticed had an incredible ass.  Last night at 150 Grand in Escondido, our waitress had soccer legs and g'donki'donk butt.  Two days before, at TGIF, another stellar ass in stellar black pants.  The one prior, from Macaroni Grill (chains are cheaper for the old folks, who watch their money when they don't have to... it keeps us rich ), had bodacious everything.  And the hostess there was a fine assed speciman too (and one of the 18 year olds from the pool, who now that the weather is cloudy, can only be found at Westfield's North County Faire Mall).  I was never big on asses...I dated a lot of cross-country runners through high school and college, so sexy for me was small ass, small boobs, and kenyan legs.  But now that I'm a little older, a little more cultured, and a little fatter, I can appriciate a fine ass.    San Diego's got some fine asses.  WOOT!  Two weddings at the park in La Jolla today as Dad and I walked along the beach (for people who think beach is a surely sunny proposition, San Diego's coast gets cloudy in the middle of may, and save four or five days, stays that way until July 4.  every year).  I wondered how they arranged the wedding out there...who rents out a public park?  There were no police or city officials, so it didn't seem like a permit proposition.  My dad wanted to sneak in and eat cake.  I think he just wanted to go in because his ex-wife used to do that kind of thing.  I've never crashed a wedding, though if I can get Louisiana's favorite young politican Dawson Taylor to agree to it, I will film him as he crashes a wedding.    Last time I worked to finish my blog, I rewarded myself with porn.  Tonight it's EverQuest and In-N-Out Burger.  A friend of mine from SoCal requires me to go each time I come into town...she always gets mad when I get it sans secret sauce, though.  I'm not big on the Thousand Island mystery delectable.   We're out of secret sauce!  Put some more Thousand Island out in the sun!   My dad lives 30-40 minutes from the coast.  Today was the first day he'd been since I last visited him.  My mom lives 20 minutes from the coast.  The last time she went was the last time I visited her.  I go to the coast as much as I can...I missed a trip in April with some friends because I had papers to finish, and I still hate myself for not getitng my priorities straight.  I will drive 12 hours for two hours at the beach.  If I lived out here, I'd be on the beach every day I could make it...and not making it would only happen if I worked a double shift or someone had died.  I don't know a damn person in North Carolina, but once my TIP job finishes up, I'm taking someone with me to Myrtle Beach for a few days for fun days and big old bags of dirty nights.  Interested?  Send headshots and resumes to rolinmoe@hotmail.com.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 3a/a - San Diego, CA    Back to reality,  the grandparents said after I got into my dad's 1990 blue Volvo 740 stationwagon, ready to leave the desert for cooler lands.  Both got hugs, handshakes, asides just for them, and a cool $20 in my palm from Gran V.    For the past week, I did nothing of consequence.  I woke up late.  I went for coffee.  I flailed at crossword puzzles.  I watched a lot of baseball.  I went to the gym.  I spent two hours each day at the gym.  I watched old movies.  I chatted with people at least 20 years older than myself, most at least 40 years older.  I flailed at my writing.  I went to the theatre.  I went shopping.  I went walking.  I went driving.  I drove swank cars.  I drove a pimped Infiniti and three pimped Mercedes.  I sat at the pool.  I played golf.  I played golf in nothing but my board shorts, hitting 120 yard wedge shots to 10 feet.  I played golf and then got in the pool.  I got in the pool and then played golf.  I watched more movies.  I ate ice cream.  I walked Palm Canyon Drive with one grandparent on either side, providing a buffer between the two as they asked each other questions that the other couldn't hear.   Frank?  Frank?  Fra-ank?  Virginia?  Virginia?  what?  Virginia?   I relax better in Palm Springs than in any other city.  It's always been that way.  Palm Springs was the vacation spot when I lived in California...rich grandparents, a pool, and sometimes we'd bring the Nintendo.  Frank would go in the yard and we'd play whiffle ball or hit whiffle golf balls.  We'd go to the water park.  We'd eat quality hamburgers at quality restaurants.  My sister and I could go the whole week just wearing sandals, if that.  Little has changed.  The whiffle balls are now real golf balls, as I break the rules and walk onto the course they live on to hit my practice strokes.  The grandparents have more money and less years to spend it in, the pool is just as beautiful.  The nintendo is replaced with my laptop, providing ample entertainment when the old folks get ready for bed (which is usually midnight, those caddy devils).  And the water park is where the gym is.    For the first time since I played high school soccer, I established a gym routine.  Repetition for the week.  Thirty minutes of cardio.  Forty minutes of weights.  Fifty minutes of relaxing in the outdoor pool, swirling in the healing waters and looking up to see beautiful bikini babies bob by.  They were always on the other side of the fence, though.  I was on the geriatric side.  No problem.  The workout was all the energy and release and catharsis and inspiration I needed.  You work hard, then you relax for a bit.  Religion for the physical self.  Definition exists on the right bicep, the first definition since I weighed 135 (five years, 30 pounds, and one femur shatter ago).  I feel better.  I breathe easier.  I am a lot darker (though I still have the whitest ass that human retinae can visualize).    My problem with the gym isn't in working out.  It's not even finding the time to work out.  It's finding the time to relax after you work out.  You go to the gym, get on the machines, go for a while, finally stop looking at the clock when you're on the cardio, start with the weights, and soon you're there 90 minutes and pushing your next appointment/place to be/book to study.  The hour of denoument that I came to know and love this week isn't there, and even if you can find 10 minutes to get in the hot tub, your view is of dry wall or musky windows, not the San Jacinto Mountain and the Coachella Valley, not to mention the tan bikini crew.    I'll try to establish the workout routine when I get back from California...maybe a bit in Arkansas, and maybe a bit in North Carolina.  But the relaxation exercises are imperative.  Can a long shower take the place of celestial waters?  Only if you're sharing the shower with a soft-skinned beauty.

      Lothar Muench's father died when he was 10 days old.  In Russia.  During the Nazi push towards Moscow.    On Lothar's birth certificate is a swaztika, It is an emblem of his pure aryan heritage.     You don't understand war , Lothar says to me in a non-agressive tone, only looking to enlighten me.   I lived through four wars.  I grew up in a Nazi family.  That is racism.  I was taught to believe there were subhuman people out there, people worth nothing.  I was taught hate.    No one is for war,  Lothar says after I tell him about my anti-war demonstrating, a practice he discourages.  He sits upright, eyes focused, sentences short, finding meaning best in his quick rhetoric contact.   There is nothing more brutal, more demonizing, more inhuman than slaughter.  When I was in Vietnam  (Lothar was a businessman in Singapore during the late Kennedy/early Johnson years of the war...he spent a lot of time near an American air base, and often found shelter there),  a boy was flown in to the air base, dying.  He was from Idaho.  He wanted a steak to eat.  We got him the steak, and he died eating it.   I won't pretend to capture his thoughts any more, because I am truly inefficient in relating his stories.  But in talking about war and politics and Bush and Iraq, I found we were saying a lot of the same things.  Which was interesting, because I always considered myself avidly liberal, and everyone considers Lothar a staunch conservative.     We all have energy.  And we need to use that energy in a constructive manner.  That can come from love.  I know the other side of love...I saw it when I was young, I see it today.  You can't focus on hate.  You can only get going in love.   I still don't think war was, or is, right.  I am still upset at the way America portrays itself as a world savior, yet policy dictates a me-first attitude.    But does that make me a liberal?  Why are there liberals who want to do more bombing?  Why are there conservatives who truly do hate war?    Brian Thomas and I played a game one night after some illicit drug usage.  After everything someone said, you'd just ask them why.  Why?  Why?  Why?  You go until you can't figure out why.  That is when you realize language is a fallacy.  Or that you hold no original thoughts, and can only regurgitate the party line through so many levels.    Tonight, it was one question for me.  Why am I a liberal?    I care about people.  I wish people had the opportunities I have/had.   I hate the rich/poor gap.  I liked a lot of socialism, but Free Enterprise isn't so bad either.    It's furstrating to align yourself in a camp that you don't agree with, and find many people you do agree with in other camps.  Then you're just arguing politics just to exercise your rhetorical muscles.  What good does it do?  I hate the bitching and yelling on MSNBC and Fox News, and I boost myself up when I don't take part in the pettiness.  Yet tonight, I rolled my sleeves and gave it a run with old Lothar.    Labels.  The more I think, I find the less I know.

      Ramblings (or Revelations, just to make Daryl Burrows happy) -     *Is it wrong to want to write a short film about fat kids playing dodgeball?  I had this revelation for a seven-minute film when my grandmother and I were at the coffee shop this morning.  It'd be a feel-good movie, where the fat kids win.      *Someday soon I'll write a chapter about my father and his love of going out to eat.  Seven times in the past 48 hours he's called me, making sure that plans are still on for our dinner reservation tonight...do we still plan on meeting Loathar at six?  Dinner at 7?  What if Loathar is late?  Will he have to wait until 7:30? Is Frank going to be ready...will he have fed the ducks?  This is why I eat Panda Express and drink High Life.    *I need to forget about the 18 year olds at the pool.  I had the pleasure of listening to one talk on her cell phone.  When the body is loud and the voice is quiet, you can at least pretend that she would be intelligent.  You can forget that you crave conversation, not just the fun of a rompy-poo.      *I counted seven specific worries from my grandmother within an hour today...my dad's drinking, my car's oil leak, Frank's partner Rudy working on a ladder at a house in Andreas Hills, the coffee not prepared correctly, the car backing out of the driveway too quickly, my dad's car acting up in Banning, and Frank's bagel browning too quickly in the broiler.

      Happiness is a  urlLink French film  with sparse dialogue, compelling characters, and a resolution that is satisfying without pandering to hope.    As we came back to the house, I watched the branches fall from two palm trees.   From afar, you only saw majestic branches falling, one at a time.  The destruction was brilliant...withering and slow death is not exciting, but arbol armageddon, where the plant sheds its skin for seemingly no reason, crying out against whatever internal wrong plagues it...you cannot help but stop the car and look.  I thought nature had gone wrong.  My grandmother didn't understand, she just wanted to get home.  I was too frightened and too thrilled to move.  Something was fighting, and its last gasp was envigorating.    Only on closer inspection were the tree trimmers evident, perched 50 feet in the air, trimming the lush foliage back.  They do it because rats get up in the trees and destroy them.  It makes the trees look like in-use condoms.

      Gratuitous cussing forthcoming:  Cheering for the San Diego Padres reminds me of the forced rubbing of the taint upon a garlic shredder.  People bitch about being Cubs fans or Dodgers fans or Red Sox fans (my dad, in his holier-than-thou-four-glasses-of-cheap-red-in-the-gullet manor, puts his hand on my shoulder and says  they know pain )...at least you are fucking competitive.  My team hasn't won two games in a row since April.  They've won 17 games out of 59.  Today, they lost to the Detroit Tigers.  The 15-40 Detroit Tigers.  The laughingstocks of baseball Detroit Tigers.  The shit ass bitch cunt fucking bitch fuck bitch fuck bitch fuck fuck fuck fuck Detroit Tigers.  The pitcher who lost?  Brian Lawrence.  He was working on a complete game at the time...eight innings of four-hit baseball, before giving up three runs in the ninth.  That would be bad luck to lose, except  the last time he started, he lost a three-hit shutout in the ninth by giving up three runs .  Two complete game shutouts working, and fucknuts loses the games in the ninth.  Not even against good hitting.  Against terrible teams.  The two teams to rally for three runs against my formerly favorite Padre pitcher:  the Brewers and the Tigers.  The other two worst teams in baseball.  My fucking god, this wasteland of cum infested shit the San Diego fucktoys call baseball will send me to the fucking grave.  Fuck.    Sosa corks his bat.  That sucks.  My team can't win a damn game agains the Detroit Bitch Tits in the ninth when their best pitcher is on the mound.  Give me the corked guy.  You cheer for the team that can't beat baseball's worst team.  The feeling is reminiscent of Dana Beyert's refusal of my advances circa March 2002.    I watched a great movie tonight,  urlLink A Face in the Crowd .  This is the movie that Bob Foshko told me to watch months ago in conjunction with my screenplay at the time.  Andy Griffith plays a hobo-gone-media superstar who gets drunk on his ability to greatly influence the American Public&copy;.  Among other things, this is the first movie I can think of where Andy Griffith and Walter Matthau play competing heartthrobs, making the heroine's indecision on who to chose that much easier to accept.    Frank (the step-grandfather) and I were at the gym a few days ago, soaking in the heated outdoor pool I oft use as catharsis.   When I was younger,  he said, moving his arms back and forth to "increase blood flow,"  my grandfather would spend time with us by sitting in the reclining chair and falling asleep.  And I figured that this man only thought old thoughts...he didn't come outside, he didn't help with dinner...he woke up late and went to bed early.  But I'm 75, and I don't have old thoughts, at least I don't think so.  I still think like I used to.   It's tough for me to get into old movies.  They move a lot quicker and usually a lot better than contemporary films, but the good movies have the good lines, and the good lines are nothing more than quick cliches used by guys with feelings at frat parties who think that their feelings will get them some stank on the hang-low.  But the more I watch older movies, the more I am impressed with their blatant honesty about situations.   A Face in the Crowd  takes a hard look at the advertising industry, showing many reasons that media (specifically visual media) can abuse the trust people put in it.  Television has the ability to influence without prejudice, and infulence without fact.  If the ad wizards can lie, who can't?  The political commentary towards the end of the movie is eerily reminiscent of one Texan's 2000 presidential campaign.  It's a smart critique of a power few people at the time understood, and an omen of the future of a media that works to herd people into thoughts.  There were three channels at the time of the film.  There are five major media conglomerates today.  Those five can each now own up to half of the media rights in a city.  Thank you for providing us choices, Michael Powell.    Fuck the Padres.  I'm pissed.

      I watch the McNeill-Lehrer hour on PBS.  Good news...kind of liberal in that it presents two sides to an issue.  This FCC bullshit is disgusting, especially while in California, where I can smell Rupert Murdoch's ball stank all over local media outlets.  Michael "Neoptism" Powell had the gall to tell Jim Lehrer that allowing large media conglomerates to own more media outlets will "help foster competition" and create "the free press that the American People&copy; deserve."  If Fox can own more media, then they can bring better programming to their outlets...like Married by America and Mr. Personality.    My favorite stupider Powell comment was in regard to the large outpouring of criticism of this move...nearly 750,000 people wrote to the FCC to speak out against these new changes.  According to Powell, these people don't know what they're talking about:  "Most of the letters were very general...they didn't address every rule we changed, just one."  Yes, the one that allows media giants to own 45% of media in a community, including cross-cutting media (before, you couldn't own a TV station and a radio station, now you can own both AND the newspaper).    It sounds like congress is going to put things back the way they were...any time Barney Frank and Trent Lott are both against the same thing, its chances of going through are pretty bad.  But until then, I'm doing my best to read and watch BBC, PBS, and Al Jazeera...nothing else.  Unfortunately, that means boycotting The Simpsons.  Fuck.

      I feel tapped on the blog.  Happens every once in a while; the vigor of personal enlightenment dissipates, leaving this site a venerable wasteland of quips and short, pointless thoughts.  My mind is not at rest; I started writing on a screenplay for the first time, my first honest work in at least six weeks.  The idea consumes me, chews at me, throws me poignant moments and thought-provoking instances, and includes one of the stronger plot-based stories I've conceived.  It doesn't provoke positive emotions, or make people get up and conquer the world, which was the reason I got into writing in the first place.  It provokes questions.  It causes disattached wonder.    It's too hard to get on the blog, and too easy to live right now.  I wake up, grab a relaxed breakfast, read the paper, work on the crossword, go out with my grandmother for a coke, a late lunch, a movie...get back and take my grandfather to the gym, do some cardio, some weights, and spend an hour in the pool, creating a floatation device and spinning in the jettisoned water, losing myself completely in the water and sunlight and my body and my mind.  We leave at 6, get home, either go to dinner or cook something quick, and I talk to the old folks after that until about 10 or so, when I grab the laptop, check my email and websites, and maybe get to the blog by 11.    The most beautiful wiccan caught me oogling her breasts today.  I drove down to the Palm Desert Borders a few hours ago, looking for coffee and a place to plug the laptop in.  I ended up surfing the music section for too long, going over the  Bend it Like Beckham  soundtrack to find a few of their electronica songs (and remember how great Blondie's song  Atomic  is).  A red-haired, buxom lass wearing a pentecostal skirt and other sundries walked by, fervently discussing the importance in the right deck of tarot cards. I figured she was talking to herself until someone walked into me; I turned around to see this silver-haired beauty, wearing a white tank-top and black skirt, with glorious large bosoms and the warmest pagan smile.  She apologized, I was speechless, and she continued over to the New Age section.  I was looking over some James Balwdin at the time, stealing looks at her over the stacks.  I looked through the Baldwin, but could only think about her breasts.  So I made my move to the Cafe, which would take me right past her.  I took the book and started walking, looking straight ahead but catching her in the periphary.  She was consumed in some large book.  I walked slowly, planning the right moment to look straight at the boobies...from the corner of my eye, they looked glorious.  Left, right, left, right, look:  I turned my head and looked straight at them...they were marvelously round and full of zest, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't like large ones.  My glorious excevation was short-lived when I looked up to see her peering over the book and looking straight at me looking straight at her dangly wonders.  She didn't share the same smile as before. I played it off as interest in New Age... That Kitaro is a great musician, eh?   No smile.  And I'm not getting laid tonight.  That would've been wicked.  Imagine all the candles!

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 10 - Little Rock, AR   I met with a guy in Durham who was interested in becoming a screenwriter, but had no experience in the field.  We talked about his writing, what he needed to get into a grad school, what grad schools would be good for what he wanted to do, and how not to want everything (writing, producing, acting, directing, editing, color correction) when you've never done anything.  My main focus to him was that he neede to write on a regular basis.  I don't subscribe to 1000 words a day (a Jack London favorite) or to wake up at 6 and rewrite everything previous before you start on the new (Hemingway)...I don't even fancy myself with James Joyce, who could only come up with two words a day and still be festive.    This blog is my writing exercise.  And I'm glad you read it.  And if you didn't read it, I probably wouldn't write it, so I'd lose the exercise, get frustrated on scripts about the repercussions of college-aged women starring in internet amateur porn, tell the script to fuck itself, and watch PBS with Brian Thomas.  Therefore, thank you for reading.  I hope you enjoy it.  But do understand...while you are my audience, I don't necessairly write for you.    Katie keeps the largest volume of personal journals I know of...since the seventh grade she has put her thoughts down into a dainty hardcover book, shelving them at completion and returning to them in fits of trouble, happiness, or nostalgia.  She let me read a little from a few of them, and I was never really interested in reading what she didn't want me to read...partly it wasn't my business, partly I was growing into a more understanding, less insecure boyfriend, and partly because the writing kind of sucked.  She was great with quotes...lots of people save quotes for usage later, but few do it as well as Katie...she was also good with identifying music.  But when it came to recounting the trial of the day,  I lost any interest.  She could talk about tongue kissing her boyfriend du jour, and I'd just keep going, because I couldn't get into it.  Seceretly, I hoped that sex would help her writing immensely.    It wasn't her as a writer that was the problem, though...she was writing for herself.  The journal was never meant for me.  At the time, that sounded preposterous... Why would you write something just for yourself?  Memeroy is for you, language is for others .  I never even considered writing something if no one else was going to read it...it was a waste.  A fair amount of my writing is personal reconcilliation, but either 1) in a way that marks a good (or at least adequate) story, or 2) in a way that I can provide a trial run on a topic, with the idea to edit and lengthen it later.    I was afraid to turn the blog into the more personal narrative format...most I've read are awful, and I don't want to waste anyone's time with needless banter about my daily activities.  But I needed the practice, and an audience was enough impetus to keep going.  So I created  urlLink Touchstones , a site for literary discourse.  I posted, but no one else got involved.  So  this  was born, and became the political outlet.  Not a problem, except there are a lot better of sites out there for political awareness and leftist discourse.    The guy I met with didn't sound so keen on the blog thing... But if I'm writing, shouldn't I be working on a script?     Little Rock with two med students who go to bed early.  Of course, so do I.  I'm getting acclimated to Central Time just so I can go back to Eastern come Monday when I hit Florida.  The drive was long...700 miles alone yesterday.  Terrible radio stations.  I've never enjoyed the return near as much as the approach.  I used to try to work the greatest maneuvers to stay at Disneyland when it was time to leave, telling my parents that I left a pair of my sister's underwear in one of the dresser drawers, or that I lost a dollar near Fantasyland, or that I missed it and wanted to go back.     urlLink Call It Sleep  was incredible.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 9 - Asheville, NC (Camp Daniel Boone)   And you get in your car.  And you put on your belt.  And you start your car.  And you reverse and you start to drive.    I'm hitching two nights at a staff cabin at Camp Daniel Boone (affectionately known to  urlLink Centenarians  as Camp Big B, even thought Big B doesn't work there anymore.  His brother does though, and his brother is Daniel, so Camp DB still fits.  This place is a usual summer employer for about half a dozen Centenary students, mostly from the TKE fraternity, though looking over the spread of Gent alumni, there's a bit better mix right now.    The drive was quick and relaxed...I love the lack of pressure in a driving situation.  Years ago I would forecast my arrival, letting my friends know a distinct time to expect me.  Not once did I not arrive within 10 minutes of my forecast, most times closer to five minutes, and several times I was perfect.  It was fun and a silly ego boost, but on the longer trips, it chapped my ability to meander, to stop at flea markets, look at potted plants and fruit stands, drive a little slower, think a little more, conceptualize a script.   My best drives are the ones where I conceive ideas during the trip.  I first started this with Will Kordsmeier in 1998, as we drove from Morrilton, Arkansas back to Shreveport.  We came up with a script idea where the world was a television show, and God, Satan, and his angels were the executive producers of the show.  I remember little else of this idea, except that it was pretty poor (it was a cross between Defending Your Life and The Truman Show, except there was a Diner where a lot of the action took place...I think I was hungry for Citgo brand Tater Babies), and Will and I loved it.  I think I found my script for this semester.  It involves Benny Mardones, as well as an idea I've kicked around for years about a guy who wants to be an artist but isn't any good at art.  It's a coming-of-age story.  The goal is to either make it The coming-of-age story, or a coming-of-age story unlike no other.  I would kick myself in the face if someone said it was 2003's  Sixteen Candles .    Asheville is beautiful and rugged.  A cosmopolitian flavor, but in the wilderness outpost fancy.  Lots of friends of mine have passed through or stayed for a while.  I can see why.  People are fit, art abounds, and showers are discouraged.  5 out of 6 men have beards, and the sixth probably just doesn't grow facial hair.  The climate is 15 degrees cooler than the rest of the state, and rent is extraordinarily cheap.  And I think there's a lot of sex going on.

      Durham, I enjoyed it.  You've got a beautiful minor league baseball field, some fine landscaping, and one of the best independent cinema markets in the country.  Work on this whole immense poverty thing, and Duke, stop paying half of your workforce minimum wage just because you're the only real employer in town.    No double doors this time...no renaissance birth.  The room doesn't mean as much to me...the campus, maybe...the quad is brilliant.  I'll look back quite fondly of this place, hopefully to come back in three years and regail this blog with stories of the past that are currently stories of the present/near past.    Life.  My own again.  Intriguing.  What will I do with it this time?

      My first girlfriend ever was Dana Bamburack, in the summer between 8th and 9th grade.  From what I'm told, that is kind of late to have a girlfriend.  In Elementary School, I was too busy playing handball or finding other trouble with my Chaparral mates to think about girls...I remember my sister asking me to support her as she stormed the Principal's office and demanded that Chaparral Elementary allow its students to kiss...I didn't know anyone at Chaparral would be interested in kissing.    Even if they were, they weren't any good.    I had a lot of crushes in middle school, namely on Nicole Cruse and Laura Odeh, two girls who would later star in mid-90s alternative cliques, but at this point were just unique cuts against the flashy money grain of Southern California.  And I did kiss a girl, Jennifer Fjelstad, who I knew from years before at Violet Capriotti's day care (de do de-do!)...we kissed because "A kiss is nothing between actors," but Chris Garnier was right, it was my first kiss.  I moved to Arkansas at the end of my seventh grade year, passed up an opportunity to sit next to Cara Roop and wow her with my Californianess, ended up taking the seat in front of Jesse Hopkins instead, and worked from that disadvantage for several years of Rogers instruction.    The summer of 1993 rolled around...I had toiled through a pretty bad year of 8th grade, making a 3.5 on the skinniest skin of my ass, doing the least bit possible for each grade I received.  I longed for California, for the area that seemed familiar, that didn't smell like Tyson Chicken, where I got to go to beautiful restaurants on the Pacific Ocean, eat at Ben & Jerrys, gorge myself strip malls and all things commercial.  Rogers was where my mom's family lived, the family whose carpet was a relic of 1971 and whose family members went by Hoss and Shorty.  California had art, culture, pretention.    My mom and sister decided to take a vacation that summer...my mom told me that if I wanted to go, I would have to pay for it.  This was not her way of torturing her son in a gender-backward contemporary Cinderella...she had no money.  Paid $21.50/hr in California at the end of 1991, she took a job doing the same thing in Arkansas for $8.50 in April 1992.  Money was so tight that I paid our monthly phone bill out of my college savings, so I could talk to my dad once a week.    I wasn't getting along with the mom or her family, some because I was a hormone-driven new adolescent, some because I hated my mother for taking me from California.  I chose the free vacation with my dad, where he would buy me things and take me places and do things Disneyland.    I did the vacation with my dad.  He bought me things, took me places, and did things Disneyland.  I saw old friends Colin and Michael, who played lots of the famed Sega Genesis video game ROAD RAGE.  They even had nicknames based on the characters.  Life was back to normal.  I loved it.  I so loved it that at the end, I decided I would move back to California.  The only problem was that I had a committment with the University of Arkansas Summer Music Camp, occuring one day after I returned from California.    I probably put 20 minutes of practice into my music, getting curt replies from my mom about not being prepared and wasting the school's money.  It didn't matter.  We pulled up to Pomfret Hall, she unloaded my stuff, and I moved into my dorm room.  I don't remember if she helped me.  Maybe.  Yes, I think she did.  And I think she drove me up to the Band Hall for my audition.  I waved, she dropped me off, and I counted the days until Arkansas would be a memory.    The sound upon opening the door of the Band Hall (I don't think it has a name...where we rehearsed that year was called Kimpel Hall, and later I would rehearse in the Walton Arts Center, but our auditions and my Timothy Thompson private lessons during my senior year of high school were in this unnamed band hall) was innordinate din.  Flutes, tubas, euphoniums, oboes, percussion...a medley of poorly tuned, poorly prepared players greeted my arrival.  Kids were huddled against lockers and in corners, positioning their music in the most feasable position to get the last strand of practice in.  At this point, for the first point in my life, I felt unprepared musically.  I found a cubbie, got out the horn, and gave the beast a go.  It was working alright, but a month of no practice killed my endurance, something I couldn't fake in the audition.  Somehow I knew to just go and play, rather than wait an hour hoping to find glory.  I went in, played my piece.  She asked why I hadn't practiced.  I asked if it was that bad.  She said no, you're a good player, that's why it's obvious you haven't practiced.    I meandered back to the dorm by myself.  It was a beautiful day, and the walk from the band area of campus down to Pomfret is one of the great Arkansas walks...you start up a large hill, cut through a forest, and pass behind Kimpel to come out near the union, from where it's down a small drive past Brough to the band hall, as well as the Chi Omega Greek Theatre.  I never make that hike when I visit Arkansas, and I should.  Here is where the memory lacks.  I played grabass for a while in my less than happening room.  My roommate, Kyle McNitt, a great guy whose current claim to fame is that he was my first friend to have a colonostimy, had Sam's Club flavored waters and even a poster of the UA Golf Team above his bed.  I had my plane tickets from California, and a number for the Jim Rome show, which I planned to call religiously, providing Rome with the Arkansas Account on the world of sports.    Somehow, we met up with Tim Moser and Jackson Jennings, two yonger guys from Rogers, and the four of us decided to meet up with some other Rogers folks, being Dana Bamburack and someone else.  If it was Nicole Villarreal, the story would come full circle.  But I don't think it was, even though she was Dana's best friend.  Dana and I got to talking.  She wasn't attractive...yet.  She had Sally Jesse Raphael glasses, squinty eyes, chubby cheeks, and a complete lack of breastage.  But she had promise she would fulfill.  And she was attracted to me.    I remember that I was warned about some little man who was dating Dana, a man that I thought of and always consider to look like  urlLink Jonathan Lipnicki .  And I didn't really seem to care.  I wasn't jealous, I wasn't afraid...I was just having conversations with Dana Bamburack.  We would talk on the phone, sometimes so much that Kyle would get upset with me.  We would talk at lunch.  We would never hold hands, but we would position our bodies as close to one another so that we could sometimes accidentally touch.  She was interested in music, dance, and a bit in education.  She liked my jokes.  She didn't like my pranks, causing me to come up with my favorite quote of mine until I was 15 and learned how to come up with a good quote,  80 percent of what I say is in jest, and the other 20 should be .  But she forgave.  And she sat next to me.  And we looked at each other.  And my mouth would dry, my hands get clammy, and I sometimes stammered.  I felt like I had known her forever.    And this all happened over two days.  She went kind of nuts, we broke up that Tuesday (Band Camp started on Sunday), tried again Wednesday, failed, and I danced the last slow song with a crying Dana at the Friday dance, to Eric Clapton's  Tears In Heaven .  That fall, we would start dating, date maybe a month, and break up for no apparent reason, other than I was in the 9th grade, I didn't really care about having a girlfriend, and it seemed like the best thing at the time.  Dana moved at the end of that year, I dated a different friend of hers years later, who I failed to kiss, and I am sure that now Dana Bamburack is an effervescent, hot 23 year old college graduate engaged to a frat guy.  I wish I could say that I hoped she would help starving children or follow music, but I don't remember...in all of the great conversations Dana and I had those two days, I don't think we ever learned anything about each other.  And months later, walking to Elmwood Junior High with Daniel Harr and Chris Faulkenberry to play in the Elmwood Pep Band because Beth Carter asked us too, Daniel mentioned Dana.  And we all laughed a bit.  And somehow I remembered that before that Band Camp, I was ready to move from Arkansas for good.  And somehow Dana, this girl that we all made fun of every time we'd see her at Corn Dog 7 hanging out with the skater kid she used to make me jealous, was the reason I was still here.

      Another group leaving tomorrow morning.  I get my life back as of 2:00pm EST.  I want it, I have a lot to do.  I found the constant inspiration I'd been lacking since Centenary...I came here with questions, and leave with different questions.  And I'll miss another 37 kids.  I thought I had prepared better to deal with it, and it will be a little easier, which might not be fair to the kids here, but hey, it was just three weeks ago that I was experiencing the breaking of full-time bonds for the first time in years...I'm an old pro now.    I lost the last game of Mafia, and it was all my fault.  Kevyn, Dennis, and I were left, and I had earlier suspected Dennis of being in the Mafia, but lamented that I never truly knew when he was in it.  I waivered based on my own inhibitions, and voted against Kevyn, even though Dennis gave me ammo against himself.  Kevyn wasn't his usual self enough, though.    I'll miss trying to read Richard's face in Mafia.  Or Trevor's.  Or answer one of Adam Heart's questions.  Or give Boody a high-five.  Or suspect Wu of wrongdoings that I haven't seen, but it's obvious he was in the middle of.  Or ask Ryan about religion.  Or Ryan about TGIF or Texas.  Or Kieron about Angels In America.    I'm not sure if I know the girls here better than I knew the ones there.  It's tough...it's only been three weeks, but three weeks of constant bombardment with these people makes it easy to forget the conversations with the Laurens, or Jackies...now I focus on what Sarah or Ana or Liz or Katie Beth said to me today.    I think I did a good job.  I'm fair.  I don't expect things from them that I didn't do myself in camp.  They get in less trouble if I did it when I was a camper.  Granted, I was a damn good camper, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  Next year when I do this, if I teach, I will really miss this interaction.    I played Benny Mardones at the dance.  They liked him.  It's an incredible song.  Hopefully they'll think of TIP when they hear it again.  Same with Dirty Dancing's  I Had The Time Of My Life .  I did so many of the same things in high school that these kids are doing now...it makes me feel good about who I was.  The question is, am I becoming the person I have the potential to be?  I think this camp got me closer to that direction, not in terms of learning anything, but just a great inspirational reminder of how great things were, and that things can be that great now, even though I'm six years older.    As I played Tommy Rugden's  Bang On The Drum  for the last song, I wanted to dance with the kids.  In a way, I hoped one would ask me to dance...it wasn't slow dance, just a line dance as we sing  I don't want to work...I just want to bang on the drum all day!   We don't dance with students as policy, but I needed to be asked...I didn't want to be the old guy looking like he was trying to recapture youth.  Then I thought, maybe I'm not recapturing it...maybe I'm still young.  Why does 23 need to be old?  Inspiration and exeuberence tie together.    I'm ready to write the letter to the GDI kids now.  Too bad it's late and I need to be up in six hours, and I only got four hours of sleep last night.  WEET!

      I'm not sure what I think of  urlLink Friendster .  I only paruse it when I am bored, and torn between looking at that and looking at my once-glorious fantasy baseball teams, but since the baseballers ain't got no love since early June, I can't bring myself to look their way, so I log on to the 'ster and surf around, reading fairly dull, faux-glamorous synopses of twentysomethings who swim with the fashion current.  Yet I stop and take a closer look when they're A)  From Austin, B)  Hot, or C)  Both.  I'm not going to track these folks down because we both own copies of  urlLink Deep Breakfast ...in fact, by seeing them on  Friendster , the likelihood is that I would avoid any sort of meeting, the antithesis of the beta site's credo.  Yet I'm still fascinated at times, still surfing around, still checking out the locals, the hotties, and the local hotties.  One friend turns into 60,000, yielding sites like  urlLink this , that I'm not sure if I'm supposed to read or not.  Yes, she links to it, and yes, she's hot, but am I supposed to peek into her life as she sorts out her feelings about suicide just because she looked good in a buddy pic?  And then what?  I know some of her inhibitions, some of her fears, something quite personal, and I just cast the website away because she's young, not my bag, and not so great a writer?  Then there's  urlLink this girl , who in many ways I hope took these pictures off some amateur softcore site, but it's quite doubtful, and much more likely that it's her.  Exhibitionism is one thing, but when a need for attention spills into posting homegrown pics of yourself in states of undress, the problem seems manifest.  She reminds me of the girl I saw outside of McDonald's on the night of Bacchus during 1999 Mardi Gras, who was tracking guys down, kissing them full, allowing gropage of breasts and genitals, all for a handshake and a string of beads.  This girl had no friends with her...she just sat on the curb outside the closed Mickey D's, wearking a courduroy coat with a fur collar, eyes vacant of passion and full of fear, participating in the social ventures for no reason other than to pump up self image in the most derogatory way possible.    I do judge too easily.  Years ago I used to pride myself on my ability to psychoanalyze complete strangers after 5-10 minutes of conversation.  It was like palm reading, except I explained all issues in a way that involved some sort of sexual inhibition or problem with siblings.  I got facets right, but never people...I cannot be reduced to my dad's alcoholism (one thing that makes  Capturing the Friedmans  so great is that it uncovers multiple layers of complexity in the familial relationships...we don't associate just A with one character, B with another...) or my mom's nagging or my sister's uncompromising stances.  But I look at her and don't see an independent woman who is empowered by  urlLink Live Nude Girls Unite .  I don't write my post-porn screenplay yet because I can't write women.  Women were the best characters in my last two works, but only in their relations to the male protagonist.  The post-porn piece is more about the girl.  Can she stand on her own?

       urlLink Capturing the Friedmans  didn't make me want to go home and take a shower, scrubbing as one must to clean off the filth and mire caused by such a harrowing deconstruction and unraveling of an American family.  I read  urlLink Roger Ebert's review  beforehand, partly to justify the $5.50 as well spent, but also to prepare for any shocking or lurid happenings.  They didn't surface, possibly because of my prior dwelling on the subject, but I just don't think the film did a strong job of setting up its payoffs.  It is a distanced look at the plight of the Friedman family, and it is interesting and good because we look at it from a distanced perspective, though a fair share of the footage we see is home video of the family.  The most telling moments in the film are when the family shot home movies of the father and brother before they were to attend trial...looking at the faux levity, and comparing the mother we see there to the mother interviewed in present day, we see firsthand the reality of life's drama.   There was more to say, but it's wiped away in a phantasmagoria of TIP job things.

       urlLink Epididymitis .    This is my second round with the beast, the first coming in April 2001, after a great run as Bartley McCormick in Martin McDonaugh's  urlLink The Cripple of Inishmaan .  During a quick scene change, I would have to jump out of my costume and into another, and every night, my nuts would kill me after the change...like I had jarred them.  The pain got worse and worse, until the morning after the last show I could barely walk with the pain.  I went to Nurse Judy for a consultation, where Bob Calhoun was more than happy to share his opinion...Nurse Judy got me to a doctor, I had a through examination including prostate check, and was given antibiotics.  And I was told not to "use my organ" for a month.    Because Epididymitis is an STD.    But I'm not having sex these days.    And I wasn't the last time this happened.    The thought regarding Epididymitis is that it hurts, it sucks, and hopefully you've got a lot of stank on your hang-low to compensate for your troubles, because this isn't anything like Chlamydia.  Both times, I was in the middle of a dry spell.  Goes to show that I should never not be having sex.    The medicine runs $135 for 28 pills, 2 pills a day.  FUCK!  I was told by Daniel Young not to get the prescription, but just to "spray some Windex on those small boys."  So until my UT insurance kicks in, I'm dropping car insurance money on some Ciprofloxacin 500mg.    I asked the doctor if I should refrain from sexual activity during the term of the medicine.  His words:   Whatever you want.   Let's see how long I can be strong "for my own good" when the doctor is telling me to rub 'em out without delay.    Chris mentioned that I should mention breasts in the title of my first nonfiction anthology.  I've improved on his technique, coming up with the title   Boobs, Beers, and Balls.  And Shits.    That'd sell like rubbers!

      I would love to vote Green again in the 2004 election...their politics are exactly what I want in government:  a significant cut in military spending, more progressive foreign relations, abolishment of death penalty, abolishment of the War on Drugs&copy;, universal health care, and taxpayer-funded elections.  But I  urlLink share the reservations  of the party...while I don't like the neo-liberal slant many Democrats (sans Dennis Kucinich) are taking, I don't want George Bush in power any longer.     urlLink Benny Mardones  fascinates me.  He probably shouldn't...an old, pudgy rocker living in Syracuse with a band called The Hurricanes who only had one hit in his career.  But the hit is one of those songs that keeps coming back to me, usually at night, in a dimly lit setting, where there is a breeze or a chill and I want a coat or a girl to keep me warm.  One song...poor lyrics, not much to focus on musically except a xylophone introduction and several backup singers during the bridge...but not yet have I ever heard a song where someone put more of themselves into the music.  And this isn't just a knee-jerk reaction to someone holding my hand and this song being on the radio, or the simplicity of many 80s synthesized songs that lack any sort of bass or multi-instrumental bends that are witty at first but hollow the more you hear them...every time I listen to his song, I try to find the holes, and instead he leaves me slack-jawed, longing for his soul to continue speaking to me.    Work is good, but not inspiring at the moment.  I'm having fun, reading a lot, worrying about a few things.  I'm censoring the blog.  Censorship is so interesting.

       urlLink Johnny English  was alright...nothing to write home about, but funny.  Whimsical.  Silly.  Twere Rowan Atkinson not in it, I'd be disappointed in myself for spending my time there...but he can make the silliest gag funny.     urlLink This  star-studded movie looked wonderful...on its Sony Classics&copy; homepage.  But IMDB gives it a 5.1.  You often wonder how a movie with 15 true stars could falter.  Or how none of the stars could have the moxie to stand up at one moment and ask the director, "Why don't you guys buy an actual script with some of the budget?"    So many movies I want to watch.  It's one of the pluses of living with Tripper this coming year...the screenwriting cabal watching films on the big screen TV, sending out for NetFlix all the time.  I am a mediophile, one who loves to collect all things media (books, music, dvd), but I need to view more than I need to own.    My goal this next year is to watch a film a day, or at least stick to that pace.  And even with that, I will only watch 365 films in a year.    There are some wonderful contacts through TIP...I've met four Ph.D's from Duke, three in the writing profession and one in politics.  One of the writers is friends with a prominent screenwriting professor at The Florida State University (that's how the folks on Monday Night Football say it).  My main focus of research is in  Hollywood Format , and how women and minority film writers fit into the generic Hollywood mold.  My premise at the moment is that for a woman screenwriter to be considered an authority on the subject, she must have a gimmick.  Claudia Johnson, the friend, wrote what looks like a very good book called  urlLink Short Screenplays That Connect .  However, it is a specified, gimmick-ladden title...she is working in short works, and her gimmick is how it connects an audience.  Syd Field, on the other hand, can write  urlLink Screenplay , the opus of Screenwriting.  Why isn't he required to formulate a specific niche for his writing?

      Part of the TIP Resident Coordinator job description should be  Able to find multiple numbers of random shit lost by students.   Water bottles, sports equipment, wallets, crucifixes (or crucifii? the word is Latin) retainers, and especially keys.  At Wake, at least a dozen kids lost their keys at some point during the camp's tenure.  Here the number is less, but the stakes are higher.  During a round of Ultimate Frisbee on the quad yesterday, John announced his key was missing, causing us to start a search line and walk at arms length across the field, scowering the grass for any semblance of a shiny object.  Somehow we found it after 20 minutes.    The goal of this institute is for every student to leave here with a plan of action that they will impliment at their school/in their community in order to help alleviate a dilemma/solve a problem/promote service and involvement.  Lisa is working on eating disorder awareness.  I haven't thought about eating disorders in a long time, probably since I was a junior at Centenary...eating disorders seem to hover primarily in the adolescent age bracket, with a few stetching into post-adolescence early adulthood (I believe that to be a wonderful term).  In high school, we were constantly bombarded with Ad Council&copy; posters and awareness videos about eating disorders, including a Coach Gooch video that can only be placed as odd - a girl who collects her post-bulimia discard, holding it in jelly jars in her closet.    I've dated two girls with eating disorders.  Quite possibly more, but I can only think of two who I was close enough to so I could notice and try to help.  One is recovering, the other I believe is still anorexic, and won't admit to herself that she has a problem.   I've dated three girls who wanted to rebel against their strict fundamentalist backgrounds, and two others whose ideas on sexual encounters came straight from John Calvin, with addenda to allow for dry humping.  Another girl was abused by her mother, and another abused by her father.    I don't post this to show my limited reading audience  Look at this! .  I don't know why I post it.  Maybe because  Call It Sleep  is such a wonderfully depressing book, so full of questions, so full of childish wonder, and so full of misaligned jackass characters.  I am not sure if this book inspires me to write, or denies me my most true story.  The father in  Call It Sleep  is a bellicose tryant, abusive in a physical realm, yet drawn whole-heartedly to his wife in a maternal aspect...his jealousy of his son's interaction with the woman comes because he does not get that attention from her anymore.  It is a perfect representation of my father, subtracting the physical abusiveness and incorporating more lucid quips and sarcastic banter.    I often forget that my father is a first generation American, and his father was born in Norway and grew up in immigrant slums in Minnesota and harbortown Los Angeles.  The evidence to tie the Albert in  Call It Sleep  to the Albert my dad's father and the Albert my father is anecdotal and fanciful...I never met my dad's father, so I don't know the relationship my dad had with him.  All I know is a 19th Century Europe that exists in my imagination and nowhere else, a simulacrum of my thoughts and dreams.

      Movie to watch -  urlLink Stone Reader .  Documentary about a man's search to find Dow Mossman, regarded as one of the greatest young writers of the 20th Century in a New York Times review of his 1972 book  urlLink Stones of Summer .  His book vanished a year later, and he never wrote another novel.    Roger Ebert  urlLink sets it up  fantastically, as he usually does...the only movie I haven't agreed with Ebert on in recent memory is  urlLink Dead Poets Society , a movie that I can honestly say I enjoyed much more then as opposed to now.  Of course, I used to think  urlLink St. Elmo's Fire  was one of the great American Cinema Classics&copy;.  Anyway, the film meanders, and an easy 20 or 30 minutes could be cut, but at the end you don't really care, because you hit the meeting point, you get excited, and the interaction doesn't let you down.  Neither does the re-release of Mossman's  Stones of Summer , scheduled for September 2003.  Until then, I was inspired to buy  urlLink Call It Sleep , the great lost book of the 1930s.

      A few bits of greatness...  Friends and other male compadres, fear not!  Masturbation  urlLink reduces the risk of Prostate Cancer .  I was always told it was tomatoes and deep green vegetables, but looks like you can keep eating the waffle fries and taco bell if you get the personal groove on.    Also,  urlLink Jerry Springer  is considering a run for a US Senate seat in Ohio, and has filed his name in case he wishes to do so.  This has caused great levity among media and political pundits, including a scathing critique from National Review columnist  urlLink Jonah Goldberg .  Everyone wants to comment on the Springer circus, get the sound bite, because it's this week's Sausagegate or Martha Stewart scandal or Laci Peterson drama or SARS news.  Normally, I'd steer clear of worthless media fodder, except I don't find this worthless.    Because I think Jerry Springer would make a damn good senator.    Let's go to the expected comments section, please:   You're an idiot!  He'd ruin the Democratic party!  -  Brandon Lawson   What the...  -  Dawson Taylor   Expected from a liberal crackpot.  -  Jerromy Falk   Cool, and expected.  I jumped on board the quick quips wagon when I heard about Springer's thoughts on the subject.  Except I had two chances to hear him speak recently...and while I can't find his exact quotes anywhere on-line, I will say his words were impressive and a nice change from the regurgitated yet dilluted Democratic response to Republican bullshit.  Springer understands that his show is a farce, but he also understands that 1) people want to watch it, especially those who love to hate him for it, and 2)  his TV show, as he said,  is not the reason for homelessness, joblessness, a floundering economy, multi-national corporation scandals and tax evasion, and a superfluous war in Iraq .    Both Michael Moore and Barry Glassner make similar arguments in their recent work, based around media effects.  "Journalists" look to their own medium, Television, when assigning blame to the "degredation of society."  And it is expected, because in that statement they are both condemning this technology that many feel is invasive, as well as glorifying their involvement in it, showing their rise above the problems of the medium that we all use and will continue to for the forseeable future.    We watch Springer, and we point and laugh, or we are disgusted by it...either way, it allows us to feel good about ourselves and look past our shortcomings because, hey, we aren't fat and stupid like those people on the show.  Same thing with the media's coverage of many an instance, like Laci Peterson, or the other one from San Diego with the little girl and the interior decorator...I don't recall his name.  Anyway, Springer chooses to indulge our fantasies in a social way that glosses over our problems as individuals.  I've never liked the show, to be honest.  But at least he doesn't gloss over our problems as a nation, as the rest of the hegemonic institutions enjoy doing.  He can promote transvestite fighting all he wants, just get the honest message to Washington.

      We started playing frisbee at Centenary in February of 2000...Matthew Philbrook or Brian Thomas or someone broke out a cheesy disc, and after the requisite midnight double-chomp, we'd hit Jones-Rice field and throw soft, curving backhands to each other.  The nightly ritual grew into a happening, and on occasion we'd have up to 10 folks on the field in a circle, throwing the frisbee, laughing, tackling each other just for the fun of it.  I'd often make a run, slide on my knees to catch it, and try to flick it to the person behind me as if I was completing the second leg of a double play.    One time, after the lights were installed on Jones-Rice but before Matthew had carte blanche to do whatever he wanted on campus, security guards Preston and John came by to see what the commotion was, and we included them in a few rounds of throws.  Preston, a Vietnam vet who was often voted the campus' favorite officer, wore his gun and holster during the festivities...it weighed him down so much that every lunge became a fanciful stumble to regain his balance, and all of us sharing visions of internal hemmorage or accidental gunfire.  I'm not saying that we brought Ultimate to Centenary...guys like Tigger Denison and Cliff "Close Your Legs" Magnus, as well as Britton "Lipschitz" Lipscomb, were playing weekly rounds of Ultimate on Fridays...about 10 or 15 folks, usually consisting of quiet science majors, would line up on opposite ends of the field and engage in a game, which at the time seemed overly dramatic and not near as much fun as throwing the frisbee up into a wind gust and seeing how far it would implant itself into the ground upon descent.    After a while it seemed obvious to merge.  Matthew, Brian, Nick Missios, JW, Leif, myself, and a very sexy sports bra-clad Sarah Lagersen rolled out for Ultimate matches, sometimes playing the Science crew, other times getting enough of the Dave McCormick/Corey Pavletich posse involved to have a game if the Science folks weren't around.  Games held no dramatic aura that I expected...we ran around, caught the frisbee, stopped, and tried to throw it to someone on our team.  We always preferred to be on the team that didn't have Sarah, because it meant we could get away with tackling her in her sweaty wonderness, then helping her up and exchanging the playful hug.  I remember one game in particular, that Fall, with maybe 20 or so folks playing, where Matt Bowden, who was never known for his athletic acumen, posted up in the end zone and called for the disc.  I got over to cover him, and he ran to the corner of the end zone, with me in pursuit.  He turned back, and I cut before him to get the advantage.  The frisbee came flying, and as I looked, I saw that he was still behind me, standing his ground in the corner, having executed the most glorious spin move.  Touchdown.    That game was also great because Nick Missios got mercilessly tackled by Dave McCormick at least four times.    Matthew decided to turn this Apple Dumpling Gang into a team, so we could go to tournaments and play some honest competition.  This hit well with the new recruits, but the establishment balked.  We played ultimate to relax, have a good time, get some exercise, chat with friends, see Ceci Salinas run around in blue scrubs, and enjoy the weather.  To create practices, drills, and a serious mentality seemed to get away from what we started frisbee for.  And so Matthew and JW took Frisbee and applied a more regimented side to it, while Missios, Bowden, Sarah, and I faded from the sport.  I played with them as much as possible, but I didn't have the time to apply to the practices and tournaments (save a trip to College Station and another to Baton Rouge), and I wasn't near the athlete anymore.    Those of us who founded the sport with Matthew began to blame him for many of the problems our group of friends was experiencing.  He was called out for ruining Spaghetti Night, a tradition I started where we would hit Notini's Restaurant on Wednesday nights for their all-you-can-eat spaghetti and bread dinner for $2.99.  It lasted maybe eight weeks before Matthew usurped my power, leaving me out of two nights in a row, and inviting people like Lori Bradshaw and Rachel Day to the festivities.  The usurption led to a shouting match between the two of us in the student union, one of my less enjoyable moments, but the guy was cutting me out of spaghetti night, my own creation.  I also later blamed Matthew for the death of oral sex on campus, for reasons never explained by anyone.    Matthew kept his team together for two years, getting a few very good players out of it, as well as enjoying the hell out of himself.  Notini's never recovered.  And now, I am coaching the TIP Leadership kids in Ultimate for a showdown with the TIP East Campus All-Stars.  They don't want to do the drills or look at the strategy...they just want to throw the high, long, angling pass, let Dennis catch it, run around a bit, and have fun.  I can't blame them.

      My want for writing comes from my past of not writing.  It's convenient and sexy to call myself a writer...instant clout in circles outside of Austin, piqued attention from a smorgasboard of girls, handshakes and refilled beers from the guys.  If I told them that my current work was a weblog in the .net sphere, I'd lose the clout, the attention, and the beers.    Danny Ruiz says that if you want to be an artist, you have to work at it professionally for 10 years before you can call yourself one.  He hit that mark a few months ago.  I'm not even halfway there...it will be four years come August, when I wrote Tough Talk, a one-act for Centenary College Orientation, that deals with transitional issues from high school to college, and does its best work in providing no answers, trite or otherwise, to the basic dilemmas of personal freedom.    I look over my portfolio and see some success (Tough Talk, Lighting, Family Tradition), some failure (The Last Temptation by Christ,  urlLink Clubbing , Faith), and some work that can't yet be branded (Questions, Three Strikes).  Three Strikes is better than everything in my success portfolio, but I can't call it a success.    Do I live, or do I write?  In undergrad, I always told myself to live, and the writing would come later...thus the nostalgia/sentimentality factor.  Last year, I wrote more than I lived...at the least it was practice, and at the most I might have the beginnings of a saleable script.  But the key is to find the equilibrium, where I can live and I can write.    The other key is to see if I'm good enough.  I don't feel like I am.  That was bound to happen after Faith failed.  And I expected Faith to fail, in some ways.  But it floundered catastrophically.    Bob Foshko had an honest conversation with me in December about his life and his writing.   I got into teaching because I knew I couldn't handle my own scruitny...I wasn't a good enough writer for myself.   At the time, I assumed he wanted me to handle his suggestions and criticisms in a more positive manner, but now I wonder if it wasn't a foreshadowing for my own literary struggles.  No one in the class is tougher on themselves than I am.  I consider myself one of the top three writers in the class, but that means little because I am not a fan of my most recent work.  I'm not a fan of this blog entry.  I'm rarely a fan of the blog entries.  I usually write daily just for the practice, but recently I haven't stoked the effort as needed, and the result is three weeks of bland discourse, centered around me and the kids I look over at the TIP camps.  Some of it is time, as I must leave at present to attend to on-the-job matters.  But I could come back to this and polish it.  But I won't.    I'm 23, and I feel like I need a hit very soon.

      We too the kids to 9th street this evening to let them walk around and see what was where...Caron, Neeli and I took them back in shifts, with me bringing up the rear.  There was a rainstorm before we came, so the sky was a beautiful mix of blues and greys...perfect blogging weather.  But without a computer, I had no way of imparting my thoughts to the masses.    So, here are my NINTH STREET NOTES! (and explainations...numbers not part of original, added by scribe for clarity)   1)   Man &amp; Woman eating sorbet      *bypass surgery      *quietly eating, but content   The man had a large belly, the woman wore sandals, had frosted hair, and reminded me of my mother.  As I sat and sipped my Americano and read Jean Baudrillard, they came outside and sat on the bench next to me, stayed quiet, and contently munched away on their sorbet.  The man had a large scar on his left leg from his knee to his ankle, indicating some sort of bypass surgery.  My grandfather recently had a bypass, and while my grandmother played it as low-key, the leg and chest scars tell otherwise.  There was an inherent contention among the two...no conversation, just spoonfuls of sorbet.  Beauty.     2)   Blue Note Barista   Yes, the Barista of posts of yore is back, and more beautiful than ever.  Without thinking about her, I walked into Blue Note for an americano, and she was right there.  She smiled, we talked for a bit, and her mind was on the moment, not indisposed in other barista-girl life matters.  I asked her what there was to do in town, and we chatted about French films for a while...I don't know French, and I wonder if I should, because when she used her pretention on me and felt me out for my Catherine Deneueve acumen, I floundered...imagine if I knew French, we'd be making steady love to the soundtrack of  urlLink Indochine .  Anyway, I left with nary a phone number, but a few hidden glances from her and the vigor to make the final push the next time.  I have one day off in the next two weeks.  I'd love to take her out during it.  Do girls dig that?  I've tried the quick city romance before, and always it fails.  I'm not looking for a quick fumble by the fire exit...I'm mostly interested in taking someone out and hearing some stories.  I am pretty harmless.  You are welcome to call my parents and friends as references.  Sure, I'd love to hold hands with hot Blue Note Barista, talk about postmodernism and make out on a rattan couch, but if it's just chat and an awkward hug goodbye, that'll work.  Gotta get 'em on the email list.    There wer emore, but sleep takes over, and they are philosophical rants about art and lap dances from girls who published Holocaust poetry...not your average light writing.  Anyway, Amy tells me to live, so live I must.

      With the dawn of new readers, I feel obliged to state what I discuss on this blog.  1) Personal introspection/the quest to "find myself" 2) Stories about the past/anecdotes (a lot like #1) 3) Non-mainstream media and culture (Leftist politics, independent cinema) 4) Shits.    4 doesn't refer to "and giggles," or just playing grabass on the interweb.  Nope, I am fascinated by feces, for reasons I can only blame human genetics and the total lack of inhibitions of my high school mates for.  I'm not interested in touching it, playing with it, hurling it...it's much more in an abstract, theoretical sense, or from the anecdotal standpoint.    How so?  Well, this afternoon I enjoyed a lunch at West Duke's Armadillo Grill, grabbing two fajita tacos and eating with several of the TIP Leadership staff.  We chatted for about 30 minutes, after which the pot started to rumble.  I got up to leave and use the bathroom near the exit, but it was busy, and this was a dump not for the faint of heart.  So I quickly descended two flights of stairs and found a bathroom nestled away in this large union center.  And I let it go.  but halfway through, two people walked in, and I had to stop mid-sentence and wait for them to finish (maybe I'm poo-shy).  They left, I finished and found my way to the bus.    I don't know why, but it wasn't until I reached the bus stop that I realized how courageously awesome a shit I had just embarked on.  The high school folks and I often talk about the great shits, or the ones you remember fondly...they make your eyes roll into the back of your head, and you lick your lips and pull them under your teeth, shaking your head in an asymmetrical rhythm, and suddenly you're doing the Bill Cosby jello pudding dance.  And there is no part better than the realization...few things are more envigorating than realizing you owe your ass a thank you note.

      Someone mentioned that I am sentimental.  No doubt...I want to say that it's more nostalgic than sentimental...sentimental has a connotation of consumerism and the use of tangible goods, while I think my memory is fueled by itself, and not a blue ribbon or scrapbook...but I love books, and I have ribbons.    Campers here.  Fun.  Pretty social.  I don't forsee many problems.  A few folks who aren't too talkative.  Hopefully it's sleepiness.    Five of them went running tonight.  We had a three minute downpour this afternoon, which caught half the camp outside in the torrent, and brought some much-needed cool air into the East Quad, so tonight was 70 and breezy...too nice a night not to be outside.  I sat and read as they ran, cheering them on every time they passed.  Quite stupid.  But they felt better.  I'll do it tomorrow too.  Everyone needs a cheerleader.

      I still haven't written to the students and staff...not ready yet.    Clare soundtracks her semesters and compiles them in CD format.  It's something I always wanted to do, and something I'm embarassed I never got around to.  I still have my last KSCL playlist...my last show was a dedication to all of my friends, and I gave most of the important people from Centenary a song (Corey McMullin and others were left out just because I couldn't figure out what song)...the plan was to take the show, burn it onto CD, and give a copy to every person I gave a song to, along with an explaination of why I chose every song...the best tribute I could think of.  When I first moved to Austin, I got to work on it via Kazaa and Morpheus, but my exeuberence was easily quelled due to the lack of originality on P2P networks...no one had Briar's  La Bamba .  And now I wonder if it's just too late.  There's a soundtrack to this summer.  Not so much in songs that lyrically tell the story of my conscience...more about the songs I've heard this summer that resonated with me...so yes, Matchbox 20, Avril Lavigne, and only two 80s songs so far (Blondie's ATOMIC and The Commodores' NIGHT SHIFT).  When the tour ends, I'll sell paraphanelia.    It's not flowing.  I'm fighting the words.  I don't know if it's obvious in the reading, but it pains me to write and read over and see the folly and erase and finally just leave something up there because, fuck, I need to write something and it's the best of the lot.  It's not block...the time to reflect is less than plentiful.    I asked Nola a question when I saw her...we were talking about careers and her as a doctor and me as a writer, and I asked her how she categorized me when she mentioned me to others.  She said  A writer, of course.   It was only interesting because Nola had never read any of my work.  Few people at Centenary had.  My Centenary writing career consisted of Fall my Sophomore year, where I took a creative writing class and produced half a dozen quality works, and summer before junior year, when I wrote a short stage play for our Orientation group dealing with the issues of college life.  Every once in a while I'd dick around with an idea, but things never got anywhere.  I wrote  urlLink Clubbing  on a May 2000 afternoon at a Starbucks in the Inwood Shopping Center, finishing the rough draft in 40 mintues and the polish an hour later.  It was okay...worth making, but not really worth seeing.    The writing didn't matter at Centenary, because I had so much more to do.   There will be time to write  I always said,  but when will there be time for this?   So I lived, and got out, and started writing.  And I learned how to be alone, how to value the hours of the day where I could sit down and lose myself in my mind and create fantasy onto a page to such a degree that people would fall in love with my characters, want my characters to be alive, and hurt when they suffered.    I'm back in the Centenary mode right now...fast life, little time for introspection.  The mind is constantly moving, but I don't have the time to let it create.

      I'm not big on posting quotes, but this one keeps popping into mind...   Get busy living or get busy dying. That's goddamn right...I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.   I'm going to see an old mentor come Thursday, Scott Greenwood.  Scott was the old Dean of Students at Centenary, and one of the better role models I have known.  It is because of him that I have this job, though he will say that it is because of me.  I wasn't Scott's favorite student at Centenary, and he wasn't my favorite staff member, but his approach to student issues and collaboration with others is probably the best I know.  I'm very excited to see how he's doing and report how I've done.    Report...how odd.    I am in search of the penultimate coffeehouse barista.  Tonight I spent half an hour at The Blue Note, Durham's independent coffee house.  The barista was pure sexiness...adidas kicking shoes, baggy green hip-hugging pants, tattoo on the small of the back, short hair, large soulful eyes...she smiled, but she was terribly preoccupied the entire night.  I might try again, though my only free night is tomorrow, after which I'm working nights up until July 26.  Maybe she has some afternoon shifts, and while the kids are in class I can get a jaunt over and grab an americano, start conversation about Nietzche, and practice some heavy petting in the stockroom.    Big turn on - sex in the stockroom.  The idea of 16 ounce cups knocked from their utility shelf perch, falling in a dramatic 2 1/2 swan dive tuck and shamlessly adorning the floor in a pollackesque array is nothing short of erotic.  I'm sporting 3/4 chub just thinking about it.    I only gave this URL to one of the students...how quickly he passes this on to the rest of the GDI group is directly proportionate to how effortlessly I lose the respect of the chi'dren.

      I don't want to already say that Leadership will be a worse experience than GDI.  It's been less than two days.  We haven't even really begun training.  And my nostalgia for three of the best weeks of my life (I've had probably two years of great weeks, but the last three go right on in there) is probably helping me forget the problems and issues of the first few days at Wake.  But so far, this has sucked.    There are a lot of factors.  I have no air-conditioning.  Because of that, I was incredibly tired all last night, and got little sleep due to the sound of night life outside my window mixed with the extreme heat in my attic dorm room.  My key card doesn't work...I only got in tonight because I was lucky that the Duke rep in our dorm was making rounds and saw me standing outside trying in vain to get my card to open the door.  The instructional staff doesn't live on-site; that won't be too big a deal when the kids are here (I don't think), but it means that for the past two nights, the residential staff has been on their own...which is fine, except the other two RCs know each other from college, so breaking into that grouping is proving tedious.  One of the current RCs just finished a camp at the Duke Marine Lab, and a staff member from her camp is there...an obnoxious girl with a big ass and bigger mouth, who follows us to meetings and turns every topic of conversation into what happened at Marine Lab... Dustin was so cute when he put his head on Dani's shoulder!  Remember when Seth had the stitches?   Sorry, but I don't give a fuck.    I do my best not to put inside jokes on this site, or really to post them in any public manner that may survive as documentation of a certain era.  When I was writing the cards for the kids and their lunch sacks, I did my best not to include any of the quips and phrases we came to know over the weeks.  This comes from my experience of packing the Rio Nueces apartment six weeks ago, and looking through my high school yearbooks.  I didn't remember some of the people who signed it, and hell if I remembered even half of the inside jokes.  So I was stuck to write something more meaningful than  Have a good summer , but that couldn't involve the element of humor that surfaced at that time, unless the event was so cataclysmic that everyone would remember it.    Things will improve when Marine girl leaves, and tomorrow afternoon when we really get to work.  If I can get a few more fans up in my room, that'll improve this tenfold.  A sexy girl in a tank top and skirt reading cultural non-fiction wouldn't hurt either.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 8 - Durham, NC   Finding Durham was easy...I-40 to I-85, and the signs lead you there.  And from the pictures I've seen, I assumed Duke would be no problem to locate...just off the interstate, maybe nestled a mile away, with a murder's row of fast food and strip mall shopping leading up to the pearly gates of Victorian architecture.  30 minutes into entering Durham, I finally found East Campus, the area I am staying for the next three weeks.    West Campus looks like gothic classrooms meet danish homestyles...very regal and professional.  There is even an area WC that is called Krzyzeskiville.  It all demands academic, athletic, and even social excellence.    East Campus could quite well be where  urlLink Animal House  was filmed.  It's quad is reminiscent to  urlLink SMU's  main drag, where all buildings lead up to the admissions hall...except everything looks as crisp at SMU...the West Campus looks magnificent here, and East Campus looks like frat land.  It didn't help that Duke's TIP short course moved in today, so 500 7th through 10th graders were out in the quad, and RAs much younger than me were wearing hats backwards and talking jive...it also probably didn't help that I just came from an incredibly well-run camp and saw an out-of-control party as my first Duke TIP experience.    However, there are many staff members not connected to the Leadership Institute here, so ethical questions about mingling and other sundries no longer exist.    My room has no air conditioning.  It reminds me of my room off Pomerado Court in San Diego.  We had air conditioning, but the days were so nice that we'd just leave the windows open and let the breeze in.  This is a little hotter than that, but I took a nap when I showed up and remembered how nice a breezy nap could be.  When Justin Kirkes lived with me, he would crank up the AC so he could get all of his covers on him.  I like sleeping in a hotter room so I can just let my skin feel the breeze.  Thus, I am an optomist about no AC in the middle of the summer in the South.  And I'm living on the 3rd floor.    A few people are around and about...I don't know if they're Leadership folks, and they already know each other, so to go up and ask is daunting.  And I also don't really care at the moment.  It's nice to make a good first impression, but it's also nice to have a day to myself, where I can go to Barnes & Noble and do some reading and hang out by myself without feeling obligated to socialize with others.  Socialization commences tomorrow!

      I will miss the fire doors the most.  When you walk into Babcock Hall, you walk into a mythical 19th Century parlor, with paintings of the hall patrons, Mr. & Mrs. Babcock, adorning the side walls, and a grand piano positioned in an alcove towards the rear.  The room is full of windows and parlor chairs, with four chaste lounges for comfortable sitting (and some comfortable couple enjoying, as a few of our campers discovered).  Turing to your left or right are hallways blocked off by fire doors.  On the other side of the fire doors, this antebellum lounge becomes just another dormatory.  Except it was my dormatory; it was my floor.    When my father moved out of his condo at Hidden Meadows in 1995, he looked back and laughed.   Why did you laugh?  Didn't you enjoy living here?  I asked...I saw no reason not to enjoy it, as he lived on a beautiful hill overlooking a beautiful golf course...the place was furnished, and he was far enough away from the hustle of life, yet close enough to join it as he pleased.  He looked at me and gave me a smirk that I now recognize as asshole-time.   You'll know when you grow up .    When I moved out of my apartment in Arlington, I didn't laugh contemptuously.  I didn't smirk.  But in no way did I miss that place.  Nor did I miss the house on Back Bay when I left there in October, settling down at Rio Nueces.  And when I left Rio Nueces, I only missed it because Brian Thomas and I had such a great time there, and I knew I probably wouldn't live with him again.    This is the first room I will miss since my first apartment in Austin, which wasn't a nice apartment in any light...Mauna Kai Condos off 31st and Duval, a shitty block of 40 efficiencies infested with king sized cockroaches and poor room AC units.  But it was my first apartment.  I bought $100 of groceries that first day, preparing for the bohemian life I was dying to live.  I lived it all right...not the one I was expecting, but I lived it.  I was on my own, paying my own rent, fighting for my survival...I didn't enjoy it at the time, but I needed that experience.  And Mauna Kai was the perfect complex to have it in.    And now, as I pack up my laptop and take my stuff out to the car, ready to drive to another camp and have another one of these experiences, I will pass through those fire doors again.  My renaissance birth canal.

      How to do this?  70 minutes or so until we grab a staff dinner at a decent restaurant up the road, after which Noah will drive to Durham...Brian, Ben and I are planning to see I3 because it's part of the series (and I still have a so-called secret crush on Clare Danes), I'm gonna download some pictures from Ben's computer, grab a few meals tomorrow together maybe, and head to Durham.  I'm not as sad about the staff, which is bemusing...maybe because I believe I will work with them again.  TIP is incestual or fraternal, whatever floats your jetsom better...I'm the honorary TIPster for life.    Yesterday we put brown sandwich bags up on the wall...one for each student.  The idea was for people to write annonymous nice comments about the person and your interaction with them over the past two weeks and put it in their bag...a last bit of inspiration before our experience together ends.  This is the kind of stuff I love doing, but I was swamped with cooking and a slide show to do yesterday that I didn't even start my comments until midnight.  I was only able to get 11 written last night, taking 2.5 hours to do that.  I did the same number in 20 minutes this morning...but there were 12 people or so who didn't get comments, not to mention the staff (half of whom left before I got back from the last trip to the airport).  Anyway, I can't think of any better way to define this experience, so here we go with the comments to me   By the way, the slide show was spot-on.  80s music carefully designed to elicit pathos and tears.  12 kids asked for copies.  Two were crying well after it ended.     Comments  (edited for your pleasure...I'll do my best to leave enough high school antics in them to make it authentic, but not too much to bore)   Rolin...you are funny, witty, and intelligent, and incredibly understanding...and like I said, tell me where I can see your movies!  ROLIN!  You taught me that even members of the Risk cliques can grow up to be really, really, really cool...you won't lose any awsomeness 20 years down the road.  I still have that couple in my room   It's an inside joke, but from one of the quieter members of the camp, who broke out of his shell about five days into the experience and today came up to me and said  What am I going to do when I get home?  No one will expect me to talk!   I told him I was going to make a film called  Too Excited About Uday , as he played Uday Hussein in our Mock Trial (you'll recognize him from the earlier picture, with the towel on his head and marker smears on his face...name is Matthew Clayton so he can search himself on Google)   Thank you for being so welcoming, even on the first day.  I (heart) U.  enough said.  you're so fun.  You did a fantastic job as our RA this year.  You made camp really fun.  Thanks for sorting through the trash with me!!   I helped this guy, Sam Ranson (Google search enabled), look through the Wake Forest cafeteria trash for 90 minutes at the beginning of camp so he could find his retainer.  He didn't.  We had the greatest time.   Rolin, dude, you were fuckin awesome.  Never quit this job, you really can change so many lives other than mine   So did I change his, or can I just change others?  =)   Thanks for everything.  You were the best RA a kid could ask for.  You are one of the funniest guys I've met.   If you're going to post in the comment section, don't do it to take issue with her comment.  Just let the irony sit fresh for a few moments.   Thank you for putting a smile on my face.  You are cool and interesting.  You are probably the best driver that I rode with.  ROLIN!!!  I love how you know all of those fun facts.  You're hilarious and always added a fun sense of excitement to everything.  You have so many talents.  Thank you for sharing all of them with us.  You are a great friend, actor, chef, and you are also a wealth of knowledge.  Thanks for being a cool guy and giving us some freedom.  You are definitely the coolest RA I have ever had.  Thanks for being our main source of entertainment (in the movie and tolf sense too).  You were a fun RA.  No basis to judge =)   I'm not trying to stroke eternal ego here...this experience keeps me without words...I want to muse about the past, the future, and where these two weeks will stand over time.  On my way back from the airport, I got the tight throat, where the vocal cords suddenly send out a pulse of pain, and you want to swallow but you just gulp...I used to get tight throat all the time:  when a camp would end, when I would leave a vacation, or when a friend would move away and we exchanged an awkward goodbye.  My last experience with tight throat came the night I left Centenary, when I drove around the city because I couldn't handle sitting in the Canterbury House looking at the walls and already missing the campus just a few feet away.  I moved to Austin, experienced dire poverty, and lost tight throat abilities in any endeavour.  Until today.    One of our couples, James and Lauren, had a tough goodbye this afternoon.  He lives in New York and is Catholic, she in South Carolina and Jewish.  They were one of the cutest groupings I've known, and with watching them grow and foster love, I also got to watch their time-mandated departure.  It was tough, it looked tough, and it played out like a scene from  urlLink Green Card , where Andie McDowell runs after Gerard Depardieu at the end, knowing that there is no more but pain because of inevitable loss.  Tonight will hurt tremendously for both of them.  So will tomorrow.  And one will fall out of love with the other quicker, causing a last moment of sorrow, and most likely quelling the relationship for good.  Or maybe they'll just succumb to time and distance, slowly fading into a corner region of memory that returns every year around this time, or at the drop of a specific Don Henely song.  But they'd rather feel this pain right now than feel nothing because there was no good to lose.    Last night we all got up and shared something with the group before we signed a document regarding our two weeks here, the projects we worked on, and what we hoped we accomplished.  I was haraunged into talking a little early, and didn't have my mind set on what to say, so I flew through a pretty low-key statement that I regret.  There was so much more to say.  So I say it  urlLink here .  Anyway, some people said some wonderful things, the staff were quite insightful, and these last few notes from my bag are the most telling, for a myriad of reasons.     Not only are you incredibly talented with films, etc., but you are so kind, intelligent, and funny.  Your being here added so much to the mood.  You helped me have fun.  I will never forget playing Monopoly with you (and how you gave all our money away!), your singing and dancing, the wonderful bedtime story (Haha!  I will tell that one to my kids).  You will be so successful.  I am truly going to miss you.  Score it as a "B" in the future.  You're my favorite.    Stay nice.   At 23, I am experiencing the best summer of my life.

      I had two choices...be introspective and get shit done for tomorrow's final day, or be introspective and write on the blog.  The shit for tomorrow is done.  I apologize.  I had so many great things to say...as I watched the fireworks from Ernie Shore Field after watching the first live no-hitter of my life, I knew it was going to be a damn good night of blogging.  And I played games with the kids, read them a story (an impromptu bit about Mary and her lamb that she turns into lunch meat after Old Man McGregor tries to sodomize it), and had a staff meeting...but work called, and the gusto was quelled through the mindless pasting of construction paper, taping of bags to walls, and rearranging of furniture.  Everyone's been in bed for hours.  They'll appriciate this in the morning.  I will appriciate bed.

      In the mug - Ethopia Yergacheffe On the stereo - Bruce Hornsby's  Old Valley Road  Errands - Get suit pressed, return several B&N purchases, flirt with hot B&N business-type, buy lunch sacks  I'm finally starting to use Friendster a bit.  I still don't really understand the point, though.  I guess it's because the majority of my friends outside of the UT circle still think of Gopher when they dial up to check email.    The kids are writing legal briefs and policy papers to send to congressmen and UN ambassadors.  Some are pretty good...the writing is better than most entry-level college stuff, though passive voice is a favorite of folks that young.  I am probably more upset with my teachers in high school for letting me get away with passive voice more than anything else, including the dastardly B I got in Finite Math from Mrs. Waits because I chose to play on the Calculus team for the school's Math Bowl...I'm gonna go with a winner any time.

      Walking back to my room after 90 minuts worth of staff meetings, 60 minutes of which occured after lights out, I told Ben that I will miss this drama.  "If this was all I the drama I dealt with, life would be so easy."  Of course that is a lie...this is perfect because I can recharge my battery for it over the school year.  I haven't talked to my mom or my grandparents or friends that have called really since I got here.  I knew that is how it would be...it's not that I don't care, it's just that my time on the job coencides with their time off work, and when I get off work, I want to sleep, not make phone calls.  I look like an ass to them all, and I don't like that.    David got my files back!  So now I sit with my Barnes & Noble impulse buys, feeling good but realizing how much money I dropped.  The girl at Barnes & Noble was quite attractive...jet black cropped hair, nose ring, pink tank top with chinese zodiac symbol...but she was an all business worker.  I dropped $25 on a Readers Advantage card because she mentioned that it would make my prices cheaper, but what it did was add $15 to my total price.  So if I drop $150 more at B&N (possible), I'll make back the money.  She told me why it was, and had very short conversation with me, and I think she was a bit interested in a slightly more than pedestrian way (and if you can get a hot girl who works in service to show interest in you, it's quite the accomplishment).  But her demeanor was all professional...she was interested in making Barnes & Noble money.  That's cool, but not attractive to me.  Be kind of flimsy, be a rebel a bit...but then you're giving up power, and when you have to fight to be considered for more than your body, any loss of power will require great lengths to get it back.    Maybe I'll see her when I return the books tomorrow.  I'm taking two back...I bought them with that Amazon gift certificate that never got used because Amazon duped me.  They came in handy here, where I was able to save $35 by buying through them rather than Barnes & Noble.  They'll be sent to Duke, where I start on Monday.  I won't have the other three finished by then.    Wow, I will really miss these kids come Saturday.  I never had a little brother or sister.  I see Daniel Young interact so well with his sister Laura and brother David, and try to be a good influence on them, and I just wish I had someone I could do that with, show the ropes to and try to help out of sticky situations like my sister did with me towards the end of our high school careers.  I've got 35 right now, most of whom I have a good or great rapport with.  And Chris had it right, we won't know each other again come Saturday.  Sure, I'll see one or two maybe...maybe one will end up at another TIP camp (this will become a regular summer thing for me, no doubt), maybe someone will need a recommendation letter, and there will be awkward emails and IMs and the like, but this is it for living a life like this, where we know each other as well as we do.  I had some great camps in my days...this will end up in that same capacity.

      Books bought today:     urlLink Culture of Fear  by Barry Glasner  urlLink America  by Jean Baudrillard  urlLink Selected Readings  by Jean Baudrillard  urlLink Impossible Exchange  by Jean Baudrillard  urlLink The Post-Colonial Studies Reader   Why all these books? (of which I will return several, I am sure)  Well, my computer decided to delete everything in my My Documents section.  That means, everything I have written in the past two years is gone.  Every paper, every note to myself, every bit of official documentation, every screenplay...all gone.  I have some backed up, and some of the important stuff printed out, but everything else is blamo gone.  And I am fucking pissed.  The books will help soothe the wound.    I would like to express my sympathies for Mrs. Kolman today, as her husband passed away last night.  Mrs. Kolman was the most important teacher I had in high school, and I can't even begin to thank her for the impact she had on my life and lessons she taught me that help establish who I am today.  It's trite, and that's too bad, because it shouldn't be.

      Spending this Labor Day Weekend&copy; in Houston for the Padres/Astros series...Padres took two of three games, and luckily both of the games I went to.  Didn't catch any home runs, though I was within five rows of one ball on Friday.  Caught a lot of flak for wearing my Tony Gwynn replica jersey T-shirt on Friday, but also found a girl smelling failtly of hallucinogens who wanted to buy the shirt off my back.  She had big hoop earrings and a large ass.  It would be hers had she a Brad Ausmus bobblehead doll.    For those unaware of Brad Ausmus, he is the catcher for the Houston Astros.  Catcher is an interesting position in the game of Baseball...it's probably the toughest position on the body, as it requires you to squat behind a plate for nine innings, get hit by foul balls, foul tips, errant baseball swings, and catch 90+ mph balls in a mitt with not near enough padding.  But it's also the last stronghold of the Good Ol' Boys Club of MLB.  Catchers signal pitches to the pitcher.  If we give the pitcher less credit than he deserves (often the case), then we credit the catcher for  calling a good game  and  providing calm and confidence  to the thrower on the mound.  Because of this, many in the world of baseball don't expect much hitting or run producing from the catcher's spot in the lineup.  And this is why Brad Ausmus still has a job...this, and every once in a while he'll hit three home runs in a game, throw out a few runners, and get traded to Detroit only so he can be traded back to Houston by year's end.    It was Brad Ausmus Bobblehead Doll Night on Friday, where the first 20,000 kids 14 and under received a free doll.  There were only 26,000 people total at the game, but because of my cheering on the visiting team and other sundries, I received not a doll.  I wanted a doll not just because it was a giveaway, but because Brad Ausmus is kind of a cult idol.  He started his career as a Padre, and then brought us Chirs Gomez and John Flaherty in a trade, and Gomez became one of my favorite Padres after that.  Ausmus had a few good hitting years, and now plays a good defense with no offense catcher for Houston, who will not re-sign him in the offseason.  It looks like the Padres will, and that is not a good thing, because if you need a catcher and there are better catchers available, there's no need to pick up Ausmus just because he looks calm, reads books, and has "intangibles."  Intangibles are the stuff of legend.  If you can't explain why someone in baseball does something well, it's because he has intangibles.  Brian Hunter might not be able to hit a baseball out of the infield, but he keeps a job in the game because he brings intangibles.  What are intangibles?  I can't say, because they are intangible...if he hit well, if he threw out baserunners well, if he was quick of foot, we would say that he was a good hitter, a good defender, or a fast player.  But he's none of those...yet he still gets paid a lot to play a game that, at face value, he is no good at.  Thus we face a conundrum, and while you beat your face into the nearest cement pillar trying to reason why Brad Ausmus is squatting behind the plate for $2.5 million a year and Ivan Rodriguez, who hits quite well, is bringing his style of play to the Baltimore Orioles.    Back to Austin tomorrow, and real work begins.  Screenplay looks good, meeting up with a few old friends and a few new ones as well.  Saw a pretty good film called The Housekeeper yesterday...French bit about a 50 year old who ends up with a 20 year old through circumstance, and how that relationship develops...doesn't glamourize or unnecessiarly dramatize, but just gives a description.  Several friends of mine should watch.

      There is so much prime sexiness at UT, so many hardbodied twentysomethings, walking around, aware of their physical irresistability, flaunting it in whatever way they choose but flaunting it nevertheless.    I go after the alternative girls.  Not alternative in the Everclear/Good Charlotte sense, but alternative in the  I don't buy what I'm given, and while I might not wear the clothes to put me in a clique, I belong in the clique moreso than most everyone else .  It's attitude...it shows up immediately.  People see confidence.  I got looks today that I didn't get last year or the year before, and it's all because I'm feeling a lot better about who I am today than I was when I first came to Austin.    I like horn-rimmed glasses, hair down to the shoulders, satchels, and smiles.  A thirty year old was in Alternative Poetics...she's a playwright in the Michner program, putting on a stage play in Minnesota this year, so she won't stay in Alt. Poet, but she's taking Foshko's screenwriting section, and we talked a bit about how Bob could quite possibly be the greatest character in the history of education.  She had a little too much of the name-dropping, talking about how great I am persona, but the glasses and satchel were enough for me to ignore the poor sides of the personality and imagine lying in her bed, looking up at the kelly green ceiling, listening to Modeski, Martin, & Wood, and speaking in prosaic vernacular, knowing I'll show up in a stage play somewhere, and she in a screenplay.    And then the girl on the IF bus...everyone on the IF bus was in the most sour of moods...it was like riding in the elevator to purgatory, where we were obligated to stare ahead and not say anything.  She kept looking at my shoes when I'd look at her, and keep her eyes on my shoes until I turned away, at which point she'd look back at me.  I probably should have followed her off the bus, asked her if things were okay, and started a conversation, because she was cool but really sullen.  But I didn't.  Maybe it was the wispy leg hair.  I'd love to be cool with it, but I've yet to be in a position of dealing with it.    Hit  urlLink Mondays in the Sun  yesterday...very good, and a very interesting look into filmmaking outside of the dominant paradigm.  Much like Chekov's  urlLink The Cherry Orchard , this film revolves in nothingness...it defines characters and moves them, but not too radically, because that wouldn't be real.  We want them to win and succeed, but they can't because they can't.  Their victories are small, and we've got to take heed in that.  A good start for my film about the guy who wants to be an artist but isn't any good.

      Last night, an early bedtime.  A bit of depression as well.  There's a constant fight to gague what I'm doing in relation to how the world runs, and the more I see that I'm making a significantly pathetic difference in the scheme of things.  The most productive thing I have done for society in over a month is give a homeless man $2 to buy some breakfast.    There's an inherent pressure in the screenwriting program to produce scripts, to produce saleable scripts, and to produce four of them by the time we leave here.  I currently own two completed feature-length scripts, as well as several shorts and the beginnings of at least nine features.  I am willing to let people see one of the shorts.  One of the features is good, but it is currently in the shop getting fixed, and I'm only back to page 7 on it.    So I sit in a Starbucks, finished with my box of organic chocolate milk, sipping on a water, ready to go to Bed Bath and Beyond to look for shelving and desks, and trying to figure out how to solve the world.  It's no more specific than that...the world is broken, and I want to fix it.  The fear is that I might not.    But what is exciting is that, no matter how much I try to bring myself to say it, I can't say that  I won't fix the world .  Because I don't believe that.  I think I can.    At Showdown a few nights ago, Maggie and I talked about the post-college existence, and she off-handedly mentioned that she is finished trying to save the world, and now she's just going to try to do her thing as best she can.  Which is fair.  It's what we all do.  We go through high school graduation...the valedictorian gives a nervous speech with words like  asinine  and  conjecture , finishes it with a bit about saving the world, and then we take pictures with girls whose bodies we used as science experiments before starting off on  The Real World &copy;.    Angela Potochnik, in her 1998 valedictorian speech at Rogers High School, said something that sticks with me today:   Every year, graduates stand on this platform and profess their want to save the world.  But none have.  Let's be the ones to do it.     I sat in the bleachers, listening, dressed better than most of the people I came with.  And as the band kicked back into Pomp and Circumstance, as Dan Wearsch shunned me and Jerromy and the Daniel's for his high school friends, and as random graduates who I knew in 1997 but didn't recognize in 1998 came up to me with Kodak Fun Savers and suddenly had arms around me and lips on my cheek, I looked for Angela.  I wanted to ask her why she never gave me a chance to save the world.  I'd only had one year.    I've had six and a half now.  And I'm still working on it.

      People say that  urlLink Full Metal Jacket  should have been two films, or just one short incorporating the gunnery sergeant and Pvt. Pyle.  I think it loses much of its psychological strength in that instance.  We never forget Act I of the film while watching Act II...and the gruesome nature of Act II is just commonplace.  Kubrick shows us what he wants to show us, and he wants us to see Act II, but gives us Act I so we are distanced from the situation, as the soldiers there are.  This isn't  urlLink Apocalypse Now , where mental resolve is questioned for all characters, or  urlLink Platoon , where the operations of war are in doubt.  Kubrick is playing a psychological game with his audience, and it works.  Nowhere have I read a review that gives the second half of the film as much love as the first...most say that the second half is superfluous.  If this were two movies, Kubrick would show them as two seperate movies.  They're not.  Without Act II, the first half could be considered cliche...we need an hour of violence and other seemingly commonplace war instance to buffer the first half, and show us what it would be like were we fighting in Vietnam.  Were we fighting, we'd look at it objectively and almost boringly.  You'd have to after living through becoming a Marine.    The last bit of media to make me think this much was the video to Johnny Cash's rendition of  Hurt .  Before that, it was  urlLink Memento .   Vincent D'Onofrio's cries still haunt me.  I lost sleep over it last night.  I will probably lose more.

      Dead battery.  That and an oil change cost $121.75.  But I get a warranty on the battery.  Five years.  The last battery lasted a little over two years.   Man, those little guys just die, don't they?  said Jeff, the sales associate at First Texas Honda I spoke with today, as if the knowledge that Honda put shit in their cars would make me feel better about the fork-out.    Class in 45 minutes.  Yet to feel like school is back in swing.  Hopefully that will change.  Inspiration wanted.

      My Padres just picked up stud outfielder Brian Giles.  Incredible.    Crazy day of equilibrium.  First, the old cell phone is being phased into retirement.  I stood in the Sprint PCS store in the Arboretum, quietly pondering my options.  In my left hand, Old Faithful...a dilapadated black Samsung phone with flip mouthpiece, saying Holla Moe to me, set off by beautiful indiglo background.  In my right hand, the Qualcomm CDM9155SP, a run-of-the-mill phone...no flip top, nothing special except a few funny rings that I never plan to use.  The new phone was $20, much cheaper than anything they displayed on the floor.  Admana, the sales representative assisting me, told me it was a special markdown from $100...I would believe that were it not for Luisa yesterday telling me it was the cheap phone they gave to schmucks who didn't want to pay big money.  I'm a schmuck.  And I saved $80 by being one.    I'll grow to love this phone though.  I can't hold my attachment to uniqueness against it...it was what I needed at the time.  We'll have adventures.    Years ago, Corey McMullin gave me some sort of rubber toy that looked of Pokemon.  I put it in my backpack and never thought of it again, except on the odd occasion where I could not find a pencil and dumped the contents out, finding this small purple dragon looking up at me, a demented smile on its face.  I figured I should throw it away...I wasn't using it.  But somehow, I was attached.  In April, sitting with Brian Thomas in Texadelphia, I decided it was time to give the little guy a new life of its own.  I put him on top of a napkin bearing the inscription WANTED:  A NEW ADVENTURE.  HAVE SEEN NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, MIAMI, SAN DIEGO, CHICAGO, MONTREAL, AND NASSAU.  WHERE WILL YOU TAKE ME?  I hope he writes.    Car is being stupid.  Something loose with the connection to the battery.  At least I hope...fix-it guru Daniel Harr gave me instructions on how to fix it, but I was unable, somewhat out of idiocy, though I tried several things he mentioned.  We'll get it jumped and see what the dealership says tomorrow.    Full Metal Jacket tonight while eating not the greatest catfish stir-fry (without a car, tough to get to market to buy rice).  Nearly cried for the first time in a movie when they beat Vincent D'Onofrio with the soap.  Holy Fucking Shit.  And I expect to make films like that?  I really wonder how someone can be satisfied with writing mindless shit after watching movies like that.

      I am Charlie Chatterbox today.     NOTE:  I don't believe that phrases like  Charlie Chatterbox  are cliche in any way...I just think they're stupid.  But people use them like they're commonplace in vernacular, as if they are cool enough to be cliche.  I remember reading an article by Tom Krasovic, the Padres beat writer for the  urlLink San Diego Union-Tribune  where he talked about Tony Gwynn hitting first in the order, and called Tony  Larry Lead-off .  Tony was one of the 75 greatest baseball players of all time, and probably one of the five greatest pure hitters...and he gets lumped in with Larry Lead-off?     Michner brunch in the morning.  The MFAs meet with the MAs from each section (Fiction, Poetry, Playwriting, Screenwriting) and hobnob, drinking coffee and pulpy orange juice.  I wanted to go...I want to meet these people I didn't meet last year but who share my passion and drive for success in the written world of the arts.  But these things are always the same...people clique off, writers from departments stay in their respective department circle, and no one meets anyone because all of the groups look so daunting, full of tall thirtysomethings wearing horn-rimmed glasses and laughing about Picasso or Isabelle Allende.    So I went out and found the stragglers, the folks without homes.  It's the most fun you can have at a party, because you don't get yourself roped in with a social circle and start talking in elitist tones.  Met a few cool folks, most from New York and the East coast area.  I'm still fascinated by everything East of the Mississippi, mostly because I've spent an extreme majority of my life surrounded by people who live out West.  And it is out West, to the Easters.    Even in the elevator today, I was talking to a sexy girl in a black cropped shirt and tight jeans, who seemed to just be riding the elevator for her own whims and fancy.  While my success in pick-ups of any fashion has been atrocious in recent memory, if I could find a way to go out with a girl who I met in the elevator, any curse I might see upon myself at this juncture would undoubtabdly be lifted.  Of course, I need to see her in the elevator one more time.    Last night was a night for the blog.  Needing internet at the house.  Honestly missed The Ex for the first time.  And the Padres got shelled.

      New bank account, University Federal Credit Union.  Kiss my ass, Wells Fargo.  Matt helped me open the account...a 30-minute excursion at his contemporary desk, no personal affects of any sort.  I wonder if he constantly wishes he was back in school, as the throng of UT hardbodies walk through there, wearing tight shirts, showing off their blooming bosoms, and believing that college requires fucking on frat boy terms.    The bank won't release my personal effects, unless required by law.  That is supposed to be comforting.    No new cell phone yet.  When I bought the old buddy, it cost $50...about $30 cheaper than the new phones.  I figured I could find refurbished again.  No such luck.  Sprint will take $20 off the price of a phone.  I can buy a new phone at $80, after my rebate.  I am so cheap.  I'm going to shop around at other Sprint stores just to see if I can find a chink in the armor.    30 minute haircut.  A blonde from Beaumont washed my hair.  New to Austin, loving it, and fitting in at the alternative hairstylists I visited.  I got a half inch taken off the long stuff.  Almost seems a waste, but it's now a controlled shaggy, and what must be an embarassing tanline is almost completely hidden since it stayed so long.  That's what poker'll get you.    Won $19 again.  Yeah, I don't have it today.  The blog hits me when I'm about to go to bed at 5 after standing around waiting to drive Brian's drunk friends home and teling Brian to get them in the car but then Brian opens himself another beer.  At 4:30 in the afternoon with a mind focused on catfish stir-fry and getting more errands done before writing and/or EverQuest tonight, the blog just suffers.  I write about my day.  That's great, but who really cares?

      Few words look as wonderful as they sound...one of those words is  pathetic .  So much fun to write.  I used to be a fan of the phrase  I hate my life  when something superfluous went wrong and I really didn't care but people expected me to...I doubt I'll change to  I am pathetic , but said events could transpire.    TA meeting with Richard Lewis this morning.  Walking in, seeing that the professor I now work for is UT's closest look-alike to Tim Robbins, and noticing the camraderie between Lewis and two of his TAs, as well as their banter regarding the LA scene, scripts, writers who visit UT...I see that I am a nobody in the screenwriting world.  No one.  Not even a small tadger in the Austin stream.  I haven't bothered to make a name.  I haven't befriended a faculty member like I used to at Centenary.  I haven't prostituted myself or my work in order to get name recognition and nods at parties where the girls are hot and everyone is talking about David Lynch because  his films are so fucked up .    I don't know what my efforts are.  I want to write screenplays, but I don't want to live the convoluted life of a Hollywood type, making gossip about Ben and J-Lo, wondering who Nicole Kidman is going to settle down with, and tying those references back to hip lingo in the writer's circuit.  I've done crowds before...a degree in English assures you entry into a crowd of pretentiousness.  I'm tired of the pretentiousness, the postmodern crowd, where any Roland Barthes name-drop turns a few heads of folks who don't understand modern postmodernist theory or cultural studies at all, but saw  urlLink Empire of Signs  on an ex's bedside table during a night of dull fucking, and said ex used to wear black and talk about feelings, so Barthes must be worth something, even though a strong tenent of Barthes' message is about worthlessness of said situations and images.  But if you talk about Barthes while drinking a 40 of Mickey's, we're as cool as cool can be.  I want to write.  I want to find a community of people who make art, and are good at it.  I want to make films with these people.  I want these films to be accessable to a broad spectrum of folks.  I want to submerge my body in a warm ocean.

      Took a dirty trip to Corpus with Daniel Harr...got in a truck, drove four hours, sat in a truck as he delivered a concrete pump and showed the boys how to use it, and by that time it was time to turn around and come back.  Absolutely wonderful time, though the inability to get in the water will only stir my desire for gulf ocean, to be sated the last weekend of August in Freeport.    Not much to say...how do you condense 11 hours of car chat into a blog?  Memories, EverQuest, relationships, work, friends, sex.  I pitched a few scripts.  If Daniel Harr were an agent, I'd be writing this whilst lounging completely naked in a pig pit of $5's.

      My mother is getting upset.  This happens often when she thinks about the current George Bush administration.     You would think that a president who wasn't elected by the majority of the people, whose candidacy helped divide the country, would make an effort to reach out to everyone, try to push away partisan politics, and make an effort to befriend and help those outside of his party  she says, pacing her apartment floor, rum and coke in hand.  In the kitchen, two pork chops sizzle in a cast-iron skillet.  My mom is most animated while in the kitchen.    I never thought it, I said.  Why would a man who was a centrist on economic issues, and a staunch conservative on the religious social issues, ever push his platform to the left?  Bush got elected, and he has four years to do whatever he wants.  By aligning himself with the likes of Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and John Ashcroft, as well as social issues like the faith-based initiatives, I don't see how anyone could reasonably expect a rational, understanding presidency from Junior Bush.    My mom grimaces.  She's an idealist, one of those who believes that the United States has always pursued truth and justice, that America is not just a country, but a motto.  She ponders.  Her son walks in her shoes...she was the only liberal in her family.  Now he is the only one...yes, she is still liberal, but times have changed, there are kids to take care of, and the idealism of making the world a better place has to suffer so she can provide for herself and her kids.  A ruined marraige and subsequent debt and poverty took the fight from her long ago.     I was impressed with him once,  she said.   September 11.  He brought the country back together.   I take issue with this anytime someone says it, but rarely do I speak out.  September 11 is the touchiest of touchy situations.  I understand that.  I lost no one in it.  I get the goosebumps, the shortness of breath when I see it on the TV.  But I don't wonder why people would do such a thing, or how they would do it.  I am sad that they did, but it is not shocking.     What did he do, mom?   I ask.    She doesn't know.   He was there for us.   And another president wouldn't have been?  I press the issue.  Many people I know believe that Al Gore would have wet himself and fall into the fetal position at the first sign of terrorist attack.  There is no evidence to prove this.  Just as there is no evidence to say that George Bush did the best job out of anyone in the world...or for that matter, the worst.  George Bush was in a tough situation.  And he did what a President does.  He gave a speech.  A pretty cheesy one too.  Yes, I listened.  I wanted to hear his reaction.  But I didn't need him to talk so I could go on with my life.  I don't think many people did.  Yes, they'll say otherwise.  But that's because they're supposed to.  We all are.  We're Americans.  We're supposed to rally around Old Glory when we're told.  And Bush was telling us.  Yet somehow, I was rallying already.  Within hours of the event, I had downloaded Lee Greenwood's PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN off Kazaa.  I wanted to hear it.  Corny, yes.  Maybe even premeditated by the media...I won't pretend to house original thoughts.  But George Bush didn't tell me to do it.  I didn't need him to.  He made his speech.  Good for him.    And now the media and my mother say he's riding a wave of terror, housing a shoot first and ask questions later foreign policy, making enemies of countries not worth making enemies out of, and just generally fucking the Middle East in the ass.  And it doesn't look like he is ready to stop.  There was an attack against us.  We would like to believe that was the original action, not a reaction to something we did.  So we retaliate with more force.  And then they retaliate back.  So now we bring in even more force.  Because force works.  We can see that, because when we used it before, we fixed Afghanistan.    I want to stop the fighting, sit down with these folks, and see what's wrong.  And I want to fix it.  Bush won't, because he's fellating big business, and big business needs to dominate the Middle East, as this war is about nothing but Globalism...not to the average American, because we live in a bubble, and our society is the Global society, but it's ours too, so we don't realize it...we just take American culture as that, and don't see the corporate influences upon other nations.  There are other nations out there?    Fixing the situation.  You slowly stop the violence.  You sit with the antagonists.  You figure out what they're mad about.  And both of you work at a way to fix it.  They're not all extremists.  The extremists won't get any love if we're not fighting against them...if they're not in a fight, they can't be the underdog.  They're just bullies if the fighting stops.  Terrorists need local support to function.  And the more shit we stir in Afghanistan and Iraq, the more love they'll get from the people of that area.  And my mom will just get more flustered.     He's a boob  she says, as a picture of our 43rd graces the television.  She has no evidence to support this.  She is correct.

      I never answered re: my coming of age stuffs.  BOOK -  urlLink Less Than Zero  MUSIC -  urlLink Sunny Day Real Estate - Diary , but  urlLink Radiohead - OK Computer  hit at a right time, too.   MOVIE -  urlLink Fame   So I just messaged someone on Friendster.  Let the hypocrisy crash around me.  Went surfing for blogs, found her site, just pictures, all clean (not always the Friendster case).  Nose ring.  I've listened to too much Benny Mardones tonight.

      Last night, I won $19.  It was Texas Hold 'em, the wonderful alternative to straight-draw poker, and the game played by the likes of John Moneymaker and Phil Ivey, as well as the Travel Channel's favorite celebrity,  urlLink David the Devil Fish Ulliot .  It was with Brian and a few folks from his work, and we put away a sizeable load of hours and High Life.    Brian bought me in because I had no cash, and no money to speak of.  I was down to $33 in the bank account, a paltry account, and while it's liveable (either my greatest moment or most lowly stratus was making $7 stretch four days back in August 2001), it allows no true wiggle room.  Brian threw in $10 for me, a great act of kindness from a guy who sells pies and poor quality pot roast for a living.  And with every intention of paying him back on a later date, I played like it wasn't my money, because if I played like it was, I would have lost immediately.  I won some sizeable hands, got Brian's $10 back to him, and ended up with nearly $40 after paying Brian back at one time.  But it was late, I had $19 of it in my pocket that I wasn't going to touch, and there were just three of us left.  I was playing with a pair of 9s, and the show cards only offered a king pair higher...there was a pair of 2s on the pitch that I wasn't worried about.  Brian had been betting high all hand, and I knew he didn't have the kings...it was my money.  We got the pot near $45, $19 of it mine.  Turns out Brian was holding a little deuce on his own, and the river card bought him the pot.   Three weeks ago, Daniel Young and I talked about how socioeconomic status is a strong determinant of where you get in life.  Or, to better set the scene, I talked about it, and Daniel disagreed.  It started with race, and why prisons held a majority of african americans when in the US, african americans make up maybe 16% of citizens.  Since race is not genetic, I tried to take him on a metaphorical search for the root of the problem (which I believe lives in US infrastructure, our cultural hegemony).  We didn't make it too far...Daniel discussed motivation, and how he notices the lack of motivation to do better among the african american workers at the hospital he does his interning at.  I was willing to go where he wanted to go, as the topic holds great importance in my mind, and if I can maybe get him to see another perspective on an issue, maybe he can take his longing for helping others and put it in a social context.    Not in this conversation, though.  I went with the lack of opportunities approach, saying that the money we had when we were younger enabled us to see the opportunities of a free market economy, the opportunities of a social dress show, and the opportunities of living in general.  We did extracurricular activities, played musical instruments, and did well in school because a premium was put on our success.  While we are the ones who are pursuing it now, and our motivation is a reason we are where we are, I made the argument that it is not  the  reason he's in med school and I'm in grad school, and we're both on our ways to trying to make our dreams come true.  He countered with motivation again, saying he got where he is because he worked for it, and his family might have money, but they never bought success for him, and they didn't flaunt wealth in any way.  And it's a good argument; when I was a kid, in no way did I think my parents were doing anything for me...I was my own boss, and I was successful because of me.  And that's the memory I have.    But I see it differently now.  I've been poor.  Not poor in the college student sense of the word, where I bemoan my monetary situation, meaning I can't go out to eat because then I can't buy the CD I've wanted for a week.  In August 2001, I had $7 to my name, four days until payday, and three eggs in the fridge.  I hadn't spent the money extravagently...extravagent spending stopped April 2001, when I somehow came to the cold realization that I wasn't going to have free rent and free food anymore when I left Centenary...I was going to have to leave Centenary, and the cash I was dropping taking people out might benefit me when I move out on my own, as Austin isn't ready just yet to take me for a free dinner.  But bills were bills, and bills were unforgiving.  I realized that people charge you for electricity and water, not to mention waste management.  Trying to save by typical convention netted small virtues; even grocery food was expensive if you wanted to turn a chicken breast into a meal.  The entertainment budget of undergrad, which was near 90% of my budget in its Shreveport heyday, hadn't existed since my Texas sojurn began.    Today, when I started my morning, I didn't realize I would get my windfall of cash on Wednesday.  So I was preparing crisis mode, and figuring out how the $33 in the bank, mixed with the $19 I had in pocket, could get me to the 25th, my payday from Duke.  And I remembered how crisis mode was back in 2001, where my days off from work consisted of waking up, eating some sort of noodles, walking to school, grabbing a paper, sitting and reading the paper and doing the crossword, heading to the PCL to check email and see the fat Sonny Bono security guard (one of my favorite Austin landmarks), playing grabass there, walking around a bit, heading to the apartment, and either 1) If the Padres were on, streaming the Padres game on the computer and trying to write screenplays, or 2) going to Borders and reading.    The one thing about crisis mode that's worth pondering is the amount of time I had to write.  With no money, there was nothing but writing to be done...it was a productive use of my time, and it was what I wanted to be doing, so without gadgety destractions, I figured I would make mad progress on my works.  But I didn't write a thing...or a  good  thing.  Because I was worried.  Worried about where I'd eat next.  Worried if a tire blew on the car, or something went wrong and I got towed accidentally, or if the gas in my car wasn't enough to get me to and from work for the next four days.  Time was not a problem, but mentally I couldn't get past the knowledge that if one small thing went wrong (and up to that point, everything had gone wrong in Austin), I was totally fucked.    But I was never totally fucked.  I've got rich grandparents.  They are bastards about money, always offering me money if I need it, but any time I take them up on the offer I get lectured about balancing a budget, and taking care of my finances, and learning how to live as a responsible adult.  And it's a fair argument, because I do spend needless money.  I have my vices.  I write best when I'm out at a coffee shop or a bookstore, and that usually costs $3 or so.  A month of those is near $100, and that's saying I never buy a bagel there.  I love Panda Express' greased-up orange chicken.  I eat it when I should eat in.  I buy a ton of books.  I play EverQuest.  I have this website.  Nothing too extravagant, but unnecessary.    And here's where the upbringing comes back into play.  First, I had the support all throughout my childhood, told I could do whatever I wanted.  I wanted to be an actor, and everyone supported me.  Then I wanted to be a writer, and everyone said acting sucked, and I was going to be the best writer I could.  My family bought me whatever I needed when I said I needed it...they wouldn't buy me a computer, but I'd get books on writing, or writing software, tablets of paper, and boxes of pens with cushy grips.  And when I came to Palm Springs, the grandparents gave me a show!  We'd put on our long pants, gaet in the Lexus, drive slowly down Palm Canyon, windows down, glasses on, throwing the turn signal at the perfect moment to make that pop crisp sound as you start the wheel left.  We'd dine at a restaurant on the drag, a bistro with well-groomed waiters and busboys, immaculate water refills, and menus that didn't list coin.  Afterwards, they'd insist on cake and ice cream, and maybe a movie, or a trinket from the street fair.  Anything to help me relax.  I'm not writing to blame my grandparents for my inability to make an $18,000/year budget comfortable living.  Before I got out of college, I prepared a budget, looking at the expenses I expected in Austin.  I took that, mixed it with a comfortable entertainment and food budget, and found that I could save $2500 a year if I made $12/hr, or roughly $24,000/yr (pre-taxes).  Not much, I don't think.  Hell, $30,000/year seems scandalous.  But I've never come close to that original budget, only approaching it now that it's half loan money and half my TA job.  I live on $18,000 fine.  I've lived on less.  And I've lived comfortably enough to not worry about whether I can afford beer after catching a film.  But I haven't found a way to live where the lifestyle keeps my mind alive, but also saves money.  I write well not when I'm relaxed, which usually comes when I'm busy, but must come when I'm not worried.  My writing in Palm Springs was shit this summer, mostly owing to the pressure of the family to hide my dad's alcoholism, and to see me, the fallow child, succeed in his graduate endeavors.  Every time I'd plug the trusty laptop in and fire up Final Draft, Gran V. would enter with a Coke and her paper.   Don't mind me,  she said,  I'm just going to finish the paper.   We sat.  I typed a bit.  Within two minutes, she would always find an article she thought was interesting, and she'd talk about it, and I wasn't going to be rude, because I was there to visit her, so I'd talk too, and ten minutes would pass and she'd apologize for keeping me from writing, and then quickly ask how it was going, and say how proud she was, and how she wanted to look at something, and then she'd mention my dad for some reason, and the moment was gone, the laptop closed, and I'd head to the bathroom to sit and look at the writer they were talking about.

      Benny's  urlLink film is showing and band is playing  at the  urlLink Stop, Look, &amp; Listen Festival  in New York City on October 30, a Wednesday.  Do I go?  Do I try to get ahold of a copy before?  Do I really need to go see Benny?    Horns &amp; Halos isn't playing in Dallas anymore...I guess two weeks was more than enough.  Shit.  However,  urlLink Soft Skull Press , publishers of  urlLink Fortunate Son  (the infamous George W. bio), might be interested in publishing some of my prose.  I haven't asked them yet, but they seem like pleasant chaps.  Who knows...I need publishings though!

      Looking for the positivies during my 72 hour monetary siege, I remember that poor people with technological access can enable proficiency through study-related endeavors.  Usually when I've got cash, I use the internet for porn and Padres box scores...I don't know if money fuels my need for baseball and felching, but the daily schedule during financial stability is straightforward:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOPE I DIDN'T PEE THE BED:  Wake up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERNET:  Email,  urlLink Union-Tribune ,  urlLink ESPN ,  urlLink Padres Message Board , my blog comments, blogs I link to, porno &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MISCELLANEY:  Writing, food, or Days of our Lives &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMODITIES:  figuring out random ways to spend my money  Life after the internet check is always a crapshoot, but if I'm not in class or not working, I'm somewhere writing.  And if I'm somewhere writing, I'm somewhere spending money.  But when your nut is infected, you're popping two $5 each pills a day for a month, your insurance covers none of it, and the cash loan you were told you could get on August 4 still isn't available on August 15, tradition and repetition must be damned for beer and movies (I have two free popcorn coupons for Regal Cinemas, and I should get a free coke coupon next time I see a Regal film, so it's almost cost-productive for me to see a movie this weekend).  Thus, the paltry hours of the day that would usually be spent at Texadelphia or picking something up at Borders or Vulcan Video end up utilized in the PCL library, sitting at a slow Dell computer (seven years ago, this piece would be a beast...Paul Jones, Daniel Young, Matt Haley and I sat in Young's room downloading dirty pictures...the pictures were maybe 200K, and they would each take 5 minutes at the least to download), reading weblogs and seeing where I rank in the scheme of the written web word.    And I'm pretty good.    Three years ago, I built a website for the  urlLink Centenary College Student Government Association , promoting the progressive actions we embarked on for the school year (NOTE:  1)  That is not the original index page, it was destroyed by a later webmaster.  2) Don't try any of the links on said page...someone broke the code after I left, and no one ever bothered to fix it).  I built it in order to celebrate our group, yet give Centenary students easy access to the issues and their representatives -- we posted representative bios, a detailed budget documenting all transactions, all legislation brought to the table, and the voting record of each senate member.  At the time of the site's unveiling, I noted to the senate that it was one of the 20 best college SGA sites in the country.  If anything, my words were an understatement...I visited over 200 college sites, of which maybe 75 had SGA sites.  Few of the sites looked crisper, and none provided near the content we did.    For that work, I was paid $500.  I never complained about the money, nor am I complaining now.  I was also paid $1200 as the SGA's Vice President of Internal Affairs, so for $1700, I worked 20 hours a week for the Centenary SGA during the 2000-2001 school year.  After I left, Drew Sutton volunteered to keep up the site.  He would be paid $1200 as Vice President of External Affairs, but he asked not to be paid the $500 stipend as webmaster.  I told him he needed the money; not only was it laborious work that was rarely appriciated, but a paycheck would keep him honest and working on the site.  He said he'd be fine.   Three years later, the site is still for the 2000-2001 SGA.    I tell this story because I understand what people want, and I understand how hard it is to manufacture.  People want content.  People want links to surf through.  People want a website that never ends, that will always be there with something new when they log on.  Whenever I get onto  urlLink Homestar Runner  and there are no new cartoons, a part of me dies, because I need new stimuli, and I know HSR provides much better that most of the flash animation on the web.    This site is good...my writing is pretty fresh...it's enough about me to keep folks interested, but not so much that it's a boring drone about my wake to bed existance.  But I've got an entire  urlLink site  that is not utilized, that sits as nothing more than a poorly organized portfolio, and that I pay $12/mo for.    We want content.  We want content that is in some way fresh and exciting.  And we want content that teaches us something, but not in the traditional, textbooks-open call of the term.  It's what I've wanted to produce since I decided I was going to have a post-Centenary webspace.  It's what I hope to do now.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Destination City - Austin, TX   And then it was done.    Getting off the plane at Bergstrom last night, I wondered if I had done things right.  I worked.  I relaxed.  I read.  I wrote.  I played a lot of grabass.  Sometimes I played no grabass at all.  I drank a lot, and I went almost two months without drinking anything.  I went to the beach.  I spent so little time at the beach.  I made money.  I didn't make enough.    But I don't want to be anywhere else, not now, and not then.  I think it was in Poway, CA where I was finally happy to be where I was, and while I knew I would be leaving soon and I would miss the people there and the San Diego breeze, I was excited about Arkansas.  And then I had to leave Arkansas, and some of the best friends anyone could ever know, but I was excited about Winston-Salem.  And the same thing there, and at Duke, and in Little Rock, and then even in Florida.    And now Austin.  Again.  Beginning my third year.  I was shat out in Year 1, gorged on by a hungry metropolis that didn't bother to taste, just enriched itself on my meager content and spent me.  I worked my way back in Year 2, focusing on myself, getting shit together so I couldn't be hurt again, and in that way, distancing myself from the city.  And now, Year 3.  Taking who I am and making something happen in this city.  I will write screenplays, I will graduate with a 4.0, I will do everything I need to do for me.  But that includes doing a lot of things that aren't directly for me.    If I'm supposed to call you because you're new in the city or I now know you live here after years apart, I can't do it right now.  Hotmail isn't working, and I never punched your phone #s into my phone.  Be patient.  I've got to be.  UT says I can grab an emergency cash loan on the 15th of August, they say this two weeks ago.  So I come back on this day in order to get this.  They say it's no go, but I can get it tomorrow!  Except they're closed tomorrow, and they're closed on Sunday, so I can't get it until Monday.  HOORAY!

      Do we even understand how stupid the George Bush regime is?  Thin the forests out to protect against forest fires and the "millions lost in property damage."  Fun how western notions of property ownership trump the environment.    I'm registered to vote in California, an echo to a past that saw me at Berkeley at this point in my life.  So who do I vote for?  I'm not a fan of the recall, so I could vote against that...but then I don't get to vote for pornstars or Arnolds.  But then there's  urlLink Georgy Russell .  I'm fascinated by twentysomethings who run for public office.  And she sells thongs.  And better read on issues than most everyone I've seen so far, sans Cruz Bustamante and Larry Flint.  Why are the porn barons always the smart guys?    If you can find a list of twentysomething candidates, or Cali candidates in general, let me know.

      Not much writing recently...the phone line to my mom's condo got cut during construction a few days back, and thus my trusty dial-up is unable to move.  So I'm at the Naples Public Library, a fantastic Spanish-style structure bustling full of genealogy books and pretentious old assholes.  Forgive me, but I don't owe old people shit just because they're old...wait your fucking turn to use the computer.    Naples has one of the largest Me First attitudes I've known in America...this is a deep knowledge of a number of American cities, including all of SoCal.  Naples fits right in...middle-class folks are looked upon as poor, and they hate it, so they're struggling to look better than they are...the new rich, the rich that are rich just by bank account at the moment, they are the true assholes of the land, feeling like Canaan is here, and we are the Baalites, owing them all of our manna, milk, honey, bread, and goodly posessions.   My mom really wants to read the blog.  She and I have a pretty good relationship, but I know few people as prude, and while she likes my liberalness on social sentimentalities, when it comes to discussing my shits and sex life, I'm pretty sure she'd read, smile, say "That's okay, pookey," and slowly cry away her pain.    My trusty Samsung Cell Phone is just about dead...range is atrocious, and the battery just lasts a few hours, much less if I dare talk on it.  It's old...there's no fancy letter-number sequence code for the phone (the TX015 or the L98E721)...it's just the black Samsung cell phone.  I bought it in August 2000 from the Sprint store in Shreveport...it was refurbished, originally bought in early 1998.  The phone is large, mostly owing to the battery...it plays ten different rings; three of them songs and seven variations on brrrrrrrrriiiinngggg...its best feature is vibrate, the setting I would leave it on during Latin class so if anyone called me, my pocket would rumble and Corey McMullin and Joanna Taggert would smile, causing Dr. Clark, who was unaware of the phone, to question their dedication to Quintus Augstus Flaccus.    Is it odd to not want to give up a cell phone?  It's not like the 1978 Volvo G260 Stationwagon, the yellow beast that was in my family from birth until April 18, 2001...but in a way it is.  Flann O'Brien says our objects become us and we become our objects, so in a way that cell phone is truly attached to my right ear, sometimes attached to my left when I'm talking to a girl and get that ear sweat that causes the hand switch, but quickly switching back because I'm just not used to using the cell phone on the left ear.  Jean Baudrillard says that our objects are just objects, with no symbolic meaning whatsoever.  Perhaps packrats are fighting Baurdillard's cause, keeping their posessions long after use-value is gone just because it will always mean more to them than it will to someone else, or it will to a trash heap.    Lots of movies the past two weeks...Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean, Winged Migration, Seabiscuit, and today, American Wedding.  Just two of us in the theatre, but there were still laugh-out-loud points.  Of course, I laugh out loud quite frequently...moreso than any person I know, save John Hubbard, who could find a career in theatre circles as a constant patron, being paid to watch plays and laugh uproariously, thus making the other theatregoers feel more comfortable in exercising their chuckles.  Great characters in that bit...sad that the cameos I hoped for from Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, and Tara Reid were for naught...but they did a good job with the few they stuck on, save Thomas Ian Nicholas, whose agent didn't do a good job of securing him more than a face and three bad lines for the final of the trilogy.  Eugene Levy is incredible yet again.

      Florida until Thursday...nothing much going on in Austin to get back to except spending money I don't have.  Maybe Schlitterbahn on Friday, when I grab my emergency cash loan that will sate me until the loan fundage comes in.  Bills are paid for this month, and now I've just got to skid by on my cash, so a few more days of watching movies and playing with my nephew, all the while dodging West Nile, sounds like the best plan.  And it makes my mom happy.    Winged Migration was incredible.  Gets kind of dull at parts because it's much of the same thing, but watching that movie, you envy the life of a bird because the bird can see the world.  Of course, you don't envy the scavenger life of birds, and how to break a wing is to be dead.    Also caught Jerry Magurie on TNT last night...good film, gets me back into the writing mode on both of my projects...he has that decision point of making the world a better place quite early in the movie, and the rest of the movie deals with the ramifications of that decision to be closer to fewer clients.  Interesting set-up.  Plus, Renee Zellweger doesn't look like an emaciated chipmunk here...she's still got some sexy going on at this point in the career.    Sun comes out for just a few minutes a day now, with lots of marine layer and thundershowers.  Tan not commenced.  Red tide washes dead fishies onto the sand.  Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?

      Amy was right.  Live now, write later.  Or live now, write now.    I need constant inspiration, a strong role in several organizations where I can see tangible results from my work, and hard work that leaves me tired at the end of the day, but excited to wake up and start the next.  Waiting tables is cool, and I love human interaction, but will that be enough for me when I put on my velvet black robe with the orange and white hood and receive my graduate degree?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I wrote little this summer, but what I wrote I believe was good, or on the right track, getting me to where I need to be.  I hold two screenplay ideas so strongly right now that I must work on both this semester...one is the project for the term, and the other is  Three Strikes , my first collegiate screenplay that made the right effort, but waxed too long in superfluous filth and never consummated the characters as was needed.  Reading Michael Lewis'  urlLink Moneyball , I found what my story was missing, the theoretical debate in baseball circles, the fight of the old school versus the new way of thinking about things...it's a great theme that was too weak in my original.  I wrote a few very good characters...if I can flesh out those who weren't as good, make Jay less of a villain and more of an opportunist, give Cheree and Luis more meat, and figure out how Sergeant Landry isn't just a one-trick pony, this shit could get sold.    Life is exciting.    Today:  Finding Nemo with mom, maybe some lunch at a restaurant, and then just hanging out.  My mom is cool, regardless of what social quirks and reclusive nature she exhibits.  Probably the most naively good person I can think of.  She doesn't see why people act badly, because she doesn't act badly.  She's liberal, but nothing compared to me...she'd vote Lieberman.  If any of you have 55-65 male friends/relatives/fellows who you know are single and like a woman who would rather watch soccer than do anything (and is the best cook I know, and this isn't just me being a good son who loves his mom's corn beef hash...ask around, the woman is fantastic in the kitchen...don't even take that innuendo where it could go), let us know.

      Watched a presidential debate between the Democratic candidates this afternoon.  With the exception of Lieberman, I could cast my support for any one of these guys.  The question is, which one can beat Bush?  Most likely it will be Lieberman, Kerry, Gephardt, or Dean...I like Dean the most, but he'll get the worst conservative backlash.  I've always thought Gephardt to be a pussy, and Kerry less than your usual Yes man.  But times change.  Not only would I take anything over George Bush at the moment, but I will adamently support the Democratic candidate (sans Lieberman), casting my volunteer abilities to the Democratic cause.  No, I cannot vote Green next year.  We've got to win.  The changes won't be swift, nor as large as I would hope.  But for the sake of domestic and foreign policy, and all things humanistic, we need George Bush to be a flash in the pan, and his cabinet of puppet masters put in media purgatory.    I can't bring myself to read Bill O'Reilley or Ann Coulter, but maybe I should.  Their bellicose stupidity makes me want to kick myself in the face until I pass out, but maybe reading it will help me when I talk to fly-by-night conservatives who can quote their ringleaders without understanding their words.    Beach this afternoon.  Red tide caused hundreds of dead fish to wash up on the shore, keeping me and most others out of the water.  Beatuiful sands though, calm waves, and a warm sun.  Two guys walked by, toned and tanned, just living the bum life.  It was my dream at the start of this year to be what they were this summer.  Sitting in my chair, with Dow Mossman's STONES OF SUMMER in hand, untanned, trimmer but not at all toned, less than tan, I questioned my choice for the summer.  Doubt lingered for several moments, then left quietly.  I would like to spend two days in Corpus before school starts, camping or living in a cheap motel, playing in the waves, drinking beers, and maybe meeting up with a twentysomething girl who likes beer, loves fun, and doesn't agree with most people about most things.  Interested?  I'll take headshots.    My sister was just on local Florida television, sweeping mosquitos into a dish as a reporter droned on about West Nile.  I missed most of the talk, but I'd assume it silly, editing my sister's interview heavily to show that there is not much of a threat of West Nile, but still a threat exists.  Fun times with news media.  Of course, I made half a dozen interviews on Shreveport television in my day, talking about lots of things but always supporting Centenary College.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 11 - Naples, FL   The queen bed calls to me, provocatively.  I turn away, run, do my best not to heed the call into her arms.  Yet she will win, and quickly...I am beaten, weakened, tired.  The mind, hours ago positively apoptic with thought, now lethargically casts away its trimmings for sullied bedclothes.  The Atlanta airport deserves description, as do flights at night, my fear of flying, the wonderful book Moneyball, my favorite screenplay, the prospects of interviewing celebrities, and sex with girls in boot-cut jeans.  Yet no, it is lost.  In 10 days I will ride the Terminal T escelator again, curious if it represents our ascent to Heaven.    Tonight, a bed in a home I recognize, even though my mom just moved in two months ago.

      The fun-time blog hour I planned for around noon today is cancelled.  Folks love to hack UT's websphere, and without any semblance of internet at the casa, I'm tapping out on the blog this afternoon.    House is fantastic.  A garage, a garage with speakers hooked up to play music outside, a garage with stereo equipment left over to allow music to be played on the speakers hooked up to play music outside, several knicknacks from the late 1980s, a cock and balls, horseshoes, a threshold, a make-out bench...all for $380 a month and a lot of painting to do.  The damage to the place is only cosmetic.  The first party was last night, and I ended up awake until 4, my longest sojurn of the summer.  Cool folks that new roomie Evan hangs out with, especially a sexy playwright who even made an operetta regarding children's literature and  Puss and Boots   fascinating.  I have a thing against Puss and Boots.  No clue why...but that cat on the cover of the book looks like a cross between an extra in Michael Jackson's  Thriller  and a pet with a severe hemmhroid problem.    Money sucks.

       Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Intermission - Austin, TX   I didn't expect a warm welcome, mostly because I let few people know I was coming through.  A 36 hour layover in your home city doesn't allow mounds of time to grab beers with friends and other fellows.  I made the calls I thought were manditory, and left the rest to my post-Florida presence...the long haul.    But from those friends, at least I would have enjoyed a phone call back.    I can forgive them...no reason not to.  I've flaked on my share of ceremonies, things I'm never proud of and rarely wish to think about.  Spring Break, 1998:  For any school vacation, the trip from Shreveport always left me a layover in Conway, as my roommate lived in Morrilton, and his family would take me to Conway and drop me off at Hendrix or UCA, from where I would latch onto a Rogers High School Class of '97 cadet, and we'd hit McAllester's or some other chain eatery, and go up to Rogers on Friday.    I did this four times during my freshman year, so the trips blur together.  Three of those times, I visited Daniel Harr, the fourth coming when I only stopped for an hour to pick up Sarah Kent because she needed a ride to Rogers, and Daniel was in Rogers anyway, taking Mellisa (spelled correctly) Falk to the prom as a "favor to the family."  This trip was one of the ones where I saw Daniel.  Just not for long.  And not in the situation I hoped to find him in.    I don't remember what I did in Rogers that week...grabass most likely, because I don't think I spent more than the weekend there, and I went somewhere else in Shreveport for the week proper.  Regardless, UCA was still in class for my break, while Hendrix wasn't.  So I went to Rogers with Mark Holland, and planned to come back from Rogers with Cameron Clausing...Cameron was the better friend of the two, but Mark held the intellectual mindset that I noticed in myself, and we had such a great car trip going to Rogers, that I balked on Cameron and drove back with Mark.  I gave Cameron some excuse, and he laughed it off as he always did, and from that point on my communication with Cameron Clausing was severly limited.  I didn't mean any harm...I don't talk to Mark or Cameron anymore, and I probably miss Cameron more...but at that point, I was 18, I was experiencing newness for the first time, and Mark Holland was a mix of old-home comfort and new-wave thought...we were enjoying ourselves, so I saw no point to end that.    Cameron was going to drive me to UCA, where I would stay with Daniel Harr, and then he'd take me to Little Rock the next afternoon where Lisa Jackson and Laura Jimerson would pick me up and we'd be back to Shreveport.  This was Easter Break...I don't remember for life what I did over Spring Break, but this was one of those four-day fests for private college, but not even a long weekend for public schools...there's a great Josh Dorne story in this (which Heath might remember, because Josh and I visited him, and I haven't seen Heath since) as well, but for later.    I was having fun.  Life was full of possibilities, my mind was constantly engaged, and I suffered from consistent permagrin.  Mark and I drove 540 to 40, discussing art, politics, religion, and girl situations, as both of us had continued to date Rogers students when we went to college, and both relationships fizzled.  We listened to Ravi Shankar or some other sitar-wielding trio, pleased that we took the close familial friendships from Rogers, but could distance ourselves from its great unwashed populus.    I never got ahold of Daniel Harr regarding staying with him.  I maybe made a halfhearted effort...somewhere in my mind I remember a pay phone in Morrilton or Clarksville or East Russellville.  Even if I did call, it was only in show...I was still enjoying the conversation with Mark, and while Daniel was a better friend than Mark, I knew I'd see Daniel a long more...with the world at my grasp, I knew Mark and many other Rogers friends would slip away.    We got into town late, threw my shit in the Hendrix dorm room, and then hit the Subway/Texaco near campus...Mark wanted a veggie sub or something.  I recognized the car outside, but only in passing.  We walked through the double doors, and the cold jet of air-conditioning slammed me backwards.  Daniel Harr sat in a plastic booth with his roommate Travis and several other friends.  He looked up at me and his face fell.  I tried to play it off... I called you!  Where were you!  but he had been in his room, waiting for the call.  He finally realized I was giving him the old fuckeroo and hit the Subway.    To remember what happened next makes me glad that I am no longer that same 18 year old.  Daniel wanted to mend fences, forget I hadn't called, and I'd go stay with him that night.  And I told him no.  Even though my stuff was just minutes away, I said it would probably be easier if I just stayed at Hendrix that night.  Looking at Daniel's spread of friends at that moment, I knew I would intellectually enjoy a night with Cameron Clausing and Mark Holland more than I would with Daniel Harr, Travis, Keeley, and April.    Daniel wouldn't take no for an answer, a testament to his character and motivation to move past my folly.  He decreed that I would come eat lunch with him at McDonald's that afternoon, before I was shuttled to Centenary.  So I did.  Awkward, yes.  Him, me, and April, a friend of his who was engaged to a guy in the military...cool girl with a huge crush on him who wanted him to swoop in and take her so she didn't have to go with the second-best option.  Since she was there, the conversation floated mostly in superfluousness, just about what was happening where and who was doing what.  Daniel was realizing he wasn't going to stay at UCA much longer, though the decision point was still two months away.  But he was healthy, he had some good friends, and he was making a name for himself where he was.  And just as I was starting to really enjoy his company, Lisa Jackson walked in and I was off to Shreveport.  I don't think we ever mentioned it again.  We had a great summer, I busted my leg, we kept in touch pretty well that year, but I didn't come home but once that next summer, and we didn't really talk at all my junior year.  I found him during the summer of 2000, and since then we've reforged a best friendship, seeing each other at least six times a year, drinking beers, playing EverQuest, and living a life well removed from Rogers High School and the townies.    I got a dirty six hours on the couch in the grad student lounge, woken up at 8 by some woman checking her email...I assumed someone would find me, but figured it would be last night at 3 or so, when the drunken cavalcade arrived from Katz's needing to check email and download porn.    New house.  Today.  Yeah, I'm excited.

      Med school party in Little Rock.  Medical conversations, jokes about rectal examinations and touching genitals without latex gloves...but some of the kindest folks you'll know.  That's what I miss about Arkansas, or Louisiana.  A community of people with common goals and supportive mentalities.  I've got it to a degree in Austin, but there are just six other screenwriters, three with families and two with serious girlfriends and one with a fairly serious medical condition.  I'm building it with other folks outside of my discipline, and I am interested to see how those friendships progress, but for tonight, feeling at home with a bunch of third year med students on a house off Shackleford in West Little Rock...I want that to be my house.  I want people to feel that comfortable.  I want all levels of pretention to be wiped away, from the frat boys to the Buddy Holly spectacled guitar players.  Enjoy yourself, and don't just show an interest in the other people...be interested.    I heard the best shitting the pants story ever today...much much much better than my Borders experience.  Incredible.  The victim is allowing me to utilize it for any screenplays, something I'd normally have no problem with, as I realize that the writer rarely creates, he just takes from others and mixes it together to provide a theme...but this story is so good, I don't want to make fame or fortune or get laid because of it.  But would me getting laid because of his shitting himself be a perfect ending to the saga?

      The page is broken =(    Yahoo!'s comprehensive support team gave me great advice on what was wrong with it:   Your file may be corrupt , though they won't help, because the page is actually built out of Blogger.  Yet it shows up fine in Blogger, as it does in my Page Editor.  I tell them this, but that doesn't matter.    I'm beginning to think I'm censored.  I was censored once before, Spring of 1999 at Centenary.  On my homepage, I made a whimsical reference to offering porn through my webspace, which linked to a picture of a clothed President Ken Schwab holding a dog, in a picture taken from the 1997 Student Guidebook's famed discourse  The President's Pen .   The page was up for months, and at one point it drew praise from the President himself, before he knew me as the KSCL mercinary.  Two days later, however, the site was down, and the webmaster told me that it was  unprofessional  of me to have that up.  Whether that was the case, I said, it didn't matter...I had freedom of speech on the webspace.   Oh,  she said.  well, there's a copyright infringement with the photographer.   I didn't press the issue.  Today I would.    Joseph Arthur -  Honey and the Moon  is rocking me.  I've got a bed, decked out in red comfy sheets.  It's a twin, which might cost me a sex life, but I'll save money on condoms and sheets, as Twin sheets are ridiculously inexpensive.  And maybe I can turn that savings into enough PBR to convince the girl that sessions on my dorm-style bed are worth the sacrifice of post-coital comfort.    I'll be up late tonight.  The room's getting to where it needs to be.  It is my room now.  I can write in it.  I can keep the TV off (if The Practice or NFL Football isn't on), throw on some music, and work on the screenplay.  Or the blog.    It comes back to the honesty, folks.  To produce art is to expose honesty in all facets.  The blog sucks when I'm not writing about what I want to write about, because I don't want some people to see it.    Tonight, after viewing  urlLink The Match-Factory Girl , a movie I thoroughly enjoyed but my screenwriting mates did not, Tripper and I got into an argument about the scope of the film.  Tripper thought it was throwaway bullshit...he didn't see a plot, said he could tell the story in 10 minutes, never cared about the characters.  His rhetoric was so goddamned arrogant that I struggled to begin counteracting it...when I'd mention that it was a character piece rather than a plot vehicle, he'd say the characters were one-dimensional at best.    In a very base way he is correct, as we only learn what the director wants us to about his characters.  But foreign film is an extremely different beast from Hollywood, and the cultural schema of these works relates to their audience...which would be their country's folks.  Tripper spoke as if he assumed Hollywood film was for the world, and foreign film was only meant to breach a local audience.  If he's right, it's only because foreign audiences are willing to learn American nuances, while we are not willing to give foreign cultures the same respect.  I'm not an expert on Kaurismaki's work, or Finnish culture, but I'm willing to give the work respect, even if there is no dialogue until the 12th minute.    After Tripper experessed his all-knowing views, I told him I hoped he would say the same thing to Mitko, our screenwriting professor who said we needed to see this film.  It was the only barb I could really throw, and in that it was the most scathing barb...I knew of his presumptuous bluff:   Of course I'm not going to say that to Mitko .  Even though Tripper thought the film was a waste for us, because  Hollywood types would never read that script , he won't express his concern in class, instead sitting quietly while Mitko and I and probably Dave Hahn talk about the strength of Kaurismaki's characters.    I've missed out on several lucrative opportunities because I don't eat ass.  But I've lived an almost constantly happy life.

      Abby McMurray was a girl that every guy at Centenary once had a crush on.  For some guys it was just a fleeting interest...something that could be wonderful but not worth a pursuit.  Others dedicated their social lives to pursuing a date with Abby.  Matthew Philbrook would often sojurn to the Canterbury House, speaking of the afternoon he just spent with Ms. McMurray, and how wonderfully things were going with his pining.    We all knew Matthew had no chance, and it had little to do with Matthew himself.  Abby was a girl with motive...she knew what she wanted and she knew how she would play to get it.  Yes, she went on a date with Bob Calhoun, Centenary's dwarven man-child.  But Bob was in Choir...Abby had no interest in sticking with Bob, but Bob fit into her schema of guys she'd date.     The Boys   1)  Choir. 2)  TKEs ( NOTE:  TKEs in the Choir were elevated to an deity status ) 3)  Other Greeks. 4)  Other.  And I never knew Abby McMurray to settle with the Others.    My crush lasted one day...Virgilio asked if he could draw a portrait of me for his senior art show.  He said it was a favor to him.  I was flattered.  Even though I wasn't the only one he was drawing that day, no one had ever expressed an artistic interest in me.  I sat as he drew Abby, who wore a periwinkle blue ball gown and some sort of gem-set necklace.  She looked beautiful...looking back I do ask why she would dress so fashionably for a charcoal drawing on blotting paper, but transfixation on her glorious breasts usurped any rational thought.    I knew too much about Abby's boy troubles, the drama she created around her...and it was created.  She had a long memory of guys gone and guys to come, and anyone who settled down next to her on one of the SUB swing benches to have an afternoon chat would learn about Chip, or any number of TKEs, and her disgust with boys.  Yet seeing her on any number of couches at the TKE house with any number of pot-smoking, GPA challenged frat boys, it felt both expected and wrong, and it seemed to feel wrong because every time I'd see her with a Todd Kileen, I wondered why it wasn't me instead.    Two weeks before I graduated, I found myself at yet another TKE party.  TKE parties were some of the best parties on campus, but they never offered anything more than the usual.  Jean Ancelet would stand in the bar, mixing the casual drink and holding the casual conversation, all the while wearing his trademark black hat with no insignia.  Sean Gilder would be outside, attempting to get the Ashley Daigles and Jennifer Maynards of the world to do the pole dance on him.  Will Wells would smoke pot in the back room.  Corey Pavletich would shake hands as he passed, pretending that he cared.    I was seated on a bit of deck bench when Abby McMurray bounced by, sat on my lap, put her arm around my neck and said  So when are we going to make out?   What's stopping us now, I asked.  She laughed and hugged me, and sat on my lap for the next twenty minutes, rubbing my shoulder and breathing on my neck.    This is where the game should have started, the game where I put on a fake charm, try to look like James Dean, and put as much kindly pressure on Abby to get her to back to my place for a night of high school romping.  But I didn't do it.  I stayed myself, remained flippant, whimsical, positive.  I would have loved to have made out with Abby McMurray that night.  But I didn't put forth the leg work to do it.  Because Abby wanted me to play the game.    Sitting on my lap, sticking her neck precariously close to my lips, maneuvering her hand across my back and my chest, yet never committing to any certain action.  Everything about my body carriage, my actions made it evident that I was interested.  But she needed the right language, the right moves, the dance that society tells us to do.    So I excused myself, shifted Abby off my lap, and went to talk to some other people.  I grabbed a beer, walked through the house, maybe danced with a few folks in the house, and made my way back out to Abby.  Because while I wasn't into the game, I was into her that night.  And I could see that she was interested in me...she didn't want to start a flowering relationship, but she was willing to put my name on her list of experiences if I was willing to play by her rules.  I wanted to see if maybe she found that I don't follow the rules.    Instead, I found her and Mark Simmons kissing.  Mark Simmons.    So I walked away, found Justin Kirkes, told him to get in the car, and we drove in silence to Longview, where I bought us Sourdough Jack combos and we talked about how girls suck.

      Rick Perry called the  urlLink third special redistricting session  today, one day after elder Democrat John Whitmire announced he was returning to Texas.  It is not unexpected, but it is unfortuante.  My problem doesn't stem from the Republicans...they're working to protect their seats.  The problem is that, during the next election, this mess will be forgotten.  Texans won't look at Tom Delay, David Dewhurst, or any of the other state and national representatives that worked to backdoor a shady resolution that ignores current census numbers.  They won't hold their elected officials accountable for their actions.  Instead, there will be talk of lowering taxes, or talk of war, or talk of jobs, and people will concern themselves with their bank accounts, and vote for the candidate that most assures them of keeping thier bank account high.    It's not easy to debate gerrymandering...Democrats do it to their advantage as well.   But looking at Texas, and  urlLink what happened recently in Colorado , it is evident that districts with distinct ethnicities/socio-economic stati/cultures are divided for the sheer purpose of dilluting their vote.  Colorado, a state with a fairly large hispanic population, sees its hispanic neighborhoods divided down the middle between two districts, splitting thier voice between other social groupings.    An article in the Austin Chronicle a few weeks ago gave mention to an issue between Lubbock and Odessa regarding redistricting, and it's the issue that is at heart in this mess.  Currently Odessa is the hallmark city of its own district, as is Lubbock.  Under redistricting, the two cities will be in the same district.  Both cities are predominantly Republican strongholds, though Odessa's seat is currently in the hands of a long-term Democrat who is constantly re-elected by the Republicans.  Odessa, an area with a primarily agrarian economy, will lose its representative, and become the bitter stepchild to Lubbock, an area whose money is less in farming and more in commerce.  Legislation that farmers would hold stronger will be passed over by the new representative if it interferes with commercial legislation, as Lubbock's population is much larger than Odessa's.    I have no faith in any person working in the White House, and little faith in most of our congress.  But after Bush was sworn in, I found myself telling a distraught, red-faced Brandon Lawson "It's the will of the people."  My opinion was that, regardless of technicalities, in the end Bush won the electoral college.  No matter how much it upset me, America wanted Junior in office.    Today, the more I shun Tom Brokaw and other puppeted news sources and turn to alternative press, I see that I misspoke to Brandon Lawson, that he was right to want to cry as George Bush stood, palm on Bible, reciting the oath of office.  Al Gore was the will of the people, albeit by a slim margin.  One of my favorite stories from Election 2000 that was glossed over immediately regarded a number of  urlLink African-Americans who were unable to vote  (NOTE:  The first half of the email is formatting and stuff...get down halfway and it is riveting) for numerous reasons...this article talks about people turned away at the polling centers, not being given their rights, and police harassment.  It doesn't even get into the sketchiness of the Motor Voter Laws, or blockade of shuttles going from low-income areas to voting centers.    I'll support Howard Dean, Dennis Kuchinich, Wesley Clark, John Kerry...any of 'em but Lieberman and Bush.  I'll vote for them.  But at this moment I understand just how insignificant my voting power is.  Don't throw me the hoo-ha about how voting is the bedrock of America, it's what it means to be in a Democracy, I should be proud to have the right  as in the background the Battle Hymn of the Union plays .  I do vote.  I encourage everyone else to vote.  But I don't even begin to believe the false pretention that I'm changing the world with that piece of paper...backdoor politics and industrial fatcats make the decisions.  I just put on my I VOTED button and talk to News 8 about how I am participating in Democracy, and how soon the people of Iraq will be as lucky as me.

      No love on the BackBlog posts =(  To be fair, readership is only down a bit from where it hit this summer, so it's probably more what I'm writing about these days rather than people bored with their findings here.    There's a fair amount to say, but why or how?  I am writing a fascinating screenplay, I believe.  Pitched it today in class and got good response, with criticism aimed at making my content better, not at changing my structure.  I'm pulling my social life to a level it hasn't seen since Centenary, finally...for the first time I have the money to go out on a fairly regular basis, and I'm well past the post-undergrad funk that wrecked my confidence for two years.  I still struggle in forced conversation points...I hate silence, and my problems arise when I start to plug what I consider awkward silence with whatever machinations ring out in my head.  I'm falling back out of the shape I got myself into this summer, which wasn't incredible, but posed for increased energy...a life of reading books and articles and writing dialogue and action doesn't beget time at the Slaughter pool or the Gregory Gym.  And the Ultimate players around here are too focused on gaming for me to pick-up with them...if I could find a group that gets together once a week to throw disc and play a game, that'd be great.  As would finding a high-quality orchestra that only practices twice a week.    This blog isn't therapy, and I don't mean for it to become that.  I'll get back to the stories, the political rants, the film reviews, the shits...

      I write because I hope one day it validates all the shit I notice in the back rooms of our selves.  The hot girl in the white midriff tank top, spaghetti straps, carrying what looks like a musical score but could be a lab practical, walking in, blonde hair tied back simply, carelessly, efficiently.  I notice her in passing; she's hot, but if I'm going to ogle, I'll prefer to do it with a mental snapshot so she doesn't get uncomfortable.  The guy sitting across from me notices her once as she passes, eyes traveling head to ass, staying on ass.  He looks back to his Norton anthology, probably enjoying some of Christina Rossetti's better work, the work that got me in trouble in high school because I knew it was about cunnilingus, but I wasn't supposed to say it out loud.  He looks up agian.  Ass.  She's not looking.  She didn't catch him.  I did.  She passes agian, this time with a friend who's not as hot.  He doesn't look...he'd get caught.  I can look this time.  Ass.  Good ass.  Back to Goblin Market.

      Will most Sundays of hardcore studies, Chargers losses, and extended grabass result in multiple bloggage?    ACL Music Festival...should've bought tickets months ago when they were just $50 for the duration, but $70 to see these shows is great as well...and I'll get some tannage going on most likely.  Who am I going to see?    Liz Phair - Friday 3-4 The Mavericks - Friday 5-6 Steve Winwood - Friday 7-8 Al Green - Friday 8:45 - 10 Endochine - Saturday 1:45 - 2:30 Los Lobos - Saturday 3-4 Abra Moore - Saturday 6:30 - 7:15 Lucinda Williams - Sunday 2:30 - 3:30 Yo La Tengo - Sunday 4:30 - 5:30 Ween - Sunday 6:30 - 7:30 REM - Sunday 8:30 - 10  NOTES:  I could trade Al Green with Dwight Yoakam no problem, much relating to an Al Green concert I attended at the Del Mar Fairgrounds in San Diego about eight or nine years ago.  Nothing against Al, but it seems like most of his songs were decent covers of other artists.  And at a festival like this, you never know if he'll break out the love ballads outside of  Let's Stay Together .  I could probably miss all of Saturday and not be too upset...Los Lobos are fun, and Endochine is critically-acclaimed, but it's got none of the draw power that Friday or Sunday do.  Phair, Mavericks, & Winwood on Friday, Williams...Tengo, Ween, and REM on Sunday?    Robert Earl Keen is left out, trumped by Liz and Winwood...Steve Winwood is one of my favorite musicians (though his new album isn't too hot, IMHO), and Liz Phair is super hot.  Kind of sad not to see Lyle Lovett making an appearance.    You're welcome to try to convince me to go to  urlLink other good musicians , but make a strong and valid argument.  And don't even bother telling me to go see Spoon or Ben Harper...I'm just not interested.     ADD - Rainer Maria, a famed Indie/Emo band, is coming to Emo's on September 24.  And I've already got plans to see Guster on October 18th at Stubb's.  Woot!

      Because I won't leave the computer until after the game is over (hate fans who pack up early), here are my picks for this week's games.  I made them on Thursday, and if you question it, contact Denton Heaney.  I'm good at picking games as long as the Chargers aren't in the thick of a playoff run.     Note:  the spread is indicated by the parenthetical numbers.  For example, for the line WASHINGTON, that means that I picked Washington to win, and gave the Jets three points...because the game was 16-13, that will go down as a tie.  Where I picked HOUSTON (+14), that means I get 14 points.  Even if Houston loses, as long as they don't lose by more than 14 points, I win.   WASHINGTON (-3) BUFFALO (-1) JACKSONVILLE (+4) DENVER (-6) INDIANAPOLIS (+1) DETROIT (-4) MINNESOTA (+5) SAN DIEGO (+6) HOUSTON (+14) NY GIANTS (-1) PITTSBURGH (-5) DALLAS (-2) SAN FRANCISCO (-7) NEW ORLEANS (+3) TENNESSEE (-3) PHILADELPHIA (-3)  I'll post these earlier in the week from now on.  If you want to play, send me your picks and I'll post 'em here...don't think there's enough space in BackBlog for posts, but try if you want.

      My boys are getting slaughtered.    I am a tried and true Padres fan, the kind that posts on message boards, keeps up with the farm system, feels like he has a strong understanding of what the General Manager is trying to accomplish with the team.  I enjoyed the division win in 1996, the World Series in 1998, and was ecstatic about the Brian Giles trade, the first in a series of moves that Kevin Towers has embarked on in order to return us to the glory days that our franchise never knew.    But my heart sits with San Diego's football francise, the Chargers.  When I moved from Arkansas, I worked to hold on to every aspect of California life I knew.  There was little in Rogers, except for the Sunday sports ticker that I'd get when watching a Cowboys or Chiefs football game...I could see how the Chargers were doing.  We never got Chargers games in Rogers...just the ticker, and maybe a highlight or two.    This is only amusing because while I was in San Diego, I was not once a Chargers fan.  I didn't care about football.  My mom and dad loved it, but their hearts were with collegiate sports, specifically the Arkansas Razorbacks.  We had hog hats and red shirts and we'd call the hogs in the living room, all pointless endeavors in my young mind.    It helps that the year I moved to Arkansas was the first year since I was a conscious being that the Chargers made a playoff run...they rattled off 11 out of 12 wins at the end of the season to win the AFC West and bring Charger Fever to the city.   And to Rogers.    I didn't keep up with the Chargers this preseason, because of school, the new house, and other grabass revolving around the baseball franchise.  They went 2-2, with an impressive win against San Francisco in their final game.  But the test was the first game of the season, in Kansas City, a division rival who is picked by many to go to the Super Bowl.  My Chargers are young, with a very inexperienced secondary, but they've got the best running back in the NFL in LaDanian Tomlinson, a great wide receiver in David Boston, and one of the marquee pass rushers in Marcellus Wiley.  Those horses, along with a talented secondary cast, should be enough to keep the Chargers close against KC, and if you're close, you can win.    As of Halftime, it's Kansas City 24, the Chargers 0.    I woke up this morning with the sole intent of watching the Chargers play.  Drove down to Click's Billiards off Oltorf, where, according to the commercials with the gruff rapist and the softcore porn star, the NFL's Sunday Ticket is in full gear, so you can watch all the games.  As I found out only after the drive and then enterance, all of the games, of course, means four.  With eight games playing across America, and Green Bay in one of them (I don't know why, but Green Bay fans take over every sports bar in America on Sunday, and they're so goddamned arrogant and pompous about their football team that it makes me cheer against a group I would otherwise have no problem with), there are three TVs for seven games.  Cleveland is on, and Cleveland is the AAA affiliate for Sports Fans who come out in droves for their team.  New England is on as well, and the renaissance the Patriots franchise had two years ago with the Super Bowl win is enough to grant them a television.  And Pittsburgh got the last one, because Gus wanted to watch that game.      I don't know where this is going.  I wanted to write about the gut-wrenching effect a Chargers loss has, while a Padres loss stings as long as it takes to change the channel.  Both are much easier to deal with now than they used to...I'd sulk all evening back in Rogers when the Chargers lost.  And there was a stretch of Padres games this summer, while I was in California watching the games on television no less, where they lost back to back games in the ninth inning, both of which were shutouts to that point.    Almost wore my Doug Flutie jersey today, but decided I'd save it for the playoff run.  It might do better in storage.    Just for kicks, an article using the cyborg test in Blade Runner to see  if those in the San Francisco mayoral race are human or machine   (special thanks to Bryan Alexander) .

      I'm ashamed of myself, but I am bitter towards  urlLink CinemaTexas .  Lotto, Texas was not accepted into the film festival, and thus I want very little to do with the organization this year.  Last year I volunteered, driving filmmakers to and from the airport, selling tickets at venues, and doing other mechanical happenings that they needed accomplished.  It was kind of fun...probably the most poorly run film festival I've known, but the films were shown and people enjoyed them.    I watched a few as well.  And I wasn't at all impressed.  Yes, they were better than  urlLink Clubbing , but I'd expect anything shot by a UT student with a working knowledge of film production to wax the floor with my senior film created by a guy whose previous experience with film production was holding a camera.  The films were alright, but many of the messages weren't strong, and a lot of the sound was awful.   Of the films created in Zander's Digital Doc class last year, only  Hump  got the call by CT.  Hump's a fine film...the funniest of the group, and possibly the most polished.  There's a moment in the film that will fill the theatre with laughter.    But I'm jealous.  I really hope that this year CT shows much better films than they did last year, or I'll really wonder how Lotto, Texas didn't make the cut.  I haven't seen it since May, but looking back on what we ended up with, I don't think it sucked.

      Today, Andrew went to his first Graduate lecture.  Tripper went to his first UT lecture.  And I went to my first real lecture.    There were some great aspects of life at Centenary College, not the least of which were the relationships developed with students, faculty, and staff.  And a lot of that came from an environment of student/teacher cooperation, which is built from a low student to teacher ratio.  My largest class was probably my health class, which had maybe 30 people in it.  Every teacher knew my name, and most knew a lot more about me.  I took five classes from Jeff Hendricks, audited a sixth, and TAed two sections of Freshman Experience/English 101 for him.  After my Freshman year, getting to know a professor was not daunting; in fact, it was expected.    And I can't lie...this was not my first lecture.  I attended a lecture at the University of Arkansas circa March 1998, when I was visiting Matt Martin and Daniel Young...I went to Biology class with them, sat through the lecture, and even aced the pop quiz given at the end of class (on nothing more than the notes taken during class).  While the professor eyed me curiously, he never questioned my placement in his classroom.    Richard's lecture was exciting...he kept a room of 70+ interested for an hour, peppering the class with challenges, and throwing in humor more reminiscent of a comedian rather than a screenwriting professor.  I don't agree with some of his writing methods, but his structure has merit, and he seems like an engaging teacher who will support my methods in the discussion groups.    Back at JP's for office hours that no one is showing up to...it's to be expected, though.  Office hours give me a chance to work on my own projects, do some class grading, and write on the blog.  And the set time, written in a syllabus copied numerous times, makes me feel important.    I'm excited about the screenplay.  And that's important.  I spent a summer trying to get my past situated with my present, and for the most part it was an exceptional time.  But even with the healthy lifestyle, the inspiration, the reconciliation of several lost friendships, I entered this year unsure about my writing abilities.  I'm not a bad writer.  I'm probably a good writer, maybe even a very good writer.  I often enjoy my blogs.  But my honest portfolio doesn't exist...I've got a short film I would give to someone to produce, and I'm redrafting my only worthwile feature, which is currently on the DL while I work on this semester's soup.  But I love this semester's soup.  And I like my strategies.  And I like how I feel as I write it, and as I make a revelation for page 80 that hopefully will elicit the response that people create art for.    A cross between Katie and Jenie Garth is sitting 10 feet away, writing on her iBook and looking pretty sexy.  I always say that I really dig on brunettes, but looking over my last six years of dating, I can only put two brunettes on the list...the rest were blondes.  She looks over here a lot, stealing a glimpse while I write.  I steal a lot more glimpses.  But she walked in with a rather large, unkempt man that reminds me fully of a twentysomething Greg Simon (I hope the California crew still reads this blog...someone in the world better enjoy my Greg Simon reference).  And there was this odd hand on the back thing from him to her, and rubbing, and smiling...and every once in a while she will run over to where he is seated and look giddy, asking him to watch her belongings, or pointing out a phrase in a book.  She would be quite good at sex if she was with the right guy.  If he's the guy, I hope his unbridled state is not just in appearance.

      Good weekend of Padres baseball and Grand Theft Auto:  Vice City.  We beat the game, killing the turncoat Lance and slaughtering hundreds of police officers along the way.  While I am honestly not a great video gamer, I love the style of a game like GTA: Vice City, because it allows for game play well after the story line ends...creative play is encouraged by the set-up of the city and its surrounding areas.  Granted, your creativity is confined to ways of killing cops and others, but it is a functioning resource...its splendor is meant to last indefinitely.    My textbook shopping spree this semester was an exodus of joy, as I found $321 of books as priced at the UT Co-op for less than $150.  However, the greatest book buy of my life occured on Saturday at a Half-Price books in Houston.  As many on this board know, I am an avid supporter of Totem Press' INTRODUCING series.  To briefly explain, the INTRODUCING books (no link because Totem lacks a web presence) are graphic novels that deal with the basics of political movements, philosophies, philosophers, contemporary scientific boundaries, and questions of life.   urlLink Dr. Hendricks  introduced me to the books several years ago, and at the time I was awestruck by his collection of 12 books.  At Half-Price, I bought six books, bringing my total to 18.  Best yet, five of the books were $4.98, and one was $2.98!  Considering market value on these books is $12, I ran away with six books for less than three would cost me at B&N.    I've become the consummate bibliophile.    The barista at JP's Java could be the greatest jackass I've known.  Frazzled as I entered today, I asked for a Grande Mint Mocha.  He looked at me inquisitively.   Excuse me?  he asked.  I clarified...a decaf grande mint mocha.  He then looked through me.  What is that?  What is "grande"?   Realizing I was not at Starbucks, I quickly changed my order to a 16 ounce.  He acquiesed.  And I understand that he is proud of his small coffee shop, and that I am in a way insulting it because I am importing commercialized lingo upon his Keep Austin Weird establishment.  And I felt bad, because this isn't Starbucks, and much of the reason I sit here drinking coffee is because it isn't Starbucks.  So he rings me up.  The total is $3.99.  I give him my credit card.  He eyes it contemptuously.   There is a minimum charge of $4 for a credit purchase.   That's fine, I think, because I planned on tipping, and the tip will bump me that cent to $4, and much over.  Then he continues.   I'll do it this time, but I want you to know that the minimum charge is $4.     In Rogers, I was viewed as alternative.  I didn't dress to fit a role, nor did I associate myself with the preferred alternative media types (namely the music of Everclear), but I was one of the more alternative individuals, and this showed, as many in the alternative clique embraced me as friend.  Today, living in Austin, I am still alternative.  I dress the same, and while my musical tastes are much more open and, dare I say, better in taste, I don't display my choice of Sunny Day Real Estate and Yo La Tengo to the world.  I figure if you think I'm worth knowing, you'll figure it out.  Yet I remain bothered when I am treated like a simpleton preppie by the alternative establishment that I do my best to embrace, and stick up for on numerous occasions.  The last thing our movement needs is the elitist hierarchy that we are supposed to be fighting against.  So I called the drink a grande.  I didn't mean to.  Usually I am able to consciously stop myself from doing it, in fear of what happened earlier.  Why I live in fear of becoming passe at a local coffee joint is a problem in itself.  I stay at JP's because the coffee is great, a few workers here are really nice, and, more to the point, my office hours are here and it would be confusing to change them now.    The world embraces those who look similar.  Austin, a city whose history promotes its diversity, is worse about its discrimination than most cities I know, mainly because it presents itself as the emancipating Canaan, a place where all freaks can find refuge and feel comfortable in their uniqueness.  I've felt comfortable in Austin, but only in spots and moments.  Maybe I'm pining for a Slacker Austin, or the Austin where Robert Earl Keen and Lyle Lovett used to sit on the porch and play guitar in their underwear.  Or maybe I'm pining for the Rogers and Shreveport of memory, where there were so few of us that we were forced to get along out of companion necessity, and it created some of the richest, most meaningful relationships of my life.

      The primary theory that I guide my thoughts on the world on is Baudrillarian in nature.  If Baudrillarian, or Baudrillard, is a foreign name or concept to you, I demand that you pick up SIMULACRA ET SIMULATION from your local bookstore, by author Jean Baudrillard.  The most dense read that you'll ever take part in, no matter what your education level.  But a wonderful theorist who is shunned by just about everyone for his views on hyperreality, which is less of a theory and more of a truth in today's society.    Anyway, Baudrillard's work can't be boiled down, but here's the crux of many of his arguments:   It used to be that television was a mirror of society, that what appeared on screen was based on what was happening in the world.  But with the rise of the telecommunications industry, the importance that advertising and PR put on media, and the semblance of power aligning themselves as favorably with media as possible, the case now is that  society mirrors television .   Never easy to prove, as theories are theories and not facts...human insight isn't something that is easy to duplicate in a lab setting.  But as I drove Austin looking for used CD shops and/or used musical instrument arenas, 101X decided to play Spacehog's one hit, a name that I can't remember...but the chorus has the words  with lands so green, and skies so blue ...and that song always reminds me of high school in Rogers, AR.    Thing is, I can remember where that memory came from.  I was at home during Spring Break 1995, and MTV was doing a small bit about their past Spring Break excursions.  And the song they capped for Spring Break 1994 was Spacehog's.  And all the hardbodies were in their bikinis, waving at the camera, ready to do things that night that I didn't imagine people did.  And I wanted to be a part of it because things were happening there...that was the center of the universe, because it was on MTV and they were making such a grandiose deal about it, and friends of mine were talking about it, specifically Kyle McNitt (that Spacehog song is also the Kyle McNitt song, as he proposed to love it, and I never pegged Kyle as the alt rock type).  And whenever that song came on, I thought of how great Spring Break must have been in the Keys, or Cozumel, or wherever they were doing it this year.    And today, almost ten years removed from sitting on that old couch on New Hope Road, eating Mac Cheese and loathing in my home, the song just reminds me of Rogers, and how I did enjoy myself there.    But that's not really the point here.  The point is that MTV started doing Spring Break on location, to tepid response.  And then in 1995, they started airing all sorts of promos for their annual Spring Break somewhere else, and showing how great it was, and to a target audience too young and mostly too far to take part in any of it, they created our Fucking Disneyland.  And for us, when we got to that age, our desire was to be a part of it.    I've never done it.  Got friends who did.  They enjoyed it, kind of.  Not drunk enough to throw themselves at women with forceful words and hand-related gestures.  But it wasn't them.  And that bothered them...because from their perspective, it was supposed to be them.    A screenplay about a manwhore some day, maybe...manwhore of course just as terrible a word as metrosexual.  About A Boy did a good job of looking after it, but it was in a very friendly, warm way...I'm interested in the Day of Reckoning, when people have to wake up and realize who they are, what they've become, and how the fuck did it happen?    The song after Spacehog was Offspring's new one HIT THAT.  I'll admit right now, I'm a huge mark for Offspring.  Always have been.  Catchy vocals, great voice, good backbeat to it.

      At some point this afternoon, by some act of God that I can't remember, I came across the terrible knowledge that the original members of Duran Duran played a show in San Antonio tonight...their ONLY US tour date.  I saw DD three or four years ago, and left the concert feeling terrible about myself because I had booed the band for not playing my favorite song...about 500 of us stuck around and booed, for no reason other than it was such a great concert that needed to end with THE REFLEX, but for some reason Simon LeBon didn't want to play it, as evidenced by saying after the end of the second curtain call, "This is it.  Good night."    So I'm watching BANDS REUNITED, and looking online for every damn 80s new wave band that might play a show, big or small.  Here's the list, and what they're doing  DAVID BOWIE - tour on east coast come March DAVID BYRNE - All Europe ELVIS COSTELLO - As close as Nashville PETER GABRIEL - nothing (was in Chicago this summer) THE CURE - Indio in May PSYCHADELLIC FURS - Same LAURIE ANDERSON - Austin in October (fuck her for that) ECHO & THE BUNNYMEN - nada MOODY BLUES - lots of Europe BRIAN FERRY - Australlia SIOUXSIE AND THE BANSHEES - dick A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS - up in the air SUNNY DAY REAL ESTATE - band split. again.  I used to play the game WHICH 80S SEXPOT WOULD YOU SLEEP WITH TODAY?  The contestants were Pat Benetar, Debbie Harry, and Chrisssie Hines.  Most chose Benetar.  I think I'd have to add Terri Nunn of Berlin now.  And she'd be my winner.  Best live performance I ever saw was her redeux Berlin during the Culture Club CLUB SANDWICH tour.    I know I'm looking to find flyshit in pepper, because the glory of these old bands is that they don't play the cash cow like REO Speedwagon, who tours the geriatric circuit every summer.  Some of the folks put out new music, some are on solo careers, and some are broken up.  But reunification is what I'm looking for!    Went looking for drums again...because I've only got a few months here, I don't want to spend a lot.  I'm quite tempted to get the turntables and look at a life of mixing...so few things bring me more happiness than great synth 80s music.  Some of my fondest memories are driving US 80 from Mesquite to Terrell, reliving a weekend of paradise with Katie Carnahan, and listening to KDGE's RED SQUARE RETRO 80s dance party on my dilapadated car radio.  No commercials, little talking...just 80s glory.  The song that always stops life and brings me back to the days of life when I owned the world and nothing ever went wrong - The Smiths' HOW SOON IS NOW?  I always marked my progress by a confectionary on the north side of the road.  When I passed that, I knew I had six miles of unadulterated land and sky to visually enjoy as the car drove itself to Shreveport.

      Some cosmetic changes to the blog.  The links, of course, give you an idea of the media I indulge on a regular basis.  Best way to figure out what I'm thinking is to see what I'm seeing.  Or buy me coffee.    Caught up with Troy Gilbert today, a friend from high school I hadn't seen in about five years.  Interesting how the time can go.  I still see guys like Daniel Young, Daniel Harr, Daryl Burrows on a regular basis, yet I haven't seen Bennett Ryel in about six years, or CJ Davis in seven.  When I was in high school, they were two different groups that I hung out with on a regular basis...in my mind Soccer and Band...at that time, had you told me to pick a group of friends that I would keep in touch with for the duration, it would be hard for me to have given one of them up.    The person to blame is Jeff Barker.  Jeff was the head soccer coach at Rogers High, and he was trying to revitalize a soccer program that was previously strong and well-organized.  His brainchild was to limit the JV squad to juniors and below, effective my senior year.  As a erstwhile starter on JV who only really challenged for a varsity spot my sophomore year, there was no soccer for me my senior year, nor was there for Bennett, Mike Moffat, Todd Slagle, Luke Macken...all the guys.  We still hung out, but there wasn't the everyday get out of class and head to Todd's house to get ready for soccer, fitting several matches of Super BomberMan in before we were through.    Looking back over the history of the two groups, it is impressive that I am as close to even one of them as I am.  Both left high school with a strong contingent of members purusing college outside of Fayetteville.  The soccer guys only had Heath Kuzack and Troy hanging on in F-town, while the band guys had about half stay.  Conway, Jonesboro, Little Rock, Oklahoma City, Springfield MO were all home to my old friends, and I was in Shreveport.  We were all growing apart, but for that freshman year, we kept in great touch through emails and visits when possible...because we had to find solidarity in our vagabond natures.    Two years later, I was still in Shreveport.  But Bennett had gone from OKC to Conway, and then gone with Mike and Todd up to Fayetteville.  Daniel Harr was in Fayetteville, soon to be joined by Jerromy Falk.  The groups had packed back together, and were stronger now than they were before.  The emails stopped with both...I had quit writing Revelations of Rolin at that point (a bad move at the time for communicative puporses, a good move now because I don't have to look back and remember my shit writing), and was loving my program, my girlfriend, and my life in Louisiana.  The rare times I got back to Arkansas, I would get in cahootz with whoever I could (which caused strife with the band folks)...but as the years passed, the only people whose numbers I continued to have, and thus continued to see, and thus continued to grow with, were the band guys, which was wonderful.  But I completely fell off with the soccer guys, once seeing them my junior year for an hour (in a spirit of awkwardness, I spent more time talking to girlfriends I never knew than I did talking to old friends), and two hours of hucking disk in 2001 after I had graduated, only because Nick Dorothy had left a message at Doug Muir's house for frisbee, which was also Daryl Burrows' house.    And then Austin, and poverty.  And there were Centenary friends to try to keep in touch with now too...and I had just spent four years with them, so they had precedence...and the band guys were all still there, and so the soccer team, to take a phrase from my debate years, didn't cross the river on the flow sheet.    So now I see Troy, who is looking great and doing great, living in a kitsch house with the most energetic of wives, and vaguely wonder about things that aren't worth wondering about.  A whole festoon of stories from my past glory are revisitable, lost in the annals of time when I couldn't tell them for audience lack of knowledge of said characters, back to the forefront.    Maybe it's not Jeff Barker's fault.  Maybe I just went a different way.  Maybe we were 19, and we sat in a car one night looking for something to do, and the laughter subsided, and for the first time in our history, that silence of enveloping awkwardness permeated the car, and the smiles faded, and the anxiety piqued, and we thought, in our sage 19 year old minds, "I don't know these people anymore."  And we smiled when we arrived where we were going, shook hands that moved into man hugs, said we'd visit the next time we were in town, and were back to our current daily grinds once the car was out of neutral.  And now, one BA and three years later, we realize we lost touch with some pretty rock people.    ---  I want to send a soft caress and love letter to "kisses," my email signatury since 1998.  When I took the line from Steve "Stump"  Moffatt in 1998, after thoroughly enjoying his ironic punk rock music reviews ending with sweet nothings, I didn't know if people would accept it.  But it was heralded, and soon kisses and I were nary to be away from each other.  By 2000, it was second hat to quickly peck out a "kisses" on the line before my name, so much so that it wasn't a swan song for the correspondance, but it was now part of my name, part of who I was.    The loss of kisses was sudden.  Howard Dean's campaign was in shambles after the media maliciously maligned an inspirational yell at the end of a speech to the point that it was foo-foo fodder for every comedian and electronica musician in America.  And the media's perpetuation of the speech as "unpresidential" was taxing...George Bush can snort coke, fuck the environment, and lie to his constituents and be presidential, but an impassioed man cannot show his exebuerence?    So I threw Eric Carmen's  All By Myself  on the radio, lit some candles, cried a lot, and resigned myself to my fate.  I wrapped it in a warm coat, nuzzled it close, and sent Howard Dean "kisses."  May he see the truth as hard as steel between the velvet lies of my monogram.    I miss it.  Words can grow to be like your children.  But children grow up and get girls pregnant.  And I received fair compensation in trade.    Have a good week everyone!  yeeargh! Rolin

      In researching my  urlLink screenplay  this semester, I came across a great documentary called  urlLink Vote For Me:  Politics in America .  One of the vignettes in the documentary revolves around Maggie Lauterer, a community journalist in Asheville, NC who decided to run for congress.  She was the Mr. Smith Goes to Washington story full-on.    And she was hated by quite a few in the area, because she didn't know how politics worked.  She listened to people, she asked questions, she took criticism to heart.  And she was attacked mercilessly by Charles Taylor, her incumbent opponent.    Everyone talks about wanting a Mr. Smith...the local boy gone right, who will bring morals to politics.  But when they come out, they don't put on the pretty face that most politicians have lived their life building.    So when I read less than objective journalism like  urlLink this , that goes after Howard Dean's impassioned campaign speech in Iowa (which I thought was kind of fun), it baffles me.  Here's a guy who is not a career politician...who has never really run a tough campaign...he was a state senator, then lieutenant governor, and then he took the governor's seat when the actual governor died...from that point on, it was re-elections, and those weren't tough.  This is his first campaign...he's won by being himself...now he is losing because he's trying that.    People want honesty, but when they see it live, they get turned off from it...a guy shows passion, and he's lambasted by the media, neoconservative talk radio and "mainstream" media alike.  And we let Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity call the media "liberal."  When was the last time I saw an article from AP with an anti-Bush slant?  I can find one on Dean every day...usually a lot more than one.    Kucinich still gets my vote, but Dean is a close second, and moreso now that I see just how ridiculous the media is being regarding his campaign.  The guy is going to lose because he's being spun as a buffoon, when in fact he's more like the average layman than any other candidate.  And that's what everyone says they want in Washington.    ---  Breakfast with Kathy Fell and some other Centenary alums this morning.  I love getting up early and accomplishing things with my day.  And to hear some of the great stories people have about olden days at the 'nary...that school is home to some crazy things that are undocumented...just as every school is.    PROJECT IDEA - get 150 or 200 alums, and ask them for one of their favorite memories from Centenary.  Then take a picture of them from that point in time, as well as a picture now, and have kind of a positive coffee table book that is quite pertinent to Centenary College, but also just reminds people of what the college experience is.  Something I can work on over time.

      Once again, I am impressed and humbled by the readership of this blog.  I always equated the blog to my college radio show...if folks were listening, great, but I never really assumed they were.    The  urlLink docudrama  blog is going to get a facelift soon, but content should noticeably improve...if you are interested in my thesis topic.  Using it as a rah-rah for myself is pointless...let's see if this works better.  My Centenary story was running towards a mention of Dr. Alexander before class interrupted the bloggage.  So now it sounds like excessive pandering to mention him, but in my Centenary career, their greatest mistake was letting him go.  Centenary drove forward into the information age when Dr. Alexander was on faculty...students built websites en masse (my web presence is a byproduct of his reach), communication and BBS was introduced into curriculum, tenets of postmodernism that arrive with telecommunications resonated with students, and a more interdisciplinary approach was taken to the English major, a discipline that seemed archaic from the bios of many other Centenary faculty (not to disparage them...I loved my classes with Havird, Shelburne, Newtown, and Hendricks).    I understand that Centenary doesn't have the money to get into bidding wars for faculty, but when you luck into a faculty member who pushes the entire school towards the essence of a liberal arts education, and who resonates with students to a degree unprecedented, do your best to keep him.

      Hit Houston on Monday for a Centenary basketball game...Centenary was never a school where students would travel too far to see their games.  In 2000 the SGA bought 60 tickets for the Centenary/LSU game in Baton Rouge and gave them to students...I didn't get to go (as was the case with most of the SGA...a pretty selfless act for most everyone), but I heard it was a wonderful time.  Anyway, this was my chance to see the Gents in action, against a team they could quite possibly beat.    And they did.  It was ugly, but Centenary hung in there, and then started getting turnovers and free throws to fall, and they put the game away in the last few minutes.    Before the game, Bowden and I made a bet on how many people from Centenary that we recognized would be there.  The over/under was seven...he went under, I went over.  We entered the arena about 20 minutes prior to tipoff, and the place was dead...not a good sign.  But to the right of us about eight sections I spotted someone who looked vaguely familiar...someone I never really gave a shit about, but a Centenary student nevertheless.  And as the game progressed, more came, and then suddenly we saw a quite familiar face in the crowd, wearing his traditional blazer, sweater vest, and collared shirt.    Dr. Ken Schwab, president of Centenary College.    So Bowden and I went down, and ran into some of the other heads of state at the old 'nary...Gene Gregory, David Hennington, Kathy Fell...Fell actually will be in Austin on Thursday, and invited me to breakfast, a great gesture considering I spearheaded a rebellion to a move she had pursued for years at Centenary.  But we ended up getting along in the end, and while there will be some awkwardness at the breakfast, it's nice to feel important enough to get invites to those kinds of things.    It's tough for me to describe the Centenary experience without coming off as a brocheure or as a pretentious ass clown.  But at that school I wielded a lot of push...I wouldn't say power per se, but I got in a lot of groups, and students in those groups listened to me, so students outside of those groups listened to me as well, and so then faculty and staff were kind of obligated to listen to me also.  It was a great time, and taught me some wonderful lessons about power, corruption, and doing the right thing.  Centenary is a lot of the backbone to the script I'm writing.    Scott Greenwood, the former Dean of Students at Centenary, and I met up in North Carolina over the summer, grabbing lunch and having a talk about the past, present, and future.  On two occasions he mentioned that about 50 schools would be closing down in the next 10 years due to the economy and budget cuts in education.  "Centenary will not be one of those," he said, which was interesting because he said it...I never considered it would be one, but when he brought it up, it reminded me that Centenary is a small school that depends heavily on enrollment and that enrollment doing something, and recently it's hit hard times on enrollment, student output, keeping faculty, and staying with the ties.    The school thrives on lucking out.  For instance, I play the French Horn (should say played, but I want to pick it up again).  Centenary had a band, and a pretty poor one from reputation.  I didn't bother to contact the band when I applied...I just figured I'd try out, make it, and that would be that.  When I tried out, the band director asked if I'd be willing to switch to Trumpet...he had five french horns, and didn't really need another.  I said I'd rather not...I was a good horn player, and wanted to stick with it.  He let me, and within a month I was playing 1st Horn music, getting the solos, and carrying the section.  I was the best non-major musician in the band, and probably could have held my own with some of the majors.  I got a scholarship for music, and found my way into the orchestra, chamber winds, and brass quintent.  To me, it was just playing music.  But for Gail Odom and the music school, it was a pretty big gift...out of nowhere they got a major-caliber horn player for four years.    I've got to run to my first class of the semester...on the drive back from Houston, I was thinking about stories.  I love stories because they don't end...they just keep going on and on and on.  Yeah, an event ends, but then it parlays itself into something else.  I didn't end the April Landry story, or this odd non-sequiter on Centenary...I will wrap them up, but they don't end.

      Last night I ran into April Landry.  Well, I didn't...I ran into someone who bore a striking resemblence.  She was about the age that April was when I knew her, skin of the same color, breasts about the size one would expect after April had hers augumented last year, smile as enchanting, movements as bewildering.    I subscribe to the tenet that I will always think there is a chance with someone who I once had a chance with, and don't anymore.  Some will chalk it to the Woman Venus Men Mars bullshit...maybe, but I've got a mental fucking rolodex that reminds me of what girls were interested in me, and I can turn to the page, think about it, remember the cad-like innocence, and hope that something happens again.    I don't really know what happened with April Landry.  That's a lie, I know exactly what happened...the key word there is why...events happen, but reasons go unknown, so you facilitate a reason to fit your telling of the event, you come out as well as you can, and hopefully the other person isn't consulted on the matter for fear that your exaggerations aren't discovered.    I can't tell you when I met April, which is unusual for me...I try to stay keen on who I meet and when, and anyone that I'm interested in usually gets immediate date and time stamp.  So that my first memory of April comes two weeks into her Centenary career, well after I must have known her (you'll see why) is inquiring.  As is the fact that every girl I dated that school year falls under the same category...people who I don't remember an initial encounter with.    April was running for student council, an admirable feat.  I was throwing the meeting for candidates.  So we met there.  Except we had met before...I was the TA for her Rhetoric 101 class with Jeff Hendricks.  The class had met by this point, and we had started working on student websites.     And yes, I had already parused the class, looked over it for hotties that I could use my position over in order to make other positions possible.  No one really came to the forefront...an ex-girlfriend of Matthew Philbrook's was in the class, but she was looking less stellar than she had the year before, and a kind of slutty girl whose name elludes me was there too...starts with an R...I'll remember her for being an exceptional idiot.    April didn't stick the first day...odd, because I'll usually canvas a room, make a choice for the person I'll have interest in, and that's it for the semester.  No one new.  Maybe because I hadn't made a choice before April was the reason I could choose April.    But this is all hyperbole.  April got in contact with me before the candidate meeting...she needed help with her website, and wondered if I could help after the meeting.  And this was when I began to notice her.  She had put her hand on my wrist, just gently enough for me to feel the touch...she wasn't grabbing it, just touching it, reaching out to me, letting me know that she was there.  And I knew now.  And I smiled, and I walked down to my class, and I sat with 12 girls in my English Senior Seminar, and thought, "How'd I miss that one?"    Candidate meeting came with nothing of note for this story, and April and I moved into the SGA office, which was newly fashioned with a window in the doorway so people couldn't use the office for sexual escapades.  April sat in the swivel chair, and I sat in a more bulky chair.  And I was hot for her.  She smelled wonderful, was cuter than any girl I'd seen that day, had a set of dimples that could brighten my day every day no matter the day, and looked at me with bold, soft, inquisitive eyes.    I should have known right off that it wasn't about web stuff.  Hell, I did.  But I wasn't willing to tell myself that, which would be my greatest failing.  She was the smartest girl in the class...though I couldn't remember her body before this day, when she became fixed in the subconscious I remembered that she was the best student in there...and yes, it was easy to tell after one day.  She was here in the office with me, alone with me, looking for help with her webpage when she needed none of it.  At the time I told myself that she was just a good student utilizing her resources.    I approached it like a golf lesson...not because April needed to learn anything, but because I wanted to put my hand on her hand and move the mouse to its proper location.  And sweet Jesus, I sure did it!  We were creating a mark on a map of Louisiana to show her hometown...we got the map up in the right program, and she got the color she wanted, and I directed her hand to where she told me to, and softly I depressed my finger onto hers, and it clicked the left mouse button, and a dot of red outlined Berwick, Louisiana.    Nola Sieber walked in at this point.  I did not remove my hand...why would I; we were just working.  She smiled, a smile knowing and hiding things all at once, and left with a binder...I knew she would be back mere seconds after April left.    The key for me was to get April to stay as long as I could.  And it maybe lasted five more minutes...I asked a few questions about Berwick, why she came to Centenary...the standard.  I probably also told her a few things she could do with her website...trying to be the cool guy who knows a lot of shit but coming off as the schmuck who is weaving his web design game.  She smiled and got up, her arm rubbing against my back as she slid past the desk and to the doorway.  "See you in class,"  I said.  "See you later," she said.    April leaves.  Nola enters.  "That girl's got a crush on you," she said, barely able to keep her smile quiet enough not to alert April.  "She needed help with her website.  That's all," I said, smiling just as loud, knowing full well that I had a damn nice prospect here.    Things were great.  Except for the girlfriend of two years in Denton, the one who I loved more than I'd ever loved anyone else, but who I just hadn't had it for since we last said goodbye.  And that April was a student of mine.  And she had a boyfriend.  And reputations at Centenary are easy to come by and hard to lose.    ---  I'm going to tell the real April Landry story on this weblog...it'll take some time.  Don't know why...maybe I played a lot of grabass up there earlier...but it felt important as I wrote it.  It's not that the story people know isn't real...it is...but it's edited for viewer's approval, and to keep my person as true to his character as I try to make him.  Stories show many sides of character...some inspiring, some degrating, some wretched.  Tellings of events don't have heroes, because to have a hero means there must be a villain.    Whatever...the girl I saw yesterday wasn't April.  I knew that when I saw her, but after I met her and got past the initial push...yeah.  Even when she was spending her time with short-limbed frat nut Keith, I was still kind of interested.  Not in her.  In April.  A girl I haven't seen in two years, haven't really talked to in three, only had one night with but a lot of good conversations in there.    ---  I decided that this next semester will be a landmark.  It's my last one for a while...a while being maybe one year, maybe two years, maybe five or ten years, maybe ever.  So since I'll be quite different and a bit or much older when I return to student academics, I want to do some things I haven't done yet while in college.  But to be fair and accomodating, I will also do things that you guys didn't do in college, provided I haven't done them either, and the don't involve acts or positions that I have ruled out doing in my lifetime.    Comment your wishes, I'll perform.  For me, I've got this so far:  *A bender of more than three days (one of which including class) *Publishing an academic paper (yes, positive goals can be reached here) *Multiple sex partners (at once or over time...never gone the distance with more than one person a semester) *Do what I set out to do from the beginning

      Odd nostalgia tonight.  I spent a while going through the old blog, focusing on my summer writings, stuff I did at TIP...and I'm impressed with my abilities.  Maybe it's because the writing supplements the memories, or maybe it's because I've worked out a good casual rhetoric...but if I can do that, hopefully a screenplay isn't out of the mix.  Or a novel.    I've realized that sadness, longing, a lack of completeness and a knowledge of that is vital to good writing.  A writer needs emotion.  One of the things that saddened me the most on my trip to California was seeing that my dad wasn't living.  He was breathing, and he was drinking, but the life was void...the eyes sullen, with nothing to offer.  And it's easy to get into that mindset...life is tough, the easiest way to do something is the way that things are usually done, and for me to be successful I need to do more than is expected of me.  So I need to feel.  And if that means to walk down the olden days a while, I can do it.    But I think it means I'll give old Taylor a call.  I met Taylor at Tripper's benefit for his friend last month, and got her number...it was quite casual, and when I called her the first time she was still in Dallas.  I wasn't going to try again, but what'll it hurt if I come off as intense?  It's better than not coming off at all.    I'm not used to dating people that I don't know.  I've done it a bit out here in Austin, and I haven't been good at it yet.  I really mastered the Rogers High School/Centenary College style of relationship, where you get to know someone over time, learn their schedule not because you're a stalker but because it's public knowledge, hang out a bit and make the slow move.  Slow move doesn't work in Austin, because there's too much going on and you'll just get pushed out of the way.  It's a busy city, but a very lonely city if you don't make things happen.    I feel better about a lot of things than I have in a good while.  So it's time to just suck it up, make a few phone calls, get a few numbers, and hope that one of the calls turns into some good conversation over cafe au laits, a movie at my place, and several hours of hot necking that stop not because we had sex but because the sun came up.    It's going to take some time to get back into the blogging madness.  It's been a long time.  The practice is going to be good for me, but the entries will be weak for a while.  I haven't written in months.  I've gotten overly political.  I am going to spend a lot of time alone this semester.  Hopefully I'll spend a lot of time with people too.

      If you want me to vote for Wesley Clark, please tell me why I should.  The guy misses debates yet goes up in the polls...gets the best press of any Democratic candidate, is the most moderate of the candidates (even Lieberman shows his Democrat stripes on occasion), and seems to keep people happy by his Ivy-league education and General status.    If you didn't see the Iowa Black & Brown debate, too bad...some great stuff.  The cuts that the media showed of Al Sharpton and Howard Dean going at it are quite unfair...yeah, Sharpton got Dean there, but the specific mentioned was that Dean never had a minority on his cabinet...a six-seat group.  Not good, but not the atrocity Sharpton makes it sound.    Best speakers...Kucinich, Sharpton, Gephardt, Dean, Mosely-Braun...the other three somewhere in there.  Kerry and Edwards were really left out of this debate.  Mosely-Braun is a smart woman.    It pisses me off that no one will even give Kucinich a chance...he's immediately made fun of for his height, what looks like a toupee, his bachelor status...the guy has good ideas.  Cut Pentagon fat, repeal Bush tax cut, help schools, work on Social Security, and strive towards health care for all.  Foreign policy of diplomacy rather than bull-mongering is about all you need from me to get my vote this year, but Kucinich is a real liberal's liberal.  If Iowans listen to the debates, he might come in fourth or fifth...could be the groundswell he needs.

      Went and saw IN AMERICA today...much better than the Turkish film DISTANT I saw at the Palm Springs International Film Festival yesterday.  IN AMERICA was something I wanted to see when it was at the Austin Film Festival, but grabass ensued and I missed it.  Hit it today, and it's one of those films that just leaves you wanting to do good things with yourself.  That and BIG FISH are both great feel-good films from recently.    No sign of the father yet.  Not too upset about that.  A pretty basic vacation so far...noting too special.  Got a facial yesterday...before the jokes start up, I've got to say it was a glorious hour spent on my face.  And now someone can search this site with the phrase "spent on my face."

      Not a lot to say.  On vacation.  Relaxing.  Thinking a lot about the screenplay...and some other work.  Considering turning  Faith  into a novel...not bad to be multidimensional in my writing.  I mean, I've got a pedigree now...got to use the damn thing.  What good is an MA if I don't use it.    Community college teacher?  Journalist?  I don't know.  Was going to work on my resume tonight.  Didn't do it.  Probably should have.  Oopsie.

      Alright...now that this seems to be up and at 'em again...FUCKING HELL YES!  WOOOOOO!    Lots to update on...sorry about the failures of the other blog and LiveJournal...but my baby is back!  And hopefully I am too.    One more blog to update you on...because it's thesis time, I decided to give myself a journal for the thesis.     urlLink http://www.etaoinshrdlu.net/docudrama   Notes on what I'm doing, what I think I'm doing, maybe I'll even link some rough drafts up there...I'm not incredibly worried about this idea being stolen, as it's a bitch of a script and an idea, and I doubt any company would ever buy it.  But I'm not writing this one for a buyer...I'm writing this one for me to make.

      One of the hottest debates the SGA had during my tenure at Centenary revolved around a controversial program called SafePlace.  The program wasn't really controversial, actually -- the SGA would provide signs for faculty and staff interested, and those signs would designate their room a  safe place , or somewhere where no one would feel any sort of trepidation because of their lifestyle or beliefs.  The controversy was about the money somewhat, and the impact mostly.    The first naysayer was expected.  Carolyn Morris, a senator lucky to make her way back for her senior year, brought up the financing issue...we were going to pay $150 to get about 200 of these things printed.  A big printing cost.  She said she could go use her sorority's copier to do it for a lot cheaper.  Dawson Taylor, the SGA president who had relinqushed the chair to me for this debate, said he wanted it done right...often things get said and then never done, and if they budgeted for it, he would be sure to see it through.    It was the second person who surprised all of us.  Zach Vaughn, a proactive senior senator with a wife and child, who took an interest in politics in only his senior year, asked about effect.  Would this really make any sort of difference?  Shouldn't this money be allocated somewhere where it would make a difference, rather than for some posters that people won't notice.  He spoke well, and Dawson was too impassioned on this debate to offer more than zealous unrefined speech.    So Zach ended up with a few followers.  Leif Sherry, Matthew Philbrook, Justin Kirkes, Drew Sutton all fell in line...the SGA could do something great here...why spend the money on the posters when we could do something else.  Something far-reaching.  Posters was a waste of our time.  That, in conjunction with the more traditonal frat-minded senate members, made the vote a close call.  Quite a close call, actually.  Of the 20 senate members with voting rights (I, as acting president, was not voting), the vote was split 10-10.  Which meant that I would be the tiebreaker.  This was my third year on the senate, my first in an executive council position.  I was often the most prepared and the most well-spoken of the senators, but in the popularity contest that was SGA, my contributions were cheered but not remembered (whereas Danielle West sat on her ass and won the Bullet Award, but I digress).  What I prided myself on was voting what the students I represended thought (I never felt like I represented my grade...I instead felt like I represented the non-fratsters, non-athletes), and if it was an issue of value, I'd vote either by the rules dictated by the SGA, or if the rules didn't say whether the vote was germaine or not, I'd vote conscience.    This was a conscience pull...we were doing something for the students, there wouldn't be any protest or interest for that matter from the students...so it was up to me.  I was going to make this sink or swim.  Pass or play.  Man up or man overboard.    And I wanted to vote with Zach.    I liked the idea of making a difference, doing something great...promoting diversity, using educaiton, all the cliche bullshit that sounds incredible when you're 20 and haven't seen its failures yet.  We could do something more.  Why stop at posters?  What good had posters ever done.    But when it came to me, I quickly voted in favor of the resolution, and relinqushed the chair back to Dawson.    Many thought it was politics, especially after I told Leif and Zach over a few beers that I agreed with their point, yet voted otherwise.  I gave several reasons to them...first off, it was just $150...for all the money we had, to float it for this seemed quite worth it in relation to other expenditures.  Secondly, it was Dawson's pet project, and Dawson was kind of my boss.  The last thing I wanted to do was get on the wrong side of my boss with a convincing vote.    In the end, though, it wasn't about politics.  It wasn't about the money, and it wasn't about playing kissy face for the power god of Centenary's SGA.  It was about my ability to do more.  And I didn't have it.  With a bill passed, we had some posters, some signfiers to show support for tolerance and embracing diversity.  Maybe I wanted to do more, but in the end, was I really going to?  If this was what someone who was passionate about tolerance was pushing for, who was I to poo-poo his idea?    ---  And now we get to the present, and what will probably be the end of the Screenwriting MA Script Readings.  We don't get a lot of help from the department regarding our professional lives...at least we don't get as much as the MFA production kids do.  They get a Hollywood Showcase, and we don't.  And yes, we don't really have a medium for showing, but because the program does little to aid screenwriters in finding directors to shoot their work, we'd like something at the end of the day to walk home with.   The plan, as I blogged earlier, was to take our scripts, get some actors, and stage readings somewhere like The Hideout.  Do it over a couple of nights (playing one up as the main event), get some publicity, maybe get some industry folks there (probably not, but think big), and celebrate ourselves as writers, because chances are few if any of us will ever have a night like this again.    It was Denton's baby, but I became the spearhead on it, as I often do with things...not because I want a power trip, but because I take charge of dormant situations.  Denton wanted to do it, but I've led things like this before.  So we drafted up an idea of what we were going to do, and after several whittles and cuts of ideas, came up with giving everyone the opportunity to do this.  I sent out an email at the beginning of the week.  No comments until tonight, when Tripper brought up location and length...who pays for a rental of a location, and how do we make this prestigious if everyone gets to read?  Can we get audience for three nights?  The email wasn't accusatory, but did little other than question issues that are really unanswerable...he's right about his thoughts, but it's one way or the other, and no one is charging to do it the other way.  So I answered him back.  And then Andrew chimed in, and before I even opened the email, I fucking knew he was gonna shit on this, and he did, asking what the point of the whole thing was, and taking his script out of the running, which isn't a good thing suprisingly, because the domino effect could take hold...Tripper goes, then Debbie and TK, and it's me and the DH's rather than the department.    I understand that they want this thing to be good.  Fucking hell, I do too.  I want to make every motherfucker happy, give everyone a sense of accomplishment, and get everyone read to an audience.  Maybe reading Debbie's script gives it the life it needs, and someone hears it and really likes it.  Probably not, but hey, it's read, and she has the memory of when her script was performed.  Same for TK, me, everyone else.  Does it have to be for anything else?  It's a celebration.    It might not seem like a big deal, these emails and all, but it kind of is.  They're offering nothing, just questioning what is there.  I ask them  come up with something better , and they would not...they might think about it, but when it's go time they're not going to have done it.  And that's not saying anything against them...it's just how it is.  We've all been there.  But when I'm working my ass off to organize something that will benefit them, no matter the shape it is in, and they just question it, and the questions cannot be answered to satisfy everyone, and it delays the proceedings to the point where we have nothing...and then it doesn't happen.  And no one gets their shit read, and that's that.  Bureacracy at it's finest.

      I don't know if it's anything to get excited about, but I just picked up a pro bono gig writing movie reviews for  urlLink The Raw Story , a liberal alternative to the Drudge Report.  Impressed with the work Kimberly Jones does at the  urlLink Austin Chronicle , and understanding how hopelessly difficult it is to get into the business without having work of your own, starting out with a website that gets moderate traffic with designs on getting more sounds good.  It's ground floor initiative.

      No bitching this early morning!  Maybe it's the I LOVE THE 80s STRIKES BACK 1982 on right now, maybe it's the eight pages of screenplay I've written since Sunday, maybe it was the hour I spent at Gregory Gym tonight.    Well, it stems from the workout at Gregory...I always feel better after some stairmaster, some weights, and the longing for healthy food and water.  But the interest was moreso in campus than the gym per se.    I'd often find myself in the library at Centenary come midnight, somewhat because I'm a night owl, partly because I had friends who worked the night shift, but mostly because by that time, the campus was dead, and all that was left was the library.  My junior year was a bit different, but it revolved around Matthew Philbrook, Brian Thomas, and myself in the SUB playing Ms. Pac-Man or on Jones-Rice throwing the disc.  Regardless, if I wasn't around come midnight, nothing was going to happen...and even if I was there it was a small chance that I could get people to do anything with me.    And this was how I considered college to be for some odd reason...life would go on around campus (Joe's, Phillin Station, TKE House...all places I frequented), but the college was shut rather early.  Students just weren't as exciting as they had been portrayed in the movies.   Katie Carnahan hated this, and halfway through her freshman year decided she was going to transfer, even though she had me right there (I did get an extra semester out of her, which might not have been the best thing, but was still fun).  She wanted to tour Southwestern in Georgetown, and to do that she'd visit her friend Amy Cass at UT over our Spring Break...April 14, 1999.  I can remember it partially because it was the opening weekend of THE MATRIX, but mainly because when Katie and I turned off I-35 to MLK, went past Trinity and San Jacinto, mad the turn onto Whitis, and parked at Jester, my idea of college changed.    This was my first trip to Austin, and it meant nothing to me.  Up until Temple, where Katie got kind of rowdy in her dad's truck and decided to distract me as best she could (and she did a good job of it), I thought the most exciting part of the trip was going to be when I met her father, who I didn't meet, because he wanted to yell at her about me and the truck to Austin.  But that changed as Katie and I parked in the overflowing parking lot that was close to the size of Centenary (not so much), and, at 2:00 am, found about twenty guys playing field hockey on a FIELD HOCKEY FIELD outside of Jester.  It wasn't the makeshift shit course or something that we were always forced to use at Centenary...it was an honest Field Hockey field, part of a dormatory.    And we spent the weekend at UT, and it was pretty glorious, and I really thought UT was more like Disneyland than it was a college...you had all of Guadalupe and its consumerism greatness, four gyms, all sorts of shit just happening on campus...so sensory I was shocked anyone could get work done.    And now I'm a student here...I've been one almost two years.  But this could be the first night I've been here that I've been back at that Jester corner after midnight, and seen just all the shit still going down on campus...loud music playing, people throwing balls or discs or what have you, study groups starting, pizzas coming, dates going home, dates just getting started, conversations gaining steam, poker games letting out...the place was alive.  And it felt good, just to see it, to be reminded of how much energy there can be in a place.    My house shuts down after 10...Tripper's usually at Maggie's, and Evan's an old man.  Brian's moving across the street come Sunday, and Corey Pavletich will be here then too, so things should pick up...and I'm excited.  Because I'm tired of the day shutting down so early.  I don't wake up before 9, and I don't see a need to.  I want to be a part of it again...shit, I know I'm 24, and I'm six years invested in higher education.  But there's no reason I have to act like an old man.

      And today, my thoughts are different than they were yesterday.    Here's what I want to do -- I want to write.  I want to give myself the opportunity to make it as a writer.  I'm scared to hell that I'm not good enough, that sometimes I can make a spark when I bang the rocks together, but mostly it's inefficient use of my time, and I should take up finance or some shit.  But I need to give it a go, because I am close.  Two years in this program was invaluable...I know the craft, I can teach the craft, I've met a treasure trove of folks...  But landing a gig, getting a script optioned...not the cakewalk.  A lot of people say that the easy part is getting the agent, and after that the world of Hollywood swallows you whole and you beg that it spits out what's left so you can put that back together and have a semblance of happy life.    So I want to make films.  I'm excited as hell about making films.  But I really need to write films rather than do anything else.  I fuckered a good shot with Austin Meyers on making a film, but it turned from a fun job into a Hollywood venture that depressed me and led me to not answer his last 20 phone calls.  Nothing against Austin, who I really like as a person, but I wasn't excited about making the fourth installment of the film I had written.  He needed to get another writer on board.    And I don't want this blog to become a lamentation of the writer's life...that's just dull.  But there's not a whole lot else going on right now...I am career focused at this, the last semester of my time at UT.  Does it have to be that way?  Maybe.  I'd love for more to go on, but looking at it, my friends here are in the same boat, and my friends everywhere else are fully work-forced, for the most part...and they're not around me on a daily basis.  Which leaves me to look for all sorts of shit to take up my time...I'm getting a ton of writing done, but I'm playing the drums about an hour a day, and I'm buying a new tennis racket tomorrow...get some cardio going without driving to Gregory to wait for a stairmaster (though I miss weights and hot tubs).    So, in 2004, I've gotten two phone numbers.  These weren't numbers I asked for...they were just given to me.  I was out, doing whatever in both situations, when conversation with girls I found attractive started, and meandered, and after a while they had to leave, but this line was the same both times --    Hey, I've got to go, but I've really enjoyed talking to you.  Here's my number.  Call me and we'll continue this conversation.     Okay, I'm not in my best athletic shape today, but regardless, those numbers  were given to me without recourse .  I hadn't asked.  They were under no obligation.  They offered the information.  Sounds money to me.  Except  both times , I've called and gotten no answer, and left a message (nothing too long...I'm wordy but I'm not going to fuck around on an answering machine), and never got the call back.  And I'm honestly flummoxed.  I can't see how pedestrian phone messages would kill someone's want to call me back after  freely giving me a number .    When I first moved to Austin, I never took numbers, I only gave out mine.  If something was going to throw down, I was going to let them make the move...I'm good at calling back.  This worked in Shreveport rather well, but I pulled out a quick 0-3 in Austin, one of which really bothered me because it was a girl that I had an instant connection with and we spent a day together dicking around at Substitute Training, where she actually  held my hand  after lunch, finger lock and everything, and said she didn't think sub training would be any fun.    Gilbert Gottfried, I'm with you --  What The Fuck?   I quietly recovered with a few dates with a chick named Kat who moved to San Diego of all places, and it was fun but more because I was out than because of who I was out with.    So I'm bitching.  Wooooo!  Damn right.  Because I live in a city with 800,000 people, and I can't seem to get out of this dating funk.  This semester, there is no "the one girl" in my classes, because I've got ONE CLASS, and Debbie is taken.  Students?  I've gone down a similar road before...didn't end well.    In high school, my friends and I used to go to Wal-Mart and play  Get the most phone numbers .  The real race was always between myself and Daniel Harr, the self-proclaimed  ladies man  of this Rogers High School clique.  I can remember one time in particular, when there was so nothing to do in Rogers that night, and this was going to be our sweet redemption for life, and Daniel took an early lead, and all I could spot were people who I had no interest in grabbing numbers from, but if I was going to keep up in the game...  But then Andrea Green wandered to the photo lab to see Courtney Johnson (is that a real person?  I think so), and I pulled up, talked it out, and grabbed both numbers.  At the time, it was the most base reception of numbers...I was friends with both, this wasn't a booty call, just a way to win a game (later I'd find out that Andrea had a thing for me that I never went for, and maybe regretted just a little).  And Daniel had received four numbers, but the voters chose quality over quantity, and I was declared the big winner.  There was no thrusting onto shoulders and parading through electronics and sporting...just the acknowledgement and belittlement of Daniel Harr by the others in the group.  And I couldn't help but feel cheap...his numbers might not've stacked up, but he did the dirty work.  I played pussy foot.

      Just in case anyone asks over the next few months  What are you going to do after you graduate? , here's my answer as of today, which is different from any answer I posited before:  -  Work in the industry (development, PA work) -  Teach adjunct (if possible) -  Freelance (if possible)  It really looks like Los Angeles is going to be home come August.  No matter how unhappy that makes me, if I've got to invest in this area for a few years, there are worse things.    I have yet to really commit to this initiative of mine.  I need to do it...throw myself at film, and not turn back.  This is it right now.  Nothing else.  And if it doesn't happen, then we move to Plan B.

      Three days of Little City wore on me, so I'm at Mozart's, enjoying the hell out of this beautiful afternoon, and getting a smattering of work done in the meantime.  I've got to cut back on the coffee consumption, but...what are you going to do?  Driving over here, I realized that the sedentary lifestyle of the writer is a total detriment, because when I go to write, I often must have something with me to focus on when the ideas slow...internet, coffee, bagels, potato chips.  At least sitting out in what was once sun will help me lose the winter pale I took on after October.    Yeah, so I'm road tripping in a week or so.  I had the opportunity to Mardi Gras it this weekend, but a shitload of work to do kept me from it...granted, wherever I go I'm going to have to work, but at Mardi Gras I'd be relegated to a dirty hardwood floor in Matthew Philbrook's old Baton Rouge house, and then sitting to watch several ultimate frisbee matches for the weekend.  Love it, but not condusive to getting shit done.  And we probably would never hit New Orleans, which isn't so bad...to do Mardi Gras you've got to go with the right people and go at the right time.  Fat Tuesday is the right time.  Night of Bacchus is the right time.    I went five years ago...Sophomore year at the 'nary, with Chris LaBorde and Nick Pabst.  Fucking incredible, and ultimately depressing.  The trip started as a venture to Richardson with Katie, the second time I'd gone, and the first time we stayed up until dawn, making out on the couch in the living room, among other places.  It was Valentine's Day weekend, and I got her Mulan and something else...a lot of girl power stuff.  Up to that point, our relationship had been platonic due to a recent break-up of hers and her want for getover time.  It didn't make sense to me, because we were going out...I wasn't the guy pal who tagged along and loved the girl who doesn't love me...we were all about each other, stopping short of physical.  That Saturday was the end of platonism...and from there, we took the fuck off.    Anyway, this wasn't a memory of Katie, but of Mardi Gras.  And really of both, because Nick Pabst had invited Katie to Mardi Gras, which I wasn't really digging (maturity enables you to act in a similar fashion around buddies and girlfriends...at this time I lacked such maturity and initiative), but then realized how stupid an idea it was...stupid because taking a 19 year old girl to Mardi Gras for the first time requires a security team.  I uninvited her, which was cool with her, and after our venture in DFW, we headed to Houston to visit Beth, a girl Nick had pined for since high school, where he was the guy pal who tagged along and loved the girl who didn't love him.  She was cool, her roommate a precursor to many a sorority type I'd meet in Austin.    A dog on the deck above me just was just knocked from the table it was on by its owner, whose arm it was humping.    I don't really care about reliving Mardi Gras right here...I do wish I took more road trips such as that at this point in my life.  And as I sit, grading sitcoms, writing another step outline for Bob (the last one), and looping Baltimora's  Tarzan Boy , one of the great 80s new wave dance hits, I want to go somewhere new.  For a weekend.  Maybe a day or two longer.  Windows down, Baltimora on, books in tow.

      I don't have it tonight.  And I knew that from the get-go, when I left Little City with the first act of my step outline.  Thought I could grab dinner, head back, plug up, put the world aside and write...never happened.  And I knew it would be that way.  And there's nothing wrong with it...you have these nights sometimes, the nights where you've got the time, and you need to use it, and you sit, and you stare, and your mind doesn't clear, and your characters don't want to cooperate, and you wait until after midnight to check the new updates of your required reading of sites for the new day, nullifying your usual morning computer romp.  You turn yourself from the computer and to housecleaning issues -- pictures need to be put in order, notes from classes finally thrown away, beer bottles from a seven-page night taken to recycling...and as soon as you do it, you think, "No, can't start this...I'm supposed to be writing tonight."  And it's back to the chair, feet up on the desk, fingers on the home keys.  Stare.  Blank.    Is it obvious that I'm trying to manufacture it right now?  Sometimes you can do that...blog's a great tool for just letting the mind romp, the words come out, and as they hit the gate ready to proceed into immediacy, you give them different assignments, start to stylize, pick up beat patterns, motifs, allusions...the fingers dance on the page, you aren't even looking at the keyboard, just at the screen, but not reading the screen, because you already know what it says, what you're worried about is what comes five, six, fifteen words down the line, when you hit a stumbling point at a comma or a need for a semicolon or a new sentence or even a paragraph.  When it's going well, the paragraph isn't daunting, it's welcome...old thoughts pushed towards new subject matter, keeping the spirit alive and enticing the reader to continue the voyage through a written language that somehow transcends the character/eye specific relationship.    2:14.  The paragraph smote me.    I fucking love writing.  That might be why the past two Tuesdays have been so goddamned difficult.  Not because my thesis advisor is playing bad cop.  Not because the script's not ready.  But because, at the back of my mind, I wonder if I can be the person to get the script where it needs to be.  And not just the script, but any writing I've done in the past, or will do later.  I can create characters...I can provide sweeping themes...I can post conflict...I have a good stand on beat progressions and how certain words create certain rhythms...my grammar doesn't suck...but all that aside, and a few good drafts into the bag, can I provide life to the static page?    First semester here, Bob calls me into his office to talk script.  And he gets down and dirty about why he got into teaching --  I wasn't a bad writer, but I wasn't as good as I knew I needed to be.  I couldn't enjoy my writing because it wasn't what I demand from others.   He then told me that this isn't information he bandies about to everyone...he wanted me to listen.  And it stuck with me...Bob's not stupid, and Bob doesn't just say serious shit to make you shit 'em and realize you've got a lot of work to do.  But it's odd, because unlike anyone else in my program, Bob hand-picked me.  I didn't even apply for the MA Screenwriting gig; I applied for MFA Creative Writing, with a script rife with technical errors.  Bob saw it, liked the characters, enjoyed what story was there, and told me he wanted me in.  So here I am, two years later, with a script he can't stand, but that has gotten positive reviews from other sources.  Yet I see the holes Bob points out, and now I can't see anything else.  Denton once said that the last thing we can do as writers is doubt ourselves...when we start to do that, we lose all confidence and will never turn the corner from writing speculative works to selling scripts and getting hired onto jobs.  He might be right, but I doubt my abilities constantly.  At the same time, some days I throw bones down and love the hell out of what I see.  The test is to come back to it weeks later and feel the same way.  That happens much less frequently.  About 40 blog posts...maybe 50 total pages of script over my career.  That stuff is great, but it's such a small sample of what I've produced.    But if I've got that...  Even if it's such a small sample, doesn't it prove that I can do it?  The great conunudrum of authorship:  you see that you've done it before...you just can't do it right now.

      I've decided to post the first outline over at the docudrama website...since it's getting a dirty edit, I feel pretty good about getting this out for mass consumption.  I'm registering the script as well...picked up Final Draft 6, and registration through that is "quick and easy!"    I'm downright giddy about catching Errol Morris'  urlLink The Fog of War  on Friday at the Dobie.  I missed it at the Palm Springs Film Festival, passing on it to see a terrible Turkish film called  urlLink Distant  (IMDB published my review...not my best writing, but it's there), and regretted it from the moment.  Now, almost two months later, I hit sweet paydirt!    No times listed yet, and Dobie says it's not showing it, but on the  urlLink official site  (which is fucking awesome), it says Dobie &amp; Arbor.  Everyone's welcome...should be a big group of folks.  Hopefully more show to this than hit the Velveeta Room on Thursday.  Regarding Velveeta...I think a fairly substantial number of screenwriters are going to do a three minute set sometime before the end of the semester.  I scoped the place on Thursday, and was pretty impressed with some of the comics.  I did notice that the crowd wasn't too big into intellectual humor, so if I want to be a riot for my three minutes, I need to figure out a routine that is all about assholes.    Blog's suffering...Foshko's getting good writing out of me, but it's up to me to make sure that my spirit isn't broken.  Whereas grabass is usually a game I revel in, I feel unequivocally guilty about wasting time right now, considering I'm in danger of falling substantially behind on my thesis work.  Of course, if I can write a freakin treatment in three days, I can probably catch up on pages pretty quick-like.    Haircut tomorrow, and maybe a trip to the Circle C pool.  And drums.  I was going to hit Dallas on Friday for FOG OF WAR if it wasn't playing in Austin...that's devotion.  Oh yeah, and an outline on a screenplay.  And better blog entries.  And coffee.  Helping Brian with his resume.  Reading TV scripts from the students.  And for some reason, I'm craving a stairmaster right now.    The Seinfeld on right now is the one where George makes the pudding skin singles and tries to eat Pastrami during sex.  Glorious.

      Writing wasn't happening at the desk.  So I moved to the bed, flipped through some channels, found that  urlLink Pretty in Pink  was the TBS Dinner & A Movie (that started after 10...who knew?), watched it through the end (I can do that with  urlLink Shawshank Redemption  and any John Hughes film, no matter where I come in on it), and realized two hours later that I was still not working.  So now it's to the makeshift papazan (such egregious spelling), where I'll screw around at IMDB until I decide that early bed means drums tomorrow.    An ex girlfriend commented that she liked the old blog better.  I'm not sure what she meant...this is the old blog.  But looking through some of the recent posts, they do strike as illuminated pedestrian prose.  Nothing too exciting.  I chalk it to the movie writing...I focus on a script, and the blog becomes secondary when the pages are flowing.  While I want to write multiple works at a time and keep an intriguing blog, it might not be possible.  Or she's wrong.    Movies don't really address twentysomethings in any realistic manner.  You get things like COYOTE UGLY or 40 DAYS, where a hyperreal sexuality exists and every motherfucker is getting laid every night, because that's standard life outside college, yo.  But you don't get anything that makes a twentysomething have that deep stomach memory where the hairs stand on the forearms and you're ashamed that this is moving you even though you love the feeling, and all you can say is  Yeah, I remember that.   I kind of remember a night at 311 where I did some crazy dancing with most singles in the place while the 70s soul cover band threw out their KC & Sunshine Band bests, but it ended like most every other bar night I experience...walk out of the place, hike to the car, throw up the deuce, and head back to the place.  This night in particular I walked with a Debbie Harry lookalike, which longtime friends will know was a dream of mine, to sleep with Blondie, except this girl in particular started the night looking like the hip pop-punk 1970s Debbie Harry who nailed bandmates in the bathroom of CBGBs, and as the drinks progressed and the night grew on she aged into the present-day,  urlLink Six Ways to Sunday  Debbie Harry (btw, who knew that Debbie Harry is almost 60?)...and while I enjoyed their most recent album, the look isn't becoming for a 21 year old who I was later told has a penchant for the hourly rate room at the I-35 and Dean Keeton Days Inn.    Of course, I don't know if high school coming-of-age stories really address the honest situation of life as a teen.  I want to say it does, but I also romanticize my life to have some deeper meaning like I thought every John Hughes film had when I was 16 and made watching  urlLink St. Elmo's Fire  a requisite date.  A girl I worked with at Starbucks back in the day said that  Pretty in Pink  ruined her senior prom, for reasons she never divulged...so there is a connection, but how honest?  I never went to a party in high school that was anything like the Kelly LeBrock bash in  urlLink Weird Science  (the girlfriend mentioned earlier used to spell weird as  wierd , keeping with the  i before e  rule...actually, why is weird spelled like that?)...dances were kind of like the last one in  urlLink Footloose , but school was never as awe-inspiring as class and life seemed in  urlLink Fame .    Looks like I'm in the mood for parentheticals and links to 80s films.    I only think about this because while watching the film, Annie Potts line about wishing that you would start old and get younger...it resonated for the first time.  Great line in the middle of an otherwise throwaway scene.  I'm only 24, and I do understand how young that is, and I had one hell of a high school experience...but some nights I wish I could wake up in that captain's bed on 1104 W. New Hope, roll into the shower, drive the 1972 green Volvo stationwagon to the gravel parking lot, get out of class at noon, get on a school bus with the debate team, and head to Little Rock to argue with people and make fun of them once it was over...and then stay up all night first out in Little Rock and then pursuing every form of hotel hijinx possible in Arkansas.  Listening to Bennett Ryel turn mute the volume on the 700 Club and give Pat Robertson and his ladyfriends their own improv dialogue wouldn't hurt, either.    Of course, I couldn't wake up one morning and decide I was going to Corpus Christi for an afternoon of dirty Gulf swimming if I were back in HS.  You want to remember the good and forget that Mrs. Weeks taught the most god-awful Finite Math class in human history, that suffered the children an hour a day for 165 days.    Clare put a gallery of pics on her website...found one of me chatting up a few social workers in full Bob Harris garb.  Too bad I look like Alice Cooper.

      I am a creature that requires seven or more hours of sleep for most nights, but I still love being up and getting things done at hours I'm usually still in bed.  Today I was out of the house by 10:30...that sounds quite late, but I'm a guy who rarely goes to bed before 3 because I do most of my writing after 10pm.  But I was up grading papers and reading scripts come 11, and now, at 5pm, I've gotten all of my grading caught up, my script is in the hands it needs to be in, and I'm progressing readily on the job search.    So I can play with the drums for an hour tonight!  Job search stuffs...I need to work in the field, or something closely related.  It's not imperative that I live in LA and work in development...I don't want to do that, I hate LA and I am bothered by the pretention that is Hollywood filmmaking.  I'll need to dea with it at some point, but my hope is to do that as a writer rather than as an arm of the machine.  Anyway, that's why I'm looking at teaching jobs...get into academia, teach writing, and work on projects on the outside during the school year, and use my summers to film or pitch or do what I must do to be successful.  I love teaching, and it's what I want to do.  But I want to be a successful craftsman as well.  So any job in the field will do...whether it be as a PA on a film set, working as a reader in Hollywood, teaching writing, working in publishing, working in journalism, or even working with live theatre.  It's time to get the resume as broad as possible with festival-quality projects (screenplays and shot plays), and maybe progress to working on short fiction or stage plays.    Interesting thing about me...I have more energy when I have more to do.  I love to be busy.  I value my time so much more when I have things to do.  When I've got one thing on my pallate, I play grabass until it comes.  When I've got eight things, I have to schedule in my writing, and my writing becomes much better at that point.

      Drums arrived at 10 am.  That's why I'm up.    Finished my outline early Friday morning.  So I took the weekend off from writing.  An 18+page treatment in three days...about the equivalent of 12 pages of script a day.  Incredible progress.  We'll see how it's taken to.    I'd like to post it and other progress on the script on my other website, but copyright issues rear themselves...I'm looking at registering this script through WGA, and if I do that I think we're cool.

      Tsingtao #2 opened.  Bed's not coming for another hour.    I don't know.  The script's coming along...I hit the end of Act I on my outline, and I know what is going to happen next...but I just - can't - write - it - for - some - reason.  Evan was complaining about this in Math...he'll know the answer, know how to get there, and just doesn't have the fortitude to make it happen.  He thought it was a problem only genius recluses with a bend for the number  i  had.  But the Rumplestilsken whose currency is the trade of ideas, and who tries to spin the ideas into gold, it's the name of my life.    Writing's not hard.  It's not a hard life, I should say.  The process is a fucking bitch.    And this isn't meant to be a complaint session, as I love few things more than opening up the laptop and feeling the fingers go at 90+ words a minute, flying without me needing to look down at them...the aptitude counselor at Chaparral Elementary School told my parents to get me a computer when I was 7 or 8, because he said my mind moved so quickly that I couldn't keep up on paper, owing to my poor motor skills...a computer would allow me to work at a pace more condusive to my mental temprement.  And I love it.  Just opening the blog, I looked forward to writing it, because I would be writing...and the thing is, I'm writing right now...writing an outline for a script I've debated since before I left Centenary.    The job trade is starting to rear its ugly head.  And I don't want to talk about it.  How's that for telling?    I need a breakthrough on the script.  Had one last night, so I shouldn't try to dip in the celestial waters so often that their mystical abilties become the norm and I can't survive without drenching my manner in the pool.  But it'd be nice to have an outline by Friday, throw it to Bobby Fosh, and get writing again.    I wouldn't mind being in love again, either.

      Update on the  Video Killed The Radio Star  drama:  Looks like Bruce Woolley was a member of The Buggles, for a while at least.  According to several reviews on Amazon.com. Bruce wrote  Video  and  Clean, Clean , the two big Buggles hits (I bet none of you have ever heard Clean, Clean), with Buggles' frontman Trevor Horn in 1979.  Here's where it gets tricky, because there's no info on this as I can find yet, but there must be a split, because Bruce Woolley has his one hurrah with The Camera Club quite soon thereafter.  The Buggles also put out an album, albeit a bit later.  However, their hit played paramount, and I wonder how much of it had to do with a music video.  Bruce Woolley fell off the earth, and Trevor Horn is forever remembered as the perm-ridden, four-eyed bass player with the soothing voice for the dawn of music television.    More as I find out.

      Hotties in the MFA program and other writing endeavors on UT's campus.  Guess who'll be a more frequent visitor to Michner Center events?    Screenwriters are in the beginning stages of putting together staged readings of our screenplays...kind of a final hurrah for our two years in the program.  More as I know it, but if you're in Austin and you don't come, I already hate you.    I hate passive voice.

      For any music fan, one of the required facets of trivia knowledge is  What was the first video on MTV?   Answer's easy... Video Killed the Radio Star  by The Buggles.  While The Buggles did little afterwards, the song lives in history, often played at retro dances, and cooed over by erstwhile 80s fans.  Myself included.  I loved the hell out of that song as ealry as 1994...it was a bit of new wave, and was the beginning of the movement that I identify my musical tastes with.  As a young person wanting to establish myself on the alternative wavelength that I saw Megan Basco and Jessica Zeitler playing with, I used to closely analyze the song, and give my interpretations, as well as why it was such an obvious choice for first video (as opposed to a Rod Stewart song...little-known fact is that MTV had 57 "honest" music videos when they started, and 25 were by Rod Stewart).    All of that in mind, I went to Borders yesterday for some media shopping...they were having a 20% off sale for students, and I knew I could find something.  And I lucked out on a 40-song 80s New Wave compilation, with a number of songs I'd never heard of, and a number I had and didn't remember (The Outfield's VOICES OF BABYLON; Red Rockers' CHINA; Freur's DOOT DOOT; Eurogliders' HEAVEN).    But the one that stuck out was by Bruce Woolley & The Camera Club...VIDEO KILLED THE RADIO STAR.  I wondered why a New Wave comp with such alt songs would throw a cover on there, when the song being covered was the poster child for trendsetting.  So, with roommate Evan in tow, I threw the song in the CD player, looking over the liner notes.    Song comes on, and immediatley it's more peppy than The Buggles, starting with a alt-robotic homonym sing at the beginning just set to drums, and then the orchestra comes in.  First stanza is done just to synthesizer, with the lead singer putting zip into the song.  The thing was moving, and by the time they got to the chorus, I realized that I liked this version more than the original.    It's rare that I enjoy covers so much...Johnny Cash's HURT is definitely one, and the new Simply Red cover of I CAN'T GO FOR THAT is pretty good too (and Miles Davis totally rocked out on Cyndi Lauper's TIME AFTER TIME).  But this was catchy, edgy, and full of something that the first one lacked...something that I couldn't place.    But it meant something that a song that is considered by any musician to be movement-defining would have a better cover.  The liner notes looked to be little help until I spotted the date of release for Camera Club:  1979.  The Buggles' video was in 1981.  Now, quite often groups will get covered immediately after a song is put out there...After The Fire covered DER KOMMISAR six months after Falco sang the german rap, and LeAnn Rimes covered HOW DO I LIVE at just about the same time that the other chick sang it.    What it brings up are questions of ownership, of authenticity.  The Buggles made a video in 1980, that played in early 1981.  The Camera Club sang an incredible version of the song in 1979.  Why, if The Camera Club's cover was so catchy, did The Buggles (whose song was pretty hip too, don't get me wrong) get the video and the lifetime of credit?    Unless it wasn't The Camera Club that covered it.    I got online to search Bruce Woolley & The Camera Club, a daunting task, as there are no fan pages, and just some random links for vinyl and out-of-print wares for the band that gave synth pioneer Thomas Dolby his first break.    But that was enough information to get to the goods.  Dolby is a cult legend, for anyone from thirtysomething geeks to current club mixers.  Regardless of if you like SHE'S BLINDED ME WITH SCIENCE, his impact was created, built upon, and the science guy with glasses had a following.    And through a fan site, I found the truth...Dolby played with The Camera Club, and yes, The Camera Club was the band to write and record VIDEO KILLED THE RADIO STAR...which was soon thereafter covered by The Buggles, who found out about MTV and made a video that will be remembered for quite a long time.    And nothing against The Buggles for doing it...great job for a couple of old guys who never had a song come close to hitting after that.  But the trivia shouldn't start and stop where it does...you might miss out on the top version of the song.

       Scandinavian Documentary Project   Maureen sent out an email regarding grants and fellowships from the American-Scandinavian Foundation, a group interested in the cultural exchange between America and its Democratic Socialist friends from Northern Europe.    Most of Marueen's emails get a quick glance and delete click from me, and I can safely say that I pay more heed to her tidbits than the majority of RTFers.  Is she going to be in the office?  What is the status of the conference for people interested in the history of print newspapers in Belize?    But anything Scandinavian is different, at least for me.  I am Scandinavian, at least a quarter of me is.  I am a second-generation American on my dad's side...never did I feel the stressors of the immigrant life that Maxine Hong Kingston did in The Woman Warrior, but I do feel a certain debtage to that side of the world that was once home to forebears.  Email conjured interest, and when a cut, paste, and click brings up a website offering money to do projects in the area, it's worth attention.    Only I don't know anything about that side of the family.  Up until four years ago, I was under the impression that my lineage was Swedish...turns out it's Norwegian (and my dad, a first generation American, still says he's Swedish, even with irrefutable proof otherwise).  My dad's father and my grandmother were divorced in the early 1950s, and Al Moe Sr. married Elizabeth of Arizona, and they had a family that I had quite small contact with.  Al Moe Sr. died in the 60s.  Liz Moe died in 2001.  Virgina, my dad's mother, knows little about the Moe clan.  And my dad's reply to my questions:   They're all dead.     Except I can't believe it.  There've got to be people out there that I'm somewhat related to, in some sense or form.  I've got the original last name,  Kvemo , changed in 1903 on arrival to America for easier pronunciation.  I know the town, Slovobrisk, a border town in the northeast area of Norway, that legend has it was often traded between Sweden and Norway.   It's been 101 years since anyone from my family was there...40% of America's history passed in that span.  But it's just two generations for my family, and I honestly believe that if I set out for that town, I'll find family.    Recently, I've seen a number of self-reflexive documentaries, with the filmmaker as protagonist, allowing his or her story to become the story of the audience...yes, we might not be in Palestine, our jaw may not be broken from a hate crime, and our parents might not be putting vinyl siding on the house...but it resonates when it's done well, because the stories are all about things larger than the event on-screen.    My story is about the loss of culture, the loss of roots.  I have family in Arkansas who will stay in Arkansas.  I have a mother who was an army brat, and wants to move around.  I want to move too.  But I'd like to have a home.  And I don't feel like I do.  And society doesn't really seem to put too much stock in where I came from, but I think it's got to be damn important.  Add to that story a sense of tradition...my dad speaks highly of tradition, the lineage of the family name that he doesn't know.  I'm the last one, and the one before me is a drunken jackass.  It's not Whale Rider...but if there's a land to discover.    This could be all the mythical history that I expect of Norway.  Who says that there will be a wise old man from the village who can trace Norwegian lineage, and direct me to the doorstep of kin, who will welcome me with open arms into their home, and fashion a wood-carved bowl for my usage?    I think it would be fascinating...start with me in San Diego, trying to get what information I can out of my dad and grandmother.  They've got some papers of Al Sr's, a birth certificate, some citizenship stuff...just a taste, but enough to get started.  By sheer coincidence (the coincidence that documentary film thrives on), the woman next door to them is fluent in Norwegian, and she has done a bit of translating before...why not do it for the camera?  We then come back to Austin and find a translator to come with us (or we find the translator first).  Then it's on a plane to Norway, and trains from Oslo to the city.  And then we search.  Cold search.  Hit the hot spots, look for the town elders, find whatever information we can on the family.  It's great if we find people I am related to, but if not, we still make it into a film.    I was planning to go anyway.  Why not take a camera and try to create something larger than the trip?  Helps if I can get the money, though.

      Been at Seattle's Best since, shit, 3:45 or so.  One page to show for it, and a lot of emails written.  The bits of a crossword that won't be finished, half a cup of cold coffee water, and a RealOne playlist looped four times.    But quite a crowd:  1)  The father and son tandem sitting behind me, enjoying bagels with cream cheese and the newspaper.  At the counter, the barista handed the little boy his own bagel, and while dad paid for the wares, he did his darndest to unwrap it from its cellophane purgatory.  The bagel, freed from its prison by a toe-headed emancipator, immediately went for the escape, which consisted of a quick move from wrapping to the floor.    The boy fumbled for several moments to pick up his new friend, now in two segments.  Grabbed him, dusted him off, and was ready to eat.  Dad noticed, and didn't have any objections.  But the barista insisted on presenting the boy with a brand new bagel.    Now the boy is covered in more cream cheese than he's eaten, while dad looks over the New York Times.  I don't know if he's reading about Dennis Kucinich...but a Dennis Kucinich support group was here earlier...four people.  Yeah, I want to vote for the guy, but is the four-way campaign rally going to get him the nod in Texas?  Over hometown GW?    2)  The boyfriend and girlfriend at the far end, guy drinking a coke from Burger King, girl reading an old paperback.  I checked out her ass when she came in, and I don't blame myself for it...she's wearing ass-looking black pants.  She caught me, but decided to spend more time looking at me than the requisite  stare.  scorn.  look away.   I assumed interest, except I wasn't interested in the ass or the girl.  Then her boyfriend came in, and now he's playing snake on his phone while she works.  Earlier they were looking at each other.  And it's just a look, but no one looks at me like that these days.    3)  hottest.  girl.  ever.  I'm a sucker for wavy hair, and the Maura Wilbur look-alike across from me has me playing Queer Eye, wondering how she got her hair like that.  I'm not interested in my hair looking like that, I'm flummoxed by hers.  It's gorgeous.  And she's right across from me...all I must do is look above my laptop and there she is, looking at her iMac, with a colleague of pedestrian looks.  I think they're law students, or social workers.  I've got a shot with social workers, not with law students.  But the Sarah Plain & Tall is wearing scrubs???  Elven angel is wearing a v-neck red shirt, don't know the fabric because I don't know fabrics, but it's a stretchy shirt, and it's got a little give when worn on her, a good accentuator of her features, which I can't see a lot of because she's looking down at her computer.  Her nose is glorious though.  And how do you explain a nose?  She just started talking, right when a Peter Cetara song on the playlist started, a song that I could loop for an hour and enjoy.  Not the best voice ever...kind of Fran Drescher without the nasty Brooklyn accentuator.    This is the kind of girl that you'd walk right up to just to say  I think you're the most beautiful person I've ever seen , and then meekly remove yourself from consideration.  And I haven't ever done that.  Some day I will.  If pedestrian wasn't there, maybe.  Of course, I'd have another excuse at the ready were pedestrian not around.    ADDENDA - I remember a TV show about lovers in Paris, back 1994 or so.  My sister and I ridicule the show to this day for a terrible line at the end of the pilot, where the guy traces the girl's face with his finger, stopping above her lip.  kiss.  He looks at her intently --  you have a beautiful flume .  Awful line.  But a beautiful flume.

      I tell people a lot, and I've never minded.  I love stories, and why not share mine, even if I don't come off as well as I'd always like...part of the role of the entertainer is to entertain first and worry second.    But a hidden benefit to being a person with an open door policy is that you can keep a stash closed, a secret booty held close that no one is meant to see, and because everyone expects that you're sharing openly, they never ask about the other.  You live life asking questions rather than being asked...discourse is always on your terms.    I'm rewriting  Three Strikes  this semester, to help aide my somewhat weak creative portfolio, and in re-establishing the scene, I wrote this innocuous bit:   Blevins looks in the stands.  It?s a good crowd, about 2/3 full.  Kids with cotton candy, paying no heed to parental wishes.   No reason for it to register anything other than a visual of a youngster with a roll of fluffed sugar as big as their head, licking sticky fingers as parents maneuver to apply wet naps to the soiled places on the face.    But I'm immediately brought to a shiver, and a sense of responsibility that I never really wanted to face.  My innocence is stolen again, in a line that was designed to show the glory of innocence.    It was at least 10 years ago, but it's got to be 14, I'm sure.  The older you get, the less instant time seems, as you live with the current day you, and have to resort to the former yous when telling stories from those perspectives.  Yeah, I was in San Diego, so at the most I was 11.  I had found my way to the Safeway grocery store just a half mile or so from the house, buying a candy bar or a soda or a pint of ice cream...maybe I was buying batteries, because there's a story where I was swindled out of a dollar for batteries by a woman I recognized.    But that's not this story.  This story revolves around a father short on hair and patience, and his three year old daughter who bore a striking resemblence to my sister.  It was this that even got my attention...at 10 there's not a lot you pay attention to outside of yourself and candy.  I remember hearing stories about Marin's machinations when she was younger...how she wanted to run away, and how it worried my parents because she referred to herself as  Marin Alexis Moe County , and my parents imagined the adult finding Marin, flustered because a search through the phone book found no last names of County...  And I had no perspective of youthful exeuberence of my own, because I was me, and perspective is an ability lacking in the young, because perspective comes with distance, either in years or in persons.  So I just heard stories, and they resonated, and I imagined the girl with the box of cupcakes in front of me as the Marin of those stories, her own little actress playing her part in imagination.    Dad had groceries in his hand...fish, poultry, bread...I don't remember.  I do remember the girl following him obediently, except for the box of cupcakes she held extended from her body, a prize worth display for all.  Dad had asked her once to put them back, and he didn't want to do it again.  But he did.  There were lots of battles to be fought on his front, and his daughter's penchant for sugar wasn't one he had the energy or want to do now.  She wasn't getting the cupcakes, and he blindly hoped for acquiesence.      But she wasn't a cognizant tribesperson, understanding her father's troubles and the concept of giving one thing up to better later initiatives.  She was three.  And she did what a three year old who had found a six-pack of pink and yellow neon butter cream icing cupcakes would do--she kept them.   Because these were the ultimate cupcakes.  So powerful the look through plastic was that it converted her to consumer in seconds.  She could taste the icing, the sugar, the euphoria and smile that goes with the first, second, and every bite of a cupcake for inexplicable reasons.  It was real in her mind, and all she needed now was to put the real in her stomach.    In the end, it was the age that was her demise.  Still balancing the cupcakes in front of her, more delicately than a toddler ring bearer takes to his craft down the aisle, she manuevered behind him into the register line--past the chips, turn left, and make the slow arc towards the pay center.    Except she was three.  And she couldn't see in front of her for the cupcakes.  And lack of motor skill development combined with visual imparement meant disaster, disaster being a slight misstep.    To see it was not to notice a thing...girl walks, stumbles, and moves her hands towards her body in a reaction.  She never fell, she didn't miss another step.  She wasn't hurt, she didn't break anything.    But she did tip the cupcakes.    And the angelic pink and yellow neon butter cream icing cupcakes turned with her hands towards her body, except they weren't secure in their plastic, and they tumbled to the other side of the plastic, and the plastic bore the colorful consequence of youth.    She did something I never would have done...had I been in that situation, I would have turned and ran, cupcakes in hand, back to the bakery, where the cupcakes would be slid somewhere towards the back of the display, and I would return, wearing my guilt, to the line.  My mom would wonder what I did, but because the cupcakes were gone, she could turn her worry to the other stressors of her day.    No, she took responsibility immediately, an audacity for a three year old.  She tugged on dad's shirt.    At this point it might be important to point out the socioeconomics of the situation.  I lived in Rancho Bernardo, a semi-posh suburb of San Diego...no La Jolla, but a great place to live with a great school system.  We had a beautiful house, and a lot more money than I even imagined.  I didn't live with the knowledge of money, and money didn't really affect who I was...earlier in life we didn't have much, but at this point our family was relatively-well off.    And the father and daughter in front of me were poor, and to have realized it at that age solidifies the point tenfold.  Maybe that's why she reminded me of a young Marin, a Marin who lived her threes in Palm Springs, when my family had little financial wealth, and my mom was the high breadwinner.  She was there, wearing clothes a little too old and a little too outdated, even for a three year old.  Dad was poorly groomed, with poor stature and the stress of finding food overriding any created drama that affected most people at the Safeway.    Dad turned, first upset that she had kept the cupcakes.  Then he noticed the spill.  Annoyance turned to anger.  He tore the cupcakes from her small grasp, throwing them onto the conveyer.  "Well now we have to buy them," he said.    "But I don't want them now," she said.  It wasn't because they were ruined.    "That's too bad.  You are going to have to eat them now."  She mounted resistance, but her shame turned her cries soft.    The clerk waited impatiently for the father to stop admonishing his daughter.  When he turned to the clerk, he offered a small smile.  "Sorry," he said meekly.  He was in a lower place than she was, and his consumerism was a bother to her process.    All the while I stood behind, desparately wanting to step forward, tap the man on the shoulder, and tell him that I would buy the cupcakes.  I could eat them, that wasn't a problem.  Hell, I wanted some cupcakes.  Yes.  I really wanted cupcakes.  No, really.  It's no problem.  This works out all for the best.    But I couldn't.  Because it wasn't my place.  Or that's what I had been led to believe.  And maybe it wasn't.  Who is a 10 year old to step into the domestic dispute between a father and a child?    Yet of all the events in my 24 years, this one sticks with me to this day.  It's one that I hold closer than most every other, one that I never told a person...not parents, not family, not close friends, not girlfriends in a lamp-lit room in the early morning after a term of physical exposure that left us tired and nostalgic.  This was a story just for me.  Because in the end, I felt ashamed.  I felt like I was the one who spilled the cupcakes, and dad had to pay for it, and I knew that dad didn't have the money, but they were ruined, and someone had to pay, and now I was in trouble, but that wasn't the worst of it, because I had just made a bad situation worse, not for me, but just for.    They left that day, got into a beat-up blue Ford, and loudly thundered towards memory.  I bought whatever I bought, and consumed it as I walked home.  But I didn't enjoy it.  The cupcakes weren't transfixing anymore.

      Good news wagon!  I was recently hired by  urlLink Duke University's Talent Identification Program  to teach the Writer's Workshop at the University of Kansas this summer.  It is one of the more prestegious teaching positions within TIP, and to get it in my second year of work with the group is spectacular.  I get my own TA, my own classroom, my own syllabus, and the opportunity to again work with the smartest kids in the nation.    And the pay is incredible.

      It might be a long night tonight.    Very enjoyable Super Bowl.  Tripper and I both won $6 after all was said and done.  We decided this afternoon to place a bit of a bet on WSEX, the great online evil other than porn.  I felt really good about Carolina with a spread, considering their penchant for close games, their strong defense, and a league average New England offense.  But to place a bet online, I'd have to pony $300 to start an account, well more than I wanted to pay.    So the Tripster, well versed in picking Arkansas-Pine Bluff to round out a five team parlay, decided it'd be a good idea for us to pool our resources to make a few bets.  I threw him $75, and he matched it, and we placed some monies down.  The roundup:  $80 on Carolina (+7) to win $70 $12 on Steve Smith to catch a pass over 21.5 yards to win $10 $13 on Stephen Davis to rush for more than 72.5 yards to win $10 $30 on John Kasay to score more than 7.5 points to win $39 $20 parlay on Carolina to win straight up AND the combined score to be over 38 to win $100  Davis was out of the running pretty quick, but the over bet looked good most of the afternoon.  And then Carolina made a game out of it, and took a lead and then the big tie with a minute left (btw, terrible timeout call by Carolina when they had 1st and 10 at the 15 with 1:40 left...let the clock run, the last thing you need is time when you've got four plays and three timeouts to get it in the end zone...take the 40 off the clock, call your timeout then, and that gives you the last possession of the game).  And what looked really good at that point was the Carolina staple of overtime followed by a Kasay field goal to win...we'd win the $100 bet, as well as the $40 for Kasay...mix that with previous winnings, and we'd have $100 each.  But Kasay had his worst kickoff. ever, and I'm settling with a few extra bucks of spending cash.    And now I write, a few more episodes of WEST WING under my belt, listening to some sappy inspirational music that I keep in check for a while, mostly synth.  It always is.    I find myself less willing to take the shit most people throw at me about 80s music.  Tastes and preferences, yes.  But the constant berating of all facets of the decade is no longer going to be met with passive aggression.  Last night I got into it with Brian Thomas for only the second time in my life, specifically because he took a few shots at 80s music.  We were listening to Siouxsie and the Banshees, a great goth meets new wave band of the 1980s, one of the pioneers of the last 20 years of college rock.  The band I played before that, Alan Parsons Project, had been a disappointment, and the past hour had been a bash-fest on the 1980s, so I said, "You might not like this sound, but you've got to appriciate it."  Brian made some side comment about it sucking, met with laughter by the table.  So I got out the big gun, saying, "Not everyone likes two guys dicking around on acoustic guitars for 20 minutes."    Brian paused for a moment.  Probably longer.  "I love that comment," he said, in his "I know more than you" attitude, "because when people say it, it shows that they're not really listening to it."  Now, looking back on the battle, I can see his fallacy here...regardless of whether I'm listening to it or not, his comment on the 80s shows his lack of attention to Siouxsie.  But I missed that inroad.  And the commentary stopped, we took a break, and I took it up outside with him.    Here's where it got me - I said something about acoustical guitar, a misstatement I often make, don't know why but I do call it acoustical rather than acoustic.  And he called me on it, for no reason other than to be a dick...it had nothing to do with the argument I was making, but he needed to point it out to weaken my position.  Then he took a few specifics and showed my lack of understanding in them (quite in the same vein of the Christian Coalition), never bothering to listen to my contention:  that the world of music doesn't start and stop with jam bands.    When it comes down to it, I don't like jam bands.  Nothing against them, I just don't enjoy it, which is odd, because I love the hell out of jazz.  I don't like the sound of the acoustic guitar.  Twangy.  And not just bluegrass...acoustic rock is the same way.  Give me something smooth...a synthesizer, a piano, a trumpet...that's what I dig on.  And I've listened to quite a bit of jam rock in my life...living with Brian for a year gave me more than enough...and they do their thing, and that's great, and it's just not my thing.  And it has nothing to do with feeling music, because I've played more music than Brian has, and probably more than most people, and I get into it, and I feel it, and it moves me, and it changes the performance.  I don't jam though...that might be it.  I never had an instrument where you'd just sit and fiddle...there was always somewhere to go, and you loved the journey.    I probably put him on the defensive with my guys dicking around comment.  But he threw me there a lot earlier.  I don't know...synth/new wave is a strong part of who I am, no matter what I say...happiness can be achieved by the right obscure 80s song...and I'm tired of having people shit on the genre because Kenny Loggins had some hit songs.  And I so rarely get mad, and I so rarely hold a grudge.

      Turned in pages yesterday, so I decided to take today off.  Slept way in, started the day with a bottle of Shiner, and am getting a massage in 11 minutes from University Health Services.  $24 for 30 minutes...great price, and not from some student.    Walked into Jester for the first time in five years today...actually, it's almost five years to the day, as I was in Jester on April 3 and 4, 1999 with Katie Carnahan.  The student store is closing, and there's a sushi bar now, but it's still got what every college dies to have -- vibrance.  Professors walking around drinking Starbucks, freshman hitting on girls way out of their league, grad students huddled together around pillars for wireless internet.  I grabbed a small notebook for film ideas and a bottled water, making extended eyes with Sarah, the hot cashier.  Bryan was the open cashier, though, and he filled my order, taking several minutes to grab himself a bag of chips while I waited.

      I need to make a list of good films I've seen this year...there've been quite a few of them.  Not just films that were enjoyable but forgotten a few hours after viewing...shit that sticks with me right now, as I write, well distanced from the initial viewing. It's obvious that  urlLink Lost in Translation  is one...but I'd need to throw Charlie Kaufman's new offering  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  up for nomination as well.  Because of the star power and chic status of writer Kaufman, I'm sure it's got a full run at most theatres...and it's so worth the go.  Granted, you won't get to hear ELO's Mr. Blue Sky in the film, but everything about the story is wonderful, how it wraps together quicly, and plot progressions that most writers would stretch into two hours happen in ten minutes, allowing the story to move places that we can't keep up with, and we find ourselves at the end of the movie wanting something to happen, not knowing if it will.    Still thinking about it today, two days later.   Ordinary People  could fit that monicker too.  And somehow, I just deleted a full paragraph of writing.  Not going to rewrite it.    I'll be to page 60 of the Dawson Taylor script tonight.  Good progress. This is the calling card, the thing I expect to speak for me as I test my sea legs on the scriptwriting waters.    Current mode on life after college...summer job at UKansas, then who knows?  If no work, probably a month or six weeks in Fayetteville, trying to pick up part-time work in film or some semblance of media (nothing against those people in Fayetteville, but my grad degree in film should give me a leg to stand on in the area, and maybe I can pursue some grantage for this script), and if I can't find full-time work there, I do the same thing in Palm Springs.  No reason to pay rent anywhere yet if I'm not working somewhere.  I don't plan to live full-time in either place, but why not try my options and do a bit of travel in the interim?    Going back on past writings pre-blog, I was big on "quoting" things that I wanted emphasized, as if my reading audience wouldn't understand my stressors without the visual reminder.  I "apologize" for my presumptive nature.

      I don't remember when I bought the Pat Benetar CD...it was really close to Centenary graduation, maybe a month before...picked up from the Warehouse Music, a Blockbuster-owned overpriced music store that ran all but one used CD shop out of Shreveport before collapsing under its Roman pomp.  It was 8.99, one of the pricey ones, but Pat was always a favorite, a sexy beast of a female rocker with pop and edge, and someone I fully regretted not seeing in concert for free when I lived in Dallas in 2000.    What I do remember is the drive to Fayetteville the week after graduation, taking US-71 and the DeQueen/Mena route, and coming up over the last hill before city splendor, and how I tried to time it perfectly so when I hit the crest of the hill, Pat's SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT would go from a capella echo to manufactured hard-side love song electric guitar.  There were 17 seconds between the start of the song and the accompaniment intro, so I had the time to hit back on the player to hit it perfectly.  I even slowed my approach for dramatic effect and sequence.  But no matter what I tried, I wasn't able to hit it, and Pat was well into wailing by the time free nature ended and Fayetteville (no more beautiful from any other angle) began.    I listened to the song half a dozen more times between there and Ben &amp; Matt's duplex.  I even drove the block once just to finish the song before stopping  to meet up with my old friends.   Days earlier I had left Shreveport for the first time on an adventure to Austin Texas to find my fortune and my bohemian roots, to write and live the lavish life of the tortured yet brilliant artist.  And without any regality, without any manufactured consent, I arced over I-49 and descended onto the dreams and wonder of I-20 to Baltimora's TARZAN BOY, right at the first entrance of the chorus (whoa-wa-whoahhh-wa-whoa-wa-whoa-wa-whoa-waaa-whoa-ooh-aah), it's progressive drum beat and catchy melodies thrusting me from the cocoon of private school into a world of great opportunity, starting with a city I fell in love with the first time it welcomed me.  So it made sense that I could do the same thing with Pat in Fayetteville.  The plan was to hit Fayetteville, canoe with the old gang, and make my way up to New York City, where I'd spend a day or two with Centenary folks who were on module, lap up the world around me, and head back to Austin when I was damn well ready.  Fayetteville was the beginning of the trip, but almost the end of the journey...no longer would I come back as the student returning home for a break, only to go back to school later (though graduate school would put an * on all thoughts of "Real World").  Would've been nice to have a closer here.

      Proof that I've always been an intellectual -        Yesterday I had a conversation with Kristian Mead about exes, and she was amazed that I not only remembered first and last names, but could give some insight into their current lives...how could I remember that?  Easy...girlfriends are pretty straightforward to remember.  The true test of my memory is that I remember what happened to that Yuban can there in the picture.  This picture was taken when I was in Kindergarten, so I was four or five here.  The Yuban can was transformed into structure for a bust of Brother Bear from the Berenstein Bears, which my mom created minutes before school started, dismantling mine because mine sucked, and she was so proud of it that she made me bring it home and it actually moved with us from San Diego to Arkansas.    Picture courtesy of Colin Young, where San Diego is representing and Starbucks is still loathing.

      Fantasy Draft #1 - Padres Fanstop NL Only League  1.  Sammy Sosa 2.  John Smoltz 3.  Kevin Milwood 4.  Jim Edmonds 5.  Luis Castillo 6.  Carlos Zambrano 7.  Geoff Jenkins 8.  Vincente Padilla 9.  AJ Pierzynski 10.  Shea Hillenbrand 11.  Edgardo Alfonso 12.  Jeff Weaver 13.  John Thompson 14.  Hee Sop Choi 15.  Dave Roberts 16.  Tom Glavine 17.  Chris Reitsma 18.  Rod Beck 19.  Juan Castro 20.  Mike Redmond 21.  Rey Ordonez  Of course, I am very pleased with how things turned out...but that's how drafts always end up.  Some great initial picks (Sosa, Millwood, Smoltz, Edmonds), a few guys of good value who dropped (Hillenbrand, Padilla, Choi, Thompson), and a few real sleepers that I stole and could have boom or bust years (Alfonso, Roberts, Glavine, Beck).  I mean, Glavine is the #1 pitcher on the New York Mets, and I got him at 16th round.  In an NL-Only League!  Best pick of the draft...and not too far behind is Rod Beck in 18th round...granted, he's out until May, but he'll give me 30 holds when he gets back, and I'm deep enough to withstand.    Rey Ordonez doesn't play for anyone right now.  I had the last pick in the draft.  Nostalgia purposes.    Screenwriting draft on Wednesday.  Lots of beer and ridicule.

      Doesn't matter if I wanted to go to Lafayette or not...my car isn't up for the trip.  Need a brake job.  Probably could have done it without one, but the gurgle my car emits when I press on the brakes every time it rains isn't jolly, especially with a rainy weekend forecast.  Car goes in at 1pm tomorrow.  It's my car's first big sleepover at a mechanic, I hope it doesn't get lonely.    So a weekend of NCAA in Austin, where I hopefully get the work done that I would have lamented whilst in Lafayette.  There was a Los Lonely Boys call for a PA on a video shoot, which would have been righteous, but because of thought of going to a wedding, I passed on it.  If it doesn't rain, I think I'll go float a river...rent a kayak and hit it in the morning.    Waking up kind of early in the morning...was up at 9:30 today, which doesn't sound like much, except I haven't been up this early for no reason in quite a while.  Getting clothes washed, CDs burned, basketball watched.    When did this blog become  this is what I did today... ?  Maybe it's because my creativity is based in the screenplay, which is kicking ass right now, and I'm so focused on using stories there that when something comes up for the blog, I let it go and open up Final Draft instead.

      Bit of lag in the blog...a weekend of SXSW, and then a early-week trip to the seafaring town of Matagorda Bay, where internet is as common as beach hotties.  A lot of sun, a lot of jumping in the water, and a great appriciation for alone time.  I don't mind roommates at all, but the five-way decision process and subsequent grabass that accompanies renting a beach house from a jackass named Bob helps to establish how great it is to set your own schedule.    I wonder if I really am older, or if I've always been this way.  I was the first one in the water each day, and often the last one to want to stop the beach games and funsies had.  But I found myself increasingly annoyed with the younger member of the group's antics.  Much of it reminded me of a band trip to Mountain Home I took in January 1997, where Bonnie and I got into it quite a bit because she decided she wanted to call me an asshole and just go after me without provocation.  Only difference is that she was 15 at the time, and I was a 17 year old full of jealous rage.  Here I'm 24 and have no connection to this chick, except she's dating one of my best friends.  But I tired of the bullshit quickly.    And I'm supposed to go to Lafayette tomorrow to see the Rubel/Broussard wedding, a wedding of two people I enjoyed in college, and it should be a good Centenary reunion, and one I should probably hit, considering I don't know how often I will be in the south again come August.  But a lot of me is trying to figure out how I can get out of it.  I've got work to do...papers to grade and a screenplay to write.  I don't want to divulge 12 hours of car time for 24 hours of time in Lafayette.  And I wasn't invited to the wedding, which isn't such a big deal considering how these joint Centenary matches work (the more the merrier), but I still feel obligated to go now that I'm supposedly the driver for Corey and Bryce.  They can take Corey's truck, which would work, and I'd get my time here.  But I wouldn't do shit with it except play grabass and get a little bit of work done.    I don't know where the bitching is coming from.  Had a great morning, got some good sleep (though cats seem to enjoy late-night coitus outside my room), and had a nice walk from my old neighborhood to JP's Java, where I got some good writing done and am back on track for Act II of my screenplay.  The writing feels good...I'd lie to say I wasn't worried about the future and how I'm going to make money and where I'm going to live, but it honestly shouldn't matter as long as I keep writing.  The trip to Matagorda gave me more ideas than I've had in ages...right now I've got four feature script ideas kicking, several shorts I had forgotten that I'd like to revisit, and four documentaries I'd love to shoot.  I'm 24...this is a process.  Get some work done, write some treatments, and try to get some grant money maybe.    The weather is great.  Warm.  I should be outside.  I think I will be, actually.

      I don't remember what I did for Spring Break last year.  It took a visit to the blog to see that I must not have done anything, save a weekend up in Dallas.  Which wasn't a bad weekend, by any means...and the Wednesday after all of that I went with Dan Young and BLThomas to Corpus.  But shit, when will I get a Spring Break again?  No clue.  So I need to do something.  Current plan is to hit Matagorda Bay on Monday and Tuesday, getting some sun and waves in...then either go to Little Rock or Lafayette for the following weekend.  There's a pretty big Centenary wedding in Lafayette on the 20th, and while I wasn't invited, it's one of those things that you're expected to go to even if the invitation isn't extended, and I'd make a big splash as these were good friends who I haven't spoken with in ages.  But the thought of hitting the Rock and chilling with two of my best friends is pretty lucrative as well.  I can't do both.  I've considered buying a digital camera and just driving Texas also...but that's something I should do once my thesis is turned in.  May 7 for that...six weeks.  I'm not fucked.  Yet.    SXSW is here, and I'm big on some of the films.  Paul Stekler's LAST MAN STANDING (not yet on IMDB) is premiering on Sunday...I have a free ticket for later in the month, but this is one worth seeing twice, as it's basically the film I'm writing this semester.  Also, I've got a chance to see the Oliver North campaign documentary A PERFECT CANDIDATE (too lazy to IMDB link) tonight, which I will take, even if it means I've got to sit with Harry Knowles.    A guy is walking past the Little City window with a 24oz Coors Original.  Not yet opened.  Soon to be, I'd assume.    When I directed the scene from ANTIGONE for Buseick's Directing II, I was really big on the idea of the media infiltrating everyday life.  I remember that we read about some director who shot Hamlet like a documentary, and at the end the calvalry comes in to see the total carnage reaped, and how having a camera there made the feel very different from when they just did it on stage.  So I did the death sentence scene for Antigone, with Dawson Taylor playing Kreon, and got Zach Mort and Luke McClung to work as cameramen around the scene.  The cameras weren't on (that would've been ripe awesome, to put their feed through to a big screen), but at the end, after Kreon sentences Antigone, Luke followed the proceedings.  Kreon was left by himself to think about how he had just sentenced his own blood to death, but he wasn't alone, because Zach Mort had the camera right in his face.  The idea of privacy was completely lost, and even though this guy was a true villain, we couldn't feel but sorry for him because he couldn't even think without being captured on film.    This is all non-sequiter on the page.  Who said that blogs must be linear?

      I wanted to talk about politics and bitching and how the process infuriates me, and how the drama of the situation needs to infiltrate into my script (which is a slower process than writing, suprisingly), but two drafts of needless rant and bitching about people bitching went nowhere.    So instead, faithful readers, here is my first published SHOT IN THE DARK!   You:  Brown hair, green shirt, reading Coetzee at Little City 3/3.  Me:  brown hair, blue shirt behind you in line.  Loved Disgrace, lost my courage.  Got it back now.   I hate the last line, but I only had 30 words to work with, and I hit 29.  Ending with  coffee  seemed worse at the time, but now it sounds like I have courage because I put a damn Shot in the Dark out there.  Courage would have been walking up to her at the time.    Whatever.  I've wanted to do this for a while now...finally did it!  WOOT!    Syllabus for my class at UKansas is written, and what the hell, here's the reading list:  1)   urlLink Woe is I:  A Grammarphobe's Guide to Better English in Plain English  - Patricia O'Conner 2)   urlLink The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock  - T.S. Elliot 3)  Various poems by  urlLink Langston Hughes ,  urlLink Leonard Cohen ,  urlLink Gertrude Stein  and  urlLink Charles Bukowski  4)   urlLink Hills Like White Elephants  - Ernest Hemingway (yes, it is a poem about abortion, and somehow, this is the only story that I am keeping from last year's reading list) 5)   urlLink The Life &amp; Times of Michael K  - J.M. Coetzee 6)   urlLink Taming of the Shrew  - William Shakespeare 7)   urlLink Ten Things I Hate About You  - Dir. Gil Junger 8)   urlLink Picasso at the Lapin Agile  - Steve Martin 9)   urlLink An Officer & A Gentleman  - Dir. Taylor Hackford 10)  urlLink Lost in Translation  - Dir. Sofia Coppola  Complaints -   *My list is kind of white.  Elliot, Hemingway, Shakespeare...all standard.  Granted, these are works of theirs that won't be read before they start AP English or more likely college, but it's a bit ethnocentric (thus the additions of Langston Hughes, JM Coetzee, and Sofia Coppola) *I would have substituted Fugard's MASTER HAROLD AND THE BOYS, or August Wilson's FENCES as the non-Shakespeare play, but there were no comidies other than Taming of the Shrew, and since it's Shakespeare, it's likely that much of the funny will be missed.  Everything else is drama.   *One world author in Coetzee, and he's white and went to school in Texas.  Granted, he writes about a black man in post-apartheid Africa, but it's a concern.    It's funny that Michael Savage and David Horowitz bemoan the liberal bias in schools...here I am trying to diversify my curriculum, and I'm as liberal as they come.  I chose five poets of different cultures and times that aren't dry and boring (Elliot is modernism, Stein is the first poststructuralist woman poet really, Hughes is Harlem Renaissance, Cohen is beat, and Bukowski is, well, Bukowski...the poet most of them emulate without knowing it), the most prolific writer of the 20th Century, probably the most decorated author of the past 20 years (Coetzee), Shakespeare, one of the great comedians of the last 20 years, the film that exemplifies traditional structure beyond any other, and the film that exemplifies structure yet somehow subverts it all (Lost in Translation).  My book is a grammar book that is very easy and enjoyable to read.  I wonder what choices they would make.  Probably JULIUS CAESAR, which has more sexuality than most Shakespeare, but somehow they don't expect kids to see homoeroticism.

      Someone explain this to me --   I got pulled over in Oklahoma over Christmas for going 66 in a 55, even though I was really in a 65.  Cop said to protest the ticket, so I did.  It was thrown out, but I received a deferred sentence.  I pay the ticket, everything's taken care of.  Except today I received word that my license is suspended because I didn't pay the ticket.  And they want me to send in $50 EVEN IF I SHOW THEM THAT I PAID THE TICKET.    Fuck Oklahoma.

      Both  urlLink The Barbarian Invasions  and  urlLink Lost in Translation  point out my inefficiencies as a writer.  They're character driven stories that touch so much more than a simple plot, subplot, and cliche theme.    In fact, Barbarian Invasions includes an overtly cliche moment near the end, where the daughter mentions that the first man in a woman's life is her father.  The line sounds like it belonged to Kelli Kopowski rather than the sexy nautalist wearing the stocking cap and enjoying the hell out of life on the high seas in Denys Arcand's incredible realization of preparing for death and life in the interim.    The awareness of weakness in writing would have scared the shit out of me only five years ago.  It actually was a little more than five years ago when I first felt the intrinsic rush of the creative writer.  I sat at my desk area under my lofted bed (it was the greatest work space I ever designed in a room, and am determined to see something similar through when I move into my next adventuresome place), got out the simplest of Bic pens, and wrote  Lighting  (on my other computer...I'll throw it online, how about that).  It was my first poem, the first time that I didn't feel like writing a poem was a trite realization of blackness and hollow feelings.  And it just caught the fuck on, and the class loved it, and people who read it seemed to find what I wanted in it...and there was immediate euphoria.  I was tops in Centenary's creative writing class for Fall 1998...the world was next!    But the memory of my true realization as a writer came that December, or maybe late November, as I sat on the stage in the band shell and wrote  The Last Temptation by Christ , my ode to salvation.  It was a cloudy day, one of the first honestly cold and damp days of the semester.  Most everyone was inside.  But around 4pm or so, there was a break in the rain, the breeze stopped, and it was passably pleasant outside.  And I took my notebook, sat on the shell, and wrote for 45 minutes, just working my ass off to get the stanzas to work in my anapestic pentameter.  It wasn't just pouring thoughts onto a page and center justifying them to give it the faux meaning of 17 year olds who read ee cummings.  It was work.  Every word meant something.  A filler word, an errant syllable, and the poem was ruined.    The poem I turned into Dr. Havird for my final project wasn't any good, and I knew that.  But it moved in the right direction...the work was there, I had poured effort into it, and while to rewrite it correctly would require a complete overhaul, it was a moment of recognition that I understood how people do not just sit down and type out greatness, but greatness is realized, and the work is turning the words into the ubiquitous realization.    So I loved  Barbarian Invasions .  And it made me feel utterly insignificant as a writer.  And I love the feeling.

      Girl is an indie chick...green goodwill shirt, hipster pants, several kitsch piercings, and a novel in hand...Booker Prize winning DISGRACE, by JM Coetzee.  Boy looks hip, good hair day, but has students at office hours, giving him less time to be spontaneous and more time to dwell on hottie taking World Lit notes on one of boy's favorite authors.  Student leaves.  Boy makes move.  Boy loses courage in transit.    Boy at same coffee shop the next day.  Boy wants a second chance.  Boy has courage now.  Girl doesn't seem to realize this.

      I'm up, and somewhat productive.  Led a grad student caucus for a faculty candidate today, and will probably continue to do this every Tuesday for the next month.  I could do with waking up early, though I got to campus late and will pay for parking for the first time in my Austin career (for being at school...I'm a whore for covered parking downtown).    Corey Pavletich, an old Centenary friend, moved across the street yesterday, and at a time I should have been in bed catching up on the sleep and getting ready for today, he and I were drinking beers at the Showdown with Brian Thomas.  Good times to just sit around and remember a ton of people who never flood through my mind at this point, but who were integral parts of it just three years ago.   Walking home last night, I decided to cut through the alley that runs behind my house...I've never gone back there as no garage relates to it, and it's just kind of there for other folks who rent out back rooms in their homes.  And passing a dilapadated old house with a sketchy wooden staircase leading to the garage apartment, I thought of Tripper's friend Rob, a guy I grabbed beers with about a dozen times last year, and who I've only seen once this year, for maybe five minutes at Tripper's benefit for Andy.  I always liked Rob...we watched Oakland and San Diego at his place last year, smoked a few bowls, drank a few beers, ate some Mr. Gatti's pizza...real good guy with a few problems, but one of those folks you just enjoy going out with.  But living with the Tripster has killed the number of things we go and do out (we used to probably grab beers or something twice a month, now it's never), and that's shut me from Rob.  And as I passed the house, which required the trasversion of the largest of water puddles, I thought about those people in life who I never really got to know, but really wish I had.    And whenever you think about that, you wonder if anyone feels that way about you...who is sitting on a subway, or working in an office building, or eating a hot dog in a municipal park, and sees something out of the corner of their eye that somehow evokes a memory of me, and they think  I wish I'd known Rolin more.   Not better as much as more...you get better with more often.    This is an interesting point in life...Danny Ruiz and I would belittle one of the weaker lines in Kushner's  Angels in America , look at each other, and in a great Emily Vise impression, throw out  Threshold of revelation? But it's kind of true.  Leaving Centenary was more of a struggle than it was a vindication...I was terrified of it, and figured tough love and a cold move to Austin was what I needed.  It worked out for the best, but it was never really the discovery that I wanted it to be...the second time around in Austin was a lot better.  But now, three months away, I'm a lot smarter to the world, and while the fear of poverty and the fear of staying off the career track scares me (much like a well-timed religious politimercial can make me momentarily question if my beliefs are wrong), it's less fear and more excitement.  Of course, it's easy to pine for something when your current life is cake and you aren't working 40 hours of cripe a week.

      Not a good time to hit depression about my abilities as a writer.  DUE FRIDAY - 12 NOON - AS MUCH OF A SECOND DRAFT AS I HAVE  DUE FRIDAY - THESIS.  FINISHED.    But here I am, a golf match scheduled tomorrow morning, that I should be sleeping for.  I should have worked on DAWSON IN 96! (working title) a lot earlier today.  Office hours end, and I transition to Dawson.  Easy enough.  Except I ran into Javier today, good old Javier from the MFA program.  I will say nothing bad about Javier's work, of which I am only briefly acquainted, because I don't feel like getting into a pissing contest.    Javier wanted scripts.  I sent him a couple.  Two months ago.  No word back from him on it...not a problem, this is how the business works.  I had pretty much forgotten about them, though I will say that I was excited that someone was reading my work.  Excited that someone who made films was reading my work.    When sexy neighbor lady doesn't leave a note on my windshield, I understand that she wasn't interested.  No matter how much I do not want to accept it, it's the name of the game.  She didn't have it for me.  And it sucked for a bit.  And every once in a while, I'll walk out to my car, and be mistaken that there is something on my car, and hope for just a second that this was all a game of possum.  Until I see it is nothing more than reflection, and I do suck for leaving her several notes.    When Javier doesn't email me back about my scripts, I don't think there is something wrong.  He mentioned he'd get to them in 10 days.  Then he said a month.  Then he said when he had time.  And that was fair.  It's a busy time for everyone.    So I see J-daddy today at Little City during a bevy of student work.  He's there with Richard Lewis, and some other film folks, none of whom throw a wave my way, but that's okay, because I'm with students and we're talking script and film and stuff...it's my office hours.  Anyway, Javy starts to leave as I'm still there, so I decide to stop by and let him know that I've got another short film in the works, and it's something more palatable for production, as it's got more traditional avenues of drama (no armpit farts, no threesomes with dead people in a french new wave style).    As I tell Javier I've got something else, he does nothing but look at me impatiently.  "Oh," he says to my news.  "Well, I'm always interested in reading work, I guess," he says, in words that rang hollow to me at first, but as I look back, smell of bellicose pretentiousness.  And while I didn't see that at first, it was obvious his excitement towards my work was waning.  I asked if he had read my work, and he forced a meager smile, a kid with his hand caught in the cookie jar.  He had read it.  And he hadn't enjoyed it.  He wouldn't tell me why.  Actually, he left right then...he was too happy to get out of the situation.  It left me with saying, "I wear big boy pants.  I can handle criticism."    I do wear big boy pants.  And I can handle criticism.  I see my weaknesses as a writer pretty vividly.  But this one stings more than most.  Maybe it's because I looked at Javier as my only UT option to get work produced...and production here was one of the selling points of the program.  Maybe I'm stressed over thesis and shit.  Maybe I have a soft skin on this stuff, and can't handle criticism.  Maybe I'm scared that I can't do this as a career.  That I lack the talent to play at the next level.  That I lack the it.    The weed-out process of life is interesting, no doubt.  Rogers High School, I was the creative writer.  I was the guy folks went to when they wanted something written.  Centenary, there was a little more competition, but I still ended up on top of the mountain.  UT is different, though I'm in the top tier of writers in the MA program.    But, as I often say to family who coo my accomplishments, what good is being good in Austin if I'm not good enough for the big screen?  This isn't a fishing contest for "you're a good writer" comments.  I don't care.  I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I was good.  I'm just curious...

      In regards to my mission to rate the bathrooms at the University of Texas, some advice from Dan Wearsch, a Rogers High School alumnus whose knowledge in this matter is biblical.    --  You should know that there are well established criteria for evaluating restrooms as outlined by myself and Young in our year rooming together in Fayetteville.  The rating is from 1 to 5 and is based on the following:   Cleanliness Comfort Acoustics Power Flush *Foot Traffic* (Rolin's addition) General Impression   All ratings should be completed using the handicapped stall.  If there is no handicapped stall, a perfect 5 is not possible.   In general, a rating is established by rating each criteria and taking the average.  However, the system is meant to be more subjective.  Ultimately, it is up to the reviewer to decide the weight of each criteria.  For example, if a bathroom is a 4 in Cleanliness, Comfort and Acoustics, but a 1 in Power flush, the average would result in a score of 3 (all decimals are dropped).  The reviewer could make a judgment call and still award a 4 to the bathroom in question.   The general impression category is used for other items not included in the other criteria.  Some things falling under this category include: Urinal Mints (quality, aroma), Auto Flush/Sink/Hand Dryers (a complete absence of paper towels combined with a weak hand dryer is a definite negative), Lighting (too bright or too dark are both negative), etc.   This should provide a good backbone for any bathroom related research to be completed.  Any questions can be directed to myself or Dr. Young.  (that's Doctor of Commodology)   Note: The only perfect 5 to date is the Fourth floor of the Biochemistry Research Building at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.  A facility so nice, it was worth walking from Pomfret just to take a dump.   Any perfect 5 must be confirmed by myself or Daniel to be legitimate.   Thank you for your attention, Dr. Dan Wearsch, C.D.

      Blogger's been weird this Sunday, requiring me to delay the poast of loathe.    I'm eating spicy vegetarian chili, topped with lots of cheese, avocado, and english muffin.  Evan's a decent cook, though he goes a bit nuts on adding a bushel of jalapenos to the brewing chili, rather than to taste for specific preference.    I wanted draft two of the thesis done tonight.  That goal will need to wait for tomorrow.    Last night, caught  urlLink The United States of Leland , a pedestrian offering by Trigger Street, the Kevin Spacey production company that is attempting to redefine screenwriting (and not doing too much with it, but that's understandable).  I'd be a terrible person to take to a film on an early date, because I go into all films in analysis mode, and only rarely does the film knock me out and draw me into the story.    Then the neighbors were throwing a party, which is cool, as I like the neighbors, and liked one in particular, but we watched a movie on Wednesday and it looks like that will be it for us, which is kind of too bad, because she's cool, sexy, and likes documentary film, and it takes very little on top of that for me to devise attraction.  I think neighbor lady is attracted to me; fact, I know it, but a note writing campaign on my part to get on the ballot seems to have scared off the prospective candidate.     Rolin fact - I like writing notes.  I write long notes.  I will write longer notes to you than you will write to me.  It means little outside of the fact that I like writing notes.  It does mean that I like you.  If that's too much to handle, a guy liking you, maybe we should tap.   But she's cool, and her roommate with boyfriend is rad, so we chatted for an hour and drank from the Shiner Blonde keg (never done the Shiner B, but it worked for working).  We ended up grabbing Corey from across the street, and I found myself talking to a girl whose first name starts with an A (Amy?), who had a firm handshake and a boyfriend.  Well, I thought she had a boyfriend, as she was kind of attached to this guy when I walked up to the keg.  Soon she was just talking to me, and quite vociferously...at first afraid to touch my arm when I said something that excited her (trepiditous as she raises her hand to lower onto mine, then realizing "I don't know you/home dude I came with is looking at us), but slowly that ended.  She was also an ear talker; it wasn't the loudest of parties, but she found it necessary to speak into my ear...maybe I've got a good ear.    The conversation stops and starts several times due to bathroom breaks, interruptions, phone calls to hear neighbor with boyfriend's cell ring of Wham!'s  Careless Whisper , and to be honest, I didn't like the idea of having this stellar, intense conversation with a girl who was obviously into me, but I thought obviously with a boyfriend.    Denton, Evan, and Corey were indecisive in support.  All three agreed that the game was mad money, but weren't sure of her single status.  It seemed contrary to original introduction, but hey, she was the one putting the smack down, what reason did I have to think she had a beau other than five minutes of idle standing next to a guy.    Conversation continued.  Moreso than before.  She was very excited about grad school and screenwriting, a sign I should have noticed early, as I've found no luck with girls who are turned on by my status as a writer.  She really wanted to read my work...and then she talked about drama and singing and operas she liked...all the while, calling me dude and nervously playing with the hem of her skirt.    She was a proficient weed-smoker.    At some point, about 90 minutes into our triumverate of conversations, I was trying to feel out something about her connection to the party.  I had forgotten about early stand next to guy, as she hadn't looked at him ONCE since she had seen me.  Neighbor I had/have a thing for was throwing the party for the UT Madrigals, a dinner theatre (yes) group on campus that has never done The Greater Tuna (as I found out on that fateful Wednesday...maybe mentioning Greater Tuna was enough to lose me any stock I had developed earlier).  Since sexy nervous talkative into me pot smoking girl was a singer at Texas Tech who loved opera, maybe she was in this dinner theatre.  But she was friendly with neighbor with boyfriend, so I just asked what her affiliation with the party was...at the most, a subconscious way to find out if she was boyfriendly with stand next to guy.    She sighed.  Looked down, the first loss of eye contact with my face or ear in 90 minutes.  "Well...um...I kind of came with (insert guy's name here...I honestly don't remember...I was well on inebriation road)...and I know Katie."    And I didn't think anything of it.  Really.  Because she wasn't looking at him, she wasn't talking to him, and this was way too close to be with a random guy from a party that you don't know many people other than your boyfriend at.  Conversation continued, hitting George Bush, my thesis (which she loved the idea of...she was a fan of most what I pitched, making the fatalist ending of the night that much more succinct), and political documentary.  Then she had to pee.   I'll be right back.   Denton wanted to leave...he didn't know folks, he was drunk, there wasn't any weed going around.  at this point.  But he saw my success and commented on it, mentioning what the idea was with stand next to guy.  So we asked around, and found out that she was dating him.  I made a quick exit to my house for 10 minutes to kill conversation, got back, and didn't say another word to her.    But that wouldn't be the truth.  She was talking to stand next to guy now, standing like she had before.  I ended up talking about Wham! with neighbor with boyfriend, who didn't believe that  Careless Whisper  was a Wham! song, thinking it was only George Michael (because it's on his Greatest Hits).  I wanted to prove her wrong, and was given permission to find the information on the internet in her room.    Enterance into her room interrupted a conversation between sexy nervous talkative into me pot smoking girl and stand next to guy, where I heard girl say, "I don't think I did anything wrong!" and guy say, "Well then why do I feel bad?"    I was the wrong guy to interrupt.  But she demanded that I share their bowl.    HONESTY NOTE THAT I MIGHT REGRET LATER - When I first came to grad school, I volunteered with CinemaTexas, meeting a sexy little blond named Dana (or she reminded me of Dana...whatever), who was dating a guy with a fish handshake and cool hair who was also working with CT.  I was one of the few responsible volunteers, and was heralded by Dana for this.  I also talked to fish handshake cool hair guy, who was cool, really doped out, but had that great stoned pacing to his speech that made anything he said sound like pure genius.  Anyway, somehow I ended up in a room with just Dana, who said that (I wish I remembered names) thought I was a great guy.  I said I thought he was nice...blah blah blah hoping he's not gay and they're just shopping friends.  They weren't.  Because Dana said that they would like me to come over one night for dinner.  To which I agreed.   And maybe spend the night  she said.  To which I smiled, and somehow got out of before never talking to them again.    What's that mean?  Last night, as I shared the awkward bowl with girl and boy, I was reminded of the last pot smokers I knew who were a couple and thought I was cool.  And as I passed the tools of ignorance from one to the other, and wondered if the same question would come up this time, I realized that my answer would have changed.  Granted, it wouldn't run like the scene in  urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien  (which she hadn't seen, but loved Mexico and sex, so she should), except for the awkwardness afterwards, where I see him on campus and we share that, "Hey, we nailed the same girl at the same time and know a lot more about each other than we should" casual avoidance nod, quickly looking occupied and walking in the opposite direction.    Anyway, the night ended.  They left together, with guy saying it was nice to meet me (really?) and girl shaking my hand, capturing the events in palindromic fashion, leaving me with the realization that I had just enjoyed the greatest handshake of my life.

      A Saturday evening of script revision (revision = substantial rewrite), coffee, and my new pet projects involving digital cameras.  I love the idea of owning a niche of society, and what better than a site devoted to pedestrian bridges?  A site devoted to ranking the best shitters at UT.  Enough said.    I will build a pedestrian bridge site as soon as my thesis is done.  Until then, today is the UT Law School!       I've spent many a night playing EverQuest at the Law School, as the couches are quite comfy and I didn't bother to own internet at the apartment last year.  Anyway, I always assumed that the structure was a patio for grabass and rich kids to drink coffee the wrong way and bitch about their starched shirts.         Oh was I wrong!

      The pedestrian bridge fetish got love in LiveJournal, and several comments on great aerial footways in San Marcos and Waco!  It's deserving of its own website, but until there's enough to put there, please indulge my sickness.         I don't know the name, but it's the $5 million bridge that opened last year, just east of Lamar, and it holds quite a substantial amount of foot traffic.  Why start there rather than Zilker, or Congress, or Riverside?  As Homer Simpson would say in reference to the star wipe, "Why have hamburger when you can eat filet mignon?"  And proof I was there (as well as proof that I'm narcissistic with my new toy)       My eyes are blue.  And the watery bits in there are because I'm staring right at the sun.    Rick Astley got added to the playlist tonight while I was eaten by mosquitos at Mozart's, writing a new Friendster profile and doing a few pages of work on the screenplay (better character introductions for Dawson and Marci)...work that should be a lot further along than it is.  Whatever.  Rick's good times.   There ain't no mistakin', it's true love we're makin' ...filthy genius!  Although the mention of lovemaking in this song made me blush in the fourth grade during a talent show where a Stephanie Tanner look-alike danced to it.  Stephanie Tanner was played by Jodie Sweeten, who I sat next to on a train in Disneyland once.  My dad wanted me to kiss her.  Had she been Kimmy Gibler...

Decision -- I want to be the guy with the crazy-ass cool documentary films that people never see but love when they do.  This revelation occurs in light of newfound knowledge that intellect and good choice in documentary film does not an attraction make.

      Listening to Breathe (another story for another day) sing DON'T TELL ME LIES; a manufactured pop piece full of mindless synth and vocals that someone lucked out and was paid to write.    It reminds me of Sharon, the stepmom from the mid-90s who wore hot orange sweaters and was quite gracious in her affection for others.  Large breasts.  Miniature intellect.  A con artist.  Who squeaked.    My memory of Sharon -- ugly yellow and white striped one-piece bathing suit, playing in the waves in Rosarito, Mexico.  Bouffant permanent.  Nasal voice.  Vinegar foot bath.  And a style reminiscent of early-90s 90210, a style we wanted to forget when it was still the in thing.    My question...it's been five years since I've seen her.  Yet I think she has the same style.  She'll always be dancing to that bad Breathe song, with the pastel flashes of synthetic happiness, and power cords resonant like slow death.

      My Civic is three years old today!  Just under 57,000 miles...got it down to 19,000/yr, way under my first year, where I put 28,000 on the puppy.  Taking care of my baby.  MUSIC - They Might Be Giants, Birdhouse in your Soul.   Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch, who watches over you.   Forgot how great TMBG is.  I used to play their 7" O Tannenbaum on my KSCL radio show, mainly because the record was green.    Great moods this weekend.  And I finally figured Marci out.  That saucy bitch put up a huge fight, but I just broke her, thanks to several great indie movies and a streak of relationship luck over the past two weeks that undoubtabdly is my best in Austin, of course all coming in a deluge rather than spread over my tenure here.  But fuck it, and enjoy it while it's here.     There's a picture opposite me, of my primitive ancestroy, which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free ...

      Bob reads my blog.    *sinking in*  There is a point on the Political DocuDrama blog (which unfortunately died...too bad, because I thought I could use it well), where I express my discontent with my story, after Bob gave me comments.  He gave me good comments, but at the time they were tough to hear.  And he knows what I said.    You forget that some things should remain private.  It's funny...writing is about taking risks, putting things on the page that might not be appropriate, going for it in a situation.  And it's a training mechanism to do that...no one can immediatley turn on a switch of HONESTY that distances themselves from the passive/agressive, socially conscious individual who says nice things and thinks otherwise.  You train your mind, and you must train your writing in the same way.  But how do you go back and write the honesty, and put yourself on the page.    I do it a bit flippantly; I'm a fan of the southern Alabama style of jokes, crass and crude, that are nothing more than distractions to fill up where I should honesty let it out.  It's a start, but it's still far from it.  There's too much fear in putting the honest you on the page.  What if it's not liked?

      Usual morning routine -   Wake up Internet (email, sports checks, friends blogs, fantasy sports team) Shower/cleansing Eat Work  Today is already different Wake up Shower Internet (email, my own blog)  I don't know what will come next.  But rare is the insatible urge to type to my reading audience.    Anticipation.  And the best. dream. ever. last night.    DREAM - realistic beyond belief, even to the point of me being awoken by an early knock at the door.  Neigbhor cheers me on with my pursuit, but her mention causes second-guessing.  I tear into my car to fix the problem (because the problem is in my car, I guess), when she enters.  Walks up to the car.  Hands me the note.  The box is checked yes.  A sense of self-loathing for resorting to 8th grade tactics, but relief nevertheless.  A kiss.  I pull away.  She pushes on, but I make note of my appearance and lack of morning oral hygeine at this point.  She doesn't care.  Wait.  She does.  Simple discussion of the consequences of such action, an understanding of the situation, what it can be and what it won't be.  "This would only last six weeks anyway, probably," she says.  I wonder why.  Too elated to really care.    Then the wake-up.  And I look at the clock, and it's 9am.  9AM!  What the hell am I doing up at 9?  Six hours of sleep is fine, but rare is the day that I can manage on six when I've got nothing to do but my own projects...no meetings, no classes, just my writing.  But I'm up.  And the day starts.    ---  Yesterday - meeting Mark Moskowitz, director of a documentary I heralded on this same blog in July,  urlLink Stone Reader .  He taught a class, I sat in on it.  Not only was it great to meet a guy who made a film I really enjoyed, but I asked the penultimate question during the Q&A session.  This question is years in the making, not because of Moskowitz, but because of a life in academia, and understanding what every great bellowing question requires--ego, knowledge, tangents, and finally a basic premise that, if in the wrong hands, would be a three word ask resulting in a flippant answer.   At the beginning of  Stone Reader , you admit you are a bibliophile, and your love of books is shown by the walls and walls of fiction novels you own.  And today you covered stories from Faulkner's  A Rose for Emily  to Mossman's magnum opus  The Stones of Summer , as well as the gauntlet in documentary films.  With all that in mind, what makes a good story?   No one knows the answer, really, though Moskowitz gave a good one.  But if you ever want to know  what makes a good, pretentious academic question? , read above.    Tonight -- Watching  Stone Reader  again.  Questions.  Friends who hopefully will love the film as much as I did.

      I don't know why I'm not friends with Nick Pabst anymore.  Not the foggiest.  One year, he and I would stay up late, smoke cigarettes in the Cline openway area, talk about whatever there was going on in the ether, and just enjoy the way the other person turned a sentence, or made a movement.  We were such good friends that we decided to room together the next year.    Our close proximety was probably an issue, as I do a poor job of keeping my space clean, but Nick's not known as a neat freak by any means.  We still hung out, albeit now we were sharing space, and I'm sure there was bitching done by me regarding him, and likewise...friendship does not equate roommates.    And it wasn't one day...everyone wants an example, a specific...but they're so rare to find...something will happen, and you won't like it, but you don't think much of it, because hey, it's something small, who cares about this...but the small things just keep happening, and you start to notice them more and more, but you still don't pay too much attention because they're nothing big, and you can't really get upset about something small.  But now you are, because they've kept happening, the small thing you didn't like before and now you can't stand, but you still can't put your finger on it unless you really concentrate.    And then there's nothing you can really do if you're the person who is doing the thing wrong.  Now your foible is part of your makeup to this other person, one can't exist without the other, and rather than enjoying friendship, you experience saturated awkwardness, dangling barbs, and as much avoidance as possible.    When I first met her, I had no problem with her.  She was energetic, that was cool.  Pretty young, yes, but you can't condemn someone for age.  There was an excitement about her; she was interested in doing things, seeing things, being a part of what is out there.  And that thirst for world exposure is a great attribute.    And an attribute that I no longer see.  Unreqited exeuberence is replaced by a requirement of situation control, and a lofty cynicism for things she does not enjoy.  The energy is still there, now a tool of agitation rather than a device for accomplishment.  Fun comes at an expense, usually at someone else's, often someone that she doesn't know, sometimes not.  And I'm more bothered when the whimsy comes at a random stranger's expense rather than mine.    She wants to be her boyfriend, who is one of the coolest people I know.  But she's not.  And what she picks up from him and uses as her own are some of his lesser attributes, commodified and mass-produced in her overbearing actions.  She doesn't know who she is, but she sure thinks she does.  And whether it's who she is, or who she thinks she is, I would rather not spend time with either.    I would like to take the blame.  My conscious acknowledgement of dislike came about after a lunch date, where we walked to my car, and she and the beau made fun of several fat people trying to squeeze by us into their car.  I thought it too, but I didn't say it, probalby because the windows were down and they were right there, and maybe because I didn't find it appropriate there.  But they bellowed their amusement with the overweight car jockeys attempting to circumvent my Civic and gain access to theirs, within feet of the situation.  And the pompous regality that they spoke with, taking pleasure in the misfortune of these folks...  I forgave him immediately.  That's easy to do; the friendship is strong, and I know his strengths well, so the weaknesses are easy to forget.  But her...I can't.  I don't know her.  And I really don't care to get to know her now.  I'm sure she's a fine person in her own regard...good for her.  I've lost the interest to invest.    --  Music sounds contrived right now.  I'm picking out the choices made, the basic interludes, the flippant structure employed.  This requires a switch from the hard rock I playlisted into classical, a synergy just as abused but not as known to me.    I'm in a shitty mood.  Funny.  Yesterday was glorious for so long, and the days prior just as much...this was a great week, albeit with less work done than I had hoped for.  It's what makes life envigorating, that the minutae can take over instances and render you complete to their outcomes.  Anxiety turns into enjoyment, and then excitement, and euphoria, and the feeling of being on the perch, overlooking the metropolis of feelings that lead to exaltation, only lasts until you somehow, against your volition, fall from your place, and begin downwards before you dig in and start the climb again.  You don't get it all.  And it'd be no fun if you did.

      Last night was to be a glorious blog post, but a quick passout after seven hours of beer drinking limited my typing ability.    There's no reason to try and tie down the way life works.  Some days feel better than others, and some days have good and bad, and some days are just all good and you do all bad, and some days are all bad that feel all good.    Yesterday I spent an incredibly small time outdoors, I wrote no screenplay pages, and while I made steadfast progress on my thesis, little of it will I keep.  Yet pizza at the Parlor, followed by beers and more beers with the neigbhors, and I enjoyed the second best night of sleep I've had all year.    The first?  The night before.    Lucid dreams, full of vibrance and life and shit going on and feeling real and obviously not but the kind of dreams you just want to stay in and enjoy like a story.  Sleep that ends at an hour that you wish was earlier, but can't bemoan, because you lost consciousness, then immediately had it again, and it was of that lateness.

      Why am I not in bed?  I'm not working...I'm grabassing.  Reading through old blog posts...I wrote them, I should know what they say.  Yet I enjoy it.  I continue to read.    Funny thing about the blog...its January-March content is pretty weak in both 2003 and 2004, April picks up, and May is incredible.  I feel something similar on this internet horizon.  The last few days of writing have found more interest and casual banter, in my mind, than a semester full of forced entry, designed specifically to make sure Heath doesn't stop reading for lack of posts.    I always considered the blog to be on one side of the writer's balance, and my creative output on the other.  The blog is creative, granted, but I get no accolades for this...some mentioned in passing that I should publish a Best Of: copy, but what would the reason to buy be, considering it's all for free here?  Writing fuels the soul, but the blog was a break from the career of screenwriting, as evidenced by my blogging.  Last year at this time, I was beginning to turn out substantial posts, while my screenplay was receiving an untimely burial.  The summer was dedicated to blog, but once I got back into school, the site fuckered itself, and I started up on a pretty kickass story idea.  That finished, and the blog was reborn, and I got into it, but the posts were grueling and uninteresting.    But now, I'm enjoying the hell out of what I'm writing in the screenplay and on the blog.    Scott Rice wants the TAs to come into class on Tuesday and talk about our approach to writing, as if we are experts on the craft.  I know what makes a good screenplay, and I can give good honest criticism, playing good cop and bad cop at the same time for my students, but to stand in front of a group of people and tell them  I am a writer; this is how I do this  is so much more daunting than any class I've ever taught.  Maybe it is because I still don't trust my abilities...how can I when my published career is found wanting?  My approach changes every semester.  I've finished a grand total of two screenplays in my life.    The pressure of society is such an interesting burden.  Hemingway wrote from 6 to 12 every day of his life, according to the anecdotes, at least.   He'd wake up, no matter what he'd done the night before, and start rewriting what he had written the day before.  Once finished, he'd move on to new things.  The writing would end at 12, no matter where he was, and he would spend the rest of the day living.   Or Jack London,  who wrote 1000 words a day, everyday.  Didn't matter in what vocation, just the words.   And then there's James Joyce,  who could lock himself in a room for days, come out, and have someone ask him "How much work did you get done?" to which he'd reply "Two words."  The questioner would be shocked; so much time for so little output...but James would smile and say "They were two good words."     Problem with me is, my two words often suck.    I'm kind of on a writing high right now, however.  The script is plugging along marvelously, after some nearfall misses in the earlygoing, one of which killed my diary blog on the screenplay (how often can you post to a blog about a project that you loathe?).  I might have a finished draft by Friday...and full-well knowing the draft will suck, I don't mind.  I have motivations down.  I feel the story for the first time since I sat with Dawson Taylor in his Houston apartment in 2001 and we talked old Centenary days that weren't really so old and I thought, "This joke about filming this guy at a party could be so much more."    I woke up early this summer...sleeping in constituted a 10am wakeup, and I could stay up until 3 or 4 to make it there.  Tonight will be a testament to see if I've got that giddy energy back.  I want to get up at 10...class at 3, office hours thereafter, and who knows what next?  Got some grading to do tomorrow (as you see I'm not doing it tonight).    Ah fuck.  Alex Smith is on campus tomorrow.  Supposed to go to his shit in the afternoon.  An earlier morning call?    My computer just realized I'm not at JP's anymore.  Good work.

      Trying to close down JP's tonight...hit The Metro for the first time in a while, enjoying the forced intimacy of the lofted enterprise, but succumbed to a need for wireless internet so I can listen to my kickass RealRhapsody playlist.    What is it?    Steve Winwood - Valerie (a script song...I'll explain that term later) David Gray - Be Mine Better Than Ezra - Under You David Bowie - Fashion REM - Radio Free Europe Erasure - I Love You (their most overlooked work...dance pop with some Morrisey thrown in) David Bowie - If I'm Dreaming My Lifew Moby - Love of Strings Steve Winwood - The Finer Things Hall &amp; Oates - Say it Isn't So Bon Jovi - This Ain't a Love Song Morrisey - Trouble Loves Me Figures on a Beach - Accidentally 4th Street (Gloria) Figures on a Beach - No Stars James - Say Something Polyphonic Spree - Soldier Girl Simple Minds - Alive and Kicking  Not as college alt as I originally assumed, but I'm an 80s nut...at least it's not laden with hits.  I like the sap when I write.  It makes me feel fuzzy.    Frank's having a "procedure" done tomorrow, as my grandmother explained it to me.  She told me a week ago in passing, as she does to make sure I don' t worry.  And I forgot, as happens often, except I called them late tonight to ask a question about former Palm Springs City Councilman Chuck Maurowski (sp?) for use in my thesis...I went to the victory celebration for him and Dana Hodges in 1990, and it is pertinent to my thesis report, so there.  Anyway, the procedure was mentioned again (he's got diabetes, and a vein in his leg is closing up, so he's got to have a stent put in).  Probably the least intrusive surgery he's had in years, but it's still a concern.  Few people I enjoy more in the world than Frank Wiskowski.  And in true form, he would rather lament Georgia Tech's poor first half shooting in the NCAAs rather than even bring up his health issues.  Part of me hopes I don't find a job before my Kansas gig ends, just so I can go spend a month in Palm Springs, finding part time PA work and taking him to the gym in the afternoons (I rarely work out so regularly).  And enjoying that pool on the outside...the greatest. pool. ever.

      30 pages in two days was big news.  But now I'm on the thesis track, which starts running today.  50 pages in 11 days shouldn't be too tough, becuase I've got a bit of research done.  Yet at the same time, I must finish the first draft of my script, and get working on Version 2, which I hope to have drafted by April 26.  Three weeks to write 50 pages and redraft it, as well as write 30 pages and redraft 120 of the script.    And people thought I wasn't playing much EverQuest before.    In honor of Kurt Cobain, I went hunting for some downloadable songs on RealRhapsody (yes, I'm a fucking billboard for the Man, I know, but it's awesome...I spent two hours yesterday listening to synth pioneers Kraftwerk), and funny enough, none of Nirvana's hits are available for consumption.  Same goes for Madonna.  The rights to both artists are owned independently, I believe, rather than from a record company, and thus it is harder to get consent on the music.  It's funny when I have no problem burning myself a cd of erstwhile female punk band Sarge, but I can't get the five Madonna songs I enjoy without doing it illegally.  Or paying out my ass.    There's something about the smell of fresh-cut grass...I parked pretty far from school today, thus my sojurn to campus was marked with passing at-home dads casually mowing lawns, decked out in tank tops, unafraid to show a bit of paunch and farmer's tan.  The sight is forgivable because of the smell of wet green, mixing with Hyde Park flavor, taking me back to Springfests in Rogers, or Septembers in Shreveport...times when the world felt like it was moving forward and you were on the crest of the wave, about to put the nose of the board in the water and ride the hell out of the wave.  Both were carefree times, yet I felt much more in tune to what was happening around me than I do now...some of that is obviously that I write rather than do these days, so I place myself in a personal fantasy world daily.  But I can't help to think that I was living more then than I am now...both times in cities of desolation rather than vibrance.

      Random musings while hour four at Flightpath slowly grows into hour five:  *I've always fastened myself to people when idling at a place.  I probably should view more folks, try to capture as many stories as I can, but honestly I can't focus on it.  I'm right now the elder statesman at Flightpath, as everyone who was here when I came is now gone, usurped by a new generation of studious individuals, slackers, crammers, and grabassers.  And I'm only really viewing three of the 20+ folks here.  Some of it must be periphery...I'm not going to stretch my neck to see the mannerisms of the woman in poncho to my direct right (unless the poncho was a hoody sweater and she was festidiously hot).  But a lot is just focus...get more out of less than overwhelm.    *This theory has always been my way of viewing girls.  Doesn't matter where the hell I go...I could be at the beach, surrounded by hundreds of bikini-clad co-ed hotties, and I'd pick one out.  And that would be the person that I'd consider, think about, and if the juevos grow, talk to.  If a boyfriend enters the picture, then I'm just fuckered for that night.    *The problem with study groups at coffee shops is that you can't tell who is together and who is not.  The Jena Malone look-alike who is in perfect eyeshot from my vantage point, hair pulled into the cutest of ponytails, tight black collared shirt showing a neverending glimpse of midriff, is with some dweeb-o and another hot girl who I saw later and is wearing a hipster black mesh hat, and lacks the personality or smile of the Secret Lives of Altar Boys star.  It's just a study thing, but the group is overwhelming.  When at the single table, you can go up, plop down, work out a way to start a conversation.  Three people is too much of a burden to bear, especially when alliances aren't well-defined.    *I've written 20 pages in two days.  It's not the greatest work, but I decided yesterday that I needed to finish the script and then go into rewrites to get peoples' motivations proper.  In the past, I'd start the rewrite now, and expect final draft perfection.  Maybe this is growth as a writer.  Hopefully the tongue-lashing Bob Foshko will undoubtabdly pile upon my mash will not deter me from continuing this apprach in future.    *RealRhapsody kicks some serious ass.    *A pick-up I once gave Daniel Young, for a girl who worked at a coffee shop he frequented and with whom he was amicable, but hoped for more:   go up, lean against the counter, and ask her if you can buy her a cup of coffee.   I thought, depending on how well he knows her and what her demeanor is, it could be masterful.  Yet I'd never use it.  Why?

      No Dallas.  Not a big deal...Austin is experiencing its most beautiful day of 2004, and while I didn't get out to enjoy it until much later than planned, it's still good.  A walk to the Snappy Mart at 1:30 to buy a coke to go with the french bread pizza I stole from Tripper was refreshing, in the way that a three block walk can be...memories of high school summers in San Diego, stuck without transportation or supervision, when I'd head out of my dad's condo (now my condo, as far as I know), scale the unscalable wall compound, and hiking across the busy road to one of San Diego County's thousands of strip malls to buy breadsticks or frogen yozurt (as Heidi's brand sold itself).    Or maybe May walks from the loft in Chicago to the community strip, where I could buy Icees or reuben sandwiches at the vegetarian deli (under new ownership).  Lazy afternoons that aren't meant to be lazy when you stay inside and long for something, but as you go outside, you just get lost in the wandering and realize that plans would only serve to get in the way of adventure.    The Natalie Portman look-alike barista at JP's is wearing a ringer T with a stain on the bottom of the front, but more importantly, a  BELLA VISTA VILLAGE inscription on the left breast.  Something like that always deserves recognition, but in my newfound spirit to embrace the newness I somehow left asunder after Big City entered my blood, I referenced it.     Did you get that shirt at a store or have you been to Bella Vista?  She didn't realize that wandering out from the dishes would require conversation.   I just got it at a store.    A pause.  She punched the frequent buyer ticket.  One more punch to a free drink.   He knew Bella Vista.  Well.  Golfing excursions, underage drinking, summers come and gone, forgotten virginities.    It's a retirement village.   He thought that sounded better than referencing his Arkansas past, an homage to a time when he would use California as his home state.  That time still exists.   Her disinterest hadn't changed since her emergence.   Well, what can you do?   Indeed.

      Still debating the Dallas trip tomorrow to see Mark Cuban...there's a lot that I can do around here.  The question is whether or not I will do it.  Good likelihood that I won't...that's just how things are.  At the same time, I'm not going to get $1,000,000 from Mark Cuban in Dallas.  But trips are nice.  And there's no way to get the money if I don't go.    What I'd need is a 9am wakeup (regardless), a look at the sky, and a decision.  If it's to Dallas to sit in a hotel lobby for four hours, waiting to pitch my reason why I'm worth a shitload of cash, that works.  If it's to get the laptop, work on the screenplay, and hopefully make some headway into the world of grantwriting and festival submission, that works too.  Whatever the case, I need to keep busy.    Would've been nice of me to get ahold of Harge and Nicole earlier than today...could've made a trip tonight for it and had a weekend in D-town.  But these are the transgressions that accompany grabass.  I'm looking at an EQ logon tonight to see if he's there, and if we'll get together after my soiree.  And to see if my account still works.    Chance that I'll have $3G saved after I graduate in May...that doesn't include the huge garage sale coming after the big day.  Not sure if the drums go out there...I'm making some good progress, as I've learned how the high-hat works.  It really requires a group to settle down with and practice usual beat patterns and get the muscle memory there.  That's a reason for finding a city.  Like I said, the minute I get an agent is the minute I feel no problem with settling my happy ass down.    Interesting fact -- the second most Billboard-successful music group after the Beatles?  Hall and Oates.  Hey, Christopher Cross was the most decorated first-time Grammy winner in history until Norah Jones took the honor last year.

      I got ahold of RealRhapsody yesterday...a pragmatic sucker for 14 day trials, and a guy who might finally feel bad about downloading from Napster, Kazaa, and Morpheus for years.  Set up your jukebox with the artists they let you (a much wider variety than I expected, as many of them that I can never find on Kazaa are here, causing my great rally for Kazaa to fall bunk), and play it out.  79 cents to download to the computer, and you don't get the damn static that often comes with illegal downloads now.    And in trying to find songs that I love but don't know the words to, I came across Bon Jovi (not because I didn't know the song, but because there was a song called WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BON JOVI that had similar lyrics to the song I was looking for), and threw THIS AIN'T A LOVE SONG on my download list.  It's a guilty pleasure song, one of the oldest...a song I'd throw into the stereo on Thursday afternoons in Cline D3 when Will Kordsmeier was doing his library shift, throw it up to loud, shut the blinds enough to allow light to sneak rather than flood, and listen, thinking about how great life will be.  And here it is again.  And somehow, the future tense is now present tense.    A sexy Lauren Jackson look-alike is sitting at the table just inches away from me, separated by a thick slab of glass (no comptuer use outside, so I'm at the counter writing pages, or I was writing pages before grabass won out, as it tends to do).  She comes here all the time; almost every time I am here, she is.  And yes, I am a pussy, that's obvious by the year+ of ridiculous posts here regarding loathing.  But the interesting thing here is that not one time have I been here alone when she's been here alone...right now she sits with a poor man's Christina Ricci, a taller version with a less attractive face but a beautiful beauty mark on the right shoulder (They both wear tight white cotton tank tops, the kind that frown on bras for the support inherent within, and allow for greater skin prowess).  And probably 80% of the time that I'm here with someone, she's here alone.  Yesterday I spent three hours at the Little City, working with students on short scripts and final outlines, and the entire time she sat maybe 15 feet away, alone, reading WONDER BOYS, a movie I didn't enjoy but a book I liked (it was what it was).    She kind of reminds me of Sarah Lagersen...every time a person shows up that she knows, immediately she springs into life, with vim and vigor and hugs and talk and gossip.  I often wondered if that was a defense mechanism for feeling important...sometimes I use it as one.  Never figured it out with Sarah.  Sarah and I knew one another for two and a half years before we first spoke, and we were forced into conversation because of Brian Thomas, who was somewhat dating Sarah.  And we became great friends after that, inciting me to drive through Shreveport on my way back to Dallas from Naples, on what was undoubtabdly the greatest. road trip. Ever.    My mom needs a new car.  Needed one for a while.  There was a 90 Volvo for sale a few doors down from me a week ago...might check it out on the way home.  Might check it out, test drive it, get it inspected, and if it's in good shape, drive it to Naples after my thesis is due.  I've been needing a good road trip for a while.  Four days would do the trick.    But you need people to make road trips as good as they can be.  My road trip was made by visits with Danny Ruiz, Sarah Lagersen, Cristal Willcox, and the impoverished of Tallahassee.  Got a haircut there as well whilst playing Florida grabass.    And now I feel like I owe the woman who is the Dean of Students at Centenary an email.  Lori Bradshaw.  yes!  how did I forget that name?  I wanted to say Karen McGowan (is that Mac rather than Mc), but knew she was the Rogers teacher with tons of kids who took over Debate and looks like every woman who cuts my hair in Austin (at least the ones that are actually women and not the ones who just dress the part).  Nostalgic.

      There's something refreshing about no screenplay deadlines.  The past three days have included at least an hour or two of script writing, but on three different projects.  It's not steadfast progress on a goal, but I'm moving forward with a lot of work, and it's better writing than if I were forced to work on one idea right now.    The key for my film career is not to get caught up in the idea that I'm getting old and I need things to happen now.  I'm 24.  I won't be 25 for almost half a year.  At 20, I always said that I'd follow my dreams until I was 30, and then I'd worry about the real world.  An easy statement to make when my life revolved around Youree Drive and Brown Chapel in Shreveport, but not wholly ignorant.    Waiting is difficult, because it gets in the way of acting.  Impatience is grown in this country, especially with the mechanisms of convenience we utilize each minute.  Daryl's bemoaning a girl's inability to call him back after 90 minutes is a prime example; were I starting something with a person who was now abroad 30 years ago, I'd have to wait at least two weeks to find out if what I wrote was met with adulation or reluctance.  Now, 90 minutes is considered too long a window.    I lost an acquanitance a few weeks ago, based on honest comments regarding his writing ability.  Truth be told, he wasn't any good, and it was quite unlikely that he ever would be.  It was nothing personal, but part of me wishes I had not scoured the piece as soon as he had passed it my way...I did try to sound positive at the end of the comments, but he got honesty that he probably didn't expect, even though he asked for it.  The work was unsolicited, and very "huggy," a Centenary euphamism denoting the want of a rah-rah attitude for effort, forgetting that talent is also a reqiurement for good work.  I get bothered by unsolicited writing; it comes fairly often, always from weak writers, who expect me to shower them with kind words and justify that their professor was wrong in whatever grade was bestowed.    Anyway, as soon as I saw who it was and that there was an attachment, I was bothered.  Though, to my credit, I took a deep breath and tried to give him the benefit of the doubt on the piece, which at first instinct I assumed would royally suck.  I waited for that to pass, and then started reading.  Couldn't get past page 10, wish I hadn't started.    Regardless of how I play off what I did as right (he needed honest criticism; better to learn he can't do it now than later), I can't help but feel like I broke a spirit there.  I just can't think how I would do it differently.  And that bothers me.

      A few quick apologies...first for sloth on the blog, second for three mentions of EverQuest in a two week span, and third for nothing other than three is the ultimate metaphor number.  WHEEE!    Got back to A-town.  Sold my drum set.  Put some money in the bank for my DV camcorder.  A ways away, but the grad money I got from folks was very helpful.  Talked with some folks about possible projects to work on.    I love having lots of projects going at once...if something burns you out, you pick up something else.  Hopefully that will be the nice part of life out of college; I can work on multiple things at once with no fear of deadline.  Of course, if I get a deadline, it's because someone is paying me, which means it's good.    So, I'm currently rewriting Three Strikes, my first script from UT, which had some brilliant moments, but was crudely overwritten.  On the rewrite, I've cut down from 24 pages to 14...for screenwriting, less is good.  We're hoping for a strong rewrite before Andrew's wedding, so I can have it out of the way and let it sit a bit before Kansas.    My other project is a little more interesting...it's something that I kicked around first in 1997 when I decided I would do film but knew nothing about it.  Seven years later, I've written the script.    I want to make a satire filmstrip detailing the dry hump.    Sex Ed was worthless in High School, as Chalymadia and Gonorrhea were Disney Cartoons, and I didn't even know that the vagina was between and not on top (and yes, the guys are nodding in understanding on that line).  So I've decided to write a filmstrip detailing the benefits of what is technically known as Outercourse.    Funny I spend two years of grad school writing character-driven dramas that detail the individual spirit in conflict with society, and the thing that my friends get most excited about is a 60 picture project where two people look like they're getting the ol' jean rub on.  Of course, with proper BEEP sounds, as well as a freaky narrator, and classic melodrama facial contortions, this thing could be genius.

      Two types of catheters:  foley and external.  Foley is a tube that goes up the urethra, and a balloon filled with water inflates, keeping it up there, and your urine drains into a bag.  External is basically a condom that does the same thing, just without the pesky urethra probe that, when put in wrongly, causes scabbing.    I've had the foley.  I wanted the external.    The external is also called a condom catheter, as well as a Texas Catheter, or a Texas Rig.  In fact, one of the doctors on Daniel's rotation asked him why it was called a Texas Rig, and if he could find out, he'd get an A for the rotation.    He put me on the case.  And here's what I know:  *Texas catheters were called that as far back as WWII, when bomber pilots would hook up to them so they could pee during flights.  Often with leakage.    *Texas Catheter is a trademarked name.    *Cyberculture author William Gibson uses the term several times, both in opus NEUROMANCER and in short fiction.  *Texas has been known to inject people on death row through a catheter...granted, probably not the penis kind, but it's the nomenclature they use.    But no site on the web is devoted to the grand question, "Why Texas?"  There are some terrible jokes about "Everything's bigger in Texas" or "Texans can't do it otherwise" or something stupid.  But nothing I can find otherwise.    Help me.  I can't sleep without knowing this.

      I graduate today!  And I'm so excited about it, I'm going to spend the majority of today in Little Rock, playing EverQuest and grabass.    But I did feel obliged to check my grades, just to see how my tenure turned out.     CUMULATIVE UT WORK  36  24  36  96  4.0000   A's across the board.  One B in the past four years of my life; and it was fucking Health.  I don't have chlamydia; that should mean I get an A in that.    Too bad letters don't equate to success outside of college.  Maybe I can string some construction paper A's along my wall, to remind me of the glory that was my UT experience.  Or I can take more pictures of pedestrian bridges.

      Slight changes, as grabass led to more internet time, leading to a new template.  As always, I'll say that I plan on doing great things with this.  Likelihood of that happening...  I tried to do the thing where every post generates its own page, but it uses up my complete Blogger virtual memory.  I write a lot of words.

       Summer 2004 - The  Pull Up Your Socks, Take Down Your Pants  Tour   Prologue Continuation - Dallas, TX and Little Rock, AR   My recent lack of posting stemmed from a small bit of post-grad depression...I hate bitching online and doing nothing else.    The delay in posting since Wednesday comes strictly from back to back hangovers.  And travel.    Got to Arlington, where Tripper and I met up and hit the Rangers/Royals game at Dollar Hot Dog Night (you can tell fairweather fans by the price of hot dogs...the stadium was at least 2/3 full for the Kansas City Royals, and rare were any cheers for anything before the fourth inning, the time when everyone had their hot dogs).  Tripper's dad had a pass for free tickets, so we got that, but had four, and it was just the two of us.  My attempts to contact Daniel Harr failed, so we sold the tickets to the people behind us for $10, parking money.  So for me, baseball, parking, and four hot dogs cost $4.  That left a lot of money for beer, and we drank there, drank at the Old Monk (sweet bar off Henderson St in Dallas), and went back to his house and drank some more.    I'm always fascinated to see how friendships develop after the constant time together ends.  Tripper and I started as friends who would grab beers and talk life, but living together quelled that and had us as buddies who didn't really go out together, save six times in a year maybe.  So the honest conversation and airing of fears that he shared was unexpected.  Of course, he was ripped.  And so was I.  And I awoke to a blistering hangover at 6am, to hear his dad bellow a toilet bowl fart of epic proportions.    Spent some time in Dallas...grabbed a lunch at a bakery I like, got a phone charger for the car...usual grabass.  On the road by 11:30, thinking I'll be real late for my 4:00 arrival.  I got in at 4:13, and that includes some terrible traffic and road construction in Benton.  I've done Arkansas since 1992, and I can't think of a time that I-30 wasn't under construction.  It looks like a widen job, one that I'm sure residents will enjoy come 2031 when it is complete.    Met up with the D's after that.  Went out for sushi, which included moments that both Daryl and Daniel got upset about, leaving me to do awkward jokes and drink sake bombs.  I did both admirably.  The night took us to Cajun's, a bar that in no way lives up to the billing...less LAISSEZ LES BOUNS TEMPLE ROULES, and more Little Rock sorority girls who put on spackle and tube tops to show their wares to the drunk guy who will grind with them a bit on the dance floor.    Living in Austin hasn't been to bad, for the girls at least.  Sexies in Austin...ahhh.  Here, not the same.  Out of the place, maybe six girls I would approach.  Several others I'd hook up with, but it's vacation...you lower the stakes to raise the average (nothing sexier for a girl than to come back to some apartment where the guy is sleeping on the futon his friend had in high school).    But it's good to do the things you don't often do.  Rare are my trips to the hookup bar; not my place, not where I meet people at all, or the kind I strive to meet, I should say.  I can meet the great unwashed; several times last night I was grinding against plumpicity, beer in one hand, female hip in another.  A style I can fake, but not one I'm really interested in pursuing.  It felt more like playing EverQuest than it did like partying.    Today -  Writing, hopefully.  Hangover be gone!

       Summer 2004 - The  Pull Your Socks Up, Take Your Pants Down  Tour   Prologue - Austin, TX   I hope to always delineate life by semesters; there's a sense of finality come May, at the end of large Term II, where you relish a certain freedom that days before had not existed, and no matter what the future holds, it resonstes fresh; you are the instigator of forthcoming maneuvers.    Part of my fear of the future is the fear of lost semesters; life becoming a continuous grind, where May turns into June, into July, and August, and soon September is here, and it's no different than May, except maybe shelling out some cash for a package vacation.     Last summer, most likely the best summer.of.my.life., I was unsure whether or not I could call this post-May determination a Summer Break.  Break from what?  I have nothing on the agenda, an open dance card and nary a partner to waltz with.  What is this break from?    An unanswerable question.  As all good questions are.    Looking over the wake of my 2003 sojurn, I see a wide-eyed 23 year old, able to spread his wings because I couldn't fall; there was another year of safety net for me to fall on.  I don't feel that.  yet.  And I really need to.  I'm good when I'm inspired.  I sleep less, I do more, I'm more fun, I'm more fit, I have more to say, I have more to offer.    The last few weeks have been enjoyable; beers with a lot of folks, saying goodbye to new friends who are now old friends, meeting newer friends who I wish I had more time with, and the past two days, organizing myself for the chapter ahead.    But the energy isn't there.  And the writing...shit.  The writing is stalled out.  Doubt festers.  Kernels of inspiration pop, but are quickly consumed, leaving a dearth of sterile seed.  I cannot forget Bob Foshko's honest moment with me in 2002, where he told me of his own writing folly, and how the inability to produce work he could be proud of cost him a career.  I often feel that way.    I am supposed to leave now.  I will be late.  Can I make the time up?

      I apologize for the lack of posts on the ol' blog.  The end of UT coursework brought with it an avenue of free time and a small parsel of depression.  My penchant for grabass mixed with the unwanted feelings, and funkage ensued.    24.  M.A., Screenwriting.  No job.  Debt.    But I think it mostly comes from my want to stay in Austin.  I really enjoy this city...the climate, the people, the proximity to things I enjoy.  It's possible that a lot of this comes from my lack of work the past two years; Austin is no longer a work city as it was in my Starbucks days, but now a school city that I can wake up late and shower myself in ineptitude in.    The fear is that the reason I desire Austin is because it is safe.  I moved to Austin because it was safe.  Crazy statement, considering I was poor and knew no one when I arrived, but it was close to Shreveport.  Close to Arkansas.  Close enough that if something went wrong, I could handle it.    I hate saying goodbye.  And most of the people I know are saying goodbye.  And I should be able to say it, and get in the car and wave as I take on a new place...I'm good at being the new guy.  But I can't read whether this indecision is fear, or if I've found a place I wouldn't mind staying in.    Finding work would make this easy, but there's not a overflowing market for grads of screenwriting.  Especially those with small portfolios.    The fog is clearing, somewhat, and Oat Willie is leading me to the promise land maybe?  It's late.  I'm headed to Arkansas for a few days of relaxation with the med school D's, and hopefully some time that I can get my own shit together.  This week has been good so far, a lot of personal work done.  I'm good at motivating myself to work hard...just not in the way of quitting soda and running laps.

      It's been a while...so long that my user interface changed.  Kind of like my EverQuest playing...I'll go for a while, and come back to everything looking so different.    It's never that I don't want to write...a trip to Georgetown to play cheap golf at Southwestern University inspired a dearth of blog topics, but I was far from computer, and ten hours later the spirit no longer subsided.    I ended up pretty defeated a few weeks back...a run-in with Javier, some pedestrian work on my thesis, resounding apathy from the workshop on my Dawson script, and a shitload of printing problems with the thesis that led to the use of $2 White Out on a copy of a document that supposedly will remain at UT Austin in perpetuity.    I'll come back around...it's what I do.  This is what I do.  Two steps forward, one step back.  It's progress, albeit grating, distressing, aggrivating progress.    How do you get someone giddy about script?  Or writing in general?  What must you do?  Where does the careless audience find interest, and how do you continue it?  Especially in screenplay, where the writing is so brief and the mind's picture so vital?    I want success today.  I think the realization that I won't have it for a while longer is tough to deal with at present.  Hopefully tomorrow will be the day that I get up and start working on the old script, or the new script, or the book idea, or the documentary proposals.  The day that the grabass stops.    Until then, I'm playing some kickass golf.

      I haven't had it recently.  Dana Bamburack stopped the blog from total annihilation, but at this point in my life, I'm really questioning the importance of castaway journaling.    Death is a cumbersome, sobering event.  Ask everyone at this camp about me, and they'll tell you I'm one of the most carefree, energetic, happiest staff members around, possibly the most spritely.  And a lot of that is there...I have to admit, the work, this staff, these kids, it's made my life a lot easier over the past three weeks.  But when it comes to my work, and my future, it's a completely different story.  If I'm with the kids, I'm doing stuff for them.  If I'm with the staff, I'm having fun, taking my mind off things, trying to weave game with the hippie female staff member who reads books and doesn't know just how much of a thing I've got for her, though she randomly stopped by my room tonight.  Yet I can't really write.  I did redraft a short film, one that Scott never sent me comments back on, and I have to admit I wouldn't send comments either, because the protagonist's motives were never clear and the ending kind of came out of nowhere; I cleaned that up and made it less about fatalism and more about aesthetics.  That's the kind of writing I can do.  I can focus on craft.  I can take an idea and put the words to it.  I can do this like it's construction work...and that's a strong part of writing.    But reading back through my blog of last year at this time is both inspiring and depressing.  The words I wrote...there's a life and voice to them that prevails over some poor word choice and grammar issues, but one year later, here I am, two weeks from my last post, picking up shit and flinging it onto the screen, hoping I turn a phrase well enough to keep my own interest, much less yours.    Read some Burroughs.  He's a good guy.  Strong writer.  Not all writing is traditional fiction.  But Burroughs is fighting against tradition, which is good...my plots fight against tradition.  I don't know...love the work, see parallels, and yet can't seem to figure out enough...  I need to get the wisdom teeth pulled...they're bitches.    But honest writing...it's really a crock of shit.  There are pros and cons to the work, to the utilization of audience in this manner.  I did this for a reason.  Got to see if that reason still exists.

       Summer 2004 - The  Socks Up, Pants Down  Tour  Most Recent Stop -  Lawrence, KS   Twenty minutes ago, I was quitting the blog for a while.  It hadn't been the best week, and the realization of what honest writing entails, and its significant lack of purpose other than menial catharsis and worry from others left me as a writing graduate who didn't want to write.    And then I got an email from Dana Bamburak.    Last year, after my TIP experience, I drafted a short bit about my adolescent career, and what could be considered a turning point if you wanted to specify a turning point...and it related to an unknowing Dana Bamburak who took an interest in me and changed me from a despondent visiter to Arkansas to someone who graduated from Rogers High with pride in 1997.  Lots happened before and after, but stories are great, and in a world where we design life on pivotal moments, what better than a first relationship story?    So Dana found the blog, like some before her, and emailed me a short bit about it, basically a check up, because really, we haven't talked since November 1993.  Eleven years.    I don't think it makes me old.  I think it means that I've been alive longer.  Age is inidiscriminate, and an unfair litmus of activity.  If we consider my birth into a greater world around me (which might be the case, though there were great moments before that, mainly my 1991 run as Doody in GREASE!), it could be that Monday moment over a Pomfret sweaty breakfast where Dana and I shared an unrecognized bond, forged across a cafeteria table, unable to be shaken by anything execept everything around us.    That year was the best band camp.    ---  It's not about honesty.  Truth is processed so magestically, cranked out by media and politburos, designed to get us living as they show it.  It's about reality, or a push to a reality that once existed.  Again, I'm Baudrillarian here.  But writer's shouldn't use the page as panacea for their maladies; there is a higher purpose to literature and media.  Or there should be.  A story needs the life, but it needs the contents of good storytelling to drive the message home.    I've been disappointed with the blog for a while...too much "This is what I did today.  Woohey!"  There's a desire to make the dwindling reading public happy, to continuously produce mash for critical siphoning.  Fuck that.

      A big day for blogging.    Sold my bed to some folks who weren't the most knowledgable about transporting large items of furniture, so I borrowed Brian's truck to get it out to them.  Brian listens to 90.7 (or 90.1), a Constitution-based radio station in Austin.  Not liberal, not conservative.  Not even libertarian, as I first pegged it, though the belief in the Constitution is a close representation.  Not progressive, though such stations are popular in the area.    Often it is a hodgepodge of mess spewed forth from the radio...good talk that encourages conspiracy without really looking into solutions to problems.  However, after buying Bob Jensen's WRITING DISSENT book at Half Price today (autographed as well, mind you) and reading a bit about setting the parameters of debate, I was more inclined to listen to the station with open intentions.    I got a good show...some guy whose name I forget, but he started with the problems of the news media, something I am always happy to chronicle.  Mainstream news is traditionally nine months to a year late on reporting news.  This isn't in relation to typical "Bush To Stay The Course" bullshit articles where the person in power gives a speech to say he will continue to do what he's doing, because that's just reporting a public relations course.    I'm talking Election 2000, where 58,000 Floridians were kept from the vote, and news correspondent Greg Palast found where the error trail led (Katherine Harris, Florida Election Commission, Jeb Bush, and rich supporters of George Bush), before the Supreme Court ruling, and no one in America picked his story up.  A year later, the story surfaces, but has no shelf life because "it's in the past."  It wasn't when it was written.  Same with Iraq.  Go back to 2003 discourse on this blog, and look at what we're hearing now about WMDs and reasons for war.  I wasn't making shit up last year, I was getting it from other news sources.    Basically, mainstream news follows this paradigm:  issue happens.  correspondent covers it.  finds something fishy is going on.  checks information with a source.  source is in power, and would be adversely affected by this story.  source says the fishiness doesn't exist.  story dropped.  nine months later, the cover-up stalls, and story breaks mainstream.  power source who said it was nothing earlier now says "we had misinformation" or "that was a long time ago" or "we all must focus on the task at hand."  story dies.    Gotta love public relations.    This all comes back around to a documentary I want to shoot where I go to Norway to find my dad's side of the family.  I've always wanted to tie it to immigration, but now I wonder if I can extend it to more of a world theatre view of America today, versus 100 years ago when my grandfather came over.  Personally, I'm not happy with the state of this country at the present, especially in its foreign policy.  And while I will see improvement under John Kerry, it's mostly because Bush will be out of office unable to fuck more stuff up.  That I hope that Kerry can get us back to the mediocre status quo we held under Clinton says just how awful George W.'s tenure has been.    I wonder if it will work.    Thinking about this documentary gets me thinking about my dad, who again is missing.  He does this ever so often...doesn't contact people, won't return calls.  Granted, I don't call him, but his mom does.  He's supposed to send information to them so we can do this Living Estate thing, and he won't do it, probably because there is already a lien on the property.  Suffice it to say, I am not the biggest fan of my dad's.  I actually could be, and I'm not really a fan.  Anyone who wants to see how alcohol can ruin someone, come talk to me.    The sexy stoner...we had a real visceral moment last night, where somehow the conversation came and I said something and it spurred her to tell me that her dad was dead.  Lung cancer from smoking.  He was an alcoholic too.  We shared something in common.  And we both kind of just shrugged it off...it's sad when it gets to that point, where a parent can be in a world of trouble, and it affects you less than someone cutting you off in traffic, because you've dealt with it so much it just lost its importance somewhere.    This is all kind of a lie, as I'm sure when he dies I'll be shook up for not having been able to help him.  I'm afraid of him, I'm afraid of bringing it up.  I've done it before, to pourous results.  He's tried.  He couldn't do it.  It's kind of sad, but when you see how he treats others, it's tough to steadfastly support him... that's just the alcohol talking .  Anyway, the fight to find compelling audience fodder for this documentary continues.

      Found the boyfriend of sexy stoner girl mowing the neighbors' lawn this afternoon...a wave, a smile, and he let me use his lawnmower to hit my yard.  Girl wasn't there.  Had she been, I wonder perchance she whisper in my ear as I make circles in my grass, spraying each other in moist mulch.

      Working on some points for the TIP workshop...fervently excited as I determine what these kids should see that they haven't seen before.  For them to become strong writers in three weeks would be incredible, and probably won't happen.  So I'm all about planting seeds...teaching outline writing, focusing on craft, and introducing them to a world of art and culture they don't realize exists.  They'll leave TIP as the cool kids.    Hole in the Wall last night for beers with Brian, expecting neighbors Holly and Lunchbox to be there...we got Katie instead, which isn't bad at all, just contrary to expectations.  A student of mine from last semester worked the bar, hooking me up with rounds of free drinks, until I passed her the $5 tip, and she said it wasn't enough to cover my tab.  Fair enough.  She had a B in my class.    Brian and I enjoy ranking systems...and the phrase "in a pinch."  Ever so often, we'll pass someone (usually not attractive), and he'll throw out "1 through 10, what pinch must it be?"  I'm pretty tough to get for pinches, because I don't throw my manly weight around too coquettishly...I can withstand famine-like pinches.    Last night, Brian points out a girl sititng with the party we composed of.  "1 through 8, in a pinch?"  I looked at the girl, who I had looked at a lot that night, and couldn't help but smile at Brian.  "No pinch necessary there," I said, laughing as Brian wasn't privy to the information I held.    "You're right," Brian said, and reveled in the girl's hardlined sexiness.    ---  One of my better posts of recent came on April 25, when I met up at neighbor porch party with sexy stoned girl.  The passing of a month helped me forget such childish things, as lament isn't a verb I use to describe my actions.  She was hot, she was into me, she had a boyfriend.  It sucked that day, and it was over.  I wasn't going to see her again.  Except there she was at Hole in the Wall, her boyfriend playing pool with his brother, who dates Katie.  I did my best to stay away from Amy, knowing things couldn't go well (depending on your point of view, it might be things that go real well).  Clearance was figured when I saw boyfriend smother his hippie queen in arms and deep kisses after most pool shots.  And I was on the other side of the party conversation, telling my sardonic jokes and keeping the drunks entertained.    Of course she didn't see fit to keep things at bay.  She walked over, and we started conversation quickly.  And there was a lot of touching on her part...hand on my arm, hand on my back, hand in my hand.  Hand on my ass.  Hand again on my ass.  Hand sliding from the back to the ass.  Hand dangling against the crotch.    I was of little reciprocation, constantly fighting the moral battle in my mind, knowing I have no affiliation to home dude, knowing I will be gone in six days, knowing that the glory of a round with said home chick would be nothing short of exquisite, exquisite of course a euphamism for FUCKING GLORIOUS!  All the while understanding the call of the society, knowing what paths you push, and what roads you leave barren.  My compromise to the situation was that I would allow whatever was going on, all the while doing nothing to provoke, if we can assume that charm and charisma is not a mitigating factor of the scenario =)    They left early, once again me shaking the boyfriend's hand, a firm, eye to eye, no hard feelings handshake.  I left it with her in a handshake, but not a firm handshake, and not really a shake at all...just a hand.  Inside of another hand.  Held for several seconds.  We let go, I smiled.  She got her purse.  Then came back and hugged me tight.  No words said.  The hand slipped to the butt again.  A few circles and a pinch.  I could only pat her shoulder and attempt to hide any enjoyment had.    He's got to understand if he's with her.  I'm not a bad guy.  He's a sexy beast; I'm most attractive when you combine the personality with the looks rather than let one hold court.  She's looking for both possibly, or she just craves attention (seemingly odd, as the two times I've met her she has played WallFlower perfectly, only emerging to twist tongues with me).    Whatever the case.  I go home unhappy, loathing the situation, understanding that one slight twist of the givens has hippie chick spending my last night with my twin bed with me.  Today, I wake up, alone, smiling the shit-eating grin, understanding that the ego boost she provides can be a bittersweet enough.

      Mission Statement July 2004  The forced writing is a tumultuous affair.&nbsp; It can feel so good, and read so miserable, especially for a rundown writer struggling to keep pushing on amidst a plethora of strife.&nbsp;   I notice my writing can tend toward melancholy, quite a change from the personality nodes found in social enterprise.&nbsp; Is it an opportunity to express some nefarious inner workings of my soul, a cavernous deep I prefer hidden from the acquaintance train of daily existence?&nbsp; I don’t easily think so, but it’s difficult to say.&nbsp; I’m a comic in person, a dramatist on the page.&nbsp; To get inside it could be fun, but right now the words here are enough.&nbsp;   What happens after this?&nbsp; Writing.&nbsp; That is the answer, folded twice and hidden preciously in enriched envelope, for removal in years time.&nbsp; No matter what tools I hold in fist, whatever trade or craft I employ for a living wage, my free time must seriously consist of writing, writing, and writing again.&nbsp;   Two years ago, I left a miserable library job at UT-Arlington.&nbsp; To call it miserable is unfair, because I enjoyed the people and it was a job with a mediocre but not paltry wage.&nbsp; To call the job worthwhile, however, would be a gross overstatement.&nbsp; UT-Austin called my number on the MA in Screenwriting, and I dreamt of baubles and wonderment from the glorified career that is professional screenwriter.&nbsp; I saw myself within fist’s reach of my goal, the closest I had ever been to something so exceptional.  Two years later, I am not a professional screenwriter. &nbsp;I don’t see myself able to grab the ring of saleable work tomorrow, nor the next day or the day after.&nbsp; My writing is not yet exceptional.&nbsp;   But I would call myself a writer.&nbsp; And I hold that title with more seriousness than I ever have before.&nbsp; I have a goal, and I plan to push as hard as I can muster in order to reach it.&nbsp; I don’t write pretty scripts.&nbsp; I don’t write high-concept fare that will make Shane Black or Jerry Bruckheimer sprinkle his BVDs, a ¾ chub of scriptitious excitement.&nbsp; I write the indie drama, the story that people ought to see, that people would enjoy, that could someday change the way we look at things if enough people got out there and my writing improved enough.&nbsp; I write to tell a story, not to make money.&nbsp;   And I write.&nbsp; And I understand craft.&nbsp; And I love craft.&nbsp; And I love outlining.&nbsp; And I love putting the words to the page.&nbsp; And I love taking two hours over one pestering sentence.&nbsp; And I hate every bit of it all of the time, and I love it beyond the mere scope of one page’s words.&nbsp; I don’t want to imagine myself not doing it.&nbsp;   Duke TIP was once again, one of the greatest experiences of my life.&nbsp; Last year I coined it my Renaissance Birth, a coming-of-age redux for a man (first time I’ve called myself a man and decided to keep it based on age and responsibility index) shat down after wide-eyed Centery-esque post-grad dreams.&nbsp; The person I was at Centenary was the person I was at Duke TIP 2003, and the person I want to be.&nbsp;   The person I was at Duke TIP 2004 was a different person, but still the person I want to be.&nbsp; The pre-summer issues at hand (and the strong lesson learned that some things are best left unwritten), I knew TIP would be my savior.&nbsp; I needed the job this year like I needed the job last year.  I have no time to rewrite this, which saddens me, as I turn some fine phrasing in several paragraphs, and end others with venerable slough.&nbsp; Regardless, the muse must continue.&nbsp; This job came at the right time in my life, and the promotion from residential to instructional added a new challenge, a new responsibility, and a sheer lack of time to dwell on the sadness in the background.&nbsp;   The most interesting aspect of teaching this summer is, I am a better writer today than I was when I finished my thesis.&nbsp; Much better.&nbsp; Teaching 37 kids over two months the rules and regulations of form, grammar, outlining, idea development, research, and methodological word choice broke me of habits ingrained since I was their age.&nbsp; Just then, I planned to use ellipses after word choice, but remembering my teaching doctrine to the students, I stepped in with a new phrase.&nbsp; Discipline achieved for instructor.&nbsp;   They’re young.&nbsp; Many of them don’t get it.&nbsp; But you can see that some of them do.&nbsp; Lights turned on and off throughout the course.&nbsp; Some were here to play with friends, others were here because of their parents, and a proud few came because this was what they wanted to do with themselves, nothing else.&nbsp; And all left with more writing knowledge and at least a stronger discipline subconsciously.&nbsp;   I owe the staff a letter.&nbsp; I’m the writer, the one who turns the phrase with the greatest of ease, wrapping my audience in comfortable velvet linens, tucking in the corners, and winding them the greatest bedtime story ever told.&nbsp; And a kiss on the forehead before sleep.&nbsp;   They deserve it.&nbsp; I met a lot of wonderful people, and made friends, not acquaintances, but friends with people I hope to keep in touch with for a long time to come.&nbsp; It didn’t happen after year 1, but there were few I really had a strong taking to.&nbsp; This year was different on that.&nbsp; I had trouble leaving Global Dialogues because of a wonderful experience, but a lot of that was a memory of who I had always wanted to be.&nbsp; This time, I leave with a sad heart because life will never be this way again with these people, and that’s a sad time, because we enjoyed every last moment of it.&nbsp;   I am happy to get my life back, though.&nbsp; The key is what I am going to do with it.&nbsp; It’s in that envelope, tucked away for safe keeping, to open once a dream is realized.&nbsp;

      After chastising the House of Representatives for voting against a bill that would allow the United Nations to oversee our 2004 Presidential election, Florida Rep. Corrine Brown was censured by the House after calling the 2000 election a "coup d e'tat," and her remarks were stricken from the roll.&nbsp;  &nbsp; That's censorship.&nbsp; I'm a Robert's Rules guy, and that's still censorship.&nbsp; Were she yelling from her seat, it's one thing, but she had the floor.&nbsp; Things she said before she was out of order were stricken...censorship. &nbsp; The only news that covered it was NBC, and they called it an "outburst," neglecting to mention any of what Brown said, or the UN issue.&nbsp; I guess when we've got West Nile and terror, we forget about stolen elections and the hypocrisy that our country runs at.&nbsp; Good work, news! &nbsp; Want to listen to it?&nbsp;  urlLink try here .&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Mixing 80s is much like linear editing, including my lack of knowledge in cutting down to strictly drum and bass.  I'll have to spend mad to get the right system, and I assume manufacture drum and bass through another system to match the drum and bass in the song I'm mixing from.  Lots of work for giggles.  But what are hobbies if you can't kill yourself over them.    What I'm kind of writing on now -   Fantasy story about our war in Iraq and other places Three Strikes script - redraft Mobsters and Opera short script - redraft Debate comedy - outline  And that's just stuff touched in the last week.  Goal - wake up early enough to write an hour each morning while here.  Ha!

      I should be writing.  But isn't this writing?  Isn't any bit of writing I do now the same as any other mess?  None of it is for a grade?  So while working on a project is admirable, it's no more important in the schema.    Listening to pop-grunge like Nickelback and Trapt, specifically because it is in iambic pentameter.  Students think cadence to writing is dead.  What better than white guys singing about cliche feelings to prove my point?    They didn't take well to Franz Ferdinand.  Or Johnny Cash.  Maybe some Rob Zombie?    Went to Exchange Club with Bill, my grandma's husband who I guess is my grandfather now, but it's odd, because it is removed bunches.  Anyway, got introduced, shook a lot of hands, had that benevolent smile up the whole time.  Good folks.  Went shopping for some swank black kicking/dress shoes, but opportunity cost wasn't high enough.  So I bought a few shirts at PacSun.    STORY - Never in my life have I enjoyed righteous game with a girl at a store in the town of dwelling.  But when I'm on vacation, it's mad money.  Today, a sexy crop cut blonde wearing the wifebeater, nose rock, red highlights rings me up.  We get to talking, everything's cool, except my 85 year old 4'11" grandmother is there, trying to peek up over the counter to look, and it's obvious she doesn't agree with my muse's fashion choices, specifically the high seriousness with which bra strap played into the wardrobe.  But I don't care, and in fact it's quite the turn-on.  She laughs at some things I throw out in passing, and it's kind of a nervous energy, something I rarely get in the hippie cities, where immersion is complete (I've realized that I'm an Arkansas hippie; I think one way, but my foibles cast me a different way, leaving me in constant awe of those who are given completely to the free love/free weed cause).  She graduated Fayetteville High three, four years ago, and is in school, though I don't know what...he friend is in photojournalism though, found out after discussing my want to buy a swank camcorder.    But what can exist?  She rings me up, wishes me luck, I thank her, and I walk off.  Look back.  She's looking.  All I need to do is go back into the store, and throw the glory line out   I know this is forward, but I'd like to take you out for dinner if you're free tonight.  Nothing serious, I'm leaving town in a day...just something to do.   But the line is bullshit, and no matter how I try to dress it, it still sounds like schmuck trying to get laid in a one'er.  I leave.  Walk a ways, wishing I had left something in the store so I could go back.  And I had left something!  My shoes!  From earlier, the sandals I picked up.  I had to hang them on something to try on a necklace.  They are still there!  She is still there!  No more being a pussy!   I walk back, energy in my step.  Grandma waits outside.    And right in front of me is a slow moving curly haired dicktard, loafing at a pace great for stoners but terrible for anxious guys trying to weave with girls.  I pass him in a bout of awkwardness, getting the attention of the girl.    In my mind, I go over the line again.  It's not that bad.    Yeah, it really is.    I pick up my bag.   Wow!  I hadn't seen that!  she says, obviously hoping I will step ten paces closer and ask for the number, unaware of my indecisiveness and lack of sufficient address in town.  I smile big at her and turn around.  It's still on my mind.

      I'm still here.  Things are pretty good.  Moving fast.  Not writing enough, but thinking constantly, storing information for later.  Understanding the craft better than I did before; wanting to understand it for the first time.  Improvement.    Not inspired at this moment for this blog though.  It'll come back.  Hopefully soon.  No promises though.

      I'm not meaning to stay off this thing, but developments in California and a lack of places with fast internet kill me here.  My time online is wholly devoted to job searches, as a dial-up connection doesn't leave much time for my usual grabass.   California -- good.  Doing some writing each day, relaxing a lot, back to where I wanted to be when I got out of school.  I know I can get a good job, and I'm lucky I've got some savings in case things don't work so quick.  I'd like to stay in Austin, but that's a bitch city to find work in.  California is nice but expensive, and Los Angeles sucks my ass.  San Francisco would be great, but I know no one.   The writing is good.  Great story I'm working on right now.   More blogging later.  I need to make it a habbit again.  It used to be an addiction, and that's when it was at its best.  We'll get back there.  Once I'm back to a town of wireless internet glory.

      Moving on today...  Last year, I wrote a great letter after I left Wake Forest.  The next term, not as much.  I started one yesterday, but it just didn't have the spark, and I didn't have the time to redraft it, and we were going out, and if I get it to people a few days late, I feel like the energy held today will be gone.  Letter writing is an exact science in many regards, much akin to any formulaic writing, which is what most writing is, really.   I drive today.  To Albuquerque.  Then on to Palm Springs.  Got 2-3 weeks planned there...haven't vacationed that long in years.  Hopefully I can knock out an outline and a few pages of this script I've got floating around.  24 hours of car ride won't hurt the creative process.  Maybe I can also think of where I'm going to move after this.  That's the really big one.  I have ambitions, I have dreams, I have goals...but I need a city.  I'd like to have a home again.  I could make San Diego my home, but it is so far from everything I've come to know.  I'm taking nothing and no one, and yes I'll have old friends who are great, but I don't feel like leaving so many of the new ones.  I like the South.  It's comfortable.  I've grown to love it.   That's why the job is so important; it dictates where I go.  The Maine thing seemed pretty nice, except for where it was.  Another job like that would be okay, but not really what I want to do.  I've got this year to write.  The original plan was to nomadically travel a bit.  I'd love to still do that, but fear crept in with my dad's death.  Fear existed regardless, but underlined and boldened by that.   It's going to work out.  I will make it work.  This is what I want to do.  Schedule.  Structure.  Something wonderful to pass my days with.  Work.  Hard work.  Good work.  Honest work.  And a city that I can call my own...at least until I go back to grad school for the Ph.D. =)  Kansas, you were great.  And a staff I will miss tremendously.
