      The US Army has had to admit that a man that has enjoyed iconic hero status in the US, former NFL player Patrick Tillman, was killed in Afghanistan in a friendly fire incident ( urlLink Independent ). Tillman, who turned down a $3.6 million football deal to serve with the US Rangers after 9/11, has been the subject of reams of newsprint since his death last month, with articles in every major international and US magazines, including Time and Newsweek. The embarrassment for the US Army comes after they reported that he had died attacking a legion of better armed enemy combatants and had been issuing fire orders until he was cut down by enemy fire. The Independent reports that he was standing next to an Afghan soldier who was mistaken for an enemy combatant, and further, that there were no enemy troops in the area at the time. Tillman was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and the Silver Star. Given that at the time, the 'War on Terror' was going through a very tough time, it's clear that the US Army needed national heroes. Whilst it does not change his sacrifice in joining the Rangers, it's a sad day when his "ultimate sacrifice" turns out to be at the hands of his own comrades, but even more so when the US Army attempts to take advantage of the situation for their own means...

      The UK's Northern Irish minister is on his way to SA to review our Truth and Reconcilliation Commission, reports the  urlLink Mail & Guardian . One wonders how they will have to adjust the process to their historical conflict, and who they select on their panel. Integral to the success of our TRC was the leadership and compassion of Archbishop Tutu, and it will be interesting to see who will be selected to head up the commission, and if that person can give it the crediblity it requires to be successful.

      Was Iran the secret mastermind behind the Bush Iraq war? This is the question of the week after the raid on Ahmed Chalabi's home last week by US forces and the revelation that he had very strong diplomatic ties to Iran's Islamic government. The  urlLink Guardian  this morning asks the question whether the hawks in the Pentagon were manipulated into the Iraq war thrust by false information delivered through Ahmed Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress. This would then give Iran a friendly Islamic led government at the expense of the unpredictable and hostile Hussain.   With much of the pre-war intelligence built around information provided by Chalabi, this could have disastrous implications for both the Pentagon and the White House. What I'm surprised about is that this investigation was made public, given the enormous potential for embarrassment it holds, especially with the secretive nature of this neo-conservative US government. What seems to have happened is that it's become the usual intelligence turf war between the Pentagon and the CIA, with the CIA calling publicly for this investigation.

      Bush's Iraq speech last  urlLink night   brought two interesting talking points. Firstly, his comments on the proposed destruction of the Abu Ghraib prison as a symbolic gesture. Whilst it is clear that he was forced into this speech by recent polling data on Iraq, as well as the recent wave of scandals, most recently the Chalabi incident, it is difficult not to see Bush as a leader that is increasingly desperate in the face of weakening power. His comments on the destruction of Abu Ghraib is a transparent attempt to bring closure to the abuse scandal by making the Abu Ghraib prison an isolated area of abuse, in order to sweep any systemic abuse problems under the carpet. Bush is undoutedly desperate to get this abuse scandal behind him, and insofar as the fact that this speech was largely an election speech rather than a policy speech, it is debatable whether the American public will be misled by this red herring.   Secondly, he also stated in the speech, "Iraqis will write their own history, and find their own way." My question is this: What would happen if, in the democratic elections in January, the Iraqi people chose to bring to power a party that endorsed a theological Islamic government as opposed to a multi-party democracy? Would the US stand for this? Would all that work, and all those 'coalition' deaths, be in vain? What scares me is how much Bush is relying on the creation of this democratic state, and how far he will be willing to intervene in the affairs of a sovereign country in order to make good on his 2004 election promises.  Kerry's response will be interesting, as for all his road work, he really hasn't seemed to make much connection with the US public on key election issues such as Iraq. The question six months away from the election is, whilst this election is largely going to be a referendum on bush, can he bring out enough of his political personality and policy positions to catch enough of the swing vote to propel him into the Oval Office?

      "Absolute power corrupts absolutely"  First of all, Thabo Mbeki's state of the nation address is available off the government website. Click  urlLink here .  I've been thinking a lot about the ANC's two-thirds majority recently, and absorbing the substantial media debate surrounding the issue. As I've said before, intensely authoritative Mbeki is, I cannot see him changing the constitution to hold onto power for another term. But what is imperative, is the development of a strong opposition to keep the ANC's power in check. But this is essentially the root of the problem, as a strong opposition cannot be foreseen in the perhaps the next two ANC terms.  In Leon's own party newsletter, he states "By our own analysis, the DA represents a staggering 76% of white South Africans and approximately 2% of black South Africans. Indian and coloured voters are fairly evenly split between the DA and the ANC, and small fringe parties such as the Independent Democrats and the Minority Front show evidence of ethnic support among Indians and coloureds. In other words, one of the untold stories of the 2004 general election is the extraordinarily high levels of ethnic consolidation." This ethnic consolidation cannot hold for the long term. As the ANC continues to bask in the post-1994 honeymoon period, with blind support from the Apartheid oppressed masses, the time will soon come where delivery will be the forefront of government, rather than our racist past. But to take advantage of this, opposition policy has to be on consolidation of their own power bases. Every political party will extol their challenges in crossing over to other ethnic voting bases, but in my mind, at least for the next ten years, this is simply not going to prove a strategy that allows for one party to provide a strong opposition.   Whilst minority opposition parties jostle for position as big fish in a small pond, their focus should rather be on partnerships that can create an inclusive opposition party that cannot be immediately dismissed as being 'anti-South African' or hold 'racist agendas' as almost all opposition parties are accused of being at present. The IFP and DA's partnership in KZN was a start, but more inclusivity is needed to take the mandate of the opposition beyond single ethnic groups and into an opposition that can be supported by a diverse cross-section of the population for the policies and promises they offer, rather than the enthnicity they represent.   Only then will there be a check to the ANC's power, and only then, will there be the requisite antidote to the mantra "Absolute power corrupts absolutely."  On a different tack, have a read of this great article in the  urlLink Guardian  today, about both Bush and Kerry being part of the Order of the Skull and Bones when at Yale. Within the first year of Bush's presidency, all but one of the other 14 Bonesmen from the class of 1968 had spent a night at the White House. Conspiracy theory, anyone?

      Bring out the scapegoats!  So the Abu Ghraib torture trials have started. Today, the first of the fools, Spc Sivits, goes on trial in Baghdad, and the Western World looks to punish the 'guilty' as quick as possible so we can all forget about this mess and go on building the Empire without any fuss. The problem is, I'm starting to feel pangs of irrational pity for these soldiers at the centre of the issue. As we found out recently in the now infamous  urlLink New Yorker  article, this type of socio-sexual torture comes right from the top. Similar, if not identical, techniques have been used in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, and these are clearly not all the work of loose cannons within the ranks. This is a directive that has to have come from the CIA/Pentagon's intelligence leaders that were under a significant amount of pressure from the Bush administration for immediate results. Pressure breeds pressure, and if the New Yorker's Hersh is correct, which would not surprise me, then there should be many more heads to roll. The chances of that happening? Very slim... These guys are the implementers, and are thus guilty as sin, but clearly they're taking the fall here. Ask the US Army, they're the guys that are the most incensed about it, as they take the fall for their political masters again!    As a concurrent theme to this debacle, Noami Klein writes a great piece in the UK's  urlLink Guardian  newspaper this week, noting that these soldiers were only in Iraq because they were desperate for work under Bush's "economic recovery". Sabrina Hartman was a pizza restaurant manager, whilst Lyndie England and Ivan Frederick were laid off prison guards. Also in this article is an interesting tit-bit about Bush trying to reclassify restaurants and fast-food outlets as 'manufacturing' enterprises to attempt to halt the rampant slide of job losses under the current manufacturing industry definition. Watch this space...

      With the NNP's party conference coming up in three weeks, let's hope it's their last. Tacking the word "New" onto the party seered into the minds of this country's population for all the wrong reasons was never a viable long-term strategy. The NNP has simply not found its feet, its voice, or a truly defendable political position, and has as such lurched from mindless standpoint to mindless partnership, ever more desperate as the years go by. For me, the moment the NNP started calling the DA racist sounded their death-knell, and for a political party with their heinous past, strong leadership with a solid political strategy was their only hope, and in Kortbroek, strong leadership they did not have. Farewell New National Party...

      Had a great weekend of reading up in a hut in the mountains of Bains Kloof. South Africa won the 2010 World Cup Football bid, which is truly awesome news. Anything that can generate in excess of 160 000 jobs for this country is fantastic. Well done to Danny Jordaan and the team, although it was sad to see how old Nelson is looking. He really needs to slow down, and I hope that was his last overseas trip. The old man deserves some peace.  On another note, there was a very interesting article in the British newspaper, The  urlLink Telegraph , this weekend, where Helen Suzman attacked the ruling ANC government, and branded Thabo Mbeki as racist. This is an interesting challenge from a woman that needs no introduction (and who is impervious to accusations of racist agendas) and one which I wish would open up more constructive debate on the government in South Africa. Much discussion has been made recently in this vein, although very little in our own (fairly toothless) media, but rather in the foreign media, with the result that debate and criticism is largely underdeveloped. Mbeki, as one of the exile ANC leaders, holds a markedly distinct view of reconcilliation from Mandela, and one which may not entirely run parallel to what South Africans expected in the continuation of the Mandela era. I do think that Suzman raises some important points, and that, as South Africans, we should be more critical of our leadership. Whilst at present, any criticism is easily washed away by the ruling government as racist diatribe, this will not always be the case, and in lieau of a strong opposition in Parliment, the public has to take the lead on keeping the government on its toes.   Whilst personally, I think Mbeki has done a laudable job in keeping South Africa politically stable through what has been a challenging time, his views on HIV/AIDS and Zimbabwe will no doubt define his presidency. I think many of us forget what  could   have happened to this country, both after the 1994 elections, and after Mandela stepped down as president. Nontheless, Mbeki does hold views that are notably, if subtly, anti-white, and in my view, he has tried too hard to define himself as an international figure, when South Africa is crying out for domestic action.

       Bush on Middle East Democracy...again  George W Bush has been hitting the  urlLink democracy campaign  trail again, this time at the Galatasaray University in Istanbul. Here he enunciated his assertion that "removing Saddam Hussein from power set the stage for a democratic transformation in Iraq that would inspire reformers in other countries." Excuse me for opening my eyes, but I hardly think Iraq is a poster child for simple and safe transformation to American-style democracy. Bremer's mismanagement of an intensely difficult situation in Iraq, and especially his decisions to purge the government and civil service of Ba'athists and demobilize 200 000 armed Iraqi soldiers, has allowed the insurgent terrorists to effectively dissuade any other Islamic country from "modernising" to democracy.   This poses a thorny problem to Bush with five months to go to the election, as he has to show the US public that the decision to go to war in Iraq could effectively spread democracy in the Middle East and give the US more leverage in handling the Israel-Palestine issue. It has to be said though, that Kerry's voice, for a candidate supposedly strong on foreign affairs, has been conspicuous in its absence.  Bush has also been forced to give a little away on the bargaining table to assist in US-Islamic state relations. Muslim countries have been especially incensed by US anger at Islamic states for upholding despots and tyrants, given the CIA's involvement in developing Osama bin Laden to his current stature, the Iran-Contra affair and US relations with Saddam Hussein in the late 80's. Bush acknowledged in his speech that "Western nations have helped nourish extremism by supporting repressive Middle Eastern leaders for the sake of regional stability", before he quickly added "but it did not serve the people of the Middle East to betray their hope of freedom, and it has not made Western nations more secure to ignore the cycle of dictatorship and extremism."

       US resumes diplomatic ties with Libya  Despite rumours of political assassination plots, (see previous   post )  Gaddafi has got what he wanted, diplomatic and trade ties with the US. The  urlLink  Washinton Post   reports that with a letter from Bush and a ceremonial opening of the US Liaison Office in Tripoli, the US has opened its arms to the former pariah.  Taking this step whilst in the middle of a State Department investigation into the allegations infers that this is an intensely political move. Bush is desperate for successes in his fight against terrorism, and Gaddafi represents a major victory, a former symbol of terrorism entering the "free" fold. (We won't even get into the implications of dropping the sanctions on Libya's vast oil resources!)  It's a brave move that could backfire immensely should the State Department uphold the assassination allegations in their report, and it's indicative of a leadership that knows how tight the forthcoming election is going to be.

       Gun license chaos reinforces implementation weaknesses  Today the gun saga continues, with the government saying the press has it all  urlLink wrong  , whilst gun shop owners claim the government has  urlLink  rejected   all their new applications, and the security industry is still taking the government to court to get an interdict against the implementation of the new laws.   This just reinforces the weaknesses in implementation of government policy. Whether the press gets it right or wrong, the blame for the confusion lies squarely at the door of the policy implementers. Again, why wasn't this explained to stake-holders, and the press, in a methodical way well prior to the Thursday's deadline. If the introduction of the law is three days away, can you seriously blame the press for "getting it wrong" if they had no prior information from the government to dissuade their argument. Moreover, surely the policy implementers would have taken note when the security industry applied for an interdict, and realised that some public relations, both through the press and directly with stakeholders, was neccessitated?   Mbeki has to force the civil service to lift their game, it's something so central to the 'real' delivery of value in his policies, and it may well be something his entire presidency will be judged on.

       Implementation failures in Government delivery  Whilst I again have to deplore Independent Newspapers' use of rather salascious headline  urlLink copy , a story they have written in The Star is another in a series of questionable rollouts of government policy.  Mbeki has rightfully trumpeted the need for delivery in this term and has created some very commendable and valuable social reform programs, but the implementation leaves a significant amount to be desired. The problem lies in the organisational capacity of the regional civil service structures that need to implement, publicise and service these programs. Recent history here in Cape Town highlights the problem perfectly. Firstly, the car licensing issues last year. Yes, there had been a deadline in place to convert to new car licenses, but local government gave the public more credit than they deserved in expecting them to contact their government branches to find out when the deadline was. The result: a huge media campaign one week before the deadline waving a big penalty stick, which forced thousands of motorists on unprepared traffic departments, leaving multi-block queues, large overtime pay bills and huge losses in productivity. Similarly, the deadline for traffic fine payment, the local AIDS drug rollout and the implementation of the FICA laws are further examples.   Which brings me to this article on gun laws. It's a great idea that the government is going to clamp down on gun laws and attempt to make guns and gun licenses harder to gain, I support it 100%, but again, a terrible job has been done in consulting the relevant parties, managing the process and publicising the proposed alterations. Millions of individuals and businesses in this country rely on private security forces to provide personal and enterprise security in our high-crime environment. Now we are told that as of Thursday this week, no person will be allowed to carry a gun without a competency permit, inferring that South Africa's 50 000 security personnel will require approved competency training in the next four days (a task industry expert say will take more than 16 months to complete), should they wish to carry a gun. Clearly, criminals will not be rushing to get their training, and all we have is another messy situation that leaves us all more vulnerable.  Forgive me for sounding like a true capitalist, but this kind of project management is a basic business technique and should not be beyond the skills of any mid-level manager in local government. Intelligent programs are fantastic, but they are nothing without intelligent implementation.

       Mbeki's big move  All of the papers have covered Mbeki's 'jump to the left', but I think the  urlLink Business Day  offers the best reporting. In a marked ideological shift, Thabo has expressed his displeasure at liberal and neo-liberal US conservatives and their penchant for free market economics and minimal influence of the state.  Mbeki contrasts the American new conservatives stance with the ANC's and firmly flies the flag with leftist ideology, saying that the "obligations of the democratic state to the masses of our people do not allow that we should join those who celebrate individualism and denigrate the state. We could never succeed to eradicate the legacy of colonialism and apartheid if we joined the campaign to portray the social, collective and the public realm as the enemies of prosperity and individual autonomy."   Personally, I agree that the strict adherence to a free market economy in South Africa is not a strong enough tool to alleviate poverty in the short term. We require state interference to redress social inequity and poverty alleviation, our past necessitates that. I cannot agree that the American form of strict individualistic and capitalistic principles can achieve any kind of moral and economic balance in this country.    At the same time however, I do believe in the need for adherence to property rights. In a move that reinforces Land and Agriculture Minister Thoko Didiza's current thoughts, Mbeki notably mentioned property rights a number of times during his speech within the context of policy principles that are not necessarily in the best interests of the South African masses. Whilst this obviously doesn't herald Thabo's new dawn as a land-grab president, every word he says on property rights has substantial implications for international investment and business confidence, and ambiguity cannot be allowed.  The central question though, is how far Mbeki will go in the extension of these principles. We can all see the logic in his statements, but the door is wide open as to what actionable policy is drawn from them. What are the implications on property rights, labour law, taxation etc. In this his delivery term, things could get interesting...

       The Dangers of Western-style Democracy Implementation  Martin Jacques comments in the  urlLink Guardian  today on the dangers of uniform implementation of Western-style democracy around the world. It’s a subject I’ve touched on before, and is a premise in which I believe very strongly.  Jacques argues that Western-style democracy is something that has only been developed over the past half century since the defeat of fascism, and even more so since the defeat of communism. Its success in its final free economic form has been based significantly on pre-form stable economic structures and even cultural societies, and it has been proven as a poor mechanism for early-stage economic growth.  “Democracy, historical experience suggests, is not that well-suited to achieving the conditions necessary for economic takeoff. Given that democracy is now the universal western prescription for developing countries, this is rather ironic.” This is especially pertinent when one considers the forceful introduction of Western-style democracy in Iraq.  Secondly, Western democracy remains a difficult instrument in diverse multi-ethnic societies where majority ethnic groups can rule over minorities.   “The west remains oblivious to the profound difficulties presented by ethnic diversity. As Amy Chua points out in World on Fire, democracy is far from a sufficient condition for benign governance in the kind of multiracial societies that are common in Africa and Asia. Democracy, the politics of the majority, allows the majority ethnic group to govern, potentially without constraint. Multi-ethnic societies, like Malaysia or Nigeria, require, for their stability, a racial consensus: democracy, resting on majorities and minorities, is deaf to this problem. Moreover, democracy works very differently in different cultures.”   It is these differences that we have to take into account. What the US/UK is in great danger of being responsible for, is the creation of a politically expedient client democracy, which last for half a decade, under which ecnomic growth is stagnant, and extremists flourish, before it is overrun by an extermist dicatator once more, and we are all back to square one.  All I am conveying is that applying Western-style democracy into the Muslim world requires a significant amount of careful consideration. A rigid, blanket application, forced or otherwise, will simply not be in the best long-term interests for both Iraq and the Western world. There has to be some compromise made in conjunction with the Iraqi people, under their own ethnic realities and cultural history (with the obvious exception of human rights abuses) where aggressive economic and political Western-style democracy is tempered to fit Iraq’s needs.

       Zim Property Rights Back-Track  Mugabe's government has  urlLink back-tracked  on recent statements of the nationalisation of all private land in Zimbabwe. "Citing a letter by foreign ministry official Joe Bimha to Zimbabwe embassies abroad, the Sunday Mail reported that the government would be nationalising only the land it had seized under its land reform programme."   "The correct position is that all land acquired under the current phase of the land reform programme now reposes to the state," Bimha was quoted as saying.  I wonder whether this was a unheralded triumph for Mbeki's quiet diplomacy. Coming so soon after Mbeki's meeting with the International Investment Council in Cape Town, one wonders if Mbeki knew that this development in Zimbabwe was just too expensive for our economy in terms of international investment, and whether some serious behind-the-scenes negotiation happened over the last few days...

       Has Parliament Lost It's Mind?  Some depressing news out of our  urlLink legal fraternity  this morning. Stemming out of Parliamentary provisions from 1998 Amending Act on Magistrate's Courts, lay assessors will soon be in our courts with the power to overrule a regional magistrate's ruling in rape, murder or indecent assault cases, should they differ from him. This essentially takes the ruling out of the hands of the magistrate and will markedly retard the speed at which the courts operate, which is already unacceptably slow.  Somebody really needs to explain the logic of this one to me. How can we overrule a learned, experienced magistrate with two people off the street? Consult to yes, give a ruling which can be overruled by the magistrate, yes, but to give the power to the lay person is just ludicrous. Moreover, as News24 reports, if one of the two compulsory lay assessors is ill, the court is held up, and if one of the assessors is unable to continue, the case has to be closed and restarted from scratch.  The most inexplicable thing is that there are currently no clear guidelines on the selection of assessors, and no set specifications that the assessors have to adhere to. Without control over this selection process by both the prosecuting and defending parties, it becomes the easiest tool for corruption and manipulation by interested parties.   With the amount of crime and corruption in our fledgling democracy, the law has to remain a pillar of truth and transparency. This is a horribly regressive step, and I'm sure we will be hearing a lot more on lay assessors, probably in some forthcoming scandal...

      The  urlLink NY Times  reports that Rumsfeld admitted yesterday that he told jailers to keep a detainee in Iraq out of Red Cross view. He also is very quick to put the blame on to George Tenet, saying he had a written request from him to do so. Sounds a bit like a schoolyard fight where you blame the guy who's gone home...  Bush supporters are finding less and less dry ground to stand on, but the question is, is Middle America hearing these developments? The more liberal west and east coast media are very open with carrying these stories, but the media in traditional Republican Middle America is incredible controlling in the information they disseminate, and thus the information that these huge voting populations assimilate. Their control, along with the Rush Limbaugh Republican radio networks, may well be a large factor in the November elections.

      Apologies for the lack of posts this week, I've been away on holiday.  I love Cheney's nerve. Yesterday he launches a tirade against the media for evidence for "irresponsible" reporting, saying the evidence is "overwhelming" that al Qaeda had a relationship with Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. He cites that there is evidence that Iraqi officials met with Bin Laden in the early 90's. If he's going back that far, he may as well launch 'regime change' against the USA for dealings with both Bin Laden and Hussein in the late 80's. Remember that 'brotherly love' picture of Rumsfeld with Hussein? I don't think Dick does.  Anyway, the 9/11 commission has been investigating this for many months now, with access to all intelligence surrounding the decision to go to war, and of course, all the intelligence that the Bush administration could get to them that would help their cause. Cheney states that the media is "not doing their homework" in reporting the ties between Iraq and Bin Laden. He clearly needs an extra pair of hands to do his dirty work for him...

      I find media and leadership censure of Zimbabwe's latest land nationalisation policy conspicious in its absence.  The leadership of this country has fought long and hard for true freedom within our borders, yet it is ambivalent about Zimbabwe's recent slide, and now its rejection of a conerstone of democracy and freedom. The SA media has reported this occurence with very little judgement, and absolutely no alarm, simply reporting the story as if it was a policy decision in Uzbekistan. And once again, ANC leadership is silent.   Surely our media is not as toothless as not to ask a single question of our leadership's position? Are they perhaps too used to being rebuffed? The more our media toes the ANC party line and offers no investigation or resistance, the more we are left with a true one-party state, unquestioned, unchallenged and unanswerable to its people.

      This is just too juicy to ignore: "U.S. probes reports Gadhafi targeted top Saudi" from  urlLink MSNBC . Two separate men have claimed involvement in a Libyan plot to kill Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, with the two men claiming to have been instructed by Gadhafi in August last year, right at the time he was denouncing terrorism and cozying up to the West.

      Well, well, look out Mel Gibson. Thabo has firmly joined the conspiracy theorists in this morning's  urlLink ANC Today  newsletter. It really does seem that Mbeki is getting increasingly paranoid and agitated by what is simple opposition politics. His cries of 'dirty tricks' are coming through in his weekly newsletter, his recent speeches, and his ANC spokespeople. Does he really need to spend so much energy defending his party when he owns 70% of the electorate? Surely he should adopt the classic presidential approach and stay above it?  The DA, as powerful as they try to make themselves seem, are a 12% party, and yet the ANC is playing directly into their hands by getting involved in these leadership spats, which inherently projects the DA into both an automatic 'official opposition' role and one of more equal power in the perception of the public. The latest being the ongoing  urlLink SCOPA  saga. In my view, the ANC should be maintaining their divide and conquer approach. Keep above the petty politics, and let the opposition parties fight amongst themselves. It's what they did so successfully in the recent elections.

      The Bush-Blair show is fast becoming a real farce. The false hope they have been given by the UN vote has now led them to offer at the G8 summit plans for "greater Nato involvement in Iraq, plans to bring western-style democracy and economic reform to the Middle East and north Africa and a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict." World peace? AIDS? The Springbok flyhalf problem? Whilst they're at it, why not solve all the world's issues.  For once, I agree with Chirac. You cannot force American-style democracy on Islamic states, it simply does not fit. Islamic countries need to build their own style of democracy, taking into account their ideological Islamic needs, and their economic and social realities. Western values and Islamic values have grown in different paths over many centuries, and it is short-sighted and simplistic to assume that American democracy can be placed over current structures.  Of course, in reality, the timing smacks of electioneering. Both Bush and Blair are facing troubled waters with the US elections in November, and the probable UK elections early-mid 2005, a movement toward democratic values in the Middle East would be a vindication for much of the recent skewed Middle East foreign policy.

      I take it as a real triumph for the our fledgling democracy, and a lucid indication of how far this country has come in the last decade, when the release of Eugene Terreblanche on Friday raises very little media coverage, and the majority of the offered column space is laced with a subtle derision. Feared this man no longer is, and the non-white population of Ventersdorp will be greeting him with interest and amusement, akin to some sort of washed-out 80's electronica celebrity.   The  urlLink Mail & Guardian  reports that he will be "welcomed by a brass band and flanked by two riders, he will mount a black horse and parade through town to a hotel, where he will give a press conference." Question 1: Will he fall off? Question 2. Will anyone care?  I did have to chuckle at this quote from Terreblanche's lawyer, Gerrie Basson. "His ideology hasn't changed but he has become more tolerant. He's not a racist, more a xenophobe who respects his own kind more." One of the best euphemisms I've ever heard! 'A xenophobe who respects his own kind more', I think that inherently implies denigration of others that are not his 'own kind', doesn't it?

      Two great pieces in the news this morning. George Bush and Bob Mugabe. Enough said!  Firstly, the  urlLink New York Times  reports that Dubya was given some interesting legal advice last year. And I quote "A team of administration lawyers concluded in a March 2003 legal memorandum that President Bush was not bound by either an international treaty prohibiting torture or by a federal antitorture law because he had the authority as commander in chief to approve any technique needed to protect the nation's security."  Two things. One, I guess that puts paid to his assertion that Abu Ghraib was such a huge surprise for the President and his executive. Oh, and by the way, guess who requested the legal advice. Rumsfeld takes the line again...  Secondly, surely this legal advice is a moot point. As the leader of the much heralded world's only superpower, surely the man can see that if he is caught with that knowledge, and that the paper trail of torture led back to him, he would not be able to put out the flames of world opinion with a paper stock of legal advice?  And then on to Bob. I suppose it was just a matter of time. Once you've destroyed any semblance of a democracy in the electoral process, why not rip out the cornerstone of democracy and freedom - property rights.  urlLink Independent Newspapers  quotes Zim land minister John Nkomo as stating "In the end all land shall be state land and there will be no such thing called private land. We want a situation whereby this very important resource becomes a national asset. The state should not waste time and money on acquisitions. Ultimately, all land shall be resettled as state land," Nkomo said.   Forgive me for being trite, but sure, I suppose it wouldn't be too out of character for old Bob to build a statue of Lenin in Harare, revive the Cold War, join up with North Korea and China and atack the 'free' world. "Screw Iraq, check out our Axis of Evil", he'll rant! Aah well, maybe that'll incite Dubya to another regime change and put his new found "above-the-law" status to some good use for once...

      Intelligence in my inbox this morning from MEMRI (The Middle East Media Research Institute - If you haven't signed up for their newsletter, do it  urlLink here  now). MEMRI reports that Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has been attacking democracy, and liberal democracy more specifically, stating that "the source of all human torment and suffering is the 'liberal democracy' promoted by the West as 'progressive political thought'."   He goes on to say "The torment of the Iraqis, of the Palestinians, and even of the Americans are the direct outcome of liberal Western democracy, and this must serve as an important lesson to the rest of the world, [which must] open its eyes and understand that those who call themselves advocates of human rights and democracy are in fact the main supporters of crimes against humanity... The reason for [this] disgrace [i.e. Abu Ghureib] is [the fact that] liberal democracy is devoid of morality, while the political thought of Imam Khomeini respected morality in addition to democracy, and at the same time pinned its hopes on God."   Khamenei offers an echo of Ayatolla Khomeini's comment "One day the U.S. too will be history" and a prediction that in Iraq, the US "will taste the bitterness of sure defeat."   With US military and Pentagon hawks cranking up the narrative against Iran, and the recent Chalabi embarrassment illuminating Iran's manipulation of decision to go to war, the country is fast positioning itself in taking over North Korea's role of the US' state enemy number 1. Iran seems to be willing to take up formerly Qadhafi's, latterly Hussein's mantle as the largest Islamic state to actively and publicly oppose the US on the one platform it prides itself on - the moral high ground.  The Islamic world is becoming increasingly polarised by the the US 'War on Terror' and in particular, the Iraq war, with Saudi Arabia, Libya and Pakistan on one camp supporting the US, and the rest, led by Iran and Syria leading those ever more vociferous in their condemnation. Bush's emphatic doctrine 'You're either with us or against us' shattered every vestige of diplomacy and forced Islamic governments to choose, and the chickens are slowly coming back to roost. The question thus, is a docile ally like Pakistan worth more than an incited enemy like Iran?

      So Thabo is  urlLink attacking  the free market ideology at the African Economic Summit in Maputo the week. A great saucy headline from Independent Newspapers which is salaciously misleading. (No, Thabo's not brandishing the old hammer and sickle.)  Actually, I agree with Mbeki's point. Partly. Liberal I am, but I do feel that some state intervention is necessary, if only to redress financial imbalances that have been born from a direct result of past injustice. As pure liberals will tell you, the market's success will trickle-down to the poor eventually. It's the 'eventually' part that's gives me trouble. It takes time. And time is one thing the poor don't have in abundance.   There are certain causes that the private sector has no interest in, and whilst the market may lift the most deprived areas up when they've leveraged everything else, I do believe that the state has to assist in building up poverty-stricken areas so that they can at least take part in the market. As labels go, I'm not sure where that leaves me. Somewhere between liberal-democratic and social-democratic? I think I'll pin my flag more to the former!  Another point of interest was host African Economic Summit Joaquim Chissano's response to an assertion on behalf of business by Reuel Khoza that NEPAD's Peer Review Mechanism should have more teeth in order to deal with offending states. Chissano insisted that it would be wrong to try to drive a country into isolation. "You will never get a good system that way." Funny, I thought it was quite a successful way to force South Africa to reject Apartheid?

      Don't have much time this morning to post, but two good articles in the papers today. Firstly, from former New York Times editor Howell Raines in the UK  urlLink Guardian , a very balanced article on why Kerry is currently on path to lose the US election by his muddled message, and what he should be doing to alter his course.  Secondly, an article (technically yesterday!) on  urlLink News24 , where Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota postulates when South Africans will cease to be black, white and coloured and just be South African. Our recent history precedes us in this matter, and infers that viewing each other within ethnic boundaries has been ingrained in our past. One wonders whether this is merely a simple altering of mindset, or whether this 'rainbow nation' view will only be able to occur when all ethnic groups believe both that they are socially comfortable and unthreatened in South Africa, and when there has been some redressment for the past.   When this will mindshift come to fruition? That's the question, because it is a central proposition for South African political parties across the spectrum, from the ruling ANC to the 'official' opposition, the DA. When will the electorate look beyond voting on traditional party ethnic blocks and look toward issues voting, and voting on delivery of services and satisfaction?

      There's a very interesting article in Sunday's  urlLink Observer  regarding the upcoming D-Day commemorations in France. It's written by a writer from German newspaper De Welt, Thomas Kielinger, who laments the fact that the ongoing remembrances of WWII does not allow Germans to escape their past, almost two generations after the war. Whilst I agree with his sentiment, especially since this is the first year that a German leader has been invited to the commemorations, what interested me was a comment he makes on the stunted patriotism that Germans feel for their country, which he hypothesises is a direct result of "this curse of the visual record of inhumanity perpetrated lurking on the sidelines as if it happened only the other day".   This strikes me as a very interesting insight. As white South African youth, whilst not having been old enough to hold an understanding of, or an influence on, the Apartheid system, we have grown up with a distinct consciousness of our own race, and its position in the atrocities of the past. Is this perhaps a reason for the lack of true patriotism I see daily from white youth in South Africa? An underlying sense of shame about the country's past, which infers that they cannot truly believe themselves to be part of, and hence proud of, their country?

      All power to Hans Fabricius, SC!  Let's hope Manto Tshabalala-Msimang finally gets reigned in. The Pretoria High Court is currently hearing an appeal on behalf of 11 000 medical practitioners by the gloriously named Hans Fabricius, charging that her decision on dispensing regulations infringed on doctors' right to dignity, freedom of movement and of practicing their professions freely.  I cannot agree more. Whilst there are definite imbalances in private healthcare locations run down racial geography, the solution surely is in the partnering with the medical profession, not resorting to 'apartheid-like', draconian laws that define where a free doctor can or cannot employ his skills. The dispensing regulations force a doctor to choose between his profession and his community, something which smacks of the ultimate for of state interference. Surely this is a constitutional issue?  Perhaps this is where more liberal roots show, but I cannot believe that this much state interference can be in the best interests of the country.

       Mbeki launches his strongest attack yet on SA journalism  Thabo Mbeki has  urlLink continued  his unpresidential penchant for personally responding to media articles that he feels misrepresents him or his party, which I have commented on  urlLink before . This time Thabo has taken issue with a recent Sunday Times article entitled "Mbeki passes the buck on job creation", and his augmented his usual commentary in his 'ANC Today' newsletter with a broad attack on the South African media.  In this case, Mbeki's usual paranoia about media criticism has been heightened by his assertions that this second term is one of delivery. In this criticism, the Sunday Times is attacking the implementation of the Expanded Public Works program as a non-starter, which cuts to the very core of Mbeki's State of the Nation resolutions on delivery.   Many great business leaders enjoy micro-managing, but I am unconvinced that a president should be involved to this level. This is a government spokesperson's role, not a presidential role. Mbeki should be placing himself above the day to day commentary of the media and letting his party strategists shape government responses to criticism and respond through alternative channels. Personally attacking either an author (as he has shown want to do in the past), or in this case, a particular newspaper, only elevates the issue at hand to a wider audience and thus escalates the national commentary of the issue, usually with negative consequences for Mbeki.  But Mbeki has gone even further this time, launching into a tirade against the quality of South Africa's journalists and general media. Forsaking brevity, this needs to be quoted in full:  "The strange and false discoveries of the "Sunday Times" with regard to the EPWP raise a number of serious concerns. One of these relates to the quality of journalism in our country. The sorry tale told by the "Sunday Times" handling of the EPWP issue points to the reality of a serious national problem. Questions must necessarily arise about the extent to which we, and the general public, can rely on the media as a source of objective information, on which we should base our actions."  "Another relates to the extent to which "political correspondents" actually understand the most basic elements of South African and other political reality and practice. This must be considered together with the peculiar notion that seems to be prevalent in some circles, that media independence must necessarily translate into a consistent effort to find fault with, and criticise the government and the ruling party, at all costs."  "The third of these concerns arises directly from the obvious certainty on the part of the "Sunday Times" that the ANC ran a fraudulent election campaign, based on the brazen propagation of a big lie. This indicates that there are some within a media that proudly proclaims that it is committed to "objective, truthful, unbiased and balanced" reporting, whose fundamental assumptions about the ANC are far removed from what would qualify to be described as objective, truthful, unbiased and balanced."  This depth of criticism is an unprecedented move by Mbeki, and shows a leader that is placing comments into the public sphere that, in my view, are best kept private, or at best dealt with through more collaborative channels. Mbeki is questioning the role of the media in the country, and is communicating ambiguous and dangerous signals of government inferences on muzzling media criticism.   Personally, I also feel that this shows a great weakness in Mbeki's leadership, a lack of measured, composed management of situations and a lack of nuance and sensitivity to a sector that is critical to the management of the public image of the presidency.  Mbeki concludes by quoting Ignacio Ramonet: "As people are now beginning to realise, news is contaminated. It poisons our minds, pollutes our brains, manipulates us, intoxicates us, and tries to instil into our subconscious ideas that are not our own. This is why we now need to establish an ecology of news, to sort real news from a flood of lies."   He then closes by saying "Hopefully the situation will not arise in future when, as seems to happen so regularly with regard to negative social phenomena, somebody will claim a place for us as the global leader among the purveyors of contaminated news."  If this is how Mbeki reacts to a small piece of criticism amongst a media that is almost pathetic in its reluctance to criticise him, one wonders about the future of government interference with the media, and I truly hope that there is much response to his tirade from the media industry itself. In the past the industry has tended to run for the hills when Mbeki throws his big stick around, but I fear that this may be a watershed moment.

       Manto's 'plan'  Manto has today released her 10-point "Strategic Priorities for the National Health System, 2004-2009," plan. Following my post this morning, I am absolutely appalled that she finds no space in the plan for AIDS. How can AIDS not be on a ten point priorities list?   Tshabalala-Msimang tries to dodge the issue by saying "It does not mean that if a particular health matter is not on the list of priorities, the department will ignore it. This list represents those things that we must pay particular attention to amongst all the other things that we do every day."  Appalling.

       SA's collective health in trouble  The annual South African Health Review has just been  urlLink released , and it does not offer any reasons for celebration.  The report shows that HIV and Aids is reversing all the health gains that have been made in the past two decades and is affecting South Africans at every age and stage of their lives. In addition, our increasingly unhealthy lifestyles are killing us. The report also exposes a deterioration in the quality of healthcare services for a range of reasons including a significant lack of staff. The number of women dying during childbirth, a critical measurement of health sector progress, has increased markedly in the past five years, almost doubling since 1998. The number of children perishing before the age of five are also increasing, although this is largely due to AIDS.   So who do we blame? The report lays it at three doors: AIDS, the brain drain of doctors and policy implementation. Let's look at doctors first.  The report revealed that "the exodus of skilled health personnel for the year under review has been substantial - 600 South African doctors are registered in New Zealand and 10 percent of Canada's hospital-based physicians and six percent of the total health workforce in the United Kingdom are South African."   So why do they leave? I assume this report must have been formulated before the recent slew of dispensing and practice regulations brought in by Manto, but it just goes to show the environment that we create for our doctors here. In a globalised world, we cannot try to force our doctors to act in ways that are contrary to their career or life requirements, they will simply take their skills to other markets, and this is exactly what has happened. Personally, I feel extremely sympathetic to doctors, and I don't think of their emigration is a 'treasonous' action. They work incredibly hard to achieve a career that ultimately is in the best interests of the country, and yet their goalposts are incessantly being moved.  The second issue is the issue of AIDS, and only the most unintelligent pundit could possibly come to the conclusion that the government's current HIV/AIDS policies have given those infected any type of chance for recovery. Manto's efforts have been disastrous, and her and Mbeki's viewpoints shamefull. Yet, even after the TAC won the right to receive antiretrovirals, when government stated that deadlines would be laid out for the dissemination of the drugs, the deception continues. Under this supposed second Mbeki term of delivery, Manto will not publicly  urlLink release  the deadlines for the rollout, an appalling slap in the face to all those who have waited so long and fought so hard for their right to live.  Which brings us to policy implementation, which is purely a management issue. Manto has clearly not set up her department for delivery, and her staffing has been a shambles. The  head of the School of Public Health at the University of the Western Cape, David Saunders says "The reason there is this huge gap (between policy and implementation) is the lack of capacity of human resources at all levels. When we say the health systems are not functioning it is because the human resources are not functioning." And nobody can claim that the health department does not have a budget, it is merely run poorly. Manto has stumbled from one disaster to the next and the faith placed in her by government is inexplicable. This is one moment that I wish South Africa was a country of opinion polls, because it would be fascinating to see the confidence that our populus has in our Health Ministry.  And to top it all off, the front page of the New York Times  urlLink carries  a story today on the 'recycling' of graves in Durban because "city is being battered by an AIDS pandemic so sweeping that people are dying faster than the city can find space to bury them." At least the article doesn't attempt to investigate Mbeki or Manto's checkered past with the HIV/AIDS question, but the paper's influence in world affairs. Some might say it's great that the AIDS pandemic in South Africa is getting such substantial publicity to encourage aid, I just hope the publicity forces the world to put pressure on our government's infantile AIDS policies.  Clearly we need change, and when it influences the collective health of all South Africans, change cannot come to soon.

       Do the Democrats want Moore?  In a recent interview with the  urlLink Guardian , Michael Moore stated that he "has not publicly endorsed Kerry." Moore sees it as his role to show the deficiencies in Bush's presidency rather than endorse another, which is rather incongruous with his endorsement of Nader in the last elections and Wesley Clarke in the current Democratic campaign. In fact, I'm sure Moore would, in private, be rather critical of Kerry, who holds some very similar policy decisions to Bush, and is also from a very cushy background. (Anybody catch the CNN Presents... special on Kerry this weekend, showing clips of him sailing with JFK is the Hamptons?)  But the question is, would the Democrats want an association with Moore? Wesley Clarke found out rather quickly that Moore's aggressive stance is often more a problem than a service, and Moore's endorsement would be simple fodder for the Republican War Room's cannons. With every vote counting, and the country as polarised on Moore as they are on Bush, a Moore endorsement may be too heavy a burden to carry for the Democrats. Thus, no official invite for Moore to the Democratic convention, but rather an invitation as a guest of former President Carter who, as CNN so deftly enunciated it, is more famous for what he has done after his presidency than during it.

       The IFP reshapes itself  The IFP conference held this weekend was an important moment in the current political landscape, and one which may have lasting ramifications. On Friday, Mangosuthu Buthelezi took the politically-correct step of releasing himself from the leadership but was unsurprisingly  urlLink voted  back into that position without much further fuss. However, national chairman Lionel Mtshali made a rather dejected departure after being voted out of his position and replaced by Dr Ziba Jiyane.  In his address to his party, Buthelezi stated an interest in  urlLink calling  a conference of all opposition groups to define the role of the 'opposition'. This is an important move that will win the IFP no friends within the DA, but could be music to the ears of disgruntled South Africans voters.  The IFP party strategists believe that they can challenge the ANC head-on, with the Sunday Times reporting that "they believe they have a chance of driving a wedge between the ANC leadership and its supporters at a time when the ANC does not have a clear post-Mbeki succession plan."   With no disrespect to the DA, I personally think that if anyone can take ANC voters from their base, perhaps the IFP can. If the ANC fails in this second Mbeki term to comprehensively solve its problems in delivery of services and 1994 election promises, the IFP could take advantage of growing dissatisfaction amongst the ANC voting base. This however, would be dependent on the strength of traditional Xhosa-Zulu rivalries.   Much has been made, particularly in KZN itself, of the spat between the DA and the IFP for the title of official opposition. However, the IFP holds the distinct advantage over the DA as having higher moral currency as an opposition party, considering its history.  However, the party has significant problems to overcome. Firstly, the party has never truly succeeded in breaking out of its traditional power base of Kwazulu-Natal. Secondly, the party has not proved itself to be very efficient in terms of election strategy or campaigning abilities. The IFP has taken some disastrous strategic decisions over the past decade, which has led them to their current position which is tenous at best. The IFP has also struggled to develop a strong enough leadership structure beneath Buthelezi.  The answer in truly challenging the ANC will be in the alignment with other smaller opposition parties and offering of a pragmatic alternative choice to the ANC's voters. Where the DA fits into that alliance could largely depend on that conference, but one feels that no alliance can be big enough to fit two leaders as egotistical and charasmatic as Leon and Buthelezi.

       SA gets SADC security seat  SA officially takes  urlLink over  the reigns of the SADC politics, defence and security chair today. With no disrespect to Lesotho, this should aid the implementation of some wider African policy initiatives, and perhaps policies close to Mbeki's heart (such as NEPAD). The SADC chair adds more bargaining power in African affairs and gives SA the vehicle to continue to shape Sub-Saharan politics.   It was with some interest that I learnt that the decision to rotate the chair annually was only taken last year, of which, since 1990, Mugabe had control. How did Mugabe managed to secure that position in the first place (assistance, blogosphere?), and how come this deranged dictator was only told to relinquish the post in 2003?

       Leigh Matthews strikes a cord  The terrible news last night that the kidnapped Leigh Matthews had been found dead brings to a close almost two weeks of intense media coverage of the story. It always interests me how some stories get picked up by the media more than others, and Guy Berger from the Mail & Guardian  urlLink investigates  the reasons behind this case very well.  What was interesting this morning was the statement  urlLink released  by ANC spokesperson Smuts Ngonyama. "We must find a way to deal with this and we must be committed to weeding out these elements. We can't unite as a nation if these sick elements are in our midst," said Ngonyama, who had issued a statement earlier this week to her captors to release her. "Leigh Matthews was a flower, a young person, the lifeblood of the nation and she was abducted for no apparent reason and (not returned) even though her parents gave the money."  Clearly the ANC is responding to the national (and media) interest in the story, as many people are ruthlessly killed in our country each day. What is interesting though, is the question whether the ANC have chosen to comment on this case specifically because it was a white upper-middle class family. At a time when white South Africans' number one fear is crime, and at a time when Mbeki has illustrated a susceptibility to alienate white voters, ANC strategists have used this as an opportunity to reassure South Africans, and more especially white South Africans, that crime is high on the ANC agenda.  In fact Ngonyama even went as far as  urlLink evoking  Apartheid memories in his statement, saying that although kidnappings and abductions were familiar to people directly involved in the struggle against apartheid, "Whether it was caused by oppression or because of crime, the effects are the same."  It is highly commendable that the Government has shown such empathy in this tragedy, and will definitely gain plaudits amongst the South African populus for doing so. It will be interesting however, to see whether there are any rumblings in the African language press that this may be a hypocritical time to make such a statement given the incessant murder that continues in the townships.

       Jumping on the bandwagon?  Remember Jonathan Idema, the US ex-Special Ops guy who was running a private jail in Kabul? Well, the BBC is  urlLink reporting  that he is claiming that he "has evidence to prove he was working for the Pentagon." He claims to have "helped prevent several attempted terrorist attacks" and said he "had regular e-mail, phone and fax contact with Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's office and other senior Pentagon officials."  As much as this would drive the nail further into Rumsfeld's (already rather damaged) coffin, I cannot believe that Rumsfeld would be as brain-dead as to have personal contact with any undercover "black-ops" personnel and further, one would think that they would be operating under greater secrecy that a residential house in Kabul. I'm sure there are plenty of more remote places in Afghanistan to hide detainees. This will undoubtedly be one of the few reports to offer any semblance of credibility to his claims, as it is clearly a case of an over exuberant bounty-hunter that has gone too far...

       Big week for Bush   This week kicks off the start of the convention season leading up to the traditional election starter's gun of the early September US Labour Day. And this week is a particularly  urlLink tough  one for Bush. On Thursday, the commission investigating Sept. 11 is to release its final report, criticizing government efforts to prevent the attacks, and Mr. Kerry is about to enjoy a week of extensive coverage of his nominating convention. In addition, one of Kerry's planned key plugpoints, the administration's involvement in Halliburton, has just been given added weight with  urlLink revelations  of a criminal probe into Halliburton's dealings in Iran.  In response, Bush is  urlLink planning  a month-long campaign that will "blend criticism of the Democratic ticket with what aides said would be Mr. Bush's first effort to set out a second-term agenda." Bush has thus brought forward his definitions of his second term, an campaign strategy traditionally reserved for the period subsequent to the Republican Convention. In addition,  urlLink according  to White House communications director Dan Bartlett, "White House senior adviser Karl Rove has told Republican allies that, in the 2000 campaign, Bush suffered from having little new to say in September and October, and that the 2004 campaign plan was drawn up to avoid that mistake."  Bush has been forced into a position of incessant campaigning due to his under-50% approval ratings and the fact that the campaign is currently on a knife-edge. He simply cannot afford to concede poll data to Kerry in this week, as the momentum (if Kerry could jog himself to take advantage of it) carrying through to the real electioneering in September may be significant. His key campaign theme of the economy is increasingly coming under attack for the lack of real job growth, as much of the job growth has come from low income positions, the so-called "McJobs". Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley,  urlLink reached  the conclusion: "While there has been some improvement on the hiring front in recent months, the quality of such job-creation has been decidedly subpar…Unless that changes, the risks to a sustainable economic recovery will only intensify."  However, Kerry has been up to some less intelligent campaigning recently. Over the July 4th weekend, Kerry fielded reporter's questions after picking up a Beretta 12-gauge shotgun and shooting 17 of 25 clay pigeons and  urlLink noting  "I'm just doing what I normally do". Whilst clearly an attempt to lessen the attacks of the NRA, the NRA. executive vice president Wayne LaPierre retorted that Kerry has voted against its positions 51 out of 55 times and has "not fought for gun owners' rights once in 25 years". The NRA is planning an extensive print campaign in support of Bush to begin airing this week. Bit of a waste of time then...

       SA to accept US help on defense  The Mail & Guardian  urlLink carries  the story this morning of US offers to provide training and equipment to two SA infantry battalions, primarily for peacekeeping missions. US Ambassador to SA, Cameron Hume, stated that the SA had agreed to the offer.   The US has already assisted Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Malawi and Senegal, which is rather bizarre as there are some states in that list that the US has been very critical of for human rights abuses. So often in the past, US assistance in military forces has ulitmately benefited rebels and militia and caused more problems than goodwill, however, it seems that the US has only been providing basic equipment such as uniforms and communication equipment. For SA, sources say the agreement will cover simulation equipment similar to that used at facilities such as the US Joint Readiness Training Centre where army and air-force units train together against an opposing force before deploying abroad.  Any strength that the US can provide to African states for peace-keeping is undoubtedly a good thing, both in assisting AU peace-keeping initiatives and the improvement of continental responsiblity by African states.

       Tony turns on Liberals  According to the Guardian, Tony Blair will today  urlLink announce  "the end of the 1960s liberal consensus on law and order", in a move designed to attract voters to the party.  While insisting that the sixties removed ugly prejudices and expanded individual freedoms, Mr Blair is expected to concede that the new lifestyles did not sufficiently foster responsibility to others, family discipline or role models - and focused the law and order system too much on offenders' rights.  "People do not want a return to old prejudices and ugly discrimination. But they want rules, order and proper behaviour. They know there is such a thing as society. They want the society of respect and responsibility, they want a community where the decent law-abiding majority are in charge, where those who play by the rules do well and those who do not get punished," he is expected to say.  Blair thus will introduce increased State intervention in a five year anti-crime plan that includes broad-ranging community-based policing, an expansion of the national DNA database and new satellite tracking technology to keep tabs on Britain's 5,000 most prolific offenders. New measures are also expected to improve the treatment of victims and witnesses by the criminal justice system, including the appointment of a dedicated witness officer in every court to ensure they are kept fully informed.

       Bush snubs NAACP  President Bush has  urlLink become  the first sitting president since Warren G. Harding to refuse to speak at the NAACP annual convention, after declining the invitation for the fourth time.   In Bush's defence, Black voters have preferred Democratic presidential candidates by a 9 to 1 margin, but in a tight election, alienating 10% of black voters that could vote Republican is risky business. The NAACP has also been very critical of Bush policies, but none more so than previous presidents, who have all realised the importance of the NAACP vote.  Bush's spokesperson put it down to a scheduling conflict, but Bush's records show that over the time of the speech he was  urlLink attending  a White House tee ball game. Whether this will have any impact will remain largely on how much it is reported, with currently only the left-leaning papers covering the story.

       Kerry finds a voice on Iraq  Kerry has finally found a  urlLink voice  on Iraq, but it is certainly not a standpoint that will convince many voters of his status as a presidential alternate.  Kerry stated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the conditions under which he would remove troops are: "if he is assured Iraq is stable, that it looks likely to remain so and that its military is strong enough to enforce order."  It is a largely centrist and unambitious position though, and again shows how similar these candidates are in many of their positions. In fact, I'm pretty sure that Bush will make a very similar offering during the election campaign. Kerry's assertions on his conditions for troop withdrawals are all commendable, but there is little indication of the strategy to achieve these goals, and when challenged, he hid behind semantics.  "I'm not going to negotiate my plan in the newspapers. But I will get there in ways that this president can't because he has burned the bridges of credibility and burned the alliances. They need to be re-established with a new president." Besides giving an inclination of a less unilateral approach, not much there...  Kerry also made a small strategic move, 'warning' the public that Bush may cut troops in Iraq just before the elections and inferring that it would constitute an insincere move to endeavour to sway swing voters in the lead-up to November's vote.  One could argue that it is too early to be publicly debating strategy, but any indication Kerry can give allied voters and swing voters as to his strategies, should he be elected, would only help to drive him further in this formative stage. One could argue that this 2004 election campaign is unlike most of its precedents due to the highly politically polarised public that currently makes up the US voting base, and that it simply cannot be too soon to be campaigning.

       Martha's new look  So Martha Stewart, the doyenne of decor, will be sentenced today at around 16:00 our time. Not that I'm awaiting the results with baited breath, but everybody loves to see celebrities fall and especially a person with such a reportedly horrible demeanour. The irony is fantastic, Martha Stewart, the epitome of the 'American soccer mom done good', the queen of home style and interior design, facing the prospect of a little time in a concrete six-by-four without a yard of fabric or touch of colour in sight. Apparently the judge overseeing the case, Judge Cedarbaum, is no fan of Stewart, and yesterday threw out a last minute appeal by her lawyers to have the federal sentencing guidelines that call for a 10- to 16-month prison term set aside. "Martha Stewart Living" could have a whole new ring to it, and most likely a string of B-Grade documentaries too...

       So being gay is a danger to US security?  The Bush Administration  urlLink lost  its attempt yesterday to push through a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. What I couldn't resist though, were some of the Republican comments after the loss. Republican Senator Rick Santorum, one of the amendment's champions, said: "I would argue that the future of our country hangs in the balance because the future of marriage hangs in the balance. Isn't that the ultimate homeland security, standing up and defending marriage?"   Um, no Rick, that would be defending your country against terrorism.

       Iran threatens Western powers  Troubling signs from Iran as MEMRI  urlLink reports  this morning of recent threats made by Iranian leaders against Western powers. Over the past few days and weeks, prominent Iranian figures have been drumming up their populus with some dangerously antagonistic messages that seem to be leading to an overt support of terrorist activities.  Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, said on July 5th: "We, the Iranian people, within the borders of our country, will cut off any hand that harms our scientific, natural, human, or technological interests. We will cut off the hand that is sent to invade and work against our people's interests. We will do this with no hesitation.... If the enemy has the audacity to harm and invade, our blows against it will not be limited to the borders of our country... If someone harms our people and invades our country, we will endanger his interests anywhere in the world."  This is a usual fiery response of Islamic leadership that perceives an external threat, but Iranian Revolutionary Guards Political Bureau head General Yadollah Javani seems to infer a more sinister threat.  He stated: "The converging of millions of Iranian youth imbued with the spirit of Shehada [martyrdom] in the Basij forces... along with a courageous leader, the trend of the Islamic awakening, and the consolidation of many supporters around Iran's Islamic revolution can [all] go into action in times of crisis and play their part in light of these threats. Today we have in our possession long-range smart missiles which can reach many of the interests and vital resources of the Americans and of the Zionist regime in our region. Thus, if the enemies show stupidity and make any mistake towards Iran, [Iran] will certainly use all the means and capabilities at its disposal."  Whether this can be viewed as mere rhetoric or not is a debatable issue, but the message it sends to radical groups within Iran is unquestionable. It amounts to an unconstrained, inferred approval of what we could be termed 'terrorist activities' from the "many supporters around Iran's Islamic Revolution".  The Middle East is becoming an increasingly enflamed arena of foreign policy for both the US and more generally the West. One does get that feeling that we're nearing some sort of tipping point either way, a watershed if you will, and the foreign policy initiatives played out in the next few months will have vast implications. With this all being extrapolated in the midst of a US (and possibly UK) election campaign, the stakes could not be higher.

       ANC in the hot seat over Zimbabwe  The ANC's persistently ambiguous stance on Mugabe's leadership is coming into even more fervent question after recent reports in the  urlLink Sunday Times  regarding covert meetings with Zanu-PF officials to share election strategies. Whilst I had in a previous  urlLink post  mentioned that the attempted AU censure may have been the first positive moves Mbeki had made against Zimbabwe, subsequent reports about Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma quashing the report seem to have put paid to that. This latest revelation is inexplicable at best, and raises some troubling questions.  The Sunday Times reported yesterday that top ANC officials "led by President Thabo Mbeki" held a top-secret meeting in June with leading members of the Zanu-PF to forge closer political ties. This, according to the Sunday Times, included open assistance on election strategies for the forthcoming Zimbabwean elections, as well as the provision of "between four and six" ANC election strategists to travel to Zimbabwe to assist Zanu-PF in their planning. In response, ANC secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe  urlLink said  that no such agreement had been made, but added that there was an "open invitation" to Zanu-PF to study the ANC strategy in their recent election win. Whether or not the ANC sends election strategists is largely inconsequential, the main point is how on earth the ANC can be actively supporting the Zanu-PF in the first place.  Moreover, the talks happened on the eve of the AU summit, and it is reported that the AU censure document was widely circulated at the meeting, adding credibility to the recent reports that Zuma apparently shut down the AU censure after talks with Zanu-PF.  This all leads to some concerning postulation. The methodology of 'quiet diplomacy' has had the wind blown under its skirt, and this lays bare a troubling view of Mbeki's commitment to the resolution of the Zimbabwean problem. Could quiet diplomacy have been a ruse to cover a president who never had any intention of pulling Mugabe from power? Does Mbeki's respect of Mugabe's 'struggle credentials' really render him incapacitated to act in any meaningful way? A darker picture emerges of Mbeki's leadership here, and for the sake of our country's international image and for the sake of the Zimbabwean people, I sincerely hope that this is a false dawn. Mbeki needs to speak. This is not an issue that can be swept under the carpet, the implications are simply too substantial, and opposition parties need to be encouraged to continue this pressure until answers are supplied.

       Bin Laden the Republican's trump card?  The New Republic  urlLink reports  that various high level US Administration officials have made their way to Pakistan in the last few weeks to continue to work the pressure vice on Musharraf's government to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, his deputy, Ayman Al Zawahiri, or the Taliban's Mullah Mohammed Omar. No problems there, each of those individuals need desperately to be brought to justice.   But nothing escapes political reality.   The New Republic reports that "an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed TNR that the Pakistanis 'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs [High Value Targets] before the election is an absolute must.' What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement: 'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.' Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.' But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that 'it would be best if the arrest or killing of any HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July'--the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.  With the entrenched tribal clans along the Pakistani border active but divided at present, Musharraf's big concern is that any prolonged military activity in the region, especially alongside US Military, will unite the clans in a civil war against the Pakistani forces. But, again according to the New Republic, his results in the capture or death of these HVTs have consequences that reach into their relations with India. Musharraf has been trying to secure an order of F-16's that would tip the balance in the cold war with India, whilst Powell has been completely non-committal, patently holding out for Pakistani results.   With that deadline only weeks away, it will be interesting to see if those dates hold any significance.

       The AU and human cloning  The Mail & Guardian reports today that the AU is looking to  urlLink develop  a common African position on human cloning. A number of African health ministers requested in a letter that it would be placed on the agenda of the next AU executive council meeting, saying "Human cloning has become an emotional and divisive issue also between African states," and added that "the question of human cloning raised serious ethical, legal, cultural, philosophical and religious questions regarding human dignity."  This raises two questions. Firstly, does Africa need an 'African position' on human cloning? Personally, I think that this is something that is policy that should be dealt with at governmental level. An 'African position' is not going to have any enforceable implementation and has the distinct possiblity of being reisgned to the bottom draw of accountable government policy. Moreover, the majority of African states do not have the scientific abilities to cure disease, let alone human cloning, and there are vastly superior priorities in health science development.  Secondly, is it viable to attempt to gain an 'African position'? Africa is a continent made up of 55 states with vastly different socio-cultural and religious values, and it may prove to be entirely impossible, or at best a distinct waste of time, to attempt to marry each state's diverse views. I think that the AU's time is better served elsewhere.

       Kerry makes the intelligent choice  True to form, Kerry has selected Senator John Edwards as his running mate in the upcoming presidential elections. His selection, although not neccessarily the safest one, was the intelligent choice amongst the VP candidates. Edwards' energy, drive and Southern charm are the perfect foil to Kerry's lacklustre, aloof Ivy League image that he is struggling to shake. In a campaign that already has had both sides pointing 'Washington Insider' fingers at each other and questioning each other's political ethics, Edwards' boy-next-door campaign message decrying the "two Americas" - the rich and the rest - is the perfect addition to Kerry's armoury. Added to this, his appeal in Southern states bolsters Kerry in areas where he is weak, and Edwards will be a key asset in gaining the swing vote in battleground states.   According to  urlLink Kerry , "John understands and defends the values of America. He has shown courage and conviction as a champion for middle class Americans and those struggling to reach the middle class. In the Senate, he worked to reform our intelligence, to combat bioterrorism, and keep our military strong. John reaches across party lines and speaks to the heart of America — hope and optimism."  Interesting choice of words at the conclusion of the quote; "hope and optimism". Those were the exact words used to define Reagen's presidency so emphatically in the past few weeks. The hypothesis here is that Kerry is trying to sabotage Bush's use of Reagan nostalgia in his election campaign by holding onto the key principles in his own message. Whether this will hold or not we'll have to wait and see, but an interesting first shot as the Kerry-Edwards team.

       The new Jihad in Iraq  The last week has seen some great journalism from Time magazine in their coverage of Islamic  urlLink extremism  in Iraq. Michael Ware has spent the past few months in communication with Islamic extremist groups operating in Iraq and the results are fascinating, breaking some common misconceptions about the insurgent operations in Iraq. Ware concludes that the militant's outlook has changed markedly, from one of guerilla tactics to drive US forces from Iraq, to an international religious jihad movement with a view to becoming both a call to action and a training ground for future jihad militants and leaders.  The first such misconception is that the insurgents are largely Baathist groups trying to regain power. Ware writes that whilst this was true in the immediate aftermath of the war, their investigation "reveals that the militants are turning the resistance into an international jihadist movement. Foreign fighters, once estranged from homegrown guerrilla groups, are now integrated as cells or complete units with Iraqis. Many of Saddam's former secret police and Republican Guard officers, who two years ago were drinking and whoring, no longer dare even smoke cigarettes. They are fighting for Allah, they say, and true jihadis reject such earthly indulgences." Defence of city barricades and skirmishes with US forces have seen Syrians, Saudis and Pakistan fighting side-by-side with Iraqi operatives, previously a rare occurrence.  The second such misconception is that these terrorist activities will dilute in the coming months after the handover of power. Ware reports that the militants goals extend much further than merely forcing US forces out of the country. "They want to transform Iraq into what Afghanistan was in the 1980s: a training ground for young jihadists who will form the next wave of recruits for al-Qaeda and like-minded groups."  U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe Iraq is a magnet for fanatical Muslims around the world. "It's become the proving ground," says a senior U.S. intelligence official. The jihadists are convinced they can continue fighting indefinitely."  In a similar way to Bin Laden's leadership, Zarqawi's leadership seems to be similarly based on magnetism and a loose ideological connection as opposed to a hierachial membership structure. This makes it incredibly difficult both to control and halt insurgent activities, as operations are completed on a cell basis. Zarqawi is involved in planning and operations structure, and then it is left up to cells to implement at will. Time yesterday released a  urlLink videotape  from Zarqawi showing how recent operations were planned and executed in shocking detail, as anyone who saw the video on Sky or CNN last night would attest.  With new Prime Minister Iyad Allaw planning to declare martial law within the next few weeks to build an assault against the insurgents, the bloodiest battles in Iraq could be on the near horizon. A final piece from Ware "The insurgents' aspirations are growing. Abdullah, a midlevel leader of Kata'ib, says he's happy U.S. troops are staying in Iraq: it means he can be part of the jihad. Asked what the jihadists will do if U.S. forces finally pull out, one of Abdullah's comrades offers this answer: 'We will follow them to the U.S.'"  It will be up to history to prove whether Bush's war in Iraq was misguided or inspired, but we may find out sooner...

       AU Slams Zimbabwe  The AU has been hard at work over the weekend, adopting a report which  urlLink slams  the Zim leadership for "the arrests and torture of opposition members of parliament and human rights lawyers, the arrests of journalists, the stifling of freedom of expression and clampdowns on other civil liberties." This is a monumentous development in Africa's treatment of Zimbabwe and must hopefully be heralded as a new dawn in relations.   What is interesting is that the report was compiled by the AU's African Commission on Human and People's Rights subsequent to the Zimbabwean presidential elections in June 2002. Assuming that it wouldn't have taken them more than six months to complete the report, this infers that this position was enunciated late 2002, early 2003, which thus begs the question, why was it hidden until mid-2004? The official line given by the AU is that it was not submitted to the AU's 2003 summit "because it had not been translated into French." Plausible? We think not..  The report cannot have been signed off without the main African powers tacit or manifest agreement, and Nigerian and South Africa diplomats would surely not have allowed this harsh critique to be pushed through in the midst of "quiet diplomacy" initiatives. It is rather coincidental that this development comes just days after Mbeki's admission that quiet diplomacy had been a failure in bringing about any change in Zimbabwe. What is more plausible is that Nigerian and South African diplomats stonewalled that report so as to not interfere with their quiet diplomacy strategy.  Whatever the reasons for the delay though, we can celebrate this censure as a marked policy shift in Africa, and hopefully, the commencement of a new South African strategy on Zimbabwe.

       Thabo admits defeat on quiet diplomacy  Mbeki  urlLink stated  yesterday that his policy of quiet diplomacy on Zimbabwe has been a failure. Speaking through presidential spokesperson Bheki Khumalo, he said that the talks between the Zanu-PF and MDC were 'too slow' and that no progress had been made on the issue.  However, Mbeki also stated that he would "press on with his diplomatic efforts in Zimbabwe despite fierce criticism, because he still believed there was no alternative to dialogue." These is a confusing sentiment. There are many political alternatives to dialogue that include simple public censure and economic pressure.  Mbeki has largely based himself as a foreign policy president, particularly in his first term, and to gain any credibility for NEPAD and his other strong foreign policy initiatives, he must take action on Zimbabwe. After his softening position on AIDS, it is the one factor in his presidency that the world still cannot understand. Struggle friends or not, a dictator is a dictator whatever the historical context, and Mbeki has to show his leadership and take action after this acknolwedgement. Will it happen? Probably not...

       The implications of Sudan  The ethnic cleansing unfolding in Sudan is yet another tragic situation for Africa, with implications that stretch far beyond the borders of the already decrepit Sudanese nation. With the Sudanese government giving Arab militia, or Janjaweed, full reign to 'do as they like' to the African rebels who rose up against them, they are creating both a state-sponsored genocide, as well as fertile ground for Islamic extremists. There are two distinct stories here, the tragedy of the ethnic cleansing, and the consequences of the world's response.   NASA satellite photography has shown that out of 576 villages in the Darfur region, 300 have already been completely obliterated, whilst 76 more have been substantially destroyed, and the Arab militia have already been accused of driving more than a million people from their homes. Sudanese foreign minister Mustafa Osman Ismail has denied that there is any ethnic cleansing or mass suffering in the region, whilst the Sudanese government heavily restricts access. Andrew Natsios, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development  urlLink said , "if nothing changes we will have one million casualties. If things improve we can get it down to about 300,000 deaths." To add to the problem, Chad claims that the Sudanese Arab militia are undertaking cross-border raids to kill refugees and steal their possessions and cattle, and are preparing to defend their borders.  The world was vastly chided for its lack of response to Rwanda, a point reinforced by Chadian President Idriss Deby, who was  urlLink quoted  yesterday as saying, "The international community has the tragedy in Rwanda on its conscience". Action must be taken this time, and it seems that this horror has not yet reached its tipping point, so time is of the essence. Bush, as leader of the world's superpower and self-proclaimed moral compass, has been slow to react, both to the humanitarian crisis and to the realisation of Sudan's importance in his 'war on terror'. Last Saturday, Nicholas D. Kristof wrote an Op-Ed piece in the  urlLink NY Times  in which he applauded Kofi Annan and Colin Powell's planned trips to Sudan but accused Bush of 'dithering' for the last few months. "Mr. Bush seems proud of his 'moral clarity,' his willingness to recognize evil and bluntly describe it as such. Well, Darfur reeks of evil, and we are allowing it to continue," he said.  The other story is the position of Sudan in the war on terror. Sudan has had a long relationship with Muslim extremists. Osama bi Laden  urlLink built  a significant amount of his Al-Qaeda network whilst living in Sudan. Further, out of the fifteen terrorists indicted in the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing, five were Sudanese, and in 1998, the U.S. bombed Khartoum in retaliation for the al-Qaeda-linked bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The US has 'claimed' Sudan as an ally in the war against terror, but this has been shown up as an intensely spurious assumption. Terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah both retain offices in Khartoum, and the leadership that made Sudan a terrorist haven throughout the 90's remains in power today. Perhaps the reason that the US has taken Sudan off its 'uncooperative' list is purely to allow entry of US intelligence officials into the country, as so much Al-Qaeda activity occurs there. The bottom line is, the situation in Sudan currently plays in concert with Bush's war on terror. Any destabilisation in Northern Africa cannot be a good thing for US security, (and any conflict with Chad could put in jeopardy the increasing oil exports that the country provides to the US.)   Action so far has been limited. The US  urlLink proposed  a UN security council resolution imposing an arms embargo and travel ban on the Janjaweed. The draft resolution would have the security council state "its determination to do everything possible to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, including by taking further action if required". It does not propose action against the Khartoum government, which is accused of supporting the militias, but diplomats said there was an implied threat of extended sanctions if there was no improvement.  However, Powell and Annan's trips to the Dufar region have been largely 'sanitised' according to reports. Annan and Powell's movement has been severely restricted and the one camp they were taken to in Sudan was  urlLink said  to be a "show camp". The  urlLink Washington Post  reports that the Sudanese refugees driven from their homes by the Arab rebels, have been warned by Sudanese government soldiers to "to keep quiet about their experiences when Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan visit the region this week." In an extreme example, when Annan arrived in Khartoum yesterday for a meeting with the Sudanese leaders, Sudanese security forces were  urlLink opening fire  on university students trying to deliver a petition to him denouncing the goverment's atrocities in Darfur.  There exists in this horrible situation a distinct responsibility for the world not only to act to avoid the horrors of Rwanda, but also an opportunity to stamp out the flames of Islamic extremism. The US is notably reluctant to play any type of military role in North Africa, as the memory of Somalia still rings in American ears, but diplomatic, economic and joint UN pressure has to be brought to bear on the Sudanese government to halt these atrocities. History will judge the world in their actions in the next month. Genocide, rampant disease and starvation in Sudan could once again show the Western powers and UN's weakness in responding to humanitarian crises where little economic benefit ensues to them, and the responses, particularly by the US, could either further polarise the Islamic-Western world, or be a starting point to bring it closer together.  My last question in this post is, where is Thabo Mbeki and the African Union in all of this? The African Union has sent an observation team to Sudan, but is that really the power of the AU? Perhaps they should spend less time looking for solutions in Palestine and spend more time assisting in our own desperate continent.

       NNP finally gives up the ghost  The NNP announced today that they would fight all future elections under the ANC, ceasing to exist after the floor-crossing window opens in September 2005, and sending yet another opposition party to its grave.  Although the ANC purports that there is nothing wrong with one-party democracy, I firmly believe that there are significant vulnerabilities in such a theology. One party leadership negates the strengths of strong democratic opposition as the only robust way to ensure protection against the ravages of corruption and power-hungry leadership. There is great temptation for future ANC leadership to take steps entrench, or even ensure, their leadership position through abuses of power, without the usual safety net of opposition.  The question is though, what the ANC will be gaining from this arrangement? The marriage with the ANC was an abhorration for many NNP members, and many of them will presumably not be defecting. The situation under the ANC-NNP marriage ensured that the ANC leveraged the entire NNP party structure, without having to deal with unhappy members. So who will benefit from these politicians, and these voters? I would think that they will be split throughout the opposition parties, with gains for the DA, for the ACDP and perhaps for the ID and Freedom Front.  Whilst this will imply that the ANC will lose some of their NNP members, this will no doubt not be of much concern to them, as it represents the folding of another opposition party. The irony must be especially sweet for the ANC, overseeing the amalgamation of the party born from Apartheid's creators into the belly of the new South African government, and I hasten to add, and politics aside, the South African political landscape looks a lot rosier without any vestige of the old NP left.

       More signs of US action on Iran  Is Iran next? Pentagon policy in Iraq seem to reinforce that the Bush Administration is laying the foundations for potential action in Iran. Whilst the US press has been ramping up the stories of Iran's nuclear capabilities, and Iran hadn't been assisting the situation by extolling some fiery rhetoric, I had perceived that the Bush Administration was using it more as an election sub-strategy. But recent reports suggest that the Pentagon is actively preparing Iranian allies (similar to the Northern Alliance in Iraq). A  urlLink report  in the Christian Science Monitor states that:  "The US State Department officially considers a group of 3,800 Marxist Iranian rebels - who once killed several Americans and was supported by Saddam Hussein - 'terrorists.' But the same group, under American guard in an Iraqi camp, was just accorded a new status by the Pentagon: "protected persons".  According to analysts, this is "a function of the swiftly deteriorating US-Iran dynamic," and is "a victory for US hawks who favor using the Mujahideen-e Khalq Organization (MKO) or 'People's Holy Warriors,' as a tool against Iran's clerical regime."  Whether this is merely back-pocket insurance by the Pentagon remains to be seen, but it could be the first concrete signs that the Hawks are on the move again...

       Another classic from the leader of the free world   "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," said George Bush in an address yesterday. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people... and neither do we."  This guy should be President?

       Sudanese militia confirm Government link  Sky News is  urlLink reporting  from a Janjaweed village this morning that tribal elders have confirmed that the Sudanese government had instructed them to take up arms against the African tribes that had attempted the uprising.  According to Sky News, tribal elders told correspondent Stuart Ramsay that "they told him they regretted the violence, but said the government had asked them to take up arms".  Ramsay went on to say that Janjaweed gunmen have been making overtures of peace lately, in an attempt to encourage some of the people they forced from their homes to return, but that the sight of young miltiamen with AK-47 assault rifles slung over their shoulders meant the refugees were too scared to come back.

       Is this Karl Rove again?  Two interesting articles this morning out of the  urlLink NY Times  and the  urlLink Washington Post , which both state that the information that led to the terror alert, whilst gained from captured information and interrogations as recently as January, is three or four years old. And thus we develop an interesting conspiracy theory: Does this mean Karl Rove and the Republican strategists are holding the US populus to ransom again?  The Washington Post reports that "most of the al Qaeda surveillance of five financial institutions that led to a new terrorism alert Sunday was conducted before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and authorities are not sure whether the casing of the buildings has continued since then, numerous intelligence and law enforcement officials said yesterday."  White House officials say that the reason for the current terror alert is this information, in conjunction with the recent threat attributed to Al Qaeda that they were determined to launch an attack on US soil before the November elections.   However, the NY Times offers that "Federal authorities said on Monday that they had uncovered no evidence that any of the surveillance activities described in the documents was currently under way. Another counterterrorism official in Washington said that it was not yet clear whether the information pointed to a current plot. 'We know that Al Qaeda routinely cases targets and then puts the plans on a shelf without doing anything,' the official said."  The timing would be just perfect wouldn't it? Kerry concludes a strong week at the Democratic Convention expecting the usual ratings bounce, the terror alert is raised at the end of the convention, and any gains he has made are wiped out as people forget campaigning Democrats and remember that they're at war and need their 'war president' to protect them.   This would be nothing new. The recent slew of books on Karl Rove and on Bush himself show the strategy of keeping leadership positions by maintaining a level of fear amongst the population of an outside 'sinister' enemy who could strike at any time. Republican strategists have used it incessantly over the years; it was in fact an art perfected by Reagan in the 80's.  To add more interest to the conspiracy theory, you would have thought that the biggest terror alert since the 9-11 attacks, and on financial institutions themselves, would have sent the stock market plummeting when it reopened on Monday. What happened? The NYSE gained ground and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 39 points. Is that pure business skepticisim, or do Bush's big business buddies know something we don't...

       Mixed response to Doha rebirth  Delegates from the WTO's 140 member states  urlLink argued  late into the evening last night, but emerged with an interim document outlining key developments in breaking the deadlock between rich and poor countries and giving a December 2005 deadline to endeavour to conclude a new global trade deal. Whilst this should be heralded as great news, especially for our continent, any response has to be tempered by realism.  Here is a basic summary of the agreement reached:   All 147 members of the World Trade Organisation have agreed on the basis for talks on a trade deal, but still have months of hard negotiations ahead   Rich countries have agreed to eliminate all forms of export farm subsidies but can keep some of their domestic support   The deal includes a "down payment" that would see an immediate 20 per cent cut in the maximum permitted payments by rich nations   Europe's multibillion-pound sugar industry is still outside the negotiations West African states failed in their attempt to open separate negotiations over the US's $3bn (£1.65m) of subsidies for its cotton-growers   Poorer countries will have to cut import barriers under which the highest get cut the most   Developing countries have to negotiate on rules to make customs procedures easier and less expensive for business   The agreement culminates almost two years of behind the scenes campaigning by developing countries and the G20+, of which SA is a founder nation, and is a definite step in the right direction.  The problem though, is that this is a tune we have heard before, and the document holds no inherent timelines or concrete stipulations; it is more a document of intent. The pursuit of wealth makes capitalist countries noisy neighbours in the quiet streets of philanthropy, and one cannot see developed countries losing protection over their major industries. Already, West African nations have been  urlLink forced  to drop their requests for an end to the $3bn in subsidies the US pays to its cotton farmers, which is killing African cotton production. This trumpets the path that will most likely be followed.   The negotiators from developed countries hold all the aces here, and any final deal is likely to largely diluted in its power to bring rich nations to heel and uplift developing nations' economies. The retraction of developed nation protectionism and is an internationally recognised noble pursuit, but let's not forget that the wealth of these developed nations has often drawn its power from the colonial oppression of poorer nations, and the market positions subsequently enjoyed are not ones that will be relinquished easily. These trade talks extend influence not over charitable aid, but into the very structure of developed countries' economies and these rich countries have little incentive other than charity to appease this situation. One may argue that inaction will lead to further global poverty, but I'm not as left leaning as to concur that the developed nations are truly empathetic to their poorer global colleagues.  Call me cynical, and perhaps I'll be proven wrong on this one, but I envisage that wealth will once again overcome wisdom on this one, and the poor nations will be left at the altar once again. It's a triumph for diplomacy that rich and poor nations managed to get back to the table after the debacle at Doha, but whether this will bring triumph for developing nations is a question with few positive answers.
