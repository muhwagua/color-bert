      So I was a witness to a pretty nasty accident tonight. A truck and a small green car were racing - doing about 190. The green car was in my lane. It pulled out when it realized I was driving too slow (120) and was bumper to bumper with the black truck. the green car tried to pull in front of me as soon as it could and missed my bumper by about six inches. At that point he lost control and slammed straight into the barrier to my right, bouced off that, hit the barrier to my left then cartwheeled on that barrier three times, snapping off a wheel that I dodged around. The whole thing took about eight seconds. The guy actually got out and started to throw a tantrum, so instead of stopping to help him, headed for the copshop around the corner. Saw a cop on the way, told her and followed her back to the scene. The guy had fled the scene.  Tonight sucked a lot. I should have stayed in bed. To top it all off I feel even worse.  I can't wait until they catch him. The other cop - the O.P.P. lad they called, Officer Thomas - he took names and numbers. I'm itching to have a chat with this chap. Fucker nearly killed me. *rage*

      Made up some of the sleep that I lost last night and found myself in a bizarre bizarre dream. Strange elements of my own family mixed with someone elses' - I had a brother and a sister. My mother and father were estranged - my mother was played by a taller woman than my real mother with silver blond hair. My father was played by James Caan. When I woke up a few moments ago, my "mother" had just accepted my "father" back into the family, and in the dream I was crying, I was so happy to have him back home. When I woke up, it was as if I'd been weeping for a good long time. My "father" was reading a book - everyone in this dream was reading books at one point, most of which I have read. A few I didn't recognize, but it didn't seem relevant. My father was trying to get something established about a design we were working on, it appears that this James Caan figure does what my dad does for a living. We were looking at a front view of what appeared to be a Reebok running shoe, having trouble understanding what each other meant about how some things fit together. He said he'd show me the model.  Earlier in the dream there was something about getting away from the police. With James Caan involved I can't help but think that this dream is a result of my oversaturation of mafia and mob films - Godfather I and II, The Sopranos and A Bronx Tale. Sonny, Michael's Estrangement and Calogero's desire to help the other Sonny as well as his love for his dad - all elements that I believe were encompassed in this dream.  I've got to say this dream was probably good for me. I've been a little stressed out of late, even with my desire and intention not to let things get to me. Having this "re-unification" with my "father" brought me to tears, and they say that tears cleanse the soul. I think I just got a free soul wash without having to pay for the gas.  I'm gonna go get my car now.

      Great news!! There's nothing wrong with my car.... right.... So I get this call from my mechanic saying that "no, it's not the alternator, no it's not the belt, I'm gonna take it for a road test cause I can't find anything there right now."  Yeah. So when it conks out, it's just fate.  Note to Earnie Eves - you can make our drinking water as safe as you want - I just paid $300 fucking dollars for a power bill. You're not going to be re-elected stupid.  So last night's sleep sucked ass. Couldn't get a damn bit of rest, thinking constantly, about bills, work, rent, my car, my education, my future. Things are looking up, but it's just going to take a little time. Nothing like everyone around you breathing down your neck about problems you don't need to be constantly reminded of.  They figured out that the kid in the Washington sniper case shot some of the people. I'm gonna take a gamble and say headshots were dad, the more sloppy shots were kiddo. You know what these folks need? A little Larry Flynt action, someone to put a bullet in the base of their spine; they never walk again, but they get to live in agony for a long and unproductive time.  Hey, kids running up and down the stairs next door - speaking of humans that need a bullet to the spine. *want them dead*  So I'm going to get some leftovers and listen to CFRB.

      k, whacked moment. I'm watching Frankenstein (De Niro and Brannaugh) on City and surfing to Montster garage where they are turning a Mustang into a lawnmower. I think these programs are similar on more than one level.  I spent the better part of this evening trying to track down what appears to be a virus or worm on my machine. It kept saying that I had the Nimda virus - which I ran the removal tool for, no such thing. Emails of around 10 megs in size kept popping up in various folders from my dad's old computer. weird shit.Got rid of it though.  I think I'm going to get a bit before I sleep, hopefully it'll help this heartburn.  I'm dying - one day at a time, just like everybody else :)

      Feck. I love writing things only to have them dissapear. I think I'm going to take time out of my day right now to clean my monitor. Yeah, that's a lot better. I tell people at work constantly not to use Windex - what do I use at home? Well, it's a mixture of Windex and laziness. That's going to change I think though. I've had one of those Tony Robbins revelatory moments - today is the first day of the rest of my life sort  of thing. That's all well and good. Tomorrow is the day I get my car fixed. Hopefully it's just the belt.   My dad's buddy Steve has a virus on his computer (doesn't everyone?) that he needs removed. Steve's a cop. I thought about doing that for a while. I'm a fair guy and I've always wanted a gun... I think that disqualifies me from the position. My propensity for road rage is usually driven by the discourteous. I'd probably get frustrated with the job if I weren't allowed to bust punks for being less than polite to me or those around me. Then again, this coming from the guy who wants to kill his neighbors for allowing his children to run screaming up and down the stairs at 8 Am... well, I suppose that could be taken as a type of discourtesy.  I don't want to be sick for Halloween. That's kind of depressing me. But I refuse to be depressed today. The sun is shining through my window and that's got to be a positive thing, right? Yeah, it's about time I got some pants on me. And now that my monitor's clean, I desperately need to clean my glasses. That's better. Thoroughly pantsed, but no glasses goop in sight. I don't dare use Windex, cause, hey, "eyeball on the floor" is not the game for me.   I think I'm going to have to close those blinds a bit, or at the very least find some sunglasses. The sun's shining in my window like it hates me.  Why is it that I enjoy talking to one, maybe two (okay maybe a few more) people online and the rest seem to be trying to get the better of me, get one up on me or are generally being pricks?   Okay, enough whinging. I've got to get some work done. I think I'm going to go out and by the joy of cooking and actually plan this week's meals. I'm going to need supplies. Potatoes, Broccoli... I'm thinking maybe a nice battered fried chicken... or maybe I'll grill it. I'm excited about cooking. Now all I need is a dining room table.

      So it's 6:22 Am Monday Morning. I've been desperately trying to get to sleep since, oh... 12. Six hours of raw frustration sucks. Did get to see A Bronx Tale and Godfather III tonight though. I finally understand the deal with Godfather III - I used to think of it in terms of "The Much Maligned Godfather III" - I guess that's how people knew I hadn't seen it. Pacino, for all his ability, shot this one. Copolla's daughter, hopefully, will never find that side of a camera again. The only bright spot was Andy Garcia - recognizable in his role of "Role model for Chris Moltisanti of the Soprano's". All in all, I enjoyed the Godfather Trilogy, but really, we could have done without three. Francis, next time you get the idea to bring us up to speed on 15 years of emotion, well, bugger off.   A Bronx Tale was good - Chazz Palmintari was delightful as usual. De Niro was De Niro. The kid (both of them) did a great job. I like Chazz. I drink Vanilla Coke because of Chazz.   So over the past few hours I've fretted over a few things. Getting in shape. Learning to cook well. (I'm going to buy the Joy of Cooking tomorrow). Getting John to pay his bills (I need that money to pay the rent. Gah - Hope his 35000$ car was worth the stress he's caused me.) Getting better (being sick never helped, and being sick over Halloween blows) and being generally more productive.   I edited my resume and sent it off to a customer who asked for it. I went to visit her companies website - aside from the glaring spelling errors and horrendous web design, there is also the fact that I haven't the slightest idea of what the fuck they're trying to sell. That's never a good thing - you can find the site at www.henchcontrolinternational.com. I've got a bunch of websites I promised people I would do. To get myself in the mood, I rewrote my own page. I think I'll have it finished tomorrow - get that gob bullshit banner off there - get some of the university of waterloo nonsense off there and get a little more colour on the page. After that I think I'm going to see if I can finish, or maybe restart the 8 Wheels page, the RA page and maybe one for my dad's business. I should think about writing one for the Ice Park, or maybe even redoing the Hench page and just trying to sell them something that's complete. God knows Hench could use it. *shudder*   So now I'm cold, tired, and I have heartburn. Best thing though is my headache finally took off. Huzzah. Finished Mother of Storms tonight - John Barnes book. I've read it a dozen times, but it's still a nice pulpy easy read.   I think the children next door are already up, getting ready to stomp around their fucking house all day, screaming and crying. I think the parents beat them. If you hear of it in the news, just remember, you heard it here first - but in a system that fucks you if you're wrong on that sort of thing, I'm not going to say a god damned word.   I think I want to start writing again. Maybe in the few hours of sleep I'll manage to get myself I'll be able to find some inspiration. Either then or when I try to get my car fixed tomorrow. Alternator's going. You can tell what with the radio fucking off and it not wanting to run and such. Anyone want to by a previously loved and hated 95 Eagle summit es? Didn't think so.   Well, that's probably enough for this one. I'll see if I b-log more. Hope so. That would be a little more worthwhile, than say, not.

      For the first time in recorded history, I'm awake at an early hour. Did the whole waking up early thing too - porridge, orange juice (multiple glasses thereof) and watching CNN (Happy 'Merican-Thanksgiving.com). It's so early that, other than changing the batteries on my keyboard, I don't know what to do.  John came over last night, that was fun. We played animal crossing, which is always a blast. Earlier, I'd been playing Metroid Prime. Which is the best game - evar. Truly "teh shiznit" as it were. My parents got home from Floridia last night (might as well be a different continent, brought to you by the Land of Old(tm)). As is their way they brought me back countless goodies of goodness in nature. A two tone suede jacket has to be one of the coolest things - Dad picked himself up one, and mom, in her infinite generosity (and desire for me to have the best of everything on the planet - evar) mentioned it'd be cool to get me one too. Dad wants to be cool. He usually is. Hence, new jacket. Fits well too. New shirts and so on were also a sexy part of this deal.  Today I straighten my insurance and most of the deal on the vibe. I can no longer get the Shadow, due to much cock being gobbled at the dealership. That's okay though, the blue and the satellite have grown on me. I think I want the blue. I'm gonna wait to make a call till my dad gets to the dealership today though.  That is all for this transmission. I'm going to go get clean now.   P.S. to all those 'leet readers out there - I can spell ever and the. It's an internet thing. Trust me.

      I Kept my word, I did some pretty serious car shopping today. Got some final figures for the car that I want. Here we go; it is going to be a Pontiac Vibe (shocker!) in either Neptune (blue), Abyss (black) or Shadow (dark grey). It will have the unpainted cladding around the bottom, like the Aztek (one of the bits about the Aztek that I've always liked). It will feature the sport package (6 speakers, 16" Aluminum Wheels, and a powered moonroof), the power package (windows, doorlocks, mirrors and so on), a cargo mat (so things don't slip around in the cargo area, but removable, so when I have filthy stuff, I don't have to worry about cleaning carpet), a bumper strip (prevents scratches, and you can stand on it - nigh essential for my needs), a snowboard carrier (my needs, as mentioned earlier), rubber floor mats (I live in Canada, hello), and  tinted windows (there's a lot of open space in the vehicle, and sometimes I don't want it looked in.  My eagle is a ripe 92 horsepower with 93 foot-pounds of torque. I don't know how I ever got around on this thing. The Vibe is 130hp with 128 footpounds of torque. It's going to be a real pleasure to drive this car. I'm shooting to get my payments around 300$ a month for the next four years. My parents are helping me out with that, which is exciting.  There's an opportunity that I might win the car for free. That would be cool, but I doubt it'll happen. I think what I need to do is find some way to consolidate as much money as possible over the next little while. If I can get that monthly payment even lower, I'll be in great shape. Well, that's enough for tonight.

      So I'm getting more excited about my car purchase. They're offering Zero Percent Financing(tm) now - which constitutes a serious amount of savings in the long run. Tomorrow I'm going to go in and get "final figures. I want to get right down to brass tacks and walk out. mwaha.  This was going to be a much more insightful look into my car buying process, but I think I'm going to call it quits for the night. I've had just about enough of typing.

      Once a month someone in my life (it may even be me) gets all Matrixy and decides to reach into the philosophy range of "Since everything I see/touch/smell/taste/hear is processed as electrical signals, what if what I see/touch/smell/taste/hear isn't what other people see/touch/smell/taste/hear (hence for to be known as to perceive or the process of perception, if you will)" or as I like to call it, "the catch 22 of you don't exist" debate.  Right now, it's a friend of mine at the university of Guelph arguing about the existance of Ghana. While I'm sure the Ghanese (Ghanians? Ghanauts?), if they truly exist, are rather miffed about the prospect of someone a continent away disputing the nature of their existance. Imagine, if you will, your typical Ghanese (Ghanistans? Ghanish?) on a typical day trying to make their living; setting bones in a hospital, writing some fantastical computer program, picking fruit, repairing a truck or weaving the native flax into a poncho for the tourists. Suddenly their loom grinds silent, the wrench falls to the ground, the fruit remains unplucked, the program remains unpatched and the bone sits unset - for the half second that it takes the other Ghanese (Ghanican? Ghanoslavian?) to dissapear. I don't know if it's really within our "rights" to unmake these folks. But hell, they're your neurons. I just hope he doesn't set on me next. Typing without hands would be tough and playing video games simply wouldn't happen. Anyone who does that to me needs to fear the wrath of a vengeful nonexistant spirit.  I think the real question here is "what do we call people from Ghana?".

      Went to see Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets tonight. Neat flick - felt a lot like the first one - which I suppose is the right idea. The rehashing of the John Williams score from the first one was a bit dissapointing - it's all well and good to have themes - but it felt like nothing was really added to this one musically. I loved Kenneth Brannaugh - he made me laugh. There was a good deal of slapstick comedy which made me laugh out loud also.  I appear to be a bundle of joy for everyone I know. That's splendid.  One of my friends took up cigar smoking. Good for her. Hope she doesn't die or anything.   I want to write more, but I'm building up a hate on for things right now, so I'm telling me to fuck off. Fuck off me.

      Thursdays rule. Trains suck.  That's all I have to say about that.  Moving along.  My letter to Mr. Gates  Dear Mr. Gates,              Even though you made me buy another Xbox just to get online, I forgive you. I just bitchslapped some texan motherfucker upside the head with a god damned Particle Projection Canon. Then I shot the building beside him. The building fell on him. I laughed. He heard me laughing.   The greatest thing I've ever experienced happened next. He cried. I fucking heard him starting to cry. He logged out a few seconds later - but my manical laughter and extremely prejudicial l33t skillz made some big tough texan steer ball like a baby.  Thank you Bill. I even forgive you for Windows 95 and Windows Millenium for this. Clean slate bro.  Now boot up your Xbox and some mechassault. I bet I can get you sobbing in Melinda's arms in less time than it takes to make a decent bag of popcorn.  Pussy.  Sincerely,  Graham.  Incidently, Wireless internet fucking rules.

      Got my hair cut today. It's disconcerting to see that shit hitting the apron in front of you in waves inches thick. It hasn't been long since my last hair cut, hence I fear that some day they'll delve too deep and I'll find a grey spongy matter sliding towards the floor obscuring the magic mens logo on it's gravitic trip. The other fear rooted deeply in the act of getting your hair cut is sucking up that first biting wide that violates the very essence of your scalp the exact moment you exit the barber shop. Frankly, fuck you mother nature. I've just had a straight razor and astringent applied to my neck and I really don't need you reminding me all my insulation is gone.  After that I made some phone calls and inquired (enquired? nah, no tabloid shit) about taking a test drive in the Pontiac Vibe, the Toyota Matix and the Mazda Protege5. The Pontaic folks were very polite and arranged one immediately. The Mazda folks said just walk in, we'll give you the keys. The Toyota folks told me to fuck off.  I'm not kidding.   Them "We don't have a test drive model"  Moi "What about a demo in your showroom?"   They "Nope"  Yours truly "One on the lot?"  Das Toyotes "Negatory"  Me-sah "Uh... One in for service? Pictures? Someone that has a decent lore level that can bard one up for me?"  Toyotacock "Fuck off"  Me "Uh...."  Spawn of Satan "...*dialtone*..."  I long for the days of yore... when Toyota sales people wore red, sharpened pencils and jumped in the fucking air and stayed there. These guys wouldn't even give me a half hearted hop if I meant I'd buy Five Matrices. Shit, the ones wearing red were only doing so cause they was representin for the Bloods.   Let's just say that I've ruled Toyota out as a choice, at least from the Cambridge location. Get this - they build the fucking things not 15 kilometres away and they STILL CHARGE $1010.00 Delivery. Fuckers. I'll pick it up thank you. Or rather I won't.  I took the Vibe out first, but I'll get to that second. The Protege5 has got a lot of go... it's a little rocket inside. Headroom is decent, backseats are a bit cramped. The cargo area can be enlarged by folding down the rear seats, the top flips forward and the bottom folds up. Carpet through the whole thing - the radio is okay. Comes in bright yellow which is pretty swank. Decent price. They were going to give me 2700$ for my little red car.  The Vibe on the other hand didn't just make me happy - it blew me away. I really really really like it (reused joke alert). You might say I'm a postive Vibe-rater. Thank you. I'll be here all night, tip your waitress try the veal.  The Vibe drove well, it looks great, it's the one I want. It sits high (higher then the Toyota with the skirt kit), it has more headroom than the Protege5, and it comes standard with most of the things I want. I mean, when I was specifying what I wanted I said "Base model, Power pack, Sports Pack, Rear Bumper protector, Bike/snowboard rack (to go on the standard roof rack) and rubber mats. As opposed to "nah, can't get that, doesn't come with it" etc. etc. etc.  More to follow

      I think I'm beginning to get some insight into Rap culture. Not a lot, and nothing uber significant I'm sure. These guys never grew up. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, two hours of boys teasing the shit out of each other led to me laughing more than I have in a very very very long time.   Eminem will never act again. Or at least, if he's smart he won't - reason for this: He's going out on a high note. He played himself to a T, and I've got to say I enjoyed his performance very much. I doubt very much that this was acting - more of an immersion into a life he's already lived. He'll never top this - I'm sure the boy can't act, but fuck it was fun watching him for the time alloted.  So we essentially are presented with The Karate Kid IV. B Rabbit waxes on and waxes off through the flick, building to a neat climax that had me laughing for a good fifteen minutes. Mehki Phephiphephr is a stellar Mr. Miyagi, what with his dreads and very carefully groomed goatee.   I enjoyed the film. I liked watching Mr. Mathers III rip a strip off some cocky bastards. The cobra gang had nothing on them. If you get the chance, go see it.

      I'm of two minds regarding the social/musical phenomenon known as "rap"  On the one hand my impression is we have hominids, not unlike myself, finding their voice and expressing themselves in what they perceive to be a poetic manner. Their deft manipulations of english and it's rhythmic intricacies is impressive to say the least.  My other impression is that it fucking sucks.  So it is with trepidation that I am going to see "8 Mile" this evening - the story of Marshall Mathers III (does he go by three or the third?) and all the angst he had to put up with as a kid. I'm sure there are a few children on this planet who can say they honestly had it easy as fucking pie as a child, I was not one of them. I never have, nor will I ever (in my foreseeable future) live/lived a tough life; conversely I'm not getting a movie deal to commemorate the worst memories of my youth either. So I'm expecting to see some seriously depressing shit to validate the fact that I'm witnessing a multimillion dollar sploogebath in the honour of this chaps' life. That said I've got nothing against the fellow - just that I'm not so sure he had it that tough. I guess I'll find out tonight.  In relation to rap - I hate a lot of people, however, my hating skills really do have next to nothing compared to the hate generating power of rap. It's fascinating to see jovial happy youths transformed into do rag wearing, gang colour sporting, rhyme spitting angry bastards of death. It happens to only a few, and yet it happens. I can't help but think that if they didn't listen to this shit and take it so seriously, they would have grown up to be nicer people. Nobody likes a fucking "mad dog killer" attitude, put it away homie.   On the upside I've got dolphins on my radio in my car. Yeah, I forked out some extra juice to get the Organic Electro Luminescent  Display. What does that do for me? Starts me down a long path of ricin' it up.

      The drive to work reminded me that while most of the human beings on the planet earth are worth fighting a war to save, there is a small minority for which this is not the case. They all live in K-W. No license plates today, I was too busy shaking my head in utter disgust to harvest them.  Missed my car install appointment at 10. No suprise there, stupid power outage. I hate Waterloo North Hydro.

      It's nearing the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.  It's hard to believe  all of the war films that you see, yet with all the difficulty posed to our imaginations by Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, I don't doubt the veracity of the horror of war.   My father keeps saying that "what this generation needs is a war." Sadly, these men were shaped by a need to survive, not a feeling of omnipotence garnered through technology. To paraphrase, "War *was* hell*, now it comes down to bugs in the software and miss dropped air strikes.  To the men and women who fought so bravely to defend us against a terror much much worse than anything seen in the last forty years, thank you. You did so with little more than your own ingenuity and zero technological advantages.  I'm not sure which President said it - FDR or Truman, but "We owe so much, to so few...."

      My dad and I looked at the some cars tonight. The Mazda Protege5, The Toyota Matrix and The Pontiac Vibe. I've been trying to figure out what I want in a vehicle - I've been critical of others for buying cars simply for style and so on, so I had to examine what I like in a car. Power I don't really give a shit for - it does at least 140 and that's generally as fast as I'd ever need to go, even in an emergency. Gas mileage is a concern, but so is carrying capacity and height. I want a vehicle that I feel taller in than my little red puddle jumper. I also want space in the rear seats for people with legs. Carrying double amputees is about what my current back seat is for. Four doors are a must, as is a roof rack. A nice sun or moon roof would be great (what the fuck is the difference between the two anyway??)  I looked at the Civic. Everyone's got one, it doesn't have the carrying capacity I want and it's just a little too generic. Also, the temptation to rice it up would be far too great and I'd end up with it a quarter inch off the ground - my vocabulary would be replaced mostly with such stellar examples of english composition as "shit niggah" and "word" and I'd have to drive the fucking thing off a cliff.  I looked at the Golf and the Jetta. While classy cars both, they are a little out of my comfortable price range. A nice TDI with leather would be incredibly efficient on fuel, but smell to high heaven. The trunk on the Jetta only holds a single body, and every time I seem to see a multiple vehicle accident, there seems to be a Golf sandwiched in there somewhere. One of my customers at work swears by them, but by his very words, he swears at them whenever there is something that needs to be repaired. Apparently you need a hoarded sum of Nazi-thefted gold and art when these Wagons-of-the-People(tm 1933 - Das Fuhrer) break down. Just like the Nazis. Fifty years after the war they're still fucking us.  I looked at the Kia Sportage. For about ten seconds. Thought process - "Hey, what about the Sportage? *pause* It's a fucking KIA."  The Honda CRV has gone up in price and down in looks and fuel efficiency since my mom bought one.  Whilst at a film not too long ago (who am I fucking kidding - it's been months since I've been to the god damn theatre - feels like) I noticed (HAH) the ads (puke) for the Toyota Matrix and the Pontiac Vibe. I've always kinda liked the "Sport Wagon" concept - which is rather counter intuitive considering my utter loathing of the station wagons of yore. That particular spur of my psyche might have something to do with the fact that I was driven to a camp as a youth in the back of one. It also may not.  Someone at work drives a bright yellow Mazda Protege5. I think the colour caught my attention. I added it to the portfolio of vehicles I was considering considering based on its "oooooh SHIIIIIIIIINEY" factor. In fact, I think my brain yelled "SHINE GET!" the first time I actually touched it. As I was browsing the Mazda site on "teh intar-web" I noticed that Red and White paint are both free, while Mazda reserves the right to charge $105 Canadian so you can have it in a colour that doesn't suck. (note to self, pick up a jelly wrist rest for keyboard tomorrow) After seeing the Other Two(tm) tonight, my interest in the Protege5 faded.  So I've settled on either the Toyota Matrix or the Pontiac Vibe. There are several interesting aspects to this decision.   Primarily: They are the same car. Toyota builds the underbits and Pontiac buys that, then slaps on their Vibe-ish top bits.  Secondarily: Both of the names are steeped in Dorkitude. First - "No one can be told what the Matrix is..." and all the requisit bullet time bullshit *that* goes along with it. The commercials in the the theatre were decidedly Ghey. Secondly - Vibe? Why not just call it the Pontiac Asspiercing Lubemaster? FUCK!  So my father and I set out in the worst storm to hit the Great Lakes area in at least ten minutes to examine the nature of Das Matrix and The Pontiac Jiggle. The Matrix's uniform colour scheme doesn't work quite as well as the two tone of the Vibe. The Vibe, as I found out upon returning home, is actually the replacement for the Pontiac Aztek, or as it was known by everyone, the Asstek. That particular Detroit mistake was the one with the built in tent in the back - cool idea, but somehow they didn't take into account that the damn thing looked like hammered shit. The Vibe on the other hand is pretty sexy.  I think between the two, the Vibe is the one I'm more interested in. They both share common features in the interior - what appears to be a lot of headroom, a dash mounted shifter, leg room in the rear - a large cargo tray and 60/40 splits rear seats that are backed in plastic. The Vibe is more expensive, however it comes with more standard features. Besides, when it comes to the pontiac, I really like the commercial with the little bobbleheaded dog grooving to the music. If they throw one of those in, I'll buy two.    The three prices involved - $26,812.25 for the Protege5 - $25,490.00 for the Vibe and $24,730.75 for the Matrix. The Pontiac is the best equipped of the lot, with the sunroof and all the trimmins. I think I'm going for a test drive tomorrow.

      Pros and Cons, Pros and Cons, Pros and Cons.  In all things be equal said my father, so I believe this topic has required more introspection.  Video Game Films that haven't been so bad (Aka the Short List) Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within It had the great Donald Sutherland - father of Keifer and the guy who made lisps acceptable everywhere. A Baldwin Brother bites it, sadly so does Steve Buscemi, Mr. Rhames and Roz from Fraser. Hell - it's got James Woods. You could have him read the phone book and I'd pay to see it. In Swahili.  Video Game Films that blow more than your average Saigon Whore Double Dragon It had Robert "Liquid *fucking* Metal" Patrick and still managed to suck.  Mortal Kombat/Annhiliation Christopher Lambert, how you've fallen, there should have only been one. Didn't I see these films the first time round as Enter the Dragon?  Wing Commander I dig Matthew Lillard - great as Shaggy. In this hunk of tripe though, good god. Why didn't we have Mark Hamill, John Rhy-Davies and Malcolm McDowell... they were great in the game (GCV - Grainy Choppy Video!! First game on DVD!!)  Street Fighter Most criminal thing about this wad of shit - it was Raul Julia's last flick.  The Pokemon Movies - Let's not go there, shall we?  Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever I think Antonio Bendaras is a great guy, who's done some decent work. I think Lucy Lui is a bit of a putz. This film is a suckage great than either could generate on their worst day.  It's all about the numbers. These flicks just don't have the forces of good on their side.

      Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the theatre - what do we get?  Pac Man. The movie.  Video games have a long and storied history of being turned into movies. Movies have a long and storied history of being turned into video games. There's a general consensus on the results. Most of the tripe generated sucks more than your average black hole. For the sake of brevity, I won't include comic book/movie adaptations and their subsequent sequel dynamics; well, for the sake of brevity and the fact that there's only so much band width to go around.  When I discuss movie/videogame adaptations, I do make several exceptions for what I like to call "The Hybrids" - Movies about videogames in general - Wargames, Tron, The Wiz. While all of these films have a certain level of suck attributed to them and their cheese factor has garnered them endorsements from the diary council of Canada - we love them nonetheless. For the few, the proud, the elite - (read: Children of the Eighties) these films were our childhood and we won't stand for anyone fucking around with them.  Incidently, reheated popcorn chicken r0xors my b0x0rs and burns the roof of my mouth. Sweet sweet pain.  So back to the biggest mistakes made by Hollywood/Silicon Valley. Perhaps the most telling example is based on the most well known video game of all time - Super Mario Brothers. The english language, while rife with terms synonymous with shit, simply can not map the breadth and scope of the suckage of this film. It takes a lot to make Dennis *fucking* Hopper look stupid. In the case of this film, mission accomplished with an hour to spare.  It's equally difficult to take Angelina "My lips obviously crave wang" Jolie, put her in tight shorts and give her a pair of guns and make it gobble chode with plenty of teeth. However, Tomb Raider - Das Flick managed it.   Tomb Raider and Mario both have plots; albeit the plots are meagre. Save the Princess. Find the lesbian lover - er... treasure.   PAC MAN IS ABOUT EATING FUCKING DOTS AND CHASING GHOSTS.     FOR NO REASON OTHER THEN THEY ARE THERE.   feck. With all the factories in the states churning out weapons and bullets, we still haven't been able to eliminate the one species on this planet that's fucking it up for the rest of us.  Dumb studio execs.

      I got an insanely early night last night. Woke up to find my internet access shot. Apparently my modem released my ip and was unable to re-establish it. One thing is making work bearable right now, that's four hours of Star Trek back to back. Which is great even if one of the eps has to be from voyager. It's kind of like reading an author you hate, you don't enjoy it, but it's valuable from a literary criticism standpoint. Bought a CD Rack for my cd's so I can finally get rid of my stupid tilt a whirl rotate a cd holder. I may put that downstairs when I eventually get a stereo (I might buy a stereo!!)  I'm thinking of turning the corner of my bedroom into a little board game centre. Four chairs or stools that would fit under a table just the right size for some board games and drinks. I think I might build the table myself and put a chess/checkers board right into the surface. I'm going to look around and see how it's done.  That is all.

      so it's been a few days since I've updated. Work is ass. I've been a little tired of late. But I did get up and make myself breakfast for the first time in years. I mean *years*.  Promises are a great thing. Troublesome at times, but great. Still going strong. It's hard sometimes, but you've just got to deal.   I think the pun in the last line almost made me die laughing.  Being cryptic is one of the most fascinating things to do. Pity for those who don't get it. Mwa-ha.

      Got my dad a cabinet from work today. That kind of makes up for not even keying in my DAMN HOURS. Talk about a stupid day. Meh. So we got my dad this cabinet - it's all nice and glass and so on. I'm just downloading new scanner drivers for my parents on their machine - their getting close to 200 kbps from hp - that's extremely rare. I consider myself a fortunate soul to have seen such a miracle.  Well, as soon as this is done I'm off to the moose where Jeff is going to indulge my food based whims cause I'm carting him around to his car dealership tomorrow. Huzzah.

      Still at work. Talked to a few nice people - and a few gomers. Death to the gomers. Star Trek was good this morning - it's the one where they have to kill the vampire thing - the vampire thing in the cloud - not the salt sucker woman. Two very different episodes. One of the Red Shirts tried to judo chop Kirk - Jim T gave him a punch in the jaw for his trouble.  So Jason's going on about the new Windows XP. Hopefully it will also come with a life for him. Ahem.

      Well things are slightly more back to normal now. It's monday morning. I'm at work. The drive in was delightful - well there was the truck that tried to run me off the road - he's my hero. In fact, he gets to be the first asshole featured on my bLog for bad driving (at least the first one I can identify!)  It was a dump truck. Blue. License plate 758 8EV. Name of Den Rick painted on the side. Where ever you are sir, I hope you're having a bad bad day.  So I'm going to sit down and play some Metroid in a bit - we don't have a cycle count this morning, so I get to relax.

      Got my car back. $200 bucks solved the problem. Proves that anything goes away provided you throw enough money at it. Had to walk to get it though. IN THE SNOW. Bad - walking in snow. Good - gliding on graphite on snow. Can't wait to ride.  Today at work kind of sucked. Picked up the Santa Clause and watched it when I got home. I like that movie. It's got charm. It's got Judge Reinhold.t.d.t. I also bought Spiderman. For a dollar. That was cool. Got a slip of paper a few days ago, which, when scanned today, reduced the price of the flick by roughly 23.99. One dolla is a great price for any movie. Plus I got a free Tshirt - another Adult Large - for some reason they're like parachutes on me - Neck almost fits round my shoulders.  Money at work sucked today. I had to approach a quote weilding father and son (my least favorite customer type following the smelly single middle aged balding man-looking-for-a-fight. The father inevitably speaks bad english (Filippo's was pretty bad) the son is cocky and thinks' he knows everything (he didn't) and they want credit (which they usually don't get, but god was in a giving mood today, so Filippo got Six Fucking Thousand Dollars. God wasn't in such a good mood to spare me their request for a discount every five seconds.  So I got home and made some bagel bites. Watched the SC. Garnered a headache beyond all human reasoning. I shouldn't have gone back to work, I'm still not better. Just took some advil and typed this.  I think I'm being stupid when I think that someone's not going to talk to me again, but I get a sinking feeling I'm right :(

      So my last post didn't show, even though it shows me posting it. Stupid log.  I'm sick. I still don't have a car. One of my best friends undoubtably hates me at this point.  At least I might be getting a decent job with a company for their website.   To that certain someone out there in cyberland: I'm sorry. I hope you had a good time tonight. I don't blame you if you loathe me til the end of time.

      As this year draws to a close I'm taking the time to refle....  Actually I'm not. I'm in the process of beating Escape from Monkey Island and 007 Nightfire. Halo pissed me off, the last level sucks the biggest wang you ever did see - for ten levels the game has been a combat fps and for the last FUCKING five minutes they decided to turn it into a driving game. I may or may not have mentioned that I loathe driving games. I actually returned all $200 worth of Gran Turismo III and Force Feedback Wheel when I realized that the game was really the bane of my existence. Talk about frustrating. I'm going to see if I can beat it New Years Day - that'd be a good way to start off the year.   On the note of Monkey Island 4 - well the first three were fun - the fourth one still has the same great sense of humour and a lot of lovely injokes for those of us who've stuck with the series. It's also *gasp* gone 3d. For those of you who don't play many adventure games, 3D is usually their death knell. It means that the company has decided to become "proactive" and regain the "cutting edge". HEY FUCKOS - clue in - those of us who play adventure games don't give a good God Damn(tm) whether or not the game has more or less polygons than a rubix cube - what we're looking for is challenging puzzles, stupid inventory tricks and bad puns. Fuck you and the 3d engine you rode in on.  The nonspecific rage that filled me scant minutes ago has begun to subside. It might have something to do with the stuffed animals in my lap. Only time will tell

      My brain has turned on me. They say that the brain itself has no sensory nerves for detecting pain within itself as a unit. My brain has clearly grown a set and has implemented a "jackhammer per nerve" policy. Agony does not begin to describe the current state of my being. I would write more, but it pulses with every click of the keys.

      So work was decent today. Not as good as I'd have liked, but better than I'd hoped. I've begun a campaign that can be described as nothing more than the utter destruction of one stupid man. Jerry King.  To put Jer.King (as I like to call him) in perspective - this is the chap that tears the crossword out of all our daily newspapers and never finishes them. He argues for the sake of arguing (we're open till nine he says the manager, who replies, the newspaper says ten, to which Jerry replies the door says nine.  urlLink The manager glares and thinks to himself. ) and he's a rude son of a bitch who always attempts to take the moral high ground, even though he lost it long ago. A bitter broken late forty year old man with his sixth (illegitimate) child on the way from his short, rotund, rather homely guatemalan wench. I intend to break him further.  He decided to get into a stupidjerry fight with Jeff today. Brought religion into it, on the floor. Something I've had to chastise him about several times already. I'm writing the complaint to our general manager right now. He has a friend who never leaves the damn store, but never buys anything. His friend enters the store after we're closed to distract and make fun of employees (get a FUCKING JOB you commie pinko bastard!!)  He decided to pick a fight with me again today. I've given this guy the benefit of the doubt for the better part of two years. No longer. It ends today.  The Following People are NOT loved by Jesus: Jerry King. That is all

      Fuck. Just lost my entire entry.  Ok, so here's the deal. I get in at 8:05 this morning and what do I hear? Five different forms of music being BLARED through the store. I waged a subtle warfare on the rest of my co-workers, unplugging TV's, muting DVDs, rotating the dial of the receiver in music from "FUCK YOUR BRAIN" to "Hey, that's not so bad." Seriously,  urlLink what the hell is wrong with my co-workers???   I'm thinking of suing the CBC. Or at least, making life incredibly unpleasant for them. A short time ago, they did an "expose" on the extended service packages offered by the place where I work. I wrote a letter to the ombudsman, as I didn't believe the article was well informed, reseached in detail or fair. I received a reply from the ombudsman; he said that he's mainly an appeal authority and that he would be passing my email along to Marketplace. I received an email as a reply from Leslie Peck. Her email basically entailed that  urlLink "yes, our article was well reseached, don't you worry, we've got things under control here" . So, hey, I give you my tax dollars and you tell me, essentially, to bite a wang. So I wrote a strongly worded email to Ms. Peck. It broke down to "yeah, you researched it. Fine. Let me see your research. All of it. Cause if you don't, I'm going to make the biggest stink since King Kong took a shit on the front step of the Empire State Building."  urlLink For fucks sake, these people *work* for me.   There is the small matter of me hating most of the people I work with. It's not a mild dislike. It's not so much a disagreement, or even an agreement to disagree. Fucking hate them with the fire of a thousand suns.  That's all for now, be back later! Smiles and giggles.  Oh yes, the following people are gay: Bill Bignell. That is all.

      The Lord of the Ringolos 2.0: The Towers that haven't been hit by Airplanes is out in theatres as of today. It's good. It's very good. The only thing that irked me was the music - for God's sake, we got the point in the first one, more inspiring speeches backed by insipid music really aren't needed anymore - Pete, for Pe... er... for you own sake, try to have someone inspire us all to the sounds of silence in the background. The Battle for Helm's Deep was appropriately asskicking. It's funny that Sauron's army were faceless bastards wearing turbans...  Possibly the best part of the film was Andy Serkis as Smeagol/Gollum... There's a scene were he's got to make up  his "minds" and the dialogue is delivered phenomenally well.  I just saw a television ad for the "Casual Sex" Dateline. That's a little fucked.    urlLink This  is the funniest picture of all time.

      BWA-HAHAHAHAHAHAH!   The  urlLink House of the Dead   movie reflects my earlier point that most film adaptations of video games are really just an effort by the director to demonstrate to the world just how much wang he or she can cram into his or her mouth at a given time. The thing that makes me laugh here would have to be (well, among others) Jurgen Prochnow's characters' name.... He's the Captain of a Boat. He's name is Victor Kirk. Yes, indeed, that makes him Captain Kirk. BWA-AHAHAAHAHAHAHAH.   Saw Bart and Anita and Rennie and Jen Cole today. They're all doing well. Got to sit down with Bart and Anita as I finished my lunch pita. That was nice. Apparently my drink had an engery booster in it, much akin to dumping speed in my beverage. I must admit, I've typed this entry in a fraction of the time that it usually takes whilst simultaneously cooking dinner and coming up with the roadway to world peace.   meh, all for now, more later!

      Every once in a while, here in Canada, we have a poor bastard that slips his nut. Shoots his bolt, deals himself short, cries over his own spilt milk and/or laments the loss of his marbles through the utter embarassment of himself in public. There are a few reasons that this can happen 1) the chap may be drunk 2) the chap may be a belligerent asshole and no one noticed and or 3)the poor bitch has a brain tumour and no one has noticed yet.  So we've got this yahoo - this complete dork from Saskatchewan. He's in charge of the First Nations out there (which is a bit of a joke, but that's a bridge I'll cross later). He makes a statement claiming that the Nazi's had the right idea when they fried six million Jews. Yikes. I'm thinking this dude has a tumour of some sort - he's 69, he's an angry native (*giggle*) and he lost control of his gums. Thankfully they found a way to shut him up.  Speaking of shutting the aboriginals up - what's the deal with them anyway? Seriously? I've met a few nice ones, but for the most part they're simply angry bitter mean people - kinda like the slavs, but with more of a hokey mumbojumbo mysticism about them. Fuck, England was invaded countless times, as was Germany. Do you see these nations trying to extract reparations out of any of their conquerors? Unfortunately what's happened is the imperialists developed a conscience. Would have honestly been a better thing to simply assimilate and stifle, much like what has happened to European cultures for thousands of years. Darwin was much righter than all of us think.   So that's my controversial viewpoint of the day. It might be motivated by the fact that everytime I get a native into the store who asks for their tax credit, there's some sort of scam going on (I shit you not, EVERY time) and potentially the fact that about 12 out of the 14 natives I can recall encountering were rude to me. Don't hate me cause I'm white. Hate me cause I'm an asshole.

      WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR FUCK UP SPECIES???  A question I'm sure we've all asked ourself more than once. I read what is perhaps the most disturbing artical I've ever read in my life today.  urlLink There are things that make me hate being human.  I have a real problem with dismemberment and/or injuries of any kind. I think it stems back to those commercials for childhood safety that I watched when I was six or seven; the commercial with the gold "Lal" type robot that cut off it's arm then admonished us that while s/he/it could put itself back together, we can not. The extension of the violation of dismemberment is when it is not an accident. I'm not one who enjoys seeing heads chopped off in films, or limbs severed.  Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers are not enjoyable things for me; however, I do find watching them worthwhile. I find the gentleman discussed in the article in question to be one of the most reprehensible human beings on the planet (if he can still be called such - I'm not sure there's a scientific name for ghoul in the categorization of our species). There's a list at the bottom of the article detailing acts of cannibalism over the past few years. I don't condone it, I don't understand it, I don't seek understanding, I seek the elimination of these people and their like from our culture. Rehabilitation is possible for people who've been twisted by the system. I can understand a good deal of our liberal system in this country - these fuckers, however, have to go. Utter removal from the gene pool is almost too good for them. Apparently there is a canibalism subculture. It needs to be found and destroyed. You're  eating  another  HUMAN BEING  for FUCK'S SAKE. There are no excuses or reasons for this sort of behaviour. FUCK.  On a lighter and less protein powered note (see, I do have my sense of humour, still) - Nemesis (or Nemisis, as it appeared on my ticket) was great. I wrote a full entry on it and when my internet connection (more on that later) timed out, I lost the whole thing. Note to me, Copy all entries before publishing. Moving back onto Nemesis - better than Nine, not as good as eight, better than seven, as good as six, what's five?, better than four and three, nothing can be as good as two and one isn't really even from the same series. Patrick Stewart makes bad dialogue sound good. The rest of the cast, however, does not. Worf seemed a little goofy and slightly underused - along with most of the cast. Hopefully the next one will be a bit more of a group effort - it's great to have almighty space battles, but you've also got to have the one thing that makes Star Trek "Star Trek" - the human element. This film had it (I nearly cried at the end) but it just didn't seem to be enough. On that note though - there was a moment between Geordi and Data - completely silent - it spoke volumes of both characters and it spoke volumes to the audience. Brilliant acting and direction all round right there. Oh yeah, and Picard ramming his ship into Shinzon's? Fucking inspired.

      I'm not sure of the exact moment that my job started to blow donkies for drug money, but chances are it had something to do with around 20 fuckers of Muslim persuasion slamming planes into shit that really, according to the manuals that came with them, were not appropriate for having planes slammed into them. It's times like this that I pray there is a God, and for that matter, that there's a Satan - just so those bastards are fucking frying eternally, forced to listen to George Dubya's new album "The 100 reasons Americans are better than you and oh yes, we're going to assimilate you all, you dirty pig fuckers". Needless to say, I spent far too much time at work today, mostly holding a certain part of my anatomy, picturing myself anywhere but there. There were some pretty stupid customers today, but going on about that is really like going on about how the ocean is fucking  wet  or how fundamentalist fucknuts need to  die.  All in all, a pleasurable pass time, but thoroughly over done.  I just watched the tail end of Unbreakable on Cable Box (which I promptly stole from John's room last week. Sorry Johnbon, you weren't using it.) Catching that particular portion of Unbreakable is a lot like eating the cream filling of a twinky without having to subject yourself to the rigours of yellow dye number 5. You get the pay off without having to sit through M. Night's brilliant yet preposterously ponderous pacing of plot. I really enjoy Unbreakable and I like M. Night's style of film-making. However, sometimes you really just want to belt him upside the head and tell him to get to the fucking point. It's not like you can just pop in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable and catch a bit. Oh no, you're there for the God Damned  long haul.   Speaking of films that  can  simply be deposited into a dvd player for easy enjoyment of say, a random boulder about to run you the fuck over, or perhaps, the vaporisation of a gang of Nazis (do you have a gang of Nazis? A flock? Flocking Nazis!!! sounds like Hirohito throwing a temper tantrum), apparently Raiders of the Lost Ark is coming to DVD. Apparently Paramount wants to release the movies as a set - while George and Steve want to release them individually with a set coming down the road. I have to side with Paramount on this one - George knows how to fucking dig for cash and it doesn't look like this effort is any different from those in the past. Just give me my original, non Greedo Shoots First Trilogy (aka, the nonfucked version) and some Harrison Ford in fedora and whip. Christ, they're doing it for Back to the Future! (TUESDAY!!!)  Sunday brings us to the watching of Nemesis. Wh00t. Go Jean Luc Go.  That is all.

      little money to be had today at work. Went in early, left late, didn't really pay off. On the upside, I got something for my dad (on top of the camera bag and lense cleaners I just bought him) that he can use at work. All in all a fairly unproductive day. I've got far too much to do tomorrow, which kinda bites, but there may be some (Revenue Canada, piss off) C to the A to the S to the H in it for me.  Sweet mother of fuck - there's a Barney - Super DEE Duper - Dance Mat available. I thought they merchandised the fuck out of that Purple asspucker and sent him on his way. Good lord!!   I'm watching a movie with Michael Douglas as the president and Annette Benning as the wench he's well... wenching. Dude's a riot. A little Michael J Fox thrown in and hey you've got a flick.  There are a few things that I want for Christmas that I'm going to put on a list that I will carefully leave within reading distance of my rents. I'm looking to get me a terrycloth bathrobe and that slick electric razor that James uses in Die Another Day. I'm pretty sure that shit has a death laser built in as well, and that's why I want it.  Meh, I've got nothing more to say for now.

      There's a lot to be said for milk and cookies. It's not so much the liquidity of the milk or the bisected multilayered nature of the cookies so much as it's the Zen State of Milk and Cookies. I mean, there's this  mindset  you get in when you prepare to consume milk and cookies:  My Cookie Sits there along with milk I'll eat it A state of zen bliss  The cookies and milk hearkens back to my childhood when the cookies and milk were not provided by me, let alone consumed willy nilly at any random point. The communal wafer and beverage was laid out by the most Dietic figure in my life for reasons dictated at which point I partook in the ritual consumption of the offerings. When I sit down to milk and cookies now I think back to my childhood and give thanks for the opportunities that I had to eat them. I also wonder why my mom was such a stingy bitch with the milk, it's not like the fucking cow was going to run dry.

      So work really is the root of all evil. Today I had someone violate my ears with a stupid question (well not *some*one per se, more or less *every*one). Had a chappy call up and here's how the conversation goes.  Me -  "Computers, thanks for holding *me* speaking"  Voice of an obvious stoner trying to emulate Bobcat Goldthwait on every possible social, economic and spiritual level - "Hi there *snort I just *gasp* bought a computer from *snasp* you guys with a *gnort* one year warranty..."  Me - "Yup."  Bobcat - "and I was wondering... do you... does it cover.... I just ejaculated on my keyboard"  Me - "oh yeah. We cover it. totally"  Suprised Goldcat Bobthwait "you... like... *sngront* cover it if I..."  Me - "Yeah. We do. And you know what? Next time you're gonna shoot some cum on your keyboard, aim it up and try to get it in your FUCKIN EYE!"  Both of us - "Click"  I realize that the Crank Caller of Stupidity got what he wanted there... But it still felt good to get the last witty line in, sort of the final thrust in our witty rapier like repartee. The rest of the day was entrenched thoroughly in mediocrity - although there was a high point - had a computer expert friend (tm) come in to look at a computer for a customer and try to flesh things out  - He DEMANDED windows XP pro on the system he wanted - I asked him why and got the standard CEF(tm) answer - "It's better, Windows XP Home sucks". Which features of Windows XP Pro does your friend need, I asked. Of course, the CEF(tm) declined to answer that question, because, as I found out later, he wasn't even fucking AWARE, on some primal level, of the differences between home and pro. STFU SMF. GAH.  Work was a lot of wankin if I do alliterate so myself. Bought a lot of tin shit though - screen wipes, a mini mouse - a new mouse for my dad for Christmas and so on. One of the Mice had a negative cost in the system and the other had a cost of 18 cents.  My chair has started to squeak, but for some reason I felt dirty when I had the urge to lubricate it. Silly Catholic upbringing.   Watched the Specialist tonight after I ate dinner. Stallone bum was a bit much. Sharon Stone is a whore. I'm sure she's a lovely person, but GOD DAMN that woman has had ZERO issues flaunting her Tatas and all the rest. Tuck em away Sharon. It was good seeing James Woods again. I love the guy. So very very evil.  So Star Trek 10 and Lord of the Rings 2 coming out fairly soon, along with Back to the Futures 2 and 3 (along with One). There are no new ideas.  On that note, I'll bid you a Hammersteinian So long, farewell, Auf Weidersein, Good Niiiiiight!

      Took delivery on my car two days ago... it's fantastical... Everything is exactly as I want. The tints make it look like a sexmobile though, which may be a bit offputting for some :)  I'm up far too late for when I have to be up in the morning. I should be catching some major z's right now, but as usual, I don't know what's good for myself... well I do, but I ignore me. Nothing quite like that voice of reason that you ignore over and over. So work's been a general bust lately. Can't say it's good having more people on staff, cause it just plain isn't. Steve hired two more guys to work with us, one for the floor and one for upgrades. It's just plain overkill, kinda like using one of those Daisy cutters on the poor bastards in Afghanistan. Gets the job done I suppose. I had a bit of a run in with Jerry a few days ago. Dude stepped in front of me as I was approaching a customer. I totally wanted to kill him. He actually sped up to get in front of me. I can't believe anyone would do that, at least not in our environment.  So aside from him being an utter dingus - the fact that Christmas seems to have been hijacked by Al Queda (bet that line got a few stares from the NSA webbots) really sucks. No one is out spending the copious amounts of money they should be. It's going to be a lean few months for some in January if this doesn't pick up.  I get the auto start and the radio installed in my new car on December 17th. Apparently the friend of mine who fixed my exhaust not too long ago managed to get an appointment - but it had to be for 8 hours of labour!! Stupid Malibu! In the meantime, I get to freeze my butt off everytime I get into my car. Meh.  Band of Brothers keeps getting better in quality as the war gets worse in nature. It was sad to see Lt. Hawk go (Buck Compton) but we knew it was coming. I just hope the chap from Office Space makes it through. It's a bit weird to be rooting for guys you know won the war - and knowing that they may not come out alive. It's hurts a little. It's just TV though. I'm suprised I get such an intense feeling from TV, but it's remarkably well done. I wish we had HBO up here in Canada, I'd purchase it just to support them.  On that note, why do Canadian television series generally hurt so badly? It's not like we don't throw a lot of money at them. Sonja Smits must be getting really tired of being part of failed series... poor lass was in traders when it died, and now the 11th hour is barely out of the gate and already in the stages of a coronary. I remember that series about a news network that had the gay producer - they killed that off too... The 11th hour looks to be more of the broadcast side, but so far the stories have been a bit weak.  I'm going to try to sink my teeth into 24 in the next little while. Bought the set on DVD and I haven't even touched it yet. I really have to start reclaiming my time. It kind of blathers away on me. DVD is a real problem - so many series, so little time. Star Trek is the worst offender. three series in like three weeks with them. gah.  Deep space nine is coming out on DVD in January - it has to be possibly the ugliest DVD case I've ever seen in my life. Pink just doesn't do Terok Nor justice.  So, when I got my car, no less than five minutes off the lot, some bastard tried to reverse himself into me to get himself out of the way of the truck. God only help him if he had have hit me. I laid on my cheap japanese weenie horn until he gave me the finger. Motherfucker stopped though. The past couple days have been slightly harrowing as I've been paranoid about everything that has come within 10ft of me.  Jim and Andrew and I are thinking about maybe starting a website selling car modifications - nothing cheesy like riceboy shit, but classy addons. We're going to sit down on Tuesday and try to hammer some details out...

      Welcome to December.  Big things happened today. Bought my car. I found a black one with all the stuff I wanted - I'm a little concerned though, well, kind of happy - from the bill of sale I receieved - these guys forgot to charge me for all the accessories that I wanted. I went with black after they parked a black one and a silver one side by side. That and the fact that 90% of the cars on the road are silver. gah. Stupid Japanese and their metallic paints. I'm a little sad to see my other car go. It's been so good to me - it was the first car I ever got into an accident in while driving (well, actually while sitting still - I was rear ended). It has some other Ray Barrone-esque sentimental value as well - but we shan't go into that. I don't know if this is the first stage of seperation anxiety, but I'm gonna miss the little guy.  Just finished watching the second season of The Soprano's. That show is tearing my heart out. I'm loving it. It's really an emotional rollercoaster. It's kind of interesting - my life seems to be going decently - I think I'm being depressed vicariously through James Gandolfini.

      I was just reminiscing about today's adventures in kicking my own ass, using a blunt ski hill as an instrument of violence. It seems that speaking gently to the slopes, pleading for tolerance and patience really only angers them and accelerates the force by which you are slammed into the ground. Repeat this phrase: Gravity is not my friend. Gravity is not even the nice man who offers me candy if I'll get in the car with him. Gravity is a soulless reaperlike motherfucker hell bent of mangling my body for the sole purpose of entertaining those around me. I still caught some of that air though. Fuck yeah.  A sad occurrence: it seems that one of my frequent trips down the hill on parts of my person other than the board has caused a recurrence of the injuries I sustained in a car accident over a year ago. There's a knot behind my left shoulder that honestly feels like someone is grinding their knuckles into my back. In reality, the only thing that will relieve this pain in someone grinding their knuckles into my back. That's Alanis-level yo.

      From time to time, those around me see fit to query my opinions on a variety of intellectual and philosophical points of discussion. One that I have pondered in great depth is the existence and nature of justice. Some would believe that no matter what our court systems produce in the way of sentencing, there still remains the great pillar of fire in the sky, or the burning bush or some carpenter's kid who at the end of the day will pronounce judgement on us all. While I don't proclaim to have any more insight into this particular topic than say, The Pope(tm) or perhaps the Queen of England(tm) I do believe I've found an example that yes, there is such a thing as justice, yes, there is a God(tm), and yes, s/he has one fucking hilarious sense of humour, not to mention a  urlLink love for animals.   Why, of why God(tm), can't I live in London and have a  urlLink spare Fifteen thousand pounds?

      In an effort to avoid an accident today, I almost caused one. Admittedly the chap I almost hit was speeding and weaving - hence me not noticing him, but it still doesn't excuse me from double checking my blind spot. As my mother says "you little fucking bastard, I'll kill you."  Oh.  Sorry, she also used to say "It's not you on the road I worry about, it's all the other idiots." Dangle that participle.  Got groceries today. 100% less dying involved when you eat.  Work today was good. Met with Steve. Sometimes I really can't tell whether I'm going to get promoted or not in this job. I should probably sit down with Tyson and go over what to do and what to say. I have trouble bonding with the managers sometimes simply because I'm not the person they want me to be. I don't drink, I don't smoke and I don't really give a damn about professional sports. I'm a hell of a talker, but I think I have trouble giving a shit about irrelevant things. Mother always told me having depth would fuck me up later in life. Well, she didn't really, but it makes me laugh to think she might have.  I've officially changed my stance on pierced noses. The rings make people look stupid. The studs are adorable. On girls. Guys, why the fuck are you putting things through your noses? Leave that to the girls, you don't need to add cute to yourself or anything. Go wrestle.  Zoolander's a funny film. I can see how it's an aquired taste though. I just keep picturing Ben Stiller as Tom Cruise and I fucking die laughing. The two of them desperately need to do a film together.  I thought I'd come up with a cure for stupidity, but it turned out to be merely a recipe for a sundae. Fuck it.

      I don't often think of my self as a handicapped or disabled person - but it occurred to me on the drive home this evening that those descriptions would apply to me. I crested a ridge in my car, driving on the highway. As I did, the lights of the city glittered in front of me - a defect in my contacts lenses - as they dried out, the image in front of me twinkled. It was very beautiful, but at that moment, I thought "I wonder if anyone else has ever seen this?". It's sort of disheartening to realize that, along the lines of Gattaca, you're a defective human being. Should natural selection have weeded me out? Meh, it's just my eyes, but still. As a kid I always felt bad about sports simply because I couldn't see the ball or puck or birdie. Mom thought I was trying to get attention, assumed I wanted to be like Kneale Turner (my best friend) cause he'd just got glasses. Sad really. Not that I blame mom. She's the best mom I've got, and i wouldn't trade her for the world.  Went snowboarding today. I'm sure it was cold outside, (-18 degrees centigrade) but it certainly helps to have the right equipment. I haven't lost much of the skill I had last year... after the first few runs, I was back to my old style... felt great. Not usually a speed junkie, but there's a lot to be said about whipping down a snow basted slope on a slab of graphite and aluminum with only your wits and a bit of plastic holding you together. There's a lot to be said, and I'm sure I'll say more about it over the next few weeks.  Reading CNN right now, it seems that the world is going to hell in a rather large overly well armed hand basket. A few shout outs to my homeys - North Korea, Iraq, the chaps of al Queda - FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU RIGHT IN THE EAR. God damn commie-dictator-fanaticmuslim bastards! (note to normal, law abiding Muslims who don't believe I'm a representative or a member of the "Great Satan" - you're all right. Get these other fellahs in order, eh?) Speaking of North Korea - What the fuck?? I thought communism had been ground under the rather stylish designer jackboot of capitalism a long time ago. You guys are sooooo 1983 it's not even funny. Feck off ya radge bastards.

      24 becomes more and more suspenseful as days (hours) go by. I think there should be some sort of accountability in Hollywood regarding the amount of stress you can apply to your viewers in a given period of time. Were such standards set, I'm sure 24 would be in violation of them, no matter how lax they might be. Approximately 10 hours into the series we  finally  receieved our first pseudo-break in the tension. Bastards.

      Good morning sunshine, as it's put in the parlance of our times. Drive home last night was as fun as a kick in the pants. The Drive in was as fun as TWO kicks in the pants. I was "late" in that I thought I was supposed to be in at 8:30 when in actuality (love that word) my start time was 9:00. So it's meh-tacular.  Did some exercising last night - I actually own exercise videos. Strange thing, I woke up refreshed. I guess it's true, I'm really not getting enough exercise.  Meh, Tyson's doing the security audit. We have a screen saver that makes people pee.  Mike in software decided to be a bit of a pain this morning. He was just standing in software watching Lilo & Stitch so I asked him to go and straighten up some of the titles on their shelves. Instead of giving me some sort of concilliatory answer - which will usually get anyone off your back here - he decided to challenge it. Dude's got a chip on his shoulder about the size of Rhode Island.  urlLink Moodybitch (tm).

      Wow. It's been a few days, and there have been some interesting happenstances.   Saturday January 18th ruled. Very much. I've been happier in my life, but that involved four pounds of chocolate, Alex Trebek, a skein of yarn, a ball of twine and some souvlaki. It's always nice to see people you've missed for *four* years - it's even better when they're happy to see you. Happy happy happy happy happy.  Brad called me tonight. Of course, it was not just a phone call, it was tech support.  I met the rudest woman in the world today. Leanne Carter of Kitchener. Bitched at me cause I wasn't replacing her notebook fast enough. Well guess what bitch? I know where you live, what classes you take and the fact that your resume sucks ass. Note to people bringing computers in to techinicians. You really need to think about being a fucking wang biter before you bring that in. After is fine. Before means I could decide to fuck you just about anyway I please.  And I did.  Bitch.

      Just finished watching a brilliant trek episode - one of the few that can make me cry. An Inner Light - the episode where Picard is scanned by a probe and proceeds to live 45 years in 25 minutes. The flute that Kamen (Picard's alter ego) played - a penny whistle - produced one of the most beautiful sounds I've ever heard. Patrick Stewart really did some fantastic work on this episode - you believe the man.

      The aftermath of yesterdays upgrade is as follows - the good karma gained by an enjoyable and fucntional supersizing of my electronic shitpile had to be balanced by something today, nautrally. So DT, my laptop customer the other day brought me a bag of stupid. Not his, no he's a pretty cool guy. Instead, the bag of stupid is care of someone who's apparently the smartest person on the planet - cause good god damn, the fucker works at RIM. People, please be aware, just because someone works at a purveyor of technology, it does not equate to them actually having any sort of knowledge in related fields. Translation - DT's buddy created a PPPoE VPN to connect to rogers. Wirelessly. Through a broadband router with a broadband wireless adapter.  If you don't get what goes on there, essentially all you need to do to make that shit work is plug it in. Apparently DT's RIMjob didn't quite gather that. I mean, it's only common fucking knowledge, how should he have garnered it? I swear, at this point, people should have to obtain licenses to reproduce.  Paul's graciously letting me use the WYSE terminal in the tech room for my rant, as I will not be participating on the sales floor today. Frankly, I had it up to the top of my dumb metre only minutes after the store opened. Pity - as I was in good spirits post wakening this morning.  Roz needs to use the computer, so I'm loggin out now.

      To sum up Saturday the 11th:  I killed a video card and a hard drive. Don't ask how, it's really none of your business - let's just break it down to the fact that when they say you should use a static wrist strap, they're right - but it still won't do fuck all if you try to overclock a 400 to 1.2 land. So I have a crispy GTS Pro and a smoked 30 Gig Maxtor 7200.  As you can probably tell, I wasn't really using either for anything - but thankfully I have futureshop's superkeen over the counter exchange program. So I got me a brand new GeForce4 Ti4200 and a Sound Blaster Audigy 2. (didn't need another hard drive anyway).  Popped those in, the upgrade ran smoother than butter. That's a first. Guess they're all starting to get the hang of this whole "plug and/or play" thing. So my computer posts around 14000 on 3dmark2001se. That's pretty rad. Go me, go me, go go go me.  So I'm really starting to get excited about gameboy stuff. First there's the advance 2.0. And there's also the  urlLink Gameboy Player  which lets a user play gameboy games on their gamecube (and hence, on their bigscreen TV).  Nintendo - you may not push the most polygons, but between Mario, Zelda, Metroid and the Gameboy - you've got my dollar.

      To top it off, I feel like Ross Geller. I mean, I've been through three roommates in three years. Bad experiences all. THREE! Most people who have three roommates are like thirty. You usually get a few good ones in between, just to cleanse your palate. Not so I. Three fucking roommates in a row that didn't work out. It must be me. I don't get it - I deoderize, do most of the cleaning/maintenance. So evidently there's something utterly vile about my personality which drives regular people for the hills and the slightly unscrupulous to let's fuck our roommate land.  Then again, I could just be blowing things out of proportion and John might just want his TV at home.

      As the night wears on, I'm giving this a little more thought. John has the day off tomorrow. I suppose he might try to get his bed out as well, leaving a truly empty room in his wake.

      So it finally happened. John moved most of his stuff out.  For those of you who haven't been following our story - John is... was my roommate. I'm really three for three at this point. First there was Rob Bannerman, with whom I could do no right. Whenever I wanted to watch TV, he wanted to watch TV. When I had friends over, they were unwelcome, whenever he had friends over, it wasn't my place to complain. Next there was Meredith and Rob. The second Rob I got along with just great (we had one fight - physical - and after I picked him up from the hospital, we were doing just fine). Meredith was the bitch to end all bitches. Simply the most aggravating person I've ever encountered. Didn't like any of my friends, felt it was her place in front of my TV - and expected me to fuck off anytime she wanted it, even though she welched on the god damn bill more times than I can count. BITCH.  Then there's John. It's a conundrum, because John I like. But sometime around September, he decided that the car that his father had given him was no longer good enough for him. The passenger seat was broken - instead of repairing or replacing the seat on the vehicle (95 Buick with 300 Hundred K on it.) So he bought an Acura RSX Premier. Rang in at around $32, 000 after taxes. It was at that point that he decided that he simply couldn't afford to live with me anymore. Naturally I was confused, felt betrayed and was leaking furious all over the place. So we came to an agreement. He would pay rent and utilities, as we had agreed to earlier. I'm not sure how this was saving him money, but I didn't ask. After all, I, as roommate/friend, was not consulted a single time. But meh.  So a few months go by. I get paid rent. Utilities seem not to matter to him. He now owes me $600 in utilities. $150 a month is what we agreed on, even that's not the 50% we had originally set down.   Then I come home today and just about everything is moved out of his room. I suppose I feel better about that then seeing almost two grand worth of electronics sitting there being unused. Then again, if he decides to welch on me, there's not much left to pawn. The fact that he did it while I was away at work and didn't even mention it to me - well that feels sneaky. I get the feeling my next conversation with John may not be as pleasant as I'd like.  Then again, if I'm getting fucked here, don't any of you, my readers, think I'll take it lying down. I like John. He's my friend. But I'll be less of a human being if he thinks that I'll just let a couple of thousand dollars fly.

      Three seconds. Apparently that's the time it takes for a police officer to determine that a dog is a lethal threat.  urlLink This has to be one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen in my life.  I was disturbed to hear about this story. I was even more disturbed to see the video. I simply can't imagine what was going on in the mind of the officer who shot this dog. The situation was grossly mishandled from the word go. Then again, if this had have been a carjacking and one of the officers hurt, there would have been hell to pay. Confusing, yet accurate, I think.  24 is simply amazing. I sit in shock and watch. You honestly don't notice an hour sliding away.

      So there's a new Gameboy Advance out - the  urlLink Gameboy Advance SP . So I'm putting myself down for two of them today. Cause only owning one of something this fucking cool would be a pity. They come in metallic blue and platinum. I will have one of each, thank you.   There's been a plane crash in North Carolina. It's a bit of a relief, cause it was pilot error, as opposed to, say, a crazy fellow with some candles and an alarm clock strapped to him screaming for the justice of Allah and the palestinian people. Folks like that give good muslims a bad name. That bad name is terrorist.  Who the fuck needs an automatic weapon to hunt? Really?  Anywho. That's all for now. More later.

      It begins. Again.   By that I mean my education has returned to do with me what it wills.  School then work then school was today's pattern. Finally got my schedule flattened out - it's a little more User Friendly(tm) now, but it's still a heavy load.  My history class was *full*. Seriously full. Glad I got there early. Got to stare at the bitches who didn't have syllabi or seats. Suckahs. We did the usual - examine the 'bus, yak about academic offences (personally I'm academically offended that, after four years, they're still going on about this) and then we got to the meat *shudder* and potatoes of today's class.   Firstly - Night Mail. A film made in 1936 by Harry Watt and Basil Wright - overseen by John Grierson. Mr. Grierson, I just learned, was a British ex-pat who lived in Canada for a period of time and founded the Documentary society in our great nation. An interesting film, one of the first documentaries ever made (Grierson also coined the term documenatry). The film, commissioned by the General Post Office, depicts the happy little society of men who get the mail there on time. A series of trains make their way through the night to a hub at Crewe, where their mail is sorted and exchanged, then they head out - all in a day's work. There is a fascinating sequence describing the snap locks and nets by which the mail bags are picked up and deposited. Even for 1936 grainy film stock, there were still a few exhilarating moments as the train raced along slinging it's cargo from it's belly and snapping up mail from swinging hooks. I always wondered if those Road Runner cartoons were accurate. There were some interesting elements about the film. All the men sorting the mail - proletarian little worker bees, seemed incredibly happy - there's a lot to be said for British cheer and tenacity - but these good old sports seemed to be having a gay old time doing what I can only imagine could be one of the most tedious jobs ever. It also seems the more "responsibility" you have, the less you have to do, the less hard you have to work and the less happy you are. It seems interesting that an element of the bourgeious imperial infrastructure would chose to depict the working relationships of their employees in such a manner. Then again, they are British, this might be the way it was. All in all, very history channel/TVO. I enjoyed it. Everyone else did not.  The second film was an offering from Bunuel and Dali - a pair of Spanish exiles in France in 1929. Silent, without commentary, the film used a series of imagery to convey a variety of sentiments - Anti-Catholic blasphemy, sex, death and rebirth. One interesting point - the death's head moth from the silence of the lambs makes an appearance. Now that I've done a bit more research into it, it's starting to make more sense.  The film opens with a women's eye being slit open. That garnered the expected reaction from a good portion of the student body - "eeeuuugh". What follows is 17 minutes of interconnected imagery that is as seperate from rational thought as the film makers could achieve. There is some sense about it though - apprarently there is a french phrase "ants in the palms" which translates into an itching to kill - as an image though - the pierced palm with insects crawling out - it's quite sacreligious. At one point the man chases the woman around, while dragging a piano with a horse or some dead game on it and some live priests are also dragged by the neck (dressed like Spanish Padres). The man shoots himself - or at least his doppelganger. Another man pokes at a dead hand in the street while a crowd gathers like the ants on the other man's palm. He's then hit by a car. From what I've read on IMDB, Dali and Bunuel decided to reject any rational progression while writing the script. I suppose that would be an interesting exercise - find a story that makes sense and film the exact opposite. I'm not sure I enjoyed it - perhaps I'm not thinking on a deep enough level - or it could be that my sense of taste simply doesn run down that alley. Needless to say I don't believe I will be adding the DVD version of Un Chien Andalo to my collection. Also according to IMDB - Dali appears as one of the priests being dragged with the piano. I wonder; what sort of Freudian fallout there is from that? I just read a comment on the message boards that reads "Don't think so hard, it'll only hurt your head" - he's probably right.

      There are people here. They are buying things. But my heart just isn't into it  today. I really can't give much of a damn.  So I'm sitting in the tech office and just moping. Alex is speaking pseudo german. I think it's kind of funny. Turns out the chap who's windows XP wouldn't install didn't do so cause the disk was scratched. Chalk one up to I told you so.  I miss Frankenputer. I'm going to play some Diablo on it when I'm at home.  Wirelessly.   Fuck yeah.  That is all for now.

      So hey, had a guy tell one of my co-workers that I needed a punch in the face today. Fucking coward couldn't say it to me. He's lucky he didn't. I might just look up his number tomorrow and give him a call.  I built frankenputer today. If you feel like emailing him his address is thepeopleunderthestairs@rogers.com - he's wireless which is really pleasant.  I think destroying part of the desk he sits on made me sick. *sigh* ah well.  The following new fathers and their newfound Guatamalish progeny are not loved by Jesus: Jerry King.

      They say you never really understand the feeling of violation in regards to certain kinds of crime until it happens to you or someone around/related to you. I must admit I never really gave vadalism a second thought until I started finding random acts of it affecting my life (some wiseass thought it would bit witty to put a mouldy half loaf of bread in my mail box at one point - really brilliant stuff there). On this New Years Day I have to deal with the undesirable knowledge that a little boy in my family - however genetically removed - was abused and beaten to death by his foster family.  I've never known a single person who has been murdered before. I met this little chap precisely once. He was unable to speak at the time, he was so young. I'm never going to see him again.  I really don't have anything else to say about that right now.  I beat Halo and Monkey Island 4. Yay.  Rabbits Rabbits Rabbits.

      I'm going to impart a little bit of wisdom that was once imparted to me at my daddy's knee: The folks at Fido are a bunch of wang gobbling cocknockers. Potentially a breed of the stupidest human beings on the planet, this particular strain of French Canadian (Fidous Frenchus Assholus Cocknockerus Homo Stupidus) is responsible for the throbbing vein now occupying space on my forehead. Worse yet, they've somehow decided I own them money(I don't) and at the same time they've decided that money is overdue (it isn't) and that they should send it to a collections agency (that may be the last mistake they ever make). So I get to explain to a bunch of grasping-with-the-language fucks about how I don't owe them money. They agree I don't, but still want me to pay it. Fuckem.  I swear to god, even this isn't wrapped up in less than 21 days, I'll do something drastic. Smoking fucking crater drastic.

      Aeons and Aeons go by between entries as the world spins on a sideways axis. (an AXIS OF EVIL, no doubt!!!) As we join our heros, they're in the process of relocating the Fortress of Solitude (okay, it's just me, but I had to make it sound good). Finally got to see the Seagram's Loft that I might buy today. It's expensive. Hell damn ass expensive. It's also the single most gorgeous house I've ever considered buying. *le sigh*  Gotta work on the final video for work now. it's a little complicated cause we really don't know who's gonna win. The only thing that's certain is that my team's gonna lose. That bites a bit; it's hard knowing you've done the best job you can and it still doesn't mattter.  Cleaned my room today. Guess seeing the vast empty spaces of The Loft's made me think that my apartment really does have space when I don't have shit occupying it.  I'm sure I've got something imperitive to say, it's just not coming to me. For now, I think we should all just visit the  urlLink greatest comedy site on the web.   We're all gonna die. Duck and fucking cover bitches.

      I'm not sure if it's a lunar cycle thing or maybe I'm just having trouble keeping things in focus. I watched Death to Smoochy tonight and nearly started crying during the ice show at the end. Gah. Damn you Norton and your expressive eyes.  Incidently, DtS could potentially be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a very long time. Danny DeVito is an incredibly talented director with a knack for framing scenes in a way that makes you feel just slightly off balance. There were so many funny people involved in this movie, it's no suprise it ended up being the masterpiece that it is. The bloopers on the DVD were a riot.  The auto show today was quite good. I bought a "Chammy" - a microfibre artificial chamois. It has to be one of the most remarkable sales pitches I've ever seen - the pitch only sells because this thing is probably one of the most remarkable fucking substances on the face of the planet. This chap literally poured out a quarter of a bottle of coke into a scap of carpet, soaked it through and sucked the whole mess up just by pressing down on the whole lot for no more than 10 seconds with this orange wunderkloth. He soaked the counter several times with a sponge, mopping the mess up everytime without leaving a drop and tossing the cloth up in the air. Not a drop spilled on the crowd. Then he squeezed it all out into a dish, then soaked everything up in the dish just by dropping the cloth in. Fucking phenomenal.  I bought an air freshener too. I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

      Well I've discovered yet another fine fine use for the internet. I've always been of the opinion that a) internet should not be capitalized. It's a network, not a national monument or th eighth wonder of the world (tm). It's a testement to our brilliance as a species, yet it's vulnerabilities also render us incapable of elevating it to the status of Golden Calf(tm). The second this is that at least a small portion of your internet surfing per day should enrich your life in a skills capacity. Whether you're reading a politically biased viewpoint on CNN or chatting with someone in a language not originally your own, stretching your mind is a particularly endearing quality of the medium. So this new link to an interesting flash application has spurred my interest in artwork. I'm a particularly bad freehand artist, as some of the drawings I'm going to post will attest. I think my goal will be to produce at least respectable artwork that I can appreciate. As much as I hold your opinion valuable to me, true believers, I don't give a shit if you like my art or not.  On that topic, They say that release is good for the soul. I know uttering death threats is illegal in my country, I wonder if representing the violent death of a neighbor in two parts ( urlLink Part One  and  urlLink Part Punchline ) is also. If so, I'm glad this is hosted the fuck elsewhere. My neighbor seems to find 6AM an excellent time to go slamming around his household like fucking Hannibal crossing the alps. But oh, did ACME get the better of him this time.  I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but my neighbors on the other side went fucking DOMESTIC the other day, it was supersex(tm). Slamming of doors, arguments clearly enuciated and identifyable by the FBI in Sarasota - without microphones. It thought it was armageddon and I loved every minute of it. At this rate, I'll probably start watching Pro(heh) Wrestling again.

      As time presses ever onwards, so indeed does the grind of everyday life. Tonight will be my third night closing in a row. The first was annual Chocolate rush Day. The second being last night and the third, of course, being the ever swank semi-annual inventory. The upside to closing last night was that Scotty in software made me aware of the arrival of the Legend of Zelda pre-order disc. For those of you joining us from home, you may or may not be aware of my utter affection for videogames. Zelda games in particular. The only official Zelda games that I do not own, have in my possession nor have I ever played are the two Zelda games for Nintendo 64 - The Ocarina of Time (OoT) and Majora's Mask.   The great gods at Nintendo have seen fit (through the devination of their sales numbers, ranked third currently in a three man race against Sony and Microsoft) to include this bonus disc. Basically what transpires is as follows - you walk into an Electronics Store(tm) and say to your drone/rep/register biscuit "I'd like to place a 20$ preorder on The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker for the Nintendo GameCube". The Biscuit will print you out a slip for The Legend of Zelda: Gayest Title Evar and promptly hand you a Gamecube disc. For a brief moment you'll shit your pants, as you believe s/he has just handed you the game itself, then you heart will shatter as you believe it's just a movie disc.   This is where we cut to the chase - it's actually a game disc. Not a demo. A full fucking game. And that game is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It's like searching for the holy grail all your life and then to win it in a raffle at the age of 83. Hot damn. I picked it up last night. Didn't really worry about it too much. I seemed able to contain my excitement. I logged  off, went to bed and tried to sleep. As the minutes ticked by, so too did the visions of rupees, hookshots and the little blond bastard in green(and you wonder why I associate with this character to much).  So there I was. Playing Zelda, in the middle of the night. Holy god, it's such a cool game. I mean this thing is totally circa 1999, but I'm right into it. The only better thing than this, Zelda wise, is the demo of the new on the cube at work.  In other news - life is progressing nicely. Going to look at some houses this week.  I've got to do some more work on the website for Voyager and for 8 Wheels. Maybe I might even do a little work on my own site. Who knows. I'm debating on whether or not to buy C&C Generals. It looks sooo tasty. You've got the Chinese, who everyone's going to love to hate, the Americans, who everyone is going to love to be and the dirty fucking terrorists who everyone is going to love to use as cannon fodder. I'm thinking of setting up an account on westwood online dedicated to the spectacular losses of the DFT's.  Finally - got my wing mirror fixed, that was happy. And free. My cornea is doing nicely. My monitor, not my eyes. My eyes are still fucked up, as per usual.  That's pretty much all for now. If there's one upside to this inventory, it's that Brady isn't here. Dude is *still* wearing the same fucking sweater.

      Time ticks ever onwards. The mirror on my vibe exploded last week. The manager at the dealership said it would be covered under warranty. I made sure I had witnesses. I got there today (after borrowing one of their $45,000 Rendezvous' - not a particularly nice vehicle, no matter what Tiger Woods says) and the service manager Felicio (felatio? service manager? the guy really did suck) tried to tell me that it wasn't covered. So I quickly beckoned to Gail "80's Hair" and she reinforced the situation regarding my mirror. I understand that Felatio was just doing his job, but seriously guy, don't fuck with me. I've been on both sides of the customer service equation and I'll assure you, I never fucking lose.  Quiz Night is just a blast. I enjoy it immensly. The topic this evening was rather engaging.

      The debate rages. It is truly a debate of epic proportions. Not since the Trojans did some sacking have we encountered such a fiercely disagreed upon question.  Who really is the stupidest person on the planet? Jason or Jerry?  The video went off rather smartly at work today. After work I came home and promptly fell unconscious. I'm rather energized now at the ripe hour of 11 O'clock, that should last a scant few minutes before I die again.   I'm really starting to enjoy Crystal Light. weird.

      There's a common belief that my employer accounts for the employment of the majority of simian life in North America. We've had visions of calling our credit card companies, getting mysteriously routed through to approvals and hearing the true voices of those behind our credit application processes: "Oooh oooh ahh ahhh ahh ooh ooh ooh". We also believe that our warehouse is inhabited by groups of "Monkey-techs"; roving bands of simians that remove the accessories, cartridges, drivers, and cables from units that they "repair" (simian code for coating a broken unit with feces).  It's only now, after seeing footage of some of my superiors on digital video that I realized this phenomenon pervades even the most human seeming tiers of my employer.  From now on, when meetings are run, all I shall hear is "oooh ooh ooooh ah aaaah aaaaahh oooh!"

      It's been a few days since my last entry.  Life has had some very *up* points since then. There are rare moments where I thank god that he ripped that rib out of Adam. This week was one of them. So damn thankful.  I got a new monitor. It's a Cornea CT1702. 17" LCD with TV tuner, Svideo, composite and DVI. It's got a fucking remote. Hot damn. I can turn my fucking monitor on from bed.  The video for work went swimmingly last week. Hopefully it will do so again this week. I think my next purchase past this monitor will be a DV cam. I need to start using my digicam more though.speaking of which, I'm gonna charge that little fuckers batteries now.  Catch you on the flip side y'all. We're counting printers in the am.

      As I returned home from work this morning, I had the urge to tune into talk radio. I seem to have these spurious little urges anytime anything disasterous happens. Often, I fight the urge and find out later that there's been a plane crash, a fire bomb in a night club or some other such catastrophe. As I tuned it, the saddest news I have encountered in a very long time radiated from the speakers of my car; the space shuttle Columbia was out of contact and presumed lost. Interviews then followed with residents of Palestine, Texas - citizens claiming that they had seen the predictable approach of Columbia on a landing run explode into a shower of green and orange debris. It pains me to realize that this is the second space shuttle I have had the misfortune of witnessing explode. A scant few days ago I found the old photograph of the Challenger I purchased as a little boy at Cape Canaveral. I saw Columbia on that visit - it was a beautiful white whale of a ship, something that has always inspired me when I think of space travel. It is my firm belief that the future of our species lies in exploring the space around us - the loss of these seven lives and the shuttle could jeopardize the program's momentum for many years to come. I only pray the ISS remains on schedule.  To the seven aboard the shuttle - may you go with which God or diety you may or may not believe in. Thank you for taking the risk.

      I did something a little strange tonight. As I was driving home from my parents house, I used the seek function of my radio to tune it a a variety of stations. An interesting experience to say the least - a lot like evesdropping really. I had the sense that I was intruding on the lives of the people to whom these stations belong. Weather, news, sports - all local yet not Local. In my travels I found Missouri, Maine, Iowa, Michigan, New York. I tuned into one station that never identified itself - it seemed to be an evangelical broadcast - Listening further I noticed that it was a religious broadcast refuting modern miracles - the kind with no proof. Refuting them with scripture - citing passages that demonstrated how God's miracles were usually performed - in front of witnesses with verifiable facts usually with a message. A fascinating take on a subject usually clouded by charismatic charlatans and elaborate smoke and mirrors. Not at all what I expected.

      I'm sick again. That's great. It's not the first time I've been called "The world's sickliest human being". I sometimes wonder if I'd be better off in some Glynhaalian Bubble.  As I perused through my collection of media a thought occurred to me. I'm sure it's not the first time the thought has occurred at all - originality is difficult to come by, at times our lives are an exercise in the derivative. I began to evaluate, as I'm sure many have done before me, how much of Japanese culture is informed by the attacks on HIroshima and Nagasaki. With the war in Iraq looming I decided to purchase some literature that I believed would help me reflect on the nature of the armed conflict. The Dark Knight Returns - Frank Miller. Slaughter House Five - Vonnegut. Watchmen - Alan Moore. Three vastly different perspectives on conflict.   Examining my experiences with Japanese culture - my visit there, the video games I own and the movies I have watched, it was interesting to contemplate how their culture was the only one on the planet to date which had been devastated by an atomic attack. The firebombing in Dresden dwarfed the casualties of both the atomic strikes combined - yet somehow it goes unnoticed - perhaps merely toying with fire and shrapnel simply wasn't different enough in comparison to rending the bonds of an atom. I think I'll give this some more thought and post later. Now it's time for dinner.

      Know what really bites?  I finally managed to do it. After all these years, I managed to crash a console game.  Suprisingly, the offending party in this case was not Microsoft. My Xbox has been running smoothly since I traded in my chipped model for something a little less illegal. My Ps2 is humming along happily. My gameboy advance sp is doing just fine and shining brightly.  No, the game/system that did it? The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Wanker... er... Waker. As I was beat the multitentacled (aren't they all?) boss of the second fortress (ah... Zelda) The game just froze. Link off to one side of the screen. A piece of heart in the middle. Some little Miyazaki-esque nubbin off to the other side. Me on the couch fucking cursing the cruel god that forced console games into a place where they're shipped like PC games.  This in between using the steam cleaner to suck the pond out of my basement carpet. I hate you Mary-Anne.  Got two boxes of girl guide cookies today. Made with 100% real girlguides. It takes the lotion from the basket and it puts it on it's skin.

      I felt like a little heartbreak this evening so I exposed myself, once again, to "All Good Things..." - the final episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.  Star Trek is a little like family, it's heartbreak to see them go. I have to admit that "All Good Things..." is probably the most well done final episode of a series that I have ever seen. Compared to, for example, the final episode of Seinfeld, All good things is an utter success.   There's an army chap in the states that just changed his name to Optimus Prime. I'm green.  I got my Gameboy Advance SP - it's essentially a Gameboy Advance with a lit screen, in a 3 square inch fold up device. It's hell damn ass light, comes with a rechargable battery and it makes me feel good just holding it.  When the American's said Shock and Awe, they really meant it, didn't they?  Shortly I'm going to be absolutely drowning in Zelda. That's awesome.

      I can really see how amazon can become an addiction. Same sort of syndrome as ebay really. Everyone wants stuff. In particularly I have a weakness for books. I suppose Jeff Bezos really knew he was onto something when he came up with the idea to sell books online. The worst parts of the bookstore experience - snooty staff and titles out of stock - simply aren't found online. The only thing they really need to replicate now is the musty smell of old paper. If my computer can output that, I'll never need to step into a bookstore again.  Today at work things sucked the bunghole just slightly. The morning was interesting, we demoed some open box wireless stuff. Got the second router up, physically. We just have to figure out how the hell to get it to transmit to the the other router now. This morning brought us two seperate cycle counts - Dos, which is always a joy, and individual skus - about 13 of them, scattered around the department. One type of CD-R, three or four peripherals, five printers of various sorts, a multifunction and a some monitors. To put this in perspective, A CD-R count can take up to half an hour. So this count was rediculous. I was really fucking pissed off to find it there. Hence I did the only thing one can do in a situation like that. Found out how many we had in the computer and compared it to what I could find. Ram was out, as always, as was one type of hard drive. I didn't bother counting the CD-R's, it's fucking moronic that we should have to count, I'm certainly not going to count something as trivial as those lovely things. Fuck you head office, we've got an Inventory Control Chick (ICC), get her to do it.  There wasn't a large amount of traffic in today. After lunch Rocky had me manage the floor. I pointed a buying group out to Jeff, he sold a nice package. *sigh*  Managing the floor was great. I got to read a nasty letter that was sent to Steve. Poor bastard, some stupid bitch of a customer brought her system in with software issues. We asked her if she wanted her system restored. Whenever a tech asks this they always, *always* mention "This will elminate all data on your hard drive, have you backed up your system?" To which the customers don't listen and just stress they wanted it fixed. So her system was restored.  She then proceeded to demand that her data be recovered, as she apparently did not know she was going to loose all of her information. So we forked out $300 for data recovery software and recovered it. Apparently she received her computer today and it's nonfunctional. I think it's just that this woman is the spawn of the fucking devil and God is punishing her(tm). Anywho, she sent a nasty fax over.  I'd like to meet her just so I can get a picture and show it off to my friends.  Monday at work was a bit frightening first thing in the am. Because it was St. Paddy's and there was a lovely belt of sunshine cascading on us from the sweet blue above, Kevin - in his infinite wisdom - decided to hold the morning meeting outside. Poor fellah didn't know what he was getting himself into.  As we head outside, Steve King produced a cigarette and commenced the process of setting it ablaze. Jerry King (no relation, although they do share some traits from time to time) began to complain, immediately, bitterly and loudly (as only a balding, multiplespawned, broken, divorced former manager of battery's plus/marriage noncounsellor can) about the smoke. The rest of us stare in awe at the sheer level of childishness this man wallows in. Kinger (Stevie) tossed a snarky comment aside and moved to the other side of the meeting. Downwind, thankfully.  Following that sexy little spat, halfway through the meeting a car rockets into the parking lot, parking in the second row of spots. A second car blasts in behind, stopping approximately an eigth of an inch away from the first car. A man leapt from the second car, clutching some sort of neon piece of hardware. He proceeds to stick his entire upper torso through the window of the first car, where the two tweenaged guys inside are now decorating their pants. Screaming ensues from rage man, whereupon he balls his right fist and punches the driver in the face. That's when we notice what he's carrying.  It's an knife - of the X-acto variety. That's when we panic. There could be a 187 about to go down in our parking lot. Tyson begins to approach the guy, at which point I stress to him that a man with a knife generally can't be reasoned with.   At this point I must depart from my retelling of this tale to lace it gently with some commentary. I won't shy from a rumble. I'm a pretty stupid motherfucker when it comes to getting in fights, I haven't been in many, but I haven't lost one in over ten years. However, there's no dishonour in running from a fight you can't win. You don't take a knife to a gunfight and you don't take your fists to a road rage soiree that's currently being attended by knifeweilding high society.  Tyson saw the point but proceeded to say that he was going to get a license number. I pointed out that the license number could be extracted just as effectively from behind the concrete posts whereas the potential from being run over drops 114% while you're behind said posts versus being in front of them. We all retreated to the calm serenity of the concrete apron and got that number.  Talk about whacked.  Later this week I stumbled upon some banana bread, jelly beans, good company and bad pizza.  Three of the things in the previous sentence where hell damn ass awesome. The other one makes me think I might be lactose intolerant.

      It's funny, the only browser on which blogger looks right is IE 6.0. I remember IE 2.0 - the bastard son of bill - that thing couldn't get a fucking page right if you paid in in gold pressed latinum. Netscape was sort of "the big thing" for the first three iterations of the software. Microsoft's IE was a laughable endevour - essentially the behemoth arriving late to the party - and a dollar short no less. Inferior in the way of features, stability and speed, IE simply couldn't compete. I remember the tide turning slowly with IE 3... and then 4. Active X started to play a large role in people switching, that and microsoft packaging their browser with every new operating system. I suppose I'm as guilty as anyone of the lazy nature which gave rise to IE spawning itself on my system - I did download 2, wasn't impressed, deleted it(remember when we used to delete things?). Downloaded 3, but out of a h@x0r-spirit inspired rebellion, I unistalled that. Finally IE 4 found a home on my system. Being able to surf with impugnity and not encounter broken links to active X scriptlets seemed to be netnirvana.  I don't regurlarly agree with the US government, but I must admit MS did have an unfair advantage. Have the stifled or strangled the market? I hope not.   That's my small bit on computer history for today.  I'm thinking about starting a small content based portal site. A few of the lads from work said they'd contribute - mostly reviews and opinions and such. I'd imagine we could all have our little rants. We'll see how it works out.

      I never said I should write by-lines. I have very little pity for the stupid. Hence this story would have been title  urlLink A Shitty Way to Go.   Yeah, I'm a jackass.  It was a beautiful sunny day today. No one would ever imagine we were days from what could be The Next War(tm). I bought new sheets to commemorate the event. I blame the yellow sun, from which I derive my powers.  Apparently there was a Republican trying to link Peer to Peer file sharing and terrorism the other day. I'm sure the buttplug the recording industry has rammed up his ass is tipped with a radio controlled joy buzzer, but fuck's sake people, Napster and Osama?  urlLink Get the fuck real.   I went on a small Amazon spending spree last night. Fuck you Bezos, and the helicopter you rode in on. Comic book trade paperbacks should not be available for purchase at at 1 Am of any given morning. On the upside I'm now the proud owner of several high end Frank Miller and Alan Moore works. At least it's high brow comic shit.  One of my fellow associates had someone go off on him on wednesday night regarding a laptop battery. I know I promised Herr Bailey (Mein Fuhrer) that I'd never pop off at a customer again, but good leaping Christ, if someone came even close to verbalizing the canticle this bastich mananged to give sound to in my presence, their face would find umbrage from my fist. We're talking fucked, proper fucked. I think I need to seek treatment for anger management. Then again, maybe I just really need to get in another fistfight. Being half irish, I think my blood yearns for it. There's something strangely peaceful about being in the middle of a punchup.  Speaking of being Irish, stout tempers and so on, if you haven't already  urlLink voted to make St. Paddy's a national holiday , the only way you can redeem yourself is to do so. Afterwards you can print out a swell Guinness Party of Canada card. I "laminated" mine; I cut out a bit of cardboard from an audio tape case to go between the folded slices, then used packing tape to seal the card in - instant lamination with none of the cost and triple the effort.  A fucking geek am I. Slinte!

      A few things:  One on the bulletin of you heard it here first: I've got to get braces again. Huzzah. My teeth did their normal drifting and general fucking with my mouth over the past eight years, and so I am left with the lovely stigma of shiny metal in my mouth again. The upside, it's free. The downside? I'M A FUCKING BRACEFACE. Great. I've got to suffer through four months of these if I want my bottom teeth straight - Eight months if I ever want to eat a sandwich or bite my tongue again.  A brief aside to the great divine entity in charge of my destiny/teeth. FUCK YOU ASSHOLE.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled witty banter.  I played Freelancer for the better part of the night last night. I completely forgot about everything, dinner, buffy, my friends - simply because this game began to suck the soul from my body. It's great. The game begins with the premise of 9/11 in space - the station Freeport 7 (WTC) is destroyed (destroyed) by The Order (al queda) led by Orillion (Osama). Liberty (the U to the S to the of to the A) begins to crack down on terrorism (terrorism) and has begun to detain smugglers, theives and freelance booty hunters (you, you and most definately you).  So I played it into the wee hours, til the wee hours became the not so wee hours. Fucking righteous it is.   The game was designed by Chris Roberts - the chap who bailed from Origin to form digitalAnvil under the velvet gloved iron fist of Microsoft Game Studios. On the downside he brought us the 90 minute pile of tripe that was Wingcommander, the movie (which did, however, pioneer some of the camera techniques that formulate the basis of the bullet time effect found in The Matrix.... and every other piece of action cinema today). Chris is a fairly good lad - I mean, the man brought us more Mark Hamill, teamed with John Rhys-Davies (Yoooooou were named after the doooooooog??) and Malcolm "I killed Kirk" Macdowel. Wingcommander 3 has the dubious distinction of being one of the first games brought to DVD. I believe there are 5 now, four of which are various iterations of Wingcommander 3.  I've been assure that I'm not a monstrous freak now that I have braces.  LIES.

      It seems that the laws of thermodynamics are really just an allegory for life. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. I'm having an unlucky day. Not a bad day, per se, but an unlucky day.   I spent about an hour last night trying to get a videogame to work - it took approximately three minutes to find out what was wrong and about 57 minutes to download all the necessary drivers. Rogers blows goats for drug money.  I woke up this morning to the cool sounds of "Lean on Me" as broadcast by my Microsoft Plus! Alarm Clock. I got up and hit the snooze button, which apparently turned the alarm off altogeter and I overslept slightly. Following that I got up, feeling quite unrefreshed and groggy and stumbled to the shower. Whilst in the shower, my towel fell in and promptly soaked itself, expressing to me that wet was truly the nature of bliss for all lifeforms towel-like and also informing me in one fell swoop that it cared not for my opinion on the matter.  I made a disc with the crack for Generals for General Paton. I left that at home.  Following that there was an accident on the way to work, through which I got jammed into a block of traffic. Late for work.  Robbie's DVD player that I sold him yesterday is defective.  On the upside Jeff got his 5.1 digital audio for his Xbox, I purchased a silly little Nintendo Card game, Lui had a baby boy named Brayden (well his wife did), Simpson's still a fucking moron and we're about to go get Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers(tm)

      Stop the presses! We've got a hot one here....  I... Actually... Had.... A.... Great....Day. An enjoyable day. A day to measure days by. I'll be sitting here on the 14th of June thinking "God damn, if only this were the 9th of March". I'm going to have another day like this and think back and say "You know, I haven't had a day like this since... March 9th!"  Slept well. Got to work, no cycle count. Jeff came back today. We go breakfast. He bought an Xbox. I bought Freelancer. I had dinner with my parents - Chinese - At the China House (next year they're moving to Kitchener and renaming it China Haus) - had the Hibatchi dish (the PuPu Platter - It won the Chinkie(tm) award for the stupidest name of a Chinese dish ever) - My fortune was hilarious ("You love Chinese Food") and we had a good solid talk about what I'm going to do for living accomodations for the next little while.  God damn, it was a good day.

      Mozarell should never be sliced and eaten on crackers. NEVER. You want to talk weapons of mass destruction, I'll talk about offensive cheeses and their effect on my delicate palate. Nothing scares me more than the thought of a certain Iraqi dictator with a bunker of gorgonzola on his side.  Speaking of which, a fucking riot today when Colin (why do they keep calling him Co-lin like colon?) Powell held his press conference at the precise moment when the Iraqi ambassador alDouri was spouting his rhetoric to the UN (in)Security Council. Brilliant timing.  Speaking of which, Al'Douri was the same guy who, in the last meeting of the "All Arab Circle Jerk and Smack Talk League", addressed the Kuwaiti delegate thusly: "Shut up you Monkey! A curse upon your moustache you traitor!!"  If that man doesn't know a good dis when he utters it, I don't know who does.

      I had a most unusual dream last night. I believe it was the product of CNN, dairy products and an overactive imagination.   It appeared that some sort of disaster had occured. There were people screaming and running. I found myself in a family's house - an asian family - carrying some kind of firearm. The gun was round and flat like a puck, it filled the palm of my hand. It also had some sort strange air about it - it reminded me of a glade plug in. I suppose that might have something to do with a resevoir of green liquid in the base of it. Either that or the spring fresh scent.  I found myself in this house, where the little girl, the only child in the family, was crying and afraid. I picked her up and went to find her parents - They were terrified when I woke them up - no doubt because I was carrying this weapon. The calmed down when they realized I wasn't going to hurt them. The mother became extreme distraught and wanted to me to make sure there was nothing in the bathroom. It seems I was aware that there could be something dangerous in the bathroom as I wouldn't approach it head on. I grabbed a mirror from the vanity  - at which point I realized the house I was in was the one I lived in as a child.  I peered around the corner and examined the room throught the mirror. There was nothing.  We fled the house under a sky streaked with red and purple... the sky aflame with debris and death... I found myself running into a canyon, surrounded by people. They were all running deeper and further into the canyon, trying to escape something. A gas began to descend from the sky, the people began to run. I reached into my pack for a gas mask... Pulled it out. No one else had one. You need to get a gas mask on in under nine seconds in order for it to be effective - the process is shut your eyes, don't breathe, turn your back against the wind, pull the mask over your face and exhale sharply to get rid of any pollutants that you may have inhaled. A gas mask is only of limited protection, the only thing that will do in a chemical or biological attack is head to toe coverage in a contamination suit.  I had trouble getting the mask on. I was puffing out my breath when I woke... people dying around me.  I called it a dream. I suppose it was really a nightmare.

The result of which saw me home from work early.   To the chap that spit at: FUCK YOU, you chickenshit asshole. Gave you the opportunity to take a swing, you just couldn't find the balls to do it. You can leave this situation knowing that you simply couldn't handle a situation with a kid half your age and size. Wimp.  That's all for now.

       I vonder vhere Gunter Wendt?   It's be a dilly of a pickle of a week. No entry for a few days and things go an get themselves all messed right up. To backtrack...   I spent the evening drinking some sort of fruitopia cocktail from a minipitcher I stole from the Peel Pub (mwaha!) and watching Apollo 13. I almost became teary in a few bits - I guess I'm a sucker for a good space disaster story that just happens to be true. That leaves me vulnerable to precisely one movie. Hey, with Superman it seemed like Kryptonite was everywhere, every greased up jackmonkey that wanted a piece of metropolis had a chunk of snotrock that landed in his backyard. With me I just have to steer clear of blockbuster.  So the war in Iraq is over. Wh00t. I've been fortunate enough to be kinda blaise about the whole thing. Huzzah for the kurds, no more gassing. 20 Billion dollars is a decent price for one deposed dictator.  Work was pretty bad for the last little while. School is almost all said and done for this term, so the real concentration turned to work. It was stagnant, agonizing, boring material.Suddenly, from nowhere I am summoned to the managers office. Suddenly it's all new and iteresting and fun again. I have a killer day and things are right with the world. WH00T!  I'm on a bit of a high right now, so we'll leave it at that. Imagine that - in such a good mood, I'm hardly quotable.

      Deep Space Nine is thoroughly ingestible. I seem to gobble the bits of Trek like tender sugarwhisps, letting them melt on my brain and seep in. Next Gen had an altogether different feel - thank you Jeff for convincing me to buy something I simply wouldn't have otherwise.  Ever start to feel a little out of place and realize that it really is something or someone you miss? That sucks.  On the upside I'm spending more time with the rents. That's pretty highend. Dad and I are looking at getting bikes after we take our test. I'm thinking a Suzuki 650. I was thinking of a 250 - but apparently it's just not enough to get me around.  I've had some bizarre dreams of late. I don't think I've woken up in the last week and understood where I was or what was going on for a good minute or so. It's rather discomforting. A rebellious brain simply isn't kosher. I glance at my desk and see bottles for apple juice, cans for iced tea, a plate for pasta, some luncheon meat wrappers and some husks of some peanut butter cups. All consumed before bed. Perhaps this is not the best sort of snack. Water and fruit before bed from now on. Also, clean this mess the fuck up. Christ. Cesspit does not begin to describe the mess that is my desk.  Work has been... well... interesting for the past few days. My boss is about to become a dad - I think he's like 26 or 27. They induced his wi... er... girl fri... er... I think they've married.... I'm not sure yet though. But they induced her today. As much as Steve can be a bit of a jerk from time to time, he's a good guy, so I hope things turn out well for him. I took Thursday off and spent it with my dad. It was productive and fun. Plus we looked at motorbikes and god damn, they're cool.  The weather is finally lightening up (I love when people refer to the natural electrical phenomenon as "lightening") - it was actually *warm* today. Not californian warm, Canadians in shorts warm. So about five degrees.  We're a rather fucked up people.

      So work hasn't been too bad for the past few days. Good money, little flack from the morons.  However I was just informed that if I'm interested in keeping myself upwardly mobile in the company, there is a meeting I should be attending tomorrow at 8 am.  If you're unaware, tonight is the night that the clocks "spring forward" (note to self. Shoot the fucker who came up with that as a witticism).  That means that I would essentially be attending work at 7 am. When we don't, according to scale, open until 10. Being there three hours early is potentially the stupidest thing I can possibly imagine, especially when I've probably got more skill then the chap dishing out the tips.  Hence I will be at work tomorrow at 10. IF there is any sort of flack distributed, I believe I'll call HR and see what the hell they have to say about it. If I've got to be there three hours early, you're going to fucking pay me for it.   On another note, Zelda is good. So is Star Trek Deep Space 9. DS9 is a little like paradoxical candy. It's tasty, it's stimulating and you really can't get enough. If candy were like that, the world would be a better place.

      It's been a rather sad April Fools.  The golden age of work is finally over. The guy who I can honestly say was the nicest to me at work left the company. Thankfully it was his desire to do so; he did give me some insight as to how things work higher up the ladder. Getting to the point where I'm fairly sure it's not what I want to pursue - even in the short term. That's rather sad.  There's a swamp in my basement. A lake. A reflecting pool if you will.  Thank fuck I'm out of here shortly. The couch is up on blocks. Life vests are issued to those heading into it's confines. All hands, abandon ship!  Season 2 of DS9 came out today. It's a great series and I'm looking forward to actually getting to know it for the first time.  Zelda continues to be one of the most fun video games I've ever played. I wish every video game experience were like this. Nintendo - you may not have the fastest system or the largest selection of games - but as long as you've got Mario, Samus, Fox McCloud and Link, I'll be buying whatever system you put on the shelf.  Exception being the Nintendo 64. I was on hiatus from videogames at that point, I do apologize. Then again, y'all made the Nintendo64, you should be apologizing to me.

I shall be the counter counter counter culture. Ahem. I'm trying out some new browsers - Mozilla Firebird and Opera. Netscapes' been a bit of a write off for a while and Firebird is apparently rising from it's ashes. It appears to be pretty darned quick, which I'm liking so far. Opera's been neat to work with, I think I might have written about it earlier, it's got an integrated email client which I like.  I've started selling some things on eBay - apparently the chap who won my first auction will be paying me tomorrow. I was a little worried cause he's a dirty dirty frenchman and doesn't seem in the slightest corrupt. He seems in the extreme corrupt. Damnable French. We bail their well violated asses out in two world wars and look what they do.  *sigh*  Well this has been mighty cathartic. I did start another blog devoted entirely to my stargazing.

      It's a strange metamorphosis I've undergone over the past few weeks. It seems like I'm enjoying life a lot more. I haven't been able to sustain enough invective to fill even the most meagre of rants.  Could it be I'm actually happy on a grand and global scale? :) Why yes, but no more so than usual. I guess I just have less to complain about.  That strikes me as a good thing. I'm going to start to record my night time observations of a different sort in a seperate blog. If you're a fan of this blog I'll be sure to post the link so you can read some reflections of a slightly more intellectual me.

       Nothing quite like a spate of nonposting days to make this all seem fresh   If you've been following my blogs at all, or if you're a new reader encountering them for the first time, you may or may not be aware of an entry dated not to long ago where I mentioned how everything was perfect at work and how I'd be posting a lot less now that I'm happy there.  I also mentioned that the state of affairs was not likely to stay that way for very long. I was right. Thus begins...   THE SUCKENING   Thursday - I noticed that Sood, the Indi-cow of death is not in our department. I traverse to the fax room. She's there among the managers. I put two and two together and once again someone less qualified has been promoted due to their status as minorityfucktard. I become furious, natch. Later there is a managers meeting called. I attend. I'm sullen, but the only one smart enough with enough desire to answer the questions (Andrew's brighter than I am, but he has a thing about, well, speaking in front of people. Weird for a guy in his position). Brian asks me to stay after the meeting. He gives me a variety of reasons, but essentially he's telling me I'm...   being sent to the minors   Well isn't that dandy. See there's a smaller store just down the road. Half the traffic, half the money, nearly the same amounts of staff. Where I was at the time, well, I hated Sood, but that's not surpising considering her vocation of being St. Assgobler, Patron saint of being incredibly fucking stupid. But everyone else I got along with; Nick could be a prick and Rachel has a lisp that makes me want to make fun of her *all* *day* *long* (I didn't), but again, nothing as terminal as Sood, and even that wasn't that bad.  So I'm informed that my transfer is immediate, it's for my benefit and life in general will be better there. It's a little closer to home, Less highway more city (worse milage, fuckers) and higher traffic volumes when you break it right down. Taking into consideration traffic lights and controls, It takes me longer to get there than my old store.  Hence we return to   The SUCKENING   This store sucks. The manager's all right, but almost everything else about it blows. There's GG, the Grumpy Gus in my department who thinks' he's king shit since he's worked for the company since the dawn of time. Guess what fucknut - IT JUST MEANS YOU'RE A LIFER WHO HASN'T BEEN PROMOTED. He decided that it was high time we talk about procedure - with the hopes of indoctrinating me into his little click. I finally picked up a videocamera and re-arranged the uglier parts of his mug.  Well, that was the way it went in my head. I just nodded and glowered and shared a secret smile with the only one I had on my side today. Mike's a bit of a godsend. The Corporate Goon Squad(tm) as he has termed them irritate him just as much as me. Thankfully I've got him as a safety valve, that should reduce any Columbine-like incidents (it's a fucking small lunch room, wouldn't be much of a show).  The other girl (she shall remain nameless to protect my liability) I went to highschool with. Apparently I'm one of the few in town who hasn't known her in the biblical sense, and it really appears that GG wants to - that makes me chuckle - the futility of his desires illustrates the barren nature of the man's soul.    The store is small, and while prettier and better lit, is depressing. The corporate goon squad made me roll down my sleeves, though the AC is bust and button up my top button even though it looks rediculous. Nazis that focus on shirts - thus giving rise to the term, shirtNazis(tm). I used to work with one of the CGS(tm) at my old store - he's been working out since and now has a pair of tits that wouldn't be amiss in a swimsuit calendar - He, and his fucking aquiline nose (you know when *I* dis a nose it's got to be fucking GARGANTUAN - to ref some pop culture now, Hulk-like in nature) gave me the old rah rah you're a leader speech today.  I don't really give a toss.  After five years it's become apparent how very temporary this job is.   THE SUCKENING  shall return

      Sweet Caroline, it's been a few fucking days, hasn't it?  Well Today (yesterday) will live in infamy (well not really.  Yeah, on Friday the 13th, I finally got my motorbike! Woooha! Suzuki Savage LS650. It's sextacular. It's so goddamn pretty it ought to be a she. Hm. Costs a lot of money, high maintenance, requires specific safety gear, loud to the point of dangerous.... it IS a she!!  So I'm going sailing tomorrow, here's to that not being a disaster.  Work has been utterly mediocre. It's been good, but like a nice does of crack, the highs have been offset by some stupid lows. There's an assclown that keeps emailing work because he needs an exchange. Well, wants one. I'm not going to really deal with him anymore cause, well, I just don't feel like. it.  Other folks have been utter stupid. Assclownery seems to be a new passtime or perhaps even a career choice for some out there. I think that could be it, you hit mid life crisis you either get a motorbike, a tattoo, bungee jump or become an assclown.  Guess I'm ahead of the game.  The stargazing's been kind of neat, but the weather doesn't really cooperate that much, we've had such a cold Spring (season, not stream or bouncy metal object) that going outside in the early evening hours to the mid evening hours suck donkey balls for drug money.  I fixed my Timex ironman today. Found it in a drawer, had the urge to fix it. Took it to work, cracked it open, popped in a new battery, flipped the reset and boom, new watch. I love technology.  That's pretty much all for this transmission. Don't take any wooden buckazoids.

      I had a moral conundrum this evening. While attending a screening of  Terminator 3: We'll stop making 'em when the cash stops flowing  I had the opportunity to stay my temper. Perhaps an explanation is in order; I love movies, I adore the cinema, I detest distractions that are completely out of sync with the film. In the packed house I was seated towards the front of the auditorium. As the film began, from one aisle and one row back, noises began to erupt. The laughter of a small child, altogether unusual, unexpected, and unwelcome in an action movie flowed forth from the seat behind me. "Great," thought I, "betcha this goes on for the whole movie!" As if prophesied by me the disturbance did continue. Through the din and the cussing, the violent gunfire and the calamatous explosions, and sadly even through the ghostly calm the giggling and crying continued. The nature of my ire was exhibited only through the gentle twitch of my right cheek; it's the cheek that indicates "you're making me angry - you won't like me when I'm angry". I quelled my rage and focussed instead on the pleasant carnage that ran rampant on the screen - a herculean feat, to be certain.  As the film ended and the lights rose, I stood and turned to examine the source of my discontent. As per my expectations I saw a father with his young son and daughter. The young girl was clearly the culprit! I turned to berate her father and... my cry of retribution died in my throat.  The young girl was mentally handicapped.  The split second decision that I made lasted just slightly longer than eternity. I closed my mouth, turned and exited the theatre. I'm not sure if I did the right thing.  Terminator 3 is a movie for adults. It is rated AA, which in Canada is a great way to say "It's an R film that we'd like to make more money from - BRING THE WHOLE FAMILY!". There was nudity, coarse language and violence in so grand a scale that even I was impressed. Is this appropriate entertainment for children, let alone a child whose mental faculties may be diminished? It seemed to me that the young girl was there mostly because dad wanted to be there and was too selfish to wait a few weeks until their presence would be less of a disturbance. I felt guilty for thinking this - after all, is it my place to say when anyone can enjoy anything?   There indeed is where my dilemma falls. I want my money back, not from the theatre, but from an inconsiderate dad.

      Barry White died.  It's one of those phrases that needs to be read on it's own, with nothing to surround it. Barry White was one of those fellows I never knew; unlike not knowing most other people, the not knowing of Barry White made my life worse, not better. To say that his music was really enjoyable was to perform a service to the term understatement. The words silky, lush, resounding, and sensual gained a layer of depth the first time Mr. White opened his mouth in a recording studio. Likewise he taught us that a throbbing, massaging bass can be loved without doffing masculinity. Barry, for many of us, coined the term aural sex.  As many of my favorite members of celebrity society begin to pass on, I feel small parts of myself die also. It wounds me that I was born thirty years too late to enjoy the work of these people in their prime. Real rather than retro; premiers instead of passe. Kate Hepburn just moved on - ending an era on her own. Now Barry.  You'll be missed, Mr. White, and not just by me.

       The suckening doth continue...   A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away... The evil empire doth continue the suckage. That's about all I gots to say about that.  I had a dream last night about an evil corporation trying to poison specific genetic groups all around the planet - almost some sort of final solutionesque plan to kill everyone except a chosen few. My friends were involved in this plan - apparently involving a binary poison called 1666 (named thusly for the Great Fire of London - the picture accompanying it depicted a 17th century disaster). The stages are called 1667 and 1668. I managed to destroy one of these stations for mixing the binary liquid before I woke - however I spilled some on myself - who knows, maybe I was destined for a horrid dream death.

      My father dissed David Bowie.   To his face.  Six weeks before the Bowmeister became a star.  My dad and mom went to see the Dave Bowie Set - a three piece group starring Dave on the piano - six weeks before  Ground Control to Major Tom  hit the top ten. Quoth my father "It was crap." That in and of itself is not terribly surpising - after all, Davie hadn't quite hit his stride at that point. My mother echoed "He looked like a big girls blose, platform boots like I had on, shock of red hair, white face.... eeugh."  So the day after this crap concert my dad is playing football - soccer - on the pitch at Ansells. On the side lines is none other than David Bowie and his managers - my dad's team was playing against a team of local doctors and Davie, apparently, was related to one of them. After the match was over my dad and his mate walked up to Mr. Bowie and said "Dave, caught the show last night, you were crap." "Yeah, and ye can't play the piana either".  From what my dad tells me, Dave took it in stride with a grin on his face. His manager said that he was going to be the next big thing in rock and roll.   Six weeks later, he was.

      My frankenCD turned out well I think. I'm about to listen to it on the way to work. On that note (HA) I think one of the things grossly missing from my life right now is an Mp3 player. I used to own one, which I sold to Johnny Wise a few years back, due to lack of use. "Why do I want a new Mp3 player?" (accurate usage of qvotatcions!) you ask? I want a new Mp3 player because it's an iPod. Yeah, an iPod. I've always had a soft spot for Mac technology (that's a bold faced lie - I used to loathe macs with a passion. Shortly after, I hit puberty and grew the hell up) - Hell, I'd trade my mom for a fully loaded G5 (seriously, is she *really* that necessary?) so this iPod thing has really tickled my fancy. I'm going to cease all extraneous purchases until I have the funds to buy one. I'm starting today by putting $20 in a jar, hopefully my dad won't decide it's another levy that he imposed and forgot about (he's worse than the Mayor Quimby during a visiting film production).  So yeah, the 15 GB iPod is $599 retail, it's got a rechargable battery, belt clip, headphones, dock, the whole shebang. The 10 GB one would suffice at $469, but it doesn't come with all the goodies. God damn, if I'm going to buy over $400 worth of gadget, I wan't the full fucking monty. Needless to say the 30 GB model is waaaaay overkill, after all, 15 GB gives you 3750 songs of average length (you there, the one giggling, grow up). 15 GB worth of Mp3s means I really have to jump on the piracy bandwagon. In FACT, you might say that litigious behaviour of the Recording Industry Artists of America is *precisely* why I have returned to downloading illegal mp3's as well as sharing my own collection online. It would be nice if there were a more impactful way to stick it to this particular man. As it stands I doubt I'll buy many CD's ever again. There are the obvious ones, The Dave (tm), anything they manage to slap The Beatles or Elvis on (contrary to popular belief (aka Quentin Tarantino) you CAN be both an Elvis man and a Beatles man. Living proof here. Other than the big few though, I won't be buying much. Certainly not their bubblegum flavour of the week.  The second facet to this whole iPod thing is that I don't own a stereo. Well I do, technically, but none of the ones I have now are for listening to music. I think I'm going to get a very subtle set of speakers and hook the iPod up to them in my room. It's got an alarm clock function - that means I could wake up to Iron Maiden, as opposed to the Christian Bible Hour (you think I'm joking? The LAWD woke me up this morning). Yeah, that'd be hot.  Run to the Hills indeed.

      Much like a lime cordial, I've had a chance to sit for a moment and I now believe I'm closer to a state that could be described as ready for consumption.  I heard a man rant about the misuse of quoation marks earlier today. I realized I'm altogether far to guilty of this crime - overworking the un-unionized quotation mark. Like some sort of illegal immigrant standing on a street corner, I pluck the poor mark from its resting place, slap it around a phrase or trendy witticism that I'd like to emphasize, and expect it to produce some sort of grammatical miracle. Not much of an issue coming from the Lord of the Splice but it does stand to reason that I should give the quotation mark a bit of a chill period. For the time being I'm going to avoid using them or switch to either   italics (classy!) ,  bolding (trashy... booo)  , or just plain *asterisks* (*lame*).  Much like Dr. Frankenstein I'm assembling a CD out of lost tracks of long forgetten CD's in my collection. Unlike Dr. Frankenstein, though, I am spitting directly in the eye of the Recording Industry Artists of America by downloading every single track from a variety of sources of pirated material. While this, in an of itself, is not a copyright violation (I own all of the tracks I am downloading), I am going to take the time and effort to share this collection online with as many other music lovers as possible. This is, of course, not to fuck the artist out of their well earned royalties (meagre though they might be) but instead to take a moral stand on an issue that most of us (rightly) don't give a shit over, and won't give a shit about until it effects us directly (tranlslation: till we get a god damn subpoena (love the spelling of that word, incidently) in the mail). It has occured to me that it is suprising that more acts of urban terrorism do not take place. God damn, I'm getting to the point where I'm am seriously miffed about being shit on. Were I of a less stable temperment (HA) I think I'd be finding me a truck full of fertilizer or a pie full of C4 or somesuch and just outright eliminating the place where the RIAA does business. A warning shot across the bow of the greedy, if you will - Robin Hood, with heavy ordinance. Or is that Ordnance? Or is heavy ordnance just serving someone with an expensive parking ticket?  I just regrettably wrote some rather inexplicably bad poetry. Thankfully I had the good sense to delete it.  Poetry. It's worse than Aids.(tm)

      I've taken to frightening Amber with Meatloaf. Not the dinner that everyone fears, but the Bat out of Hell variety. She had this bizarre paranoid fear of Native Americans (not the modern kind, the ones with the headresses and the scalping) which I exploited via the Tomahawk Chop and tribal rhythms pounded out on any flat surface while she was around. Apparently that one has passed and now we're on to Meatlof.  This means one thing and one thing only: I have begun to give virtuoso performances of such classics as Paradise by the Dashboard Light and I would do anything for love.  Truly I am the God of Sex and drums and rock and roll.  Oh Yes.

      The latest gap in my posting is a span of time hardly worth the attentions of one, Dr. Alan Grant or any other palentologist - fictional or otherwise.  This really will mostly be a jumble of my most irrational emotions framed in some rather dioramic scenes.  I've had a lovely time riding my bikes , both motor and pedal over the past few days. I guess getting in shape can be fun, as well as popping small wheelies (honestly, I didn't know cruisers could pop wheelies, outside of videogames. it was cool). There is an interconnecting set of trails interspersed all through the tri-city area. It's kind of Prince of Tides-ish, that section where his brother goes nuts/urban commando and starts blowing shit up. I'll now wallow in the shame of having read a Pat Conroy novel. At least I haven't watched the film.  Work has been a series of love hate relationships - I saw Mary Stevens today - the lady that was going to offer me a job but never emailed me back. I suffered a brief moment where I wanted to take her walker from her and beat her senseless. It passed. Barely.  I ran the floor today for a little while. By little while I mean "ENTIRE FUCKING DAY". It was painful. I've been yelled at in my time, but this takes the cake. I was even yelled at by a deaf lady who wrote her yelling out on paper. Yeah, terminal papercut to the throat indeed.  I'm having a tough time with Glennis. It's seriously a Love/Hate relationship. I love to hate him, but occassionally he's a human being. He really knows how to demean people, were I made of weaker stuff, I'd probably end up a blubbering mass of tears at his emotional onslaughts. Instead I end up mostly incensed at his utter lack of and his occassional abuse of tact.  I loathe the fact that I'm not nearly the person my parents are. Perhaps it's something that comes with age or experience or with breathing British air. I really don't measure up when you think about it - both my mom and my dad grew up in environments that were hostile to say the least. My mother grew up in an environment that was slightly less friendly than an Iraqi minefield; the stories you see told of the Irish, in books and in films, these stories are not exagerations or fancies of creative minds. My mother grew up in a hell on earth that explains, to a degree her behaviour towards me over my entire life. It saddens me that I'm not more like them.

      It's my goal to stretch out the times between posts so that they are measured by professionals in terms that end in "lithic" and "zoic".  So life has progressed slowly but surely. The emmigrators moved on to Alberta (you KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!! :) making my life a whole lot less busy and somewhat less interesting. Yes, that means I miss you. Shut the hell up.  My birthday came and went. I'm older. That's not a huge problem for me, I'm still mentally five years old. I've realized that I loathe people speaking in general terms about amorphous prinicipals while I'm trying to concentrate. In short, I need people to shut the fuck up when I'm trying to post. That means you mom. I'm a good child, I swear to god.  Finally got my car stereo installed in my car. John, the installer married Andrea - a girl I used to take the bus with in high school. She was and still is incredibly hot. I envy John, but I'll live.  Glennis (pronounced Glen-Iss, but spelled like Penis) is being a bit of a cockmonger at work. The past few days have been utterly priceless. Brownie is keeping track of how often he mentions his potential sterility to customers. We've also started a completely seperate but partially related tally of how often he tells customers he is going to get digital camera X, almost for free, cause I was fourth in Ontario last year quote endquote.  So we essentially have an egotist with a malfunctioning dick that somehow believes his life is relevant to someone elses, somewhere. I believe he's informing everyone in the rare occurance that someone might actually care - so far it's been a negatory.  I met a fellah not to long ago who looks like Agent Mulder. He's gay as the Jack of Diamonds, which kinda makes me chuckle. This kid, not Dave Duchovny. Dave is married to Tea Leoni, who is explicably and expressly hot, which I presume inferentially proves his utter lack of gayness.  Arnold is running for governor. I would vote for him without hesitation; even when the competition includes such sizable rivals as Gary Coleman.  BLACKOUT 2003 came and went. I was suffering from the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had (still am actually, props to Slamber who said it could last a month - 24 fucking hours my god damn burning asshole) - it appears Ohio is to blame, therefore Ontario > Ohio. Suck it up Drew Carey.  A good point was just made to me. At least if Glennis is sterile, he won't spread.  I hooked my Xbox up to my Big screen. that's really where it belongs. It's sexy over there. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is much much more of a game than Episode I or II were movies. It's a god damn fucking shame that Lucas' brain has been asphyxiated by the parasite that's slowly eating his body. If he had a drop of creative sense, this is the movie he would made. The only thing that makes me sad is that there isn't a dark force power labelled "Kill Kitten". I suppose I could use the regular  Kill power and direct it at a local kitten, but something specific really would have filled that void.  Glennis does have one redeeming quality, if I were dying in a raft, his corpse would feed me for many weeks. Quoth me. Thankfully he doesn't wear spandex. At least not that I can see.  That's some of what I have for you for now. I shall return, much like the Dark Knight, though with a hell of a lot less hot Robinchick and Battank.

      I sit here, listening to an orchestra mete out the tunes of videogames of my childhood with a reverence reserved for composers long dead. My eyes are closed and I can not see what I type - I shucked my contact lenses hours ago. I'm typing slowly so as to make as few errors as possible. I'm rather exhausted, I think that the past few days have been more than what I really could bear, at least as far as a biological standpoint could account for.  When asked how my day was, I responded "Hiroshima". When contemplating how my evening is going to be, I think "Nagasaki". It's been truly disasterous in an epic sort of way.  There have brilliant glimmering points of light that have pierced the fallout. I believe my current worldview, my mindstate is being dictated entirely by the lack of sleep that has been thrust upon me. As I'm sitting here worlds like foible, lycanthrope and fois gras slide across my brain.  Exhaustion is quite overrated, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone.

      Apple's latest price drop and revision on the new iBook is something that has given me pause. There is all sorts of goodness to be had through the Apple site for well under $2000. Their latest offering, the G4 (wow - this is their FAST chip) 12" iBook is $1349.00 with the student discount.  I'm now trying to decide whether I want to spend my gift certificate on an iPod or if I should wait and get the iBook or if I should spend the GC's on the iPod and slowly save til I can afford an iBook - or better yet, the 12" Titanium Powerbook.   Now I'm sure there are those of you out there who are wondering precisely why I would want or need another computing device. It's fairly clear that this one that I'm am currently operating is sufficient for the job it is doing.  The answer is three fold, I think.   Primarily, I'm returning, at some point in the near future (January or September of next year) to the University of Waterloo (I think. I may transfer, depending on what I decide I really want to do - some soul searching has to be done here.) I'd like a workstation that can go with me. Part of the problem previously has been that I'm not a particularly good notetaker with pen and paper, however, when it comes to typing, I've usually got the word down before it's out of the prof's mouth. My PDA was an acceptable solution for this, but it led to hours of post class formatting, which was less learning and more typographic acrobatics. A notebook, particularly an iBook with it's long battery life and small footprint would be ideal in moving from class to class.  Secondly, I'd like a wireless solution for home and for the road that is more integrated than my PDA or my cell phone. I'd like to have the same level of technical capability while retaining my mobility. I have a hankering to sit in coffeehouses, parks, restaurants and bookstores and simply type, read, analyze, examine, create etc. etc. etc. The one thing that pains me in regards to my current existence is being bound to the basement of my house. I've got a lovely little setup with a 17" LCD monitor and so on, however, even with my wireless capabilities as they stand, I've been relegated to the lowest point in the house. Frustrating, though I've done a good deal to make it more homely.  Which brings me to my third and final point:  I'd like to embrace the creative side of my personality with more vigour. I've found a renewed interest in photography and videography and I have a lovely feeling about some creative writing. Words, ideas and images have just been popping into my head lately, things so intense that I've been driving to write them down on little scraps, even start to sketch things! (You have no idea how bizarre this is - my ability to transfer a mental image to the page is legendary in it utter lack of quality. Truly, among those who simply for lack of a better work  suck  at illustration, I am a master). "What would this have to do with a laptop?", you ask? Well, I believe, and my recent experience with my new work environment is the only proof I need, that a clean and streamlined working environment frees the mind and encourages creativity. While I know the pretension is simply dripping from that statement, I just feel things flow more with a "lubricated" (for the lack) canvas. This is something that I think I've known for a while - it's effects were emphasized when I downloaded and started using iTunes. The Macintosh environment, for me, is a work friendly environment.  With that said, I'm no closer to my decision than when I started. I think I'm really going to have to sleep on this. If anyone out there has an opinion on it, drop me a line.

      As uberslick as most of us would class it, sleeping in really ain't all it's cracked up to be. Sleeping in comes with several companion facets - (Farah Facets, I like to call them) that simply do not Snickers-Level Satisfy. Primarily, it means I stayed up late. This is true and completely accurate - there was conversing into the wee hours as  I watched some of the best episodes of the Sopranos I have ever had the chance to lay my poor, unworthy occularies upon. While staying up was great - I always feel bad when I don't accomplish something while staying up; no extra coding was finished, no new pages were added to any website, no language was learned, etc... I tried to absorb some of the basics about real photography, however, photo.net/learn takes me to a plethora of pages with poor parsing - nothing between it's head tag and it;s tail if you will. Pity.  Sleep has been an interesting exercise over the past few days. I purchased down pillows from Ikea - they are simply the greatest thing to happen to my nightly retreat from consciousness since the first time I found staying awake was not an optional thing. I also invested in a comforter at the time - something I've never in my life owned up until this point. Bedspreads were always the rule, with blankets. Let me say that the fine North American invention of the comforter probably prevented a war at some point, it's a god damn life saver. However, it promotes the most dangerous type of sleep. The "Aww fuck it, it's only X o'clock"- Rollover(tm). Really a dangerous thing for those wanting to get work done.  It's not often I'm in bed til 12. It's superduper rare. I've had my day (I'm not going to get anything done today as I have to get cleaned up and go to work, but at least I had a good nap. Dreams were weird (no dreams about out future prime minister again, that was *whack* - to coin a term).  So now all of today's morning appointments, (one really - to set up a computer, that's all I do), are being shifted to tomorrow.  One thing that's on the roster for today: More Glen-asskicking. MWAHA!  He's really not that bad.  Oh yes. Yes he is. Someday I'm gonna get all survivor style and "If you WAS lyin in the DESURT with no FOOD or WATA, I wouldn't even stop to give you a DRINK."  Mostly cause I've got to have someone to loathe, and congrats Glenner, you're it :) LOVE YOU!

      Tomorrow is a big day in my life. I know this even before I get to tomorrow because of something magic. Something important. Something that will change my life forever.  Indiana Jones is being released on DVD tomorrow.  Hey.  HEY. Jesus. I don't mind the laughing, but try to keep it *civil*  It's a pretty significant event for a boy who has always looked up to Harrison Ford. I've got the jacket, I've got the hat and I've got the whip. Now all I need are some Nazis - whose asses shall promptly be kicked.  In other great news, I'm whupping Glennis in the month to date thing. That means I get to go to the vendor fair and he doesn't. If I can keep this up for the next 10 days I can laugh manically and rub it RIGHT in. I'm an asshole, but I'm good at it.  My days are filled entirely with computer repair. It's all I do.  Someone shoot me.

      And here we go.  Yeah, it's been a while. Shut the fuck up.   So work's been an absolute joy of late. I really hope there is a project Echelon (google it) cause at the point I'm about ready to FLY MY METAPHORICAL JETLINE into the TWINTOWERS that is the PLACE THAT I WORK. Christ almighty. The shooting, it is unpleasant you see, but it must be done. Fucktards to the left of me, Jackholes to the right, and here I am, dear readers, stuck in the middle with you.  Nana bread is good. Try it with Chocolate chips. Thank you Ms. Giffin.  Now iTunes just came out. For Windows. This has had some ramifications on my life in several ways. One - in things not related, I'm more cheerful. Yeah, you heard me, a fucking software program is actually making me more happy in my everyday life. Everytime I sit down at my PC there is a comforting interface waiting with a FUCKTON of music hidden behind it's XML driven sheen. It's a bit of a bizarre happenstance, 90% of my music is duly pirated (fuck you RIAA and CCC); But... BUT that figure is shrinking. My god. Not only has Apple made me want to listen to music more, They've made me want to buy more.  Not this pop-y nonsense that goes around like the clap, but actually music. It's been heavenly.  Of course the frequency with which I download music has gone up as well, so maybe that number's there to stay. Needless to say, an interest in music has been kindled, or rekindled and I have apple to thank for it. An iPod shall be purchased, believe you me. Woo.

      It is officially today.  Today, this January 19th in the year of our Lord Two Thousand and Four, we celebrate a great event in human history. So momentous that should statuary be erected in honour of this day it would dwarf the very planet that created it.  Today is the last day that I work with Glen in communications. This is akin to the last of the Nazi's being hunted down and sent off to The Hague. So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, Goodnight!  I'd like to say I'll miss him, but if I took a decent bead and really meant to, I'd probably hit him.  No more smug. No more self importance. No more irritating self righteous bastardism. I hope they break him. I'm not a hard guy to get along with - everyone else and I - well it's just peachy. Glen? Well Glen doesn't get along with anyone. Mister Heart-on-his-sleeve really needs to take the prick-o-metre down a notch.  In other news there's a girl at work who smells. It's really sad, because you want to say something but you don't. I mean complete litter box smell. It's really not cool. Also - she's never not eating. She's been told about it too - we're not allowed to have food or beverages on the floor (with good reason - sensitive equipment and such). I saw her finish a muffin and within moments whip out a chocolate bar. That's just not right.  How do you go about organizing an intervention?

      Everything you do to me is like I'm drunk - or something like that.  Blogging seems to be developing into this very bizarre form of composition - it's almost like you can see a chunk of text and say immediately "That's a blog". They seem to be very tangent... er... tangential? Tangenital? (If someone gets off track and you whap them in the nads, have you just struck them about the tangenitals?) - Like streams of consciousness but it a more structured form. e.e. cummings with a filing system.  Leaping off on a tangent - that's another thing, segue's seem (seam? HA!) to be optional - I think the new direction for the US Space program is finally in the realm of "Promising" again. Mars has been the least successful venture that Nasa has undertaken thus far - shooting for the moon (again) is a slightly less lofty if necessary goal. We know we can land on the moon. We did before. However, the computers they had then filled rooms, now they fill pockets. Break out the bloody Saturn V's and let's get this show on the road again.  Crimson Skies is delicious. Non-Nazi-Nazi's are fun to shoot.  You may now return to your regularly scheduled whatever.

      I got a call this morning from the head CSR of my former store.  Ted's back.  Maybe you can't fathom the sheer terror that this inspires in me. Ted consumed nearly six weeks of my life. Ted's a shriner - they're good folks - if, somehow, as a child, you've encountered some sort of flame based injury - they take care of you. Ted's a little path though - as in psycho, socio and -ological liar.   Here's the deal: He bought a computer off someone. I don't know who. The call comes through on my watch that the end of the world, despite the utter lack of raining fire and cackling horsemen, is actually occuring. You see, Ted, for all his claims of having more money than god, managed to buy himself a refurbished computer. Listen, for those of you out there who don't get it - if you buy a refurb, you're going to get a stinking good price. Think about why. It's still your call, but don't bitch when it's got some kinks that need to be worked out. Now Ted, he claims that he's just had a stroke and can't drive. So someone has to come out to his house and fix it there.  We don't do that. If you get hurt on the job offsite, you're fucked. Proper fucked. So we don't do it.  Until the dirty rotten pigfucker calls the Regional Manager on his cell phone. Then you get dispatched post-haste. Needless to say I spent many hours in Ted's old-man apartment, inhaling cigarette smoke waiting to die. I prayed death would come to release me. Yeah, didn't happen.  So I get a call today asking me to deal with Ted. The word no has never had a more vocal proponent then me, this morning. FRO - Fuck Right OFF.  So I'm waiting for the next call, begging for my help, No needs my support

      I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance through geico!  Well, that's a lie. I'm insured through work - something I wasn't quite sure of on Monday after Kevin (hereafter to be referred to as Kev-bo the Master Cockgobbler - well, maybe not) yelled at me for a solid two hours. You see, there was this man. This man - let's, for argument's sake call him Jeremy Ribideau - returned a camera to my store. Now I can prove, circumstantially, that he fucked us. I didn't accuse him of it, but he fucked us. I caught him and asked him if he had anything to explain. Guilt got the better of him and he threw a fucking tantrum on me. Later he wrote a letter to head office (well, no names, so I'm relatively free, but whatever). Later he comes in and we have some words - there's a disparity here (much like his complete bullshit letter) about what happened - he claims I used some rather strong language, which I have the good sense not to do. This, of course, is cause for Kevin to ignore me and shout for two hours until I slapped some fucking sense into him. I did it fairly sharply which could have landed me squarely in unemployed (no big deal really) but instead snapped him the fuck out of the land of gross stupidit.  The DLA is coming along nicely in Uru. Hopefully we'll see the webpage finished tomorrow. I'm collaborating on a Sound and Light entry - well, we're thinking about it. We'll see. I did the writeups for dniactivities.org yesterday. I'm just waiting to see what more work I can do.  My teeth hurt like hell - this brings me back to my original point - My orthadontics, which I originally thought would be leaving my person sometime around December this year - well they'll actually be parting my company sometime around April. Fuck yes. Straight teeth roxx0r my b0xxors.  madam im adam is a palindrome.  I've started to re-read Foundation. Along with Dune it's one of the great Sci-fi mindjobs. At least it's not more Phillip K. Dick - that fellow had problems (has? surely he's dead, right?) with memory - everything's always about memory alterations. Then again, it may be something to look to.  It's hella cold today. Wrap up for god's sake.  I really like CSI. Like, REALLY REALLY. I could care less for Miami - Horatio? Fuck, why is that man still in television? However, Gil Grissom - I really care about him. I recently saw two episodes which quoted ideas from the Tomas Harris Lecter Trilogy - fascinating in that Will Petersen played Will Graham (later Played by Ed Norton) in the original Manhunter (Red Dragon the First). But I really like him. I'd like to work with him. Some people just strike you the right way. He does.  Currently Listening to: The Dave

      Like Ian McKellan from the depths of middle earth I find blog thrust upon my person through a random IM. Ah, blog, I've missed this. Forgive me for my wayward wanderings - I discovered sleep, violating our bloodsworn pact of insomnia. I've also discovered Uru, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good and Evil and Crimson Skies all of which have torn me from your bosom.  I realize that my blog is, ast the best of times, politically incorrect. I should really apologize to anyone I've offended, minorities (the russians), majorities (John) and so on. I would imagine the reduced-stress environment that I currently enjoy has made me less crochety. Also - I deal with russians a hell of a lot less now. I should really qualify that statement though - when I say russians, I probably don't mean russians at all - I've heard they are quite friendly and joyous. I mean the bitter eastern bloc'ers who've had the collective souls of their families crushed under the iron boot of communism. I feel sorry for them while loathing them as they loathe me. I feel less morose as the hatred is generally mutual.  My watch chimes at 8:00 PM EST daily.  I'm out of debt. That's a very exciting thing. If I manage to complete my degree while sustaining this level of "out-of-debt-ness" I'll be quite proud.  My weeks consist of consuming baked goods lovingly crafted for my person. That kicks quite a bit of ass.  I've met some really phenomenal people because of a game called Uru (quit trying to pronounce it - it's Ooo-roo - just go download the demo and get off my case - www.urulive.com). Three very cool people and I have hatched some pretty wicked ideas. I hope things pan out - it could be quite sweet.  I got a sexy haul for Festivus. Raindrops on roses and SLR Cameras - that sort of thing.  Glen's leaving my department. I just found out two days ago. I yelped like a mother when I heard. They've tossed him to the lion's den in hometheatre. I'm doing abdominal exercises just to prepare for the sheer amount of laughter I'm going to be involved in watching him crumble like a week old Timbit.  We've got a lot of catching up to do, you and I. I shan't overstay my welcome this time, but we'll talk over a bottle of wine. For now, buenos noches!

      So my bank hasn't done jack for me lately.  Correction. They rape and pillage my account like rabid visigoths (which, unlike normal goths are quite uneffiminate and carry clubs instead of hanging around in them) and "withdraw" a multitude (like Jesus Fish and Loaf Crowd sized) of "fees" on a regular basis. For the priviledge of holding on to  my  money these delightful people were charging me upwards of   a hundred and sixty freakin' dollars  a year. SO THEY COULD MAKE INTEREST OFF MY MONEY AND NOT PAY ANY TO ME!!  FTS: Fuck that shit.  So I signed up with PC banking. As of next week I'm transferring all my bills and shit over to this new account. Unique concept - they're paying me more interest (TEH SEXAY!) and I get points for groceries. It's tantamount to bribery. I love it.  Got an email from an old friend today, just as I was searching for his email address to drop him a line. It's like I'm in some John Cusack movie.  Pardon me while I go rearrage my videogames in autobiographical order.

      About my old house and not being able to sleep and trying to kill some fat man with a baseball bat, a hatchet and variety of other implements. I woke up gasping for breath. It sucked something proper.  I think I'm going to start a new website (I'm still working on my other one too - another-castle.net) about Canadian Politics. I get far too angry about things in the country at the municipal, provincial and federal level not to do anything about it. I've got some things down - when I get them to make sense, I'll share them with you here.

      I do and I don't have a temper.   Generally I'm very calm. In the face of most adversity I'm very calm. Then the simplest thing will set me off. I tend to explode in the face of rediculous adversity - things like insurance, taxes, gravity and sharp edges. I get the feeling I should probably seek some therapy for this, but I'll inevitably try to deal with it by myself and end up Falling Down.  Some days it's just not worth getting out of bed. Add this one to the list.  I'm clenching my jaw a lot. I think I need to see my dentist. It's to the point where my jaw is starting to hurt.  I wish my eyes worked like those belonging to regular humans.  They say becoming virtuous takes time. What if patience is the virtue I seek?

      Uru: Live is dead. Long Live Uru: Live.  They killed it. It's like smothering a child who has asthma for fear they won't turn out to be an olympic athlete. Willfully abandoning your child to crib death as you parade around the deck chatting with friends and joking about the nature of pimentos and their place in the world and your martini. Apologies are being made, accusations are being hurled; it's flat our rediculous. I won't forget this.  In other news, the dream is still alive - Jay has a drive unlike no other I've ever seen - smart lad, jovial and - well, he gets distributed computing on a micro and macro scale. That's kinda cool. I'm glad I can still be a part.  Glen's been in home theatre for three weeks now - he's based for two paychecks. It's sad. That's a lie; it's amusing. I wrote "Dust me Glen" on all of the TVs in his section. I'm not a nice fellow. Full count was tonight - it was over in record time.  I've the aspriation to write the Great American Novel. It's on my to do list.  I think I need a new camcorder and an iBook. Tomorrow I'm going to open a savings account for those two items.  I'm clenching my jaw a lot. I need to talk to my dentist a lot. My teeth are quite a bit straighter now.  I'm now onto Foundation and Empire (as soon as I found my copy - I was searching for quite a bit - it was disparaging not being able to find it).  I haven't been able to use my camera or my telescope of late. That's sad. I will be able to soon, that's nice.  My new computer flies. Bloody well flies. It's uncanny.  Played some Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance II. While I'm broken hearted at the loss of my nigh unstoppable Archer-of-Death, the Rogue Dwarf ain't half bad.   I think I'm just writing for something to do right now. I'm going to go and try to be more creative.  Currently listening to: The Beatles

      Kevin got laterally moved to Windsor. We've got Bodh (woo). Bodh and I have clashed before and every time I say his name I feel like I've got a cold. "Boh-d" Like I'm trying to say bold with a nose full of mucus.  To top it off, you guess, the abject failure returns. Glennis has been reassigned to my department. I want him dead. I want him gone. I want him anywhere but here. I hate his fucking guts.  And yet I get to smile to his face, for team players don't hate each others fucking guts.  I am not a team player.

      The Sky split, the earth shook and... I got fucking promoted.  Here's the backstory: It's March. Our numbers haven't been too favourable of late but we're only four days in. Anyone panicking at this point needs a solid kick in the nuts. Of course this means that the three stooges are in full fledged code red Al Queda level panic.  Thursday afternoon - the K man gets back from a unit meeting and begins to illustrate how much of a beatdown is in store for the employees of our shop. This proceeds for an hour until I inform him that it's completely the opposite thing of what we'd call productive and he really needs to cut that shit out, pronto.  Cut to: Friday Morning, the lunchroom, my knuckles are white as I grip the suggestion box while leaning on it. I envision it's K's head and that I'm going to rip it open and boot his cerebellum across the parking lot. Beatdown after beatdown rains down for over 45 minutes in the most excruciatingly bad meeting I've ever been a part of. What I don't know is that it's part one. Saturday morning is part two. Needless to say, on both of these days, numbers are bad, morale is down and people just don't give a shit about doing a good job. After all, if you're told you're shit, who are you to argue?  Cut to: This morning. K's turning the meeting over to the Hip Hopper who goes about delivering a Panic Meeting - that is to say "well, we know the reasons you're giving us for things being bad, but they really don't add up" even though they really do - it's like there's this reality distortion field that decends on these people and they can't see forest, trees or anything else. It's a god damn shame - they should just donate their corneas to someone who would use them.  I'm getting pissed at this point. I know how to motivate people - it's a gift I've got - and I can do it without being an asshole. So I step in. I halt the whole proceeding and go right ahead and do my thing. Instead of getting cut off, I'm givin the floor and I run the rest of the meeting. As soon as I've said my piece I can see both managers and employees nodding, smiling and everyone seems a little more revved about things.   Then K starts going on about someone who works hard and is a perfect example of leadership and how to do things right. I think he's talking about Glennis until he says "I think Rob and Glen know who I'm talking about here..." and proceeds to say that I've been promoted to Senior Sales Associate.  God damn.

      There's so little good television. It's like television is the metaphorical equivalent to mana in an acid rainstorm - every hundredth drop is pure heaven sown into the sky by God himself; everything else will melt straight through your skull and leave you deader than the non-virgin blond in a horror flick. Joss Whedon has brought a lot of the television I currently consider worth watching to the screen - as has this "Dick Wolf" fellow. I hear that Dick has earned his name through force of personality, can't say I'd know for certain. It appears that like Mr. Whedon's other offerings, Buffy and Firefly, Angel will soon be going off the air.  That's gonna cut my TV watching down quite a bit. Right now I've got Angel, Smallville, Law and Order and it's variants, and that's about it. Reality shows are just sucking far too hard to care anymore. Let's get back to good old TV. Apparently Steven King has a new showing called "Kingdom Hospital" - I'll check that out - it's a hospital with ghosts.  I've been at the golfing range quite a bit lately - it's something fun to do with dad. I spent a little time people watching at the mall today. It was an interesting exercise.  You'd be surprised how many old men wear the same flat cap.

      There's this guy at work. He's a manager, that is to say, somehow, he's usually got keys to the joint. Scary stuff. In any case I just happened to walk in on a discussion between this fellow (a hip hopper: the term is derived from his inability to form a complete sentence without some sort of slang or ebonics - not to say this is a bad thing, I find it entertaining as hell) talking to a young lady I work with about, and I quote here, "the sexiest part on a man's body", which to this point I had always assumed would be his quick wit and intellect. Instead I've been informed that the sexiest part on a man's body is in fact, manlines.   Manlines? Say it slowly with me.... W... T....F?  Manlines, apparently, are the vertical lines formed by a man's pelvis if he's pretty trim. Accord to mein hiphopping caucasian manager, this is why hip hoppers wear their pants so low. And here I was thinking it was simply because they hadn't stolen a belt in the right size. (badum bum)  Goooo Manlines.  So I've been on this Atkins diet. About two weeks ago I weighed around 165. I now weigh 153. I'm not really concerned about the weight at all, I couldn't give a toss what I weight. I'm more concerned about my body shape and my energy level - lately my pants feel roomier and I've been doing three miles a day on the treadmill. It's quite rewarding. After my little treadmill sessions I'm also doing a bit of weight training; gonna see if I actually can string some muscle on these bones.

      ...to the abject failure that is the Glennis.  We both do the same job. I'm senior sales, he's SMT (Store Management Trainee - it used to be SMD, stood for "Suck My Dick" - while accurate, it was a little obnoxious). That means at this point, we're both opening and closing the store, we both have our own set of keys (mine are coming), we both have alarm codes, we both run the floor, we both do high shrink counts and we both sell.  I do all of this better than he does.  That's not hubris talking. That's not ego. It's the bold fucking truth. Sweet, ain't it.  See, when I run the floor, we make money. I ran the open today - we were up to 50% of target at 4, with fairly decent numbers. Glen ran the close, - when I dropped by, we had actually LOST ground - that's right, we were at less volume than when I had given him the floor. Secondly, I run a sucessful program - open box. I'm hoping to add clearance to the sucessful list by the end of the week - we're best of Canada in the region on both now. Glen - well, they bounced him from clearance (it sucked) to monster (it sucks, we didn't even have the most basic tools one needs to present the shit - way to go fearless leader) to (now) basket. He's like a Failure-leper, breeding suckassageness where ever he may wander.  He's a patronizing son of a bitch to boot. He tried to make me look bad today - going on about how I'd lost a report - the Returns Audit Report (the bump) that I was supposed to file. Funny thing? It was "lost" because I'd already filed it. Get off my efficient ass motherfucker or I will put you down like a rabit badger. (Badger badger badger badger badger badger badger).  Bodh asked me what had changed about my approach to work over the past few months - I let him know that I've become a more goal oriented person.  My goal? Total domination of the Glennis' soul.  What do I do when I hit the goal? There shall be a mighty party. There will be punch and pie.

      So far Bohd hasn't been so bad. I've been exposed to him for a collective timespan of less than six hours over the course of the week. I had to redraw the schedule this week - it was a bloody chore - consider I'd already done it once. Rob keeps attempting to console me with the fact that the Glennis will probably be gone within the next month - we both know that's a lie. He can't even manage a home theatre department, let alone several other chores beside that. He has no work ethic to speak of. We have AORs - Areas of Responsibility. Tag, dust shit, make sure it looks good. For his entire tour of duty in Home Theatre he wouldn't dust (I'd write "Dust me" on the screens), his plasma wall was broken and things were generally fucked up. A real shame. Now that he's back in comm, things are bad - we've got serious staffing issues. Essentially we have five full timers in a department that could run on three.  In good news I've been assigned dual captaincy with Open Box and clearance. How I juggle these two tasks will be the benchmark by which I'm compared in the future. You wanna shoot high, but not so high that you hang yourself. It's a delicate balance.  I talked to Harold about working at Rogers yesterday. That could be appealing. At the very least a steady paycheck would be nice.  I'm looking pretty trim on this Atkin's thing, however I've got a holdover from when I was sick. I think I'm going to go back to the doctor and talk to her about it - my stomach hurts quite a bit almost immediately after I eat. Maybe it's the cancer.  Yesterday was April fools, I didn't get fooled at all. Pity.  Jeff has announced that he will be joining us here next week in an impromptu visit. That is very exciting and unexpected. There shall be much rejoicing.  Movie theatres are phasing out cheap night. My propensity for downloading films just shot through the roof. Fuck me, I fuck you right back. IN THE EYE.  That's all for now.

      to defend your home? I had a dream not more than two hours ago which seemed to focus on the nature of how far I would go to defend the sanctity of my home and my possesions. The cast of characters seemed interested - I'm not sure if they are telling in anyway. A rather overweight person who seemed to be a native Canadian was trying to intimidate me and break into my home. I managed to subdue him and got him out of the house. His friends showed up in a beat up old Taurus (none of them were native Canadian) and one of them pulled a gun. I quickly pulled the chap who was trying to break in back into the house and managed to get to the kitchen where we struggled over a knife; I eventually won the upperhand. Back outside the others turned over the gun and then sat there as I beat the crap out of the person who was trying to break into my house with a variety of implements. (At some point he got free and started spray painting the two sports utes in the double car sized garage - this becomes an important incongruity later) For some reason even in my dream I stopped myself before delivering a fatal blow. The police came and towed away the car with the three other boys in it and then dragged the other boy away. The dream ended with us reversing a rather large red pickup into the single car sized garage (the truck folded up to accomdate the size).  Then I went outside to interview a young asian girl about a new mosque (say what?) that was being built and how nice it would be.  I'm gonna blame this one on the eye drops.

      I just spent one hour fifty four minutes listening to the audio commentary of "The Last Samurai" after writing some preliminaries down for my article. Edward Zwick has some really interesting things to say in TLS, nothing supergroundbreaking(tm) but it was nice to know where they were coming from.  That's all I have for now.

      Bored, that is. It appears that since I'm supposed to keep my eyes shut and not stressed for the next few days I have nearly exhausted most of the easily accessible options. I've listend to every edition of the daily show that I've had recorded on my PVR. I've listened to the Michael Moore book I had on tape (he's a bit over the top, isn't he?) and I've come to the conclusion that writing these entries with my eyes closed will probably lead me to conclude that I should brush up on my typing. Then again, if you can read this, mayhaps not.  I think I'm going to see about listening to some DVD commentaries. I'm also going to think about writing some more on an article I'd like to submit for an upcoming book.Yeah, I haven't mentioned it here before, but that's cause I was just thinking about it. Now that I've got some writing done, it makes a whole world of difference.  I may boot the old notebook up and give it a whirl.

      So I went for my follow up with Dr. Alfano this morning. - A brief insight into Dr. Alfano - he's a cool guy. I met him about a month ago when I needed my prescription verified - he's the one I talked to about LASIK to begin with.  Today I went to see him and I'm seeing better than 20/20 in both eyes. My right eye is slightly itchy - so Dr. Alfano sent me to the Waterloo centre again just to make sure. There wasn't anything wrong - it's what they call an epithelial defect - however I appreciate him taking the time to make sure - better safe than sorry as the old adage goes. I've been told to up the frequency of my lubricating drops to every 15 minutes - with the way the BION tears feel I have no problem with that. It's a very pleasant soothing sensation. The antibiotics and the anti-inflamatories are now four times a day - they sting less now.  I had to tape these enormous plastic shields to my eyes last night. Surprisingly I had no problem sleeping in them at all. I looked like a bug, but hell, for better than twenty twenty? I'm in.  I'm off to go juice my eyes again and them I'm going to listen to a few more movie commentaries. W00t

      The course of eyedrops is intensive but nothing so horrible as you might think. Two of them, the Maxidex (shake before using, use every waking hour of the first day and four times a day for the following three days) and the Ciloxin, (use twice today, dinner and bedtime and four times a day for the next three days brekky, lunch, din din and sleepybyes.) sting around what must be the edge of the incision when applied. It stings only for a second and considering that these are the anti-inflamatories and the anti-biotics, it's slightly reassuring that they do. The Bion Tears (the lubircant) I'm hitting on a regular basis - 2-4 times an hour, depending on how I feel. Apparently those who moisten their eyes more promote the best healing. I want to be a best healing promoter(tm) so that's what I'm going to do.  I have a followup in the morning with Dr. Alfano - hopefully he tells me that I'm doing fine. At some point tonight I get to "Raise Sheilds" and go all hands to battlestations with the plastic guards I get to tape on to my face. These things are the rule, not the exception, for the next week. Seems a small price to pay. So tape away I shall.  Doing well so far.  Mom brought me fruit in a little cup with cool whip. She roxx0rs.

      Here's how the process works.   You shou up at the university of waterlloo Laser Eye Centre about ten o'clock. You let them know you're here. They let you know that they have eyes and that they can see you and it's about time you sat your myopic ass down.  You do so. A girl walks in, looks about 19 with what chould be her... brother? Father? She looks nervous. An old lady comes out of the clinic - it appears she's been treated already and so she sits down, waiting for a ride. A third couple walks in looking rather tired. They sit down. I'm called in to do the most important part of the procedure - paying for it. My dad comes with me.  He hands over the Amex - the amount of points derived simply from this sale are phenomenal - Amex has a "Spend $3000 and double your points for May" thing on. Just so happens my surgery is $3000. Dad needs to get back to work, and though he wants to stay I tell him to bugger off and go make smoe money. The next time I'm called in, a they dialating drops go in. After being noted regarding my condition from Dr. Alfano, they know to use special drops so I'm not blind as a bat for the next few days. They still sting like mothers though. I go back to the waiting room. Everyone is sitting there in booties and some have already donned their caps. They all look morose. I start to crack a few jokes. With in a few minutes we discover that Brandy is actually married to her rather old looking compatriot. Also, she's a op. Later I learn that she's got a very small tolerance for pain. Odd for a cop. Also there is Michelle, having travelled from Vancouver because her boyfriends' mom works there. Seems like everyone getting a discoutn except me.  Finally I get taken into the thrid room. About an hour and ahalf has passed at this point. A very nice lady whose name I didnot catch began to tryat my eyes with drops - an antiinflamatory, and an antibiotic. They both sticg. We discuss te general idea of what's going to go on, then she gets into specific.s I've been through it a few times, but I suppose they don't want any sort of mix up going on.  Finally I am sent to see Dr. Jelllie. He's very much like his name would imply. Kinda wobbly both phycially and in tone. Seems lieka  nice man, though. He beings to detail the exact process and complications therein presented bymy procedure. I begin to think "oh, shit. here we go" He starts telling me about PRK - which I've researched. Essentially  PRK laser the eye directly. seven days of near blindness and three months of roids and drops. No thank you. Lasik - Laser in situ Keratome ( I think, off the top of my head) involves uction being placed on the yee - a microkeratome (think mini guillotine or cigar cutter) is lowever on tothe eye and slices the top off, swish swish, leaving a little hinge (think nearly headless nick) by which to flip said flap open.  The idea is this. I', a boderline case (aren't I always?_ in that I could be a candidate for either. He asks me flat outright. I state that I would like LASIK. He smiles as if I've hit on the right answer. I go back to the dark room with the three green lazyboy chairs and the nice lasy. She goes through the final series of eye drops and then casuall uses a swab to anesthtize the under side of my eyelids.  Needless to say, my eyes are not th emost cooperative, but I did my best not to fight her. THe bruises should heal in a few weeks anyway. Finally she hands me what must be the smallest god damn tablet on the planet. It's Atavan. An anti anxiety drug. She says "You seem to be the calmest person we've had in while, but this'll help you sleep when you're done." I pop it.  Dr. Jellie is ready for me. Brandy is still freaking out, I give her a quick thumbs up and move on. As I pass the next room I'm informed that a patient who's had the procedure done back for an enhancement and would like to watch my procedure if I would be so kind. I said certainly. I am led into the room and told to lie down on the bed. I was hoping for restriats, I get twitchy. No such thing.  I lie down and nearly bean myself on some really freaking expensive equipment. Many hands shoot forth to prevent my cranium from damaging the priceless equipment - or is it the otherway around?  It's all bright lights and burning hair from here on in kids. I'm aligned for my right eye. The left on is taped shut with surgical tape. The right eyelashes are taped, upper and lower. the Speculum (ladies, I know it's a horrible word now) is applied to my eye and cracked open. No discomfort.the microkertome is put onto my eye with the suction device. The pressure increase (no feeling of that, I can hear them) and the world goes black. Seriously, one minute you're wsitting thtere, the next minute, the lab doesn't exist anymore.I feel a vibration across my eye, bottom to top then again, top to bottom.. Pressure goes and I see a form reach down and peel a contact lens of my eye. "Perfect flap!" exclaims Dr. J. I uncross one set of fingers. Hands wrap around my head, keeping me as still as can be and after a few light blips, a bright purple light flits around mmy eye. It sound and smells exactly as I would have expected from being told so many times - like a bug zapper burning hair. It doesn't bother me at all.twenty five.... fifty,,.. seventy five... done. After a few moments the flap is reinstated and small canoe paddles are beying a pplied to my eyes in some  way either in a lilliputian effort to circumnavigate the maris oculis or in order to smooth this chunk of eye back down so I can open and close my eyes normally. The tape is pulled and I can open and close my eyes like a champ.  The right eye is then taped shut and the procedure is repeated on the left eye. Not as smooth - I can feel the speculum and the microkeratome. I jump whne my eye gets slices. However, perfect cut again.  I'm helped from the OR and into the holding room again. The nice ldy gives me a few more drops and my kit of stuff - bion tears and my night lenses. She also gives me the oolest pair of sunglasses I'll never buy. I wear them immediately. I get my eyes checked just briefly and all appears to be well.   So there you have it. I wrote in an earlier blog wondering if I wasdefectove in the inventory control sytem of God. It appears now that I can be resold OB, refurbish. Huzzah.  I apologize for any spelling mistakes in this entry - it's purely touch type without the benefit of proofreading as I'm not supposed to stare at a screen. I'll fix em later. Maybe.

      In nine hours and forty three minutes I have an appointment with Laser Eye Surgery at The Laser Centre at the University of Waterloo.  With luck I'll never have to wear glasses again (they say I'll have to wear them for reading when I'm forty. To them I say BRING ON THE NANITES!!!).  I'm a little apprehensive, but it's starting to settle. Everyone I've talked to has said it is the greatest thing that has ever happened to them. I hope I can say the same in a week.

      Because of the nature of the pain in my teeth yesterday I ate pizza. Or more precisely, the toppings off a pizza - in accordance to my "New nutritional approach" (that's the only way I can say Atkins without getting lynched nowadays). I went to bed early and somehow managed to gear myself up for the weirdest dream I've had in a while. All the significant players from highschool were there, Tassie Hall had been turned into this *enormous* place wherein one of the most elaborate productions I've ever seen was being displayed. There were even folks from work there - some of whom apparently have particularly good singing voices.  It messed with my head completely. It wasn't a nightmare, but it was a dream I was glad to get out of.

      My pupils didn't re-constrict. I've had elastics put on my brackets. I can't yawn, my teeth hurt and bright lights (like this monitor) are really hurting my eyes.  I feel so very broken.

      Right now I'm having trouble typing this post. My eyes ahave been fully dialated as part of a series of test that I have to participate in for my laser surgery. Everything is blurry. Blurry with my glasses on, blurry with them off. I have some fun driving home - I imagine this is probably what drunk driving looks like minus the slow reaction time. Driving home wasn't so bad, but as soon as I got downstairs to the basement it became very clear that this is going to get worse all day. I can see find in pitch black - I'm closing my eyes while I type this because the brightness of my LCD display is a little too bright for once. I brought my iPod with me to the Opticians as I was told that I would be waiting 15 to 30 minutes in order to make sure my eyes dialted completely. THe first set of drops were the yellow dye/anesthetic that I had last time. The second set were designed to dialate my eyes; they stung.   I've taken a few pictures of my eyes and captured some video - very cool look - they're almost completely black. Needless to say, I'm very excited about this procedure.  I've got an orthadontist appointment tomorrow at noon - apparently I missed one earlier this week. That kinda sucks - hopefully he'll be able to tell me when I get my braces off.  I bought Star Trek: Voyager Season Two - it's turning out to be a more interesting show when you can see all the episodes in their original broadcast order. The one thing that bothers me is that in almost every single episode they're getting their asses kicked. It's Archer Syndrome all over again.

      I don't watch a lot of TV. I like to think I watch smarter, classier television. Over the years it's been a plethora of Treks Star, a variety of Joss Whedon shows and just about anything sci-fi with good plot and dialog. The best part of television is that for about six months you have a friend with you every week. Continuing story lines, familiar characters. Someone to associate with.   It's hard to let go. All Good Things was one of the first. Saying goodbye was hard even when you knew the feature film was just around the corner.  Tonight I bade another friend farewell. Angel went off the air with what was, in my opinion, a very satisfying final episode. It resovled nothing - and yet left me with a sense of resolution nonetheless. The show was about making a difference (or the lack thereof) and the real stuff that people who preport to be heroes are made of.  We still have Smallville. Of the holy trinity - Buffy, Angel and the Boy of Steel, only Kal-el remains.  The summer approaches and we shouldn't be watching TV anyway. But I'm still going to mourn the loss of my friends.  Seems silly when people are dying around the world - but fuck you. Who are you to judge what's important to me anyway?

      I couldn't breathe last night. Simply the worst night's sleep of my life. At 5AM I ventured downstairs and played some CoH for a few hours - level 16 is playing through much smoother than level 15. By the time I went back upstairs to sleep it was actually cold, so I needed my comforter. It's a bizarre country in which we live. The American's don't have to put up with this nonsense, they issued an ultimatum to Mother Nature and just pointed at Saddam. 85, breezy and partly cloudy every day. Not a bad deal, if you've got the nukes to back it up.  I have to go to work (that's sort of a given, it's a day that ends in "...day") and I'm still tired and cranky. I was going to ride my bike, but it's really cold now. I get the feeling it's going to be horrid. Ah well.  I had a nightmare last night where I lost a tooth. Even with my braces in. It was fucked up. I have a real thing against limb loss (if you've read the blog, you know) which definately includes teeth. Not pleased, not pleased at all. I'm going to have to have a sit down with the old subconscious and let it know that this sort of behavious simply will not be tolerated.

      Five men cut off the head of another man as a tribute to the hate and anger towards a group of other men.  It seems like such an innocuous statement in print. Nick Berg got his head cut off. Very plain, no mess about the actually lexicon - it seems like a very subdued way to expire. It isn't. This isn't some sort of Tarantino-esque jaunt through moral degredation; these men pick on someone who had little or nothing to do with their grievance and punished him for their own frustrations. To top it all off, instead of taking responsibility for this "bold act" (as I'm sure they've termed it), they've hidden their head behind scarves and balaclavas. Cowards.  What the hell is wrong with these people? I don't mean muslims and and I don't mean Iraqis. I mean the folks in this world who readily do what we would term as "Evil" unto those around them. What is it about the middle east that provokes people to turn to arms so quickly? Even in the 18th and 19th centuries North Americans were slow to anger (though the violence burned brightly when ignited).   What of peaceful protests? What of quiet defiance? What of simply going about your business? It would seem to me that rebuilding your shattered nation after thirty years of dictatorship and a handful of wars would be a more beneficial goal. It shames me to share genetic code with these bastards.  Is it something to do with Islam? How is it that there are some who practice what they call Islam who have been so devoured by hate? I really don't understand why they feel they must destroy and kill - either the Jews or Westerners. I could devoutly not give a toss if I met one of these chaps down a dark alley - in fact, I'd tip my hat, wish him a mighty fine evening and go about my business. Why is his business killing me?  If it comes down to a Darwinian "Us or Them" I am resolute in the belief that it will be us. However, why does this problem exist at all? It's the one thing, the most important thing that I don't comprehend regarding Middle Eastern Politics. No one has really gone over "why" they hate us - just who and how they hate us. In the movies terrorists have demands - we barely hear from these people. Even Cobra Commander was more communicative than these swines.  Fuck em. The problem with the American's right now is that they're not hitting back hard enough. The Israelies have a lovely technique - track down who was responsible for a given crime and WIPE OUT their entire family. A genetic line, erased. Slowly but sure we'll get to the point where no one can be bothered to hurt each other any more.  That or we all die.

      I'm about to head out to have my eyes checked for potential LASIK eligibility.  They have an option where you can get better than 20/20 sight. I'm taking that.  If they also have an option where I can shoot lasers out of MY eyes, I'm also taking that.

      It's been over a month, I know. I'm pulling some pretty ridiculous hours, so get off me okay?  Alright - here's the deal: New Game = City of Heroes. Finest game I've played in a while. I can FLY. FLY. Yeah. Fucking FLY. I'm a hero. I go around fighting crime with my techonological wizardry and gadgets. I may choose to go around bashing evil with superstrength and magic later, there are so many freaking options it's stupid. Needless to say it doesn't suck. There's a fee involved, per month. Yeah, never wanted to do that. Going to though.  I've been a little stumped of late cause the game's just kicking my ass. Toughie, deal with it. A challenge is a challenge, wimping out ain't heroic. However, logging off to cool off and go back later ain't a bad idea either. It keeps you from going through excessive amounts of keyboards.  Secondly, got a new toy. Canon Elura 65. Canon did us a stupid deal on this thing. Got it for 21$ a month for the next little while. Stupid stupid good deal. It's incredibly sexy. I'm keeping a video diary to supplement the blog - maybe I can host and link to some of the clips.  Work's going well. I won employee of the month, I'm not sure what that entails. Apparently my co-workers voted for me. Cool. Best thing was - Glennis didn't win it.  The Atkins is going well. I'm starting to develop a six pack, that's kinda cool. A few of my friends are trying it out. It's working well for some of the people at work right now - that's great. A guy in computers dropped 7 lbs in 10 days. It's nice to be a positive force for people. The one thing that a few are having a tough time wrapping their heads around is the ongoing nature of Atkins. It's not a diet - it's a lifestyle change. You don't gain the weight back cause you don't go off it. That simple. Cool by me.  My backs' been bothering me a bit of late - from the accident oh so many years ago. I've got an appointment with the chiropractor tomorrow. Don't know if that'll do more harm than good. Who knows. We shall see.  It's nice to be posting again. Hopefully I can squeeze some more entries in soon.

      Speaking of Columbo's, I should put tonights' theft story in perspective. Perspective, means, of course, that something far, far worse and far, far funnier happened to the Glennis on Monday Night. This is second hand, so don't shoot the messenger here kids, but I've got it on good authority that it's pretty accurate.  We have a chip display. Not for microchips or memory chips, but for chips of the corn and potato variety. A veritable temple of carb-evil. A satanic alter to Humpty Dumpty and the Muchie gang.  Glennis was governing the floor (he doesn't manage it, he governs it... WITH AN IRON FIST!!! ... ahem). So some lads, looking glassy eyed and smiling like the GST had just been repealed are loitering. They firmly grasp both sides of the display and hoist it into the air. They march directly from the store and begin cramming it in their car. The Glennis is shell shocked - a customer comes up to him from outside and hands him a bag of chips and says "Aren't you going to stop them?"  This apparently triggers some sort of Stupor-Hero reflex in our duh-tagonist. He races out to seize the villains... as they drive away... in their car... with.... NO LICENSE PLATES.  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!  Oh, the comedy. I can barely breathe.  Apparently he called the cops and speculated that they might be on drugs. To which the cop allegedly replied "They stole an entire display full of potato chips and doritos and you *THINK* they  MIGHT  be on drugs?? Shocker man. Shocker."  It'll take me a while to get over the raw humour that is this one.  Maybe Glennis should be a security guard.

      The Glennis and I had a laugh and a joke today. It's like laughing and joking with Jack from The Shining. You never really know when you're going to take an axe full on in the chest.  I wore my suit to work today - it's a new suit, silk lined, which my mother told me in no uncertain words "looks like a bag of shit". Yeeeowza, thanks' mama. I showed her the spot on the jacket where the seam had begun to fall apart (I've had this suit number in months) and she promptly seized the jacket and proclaimed (I shit you not, this was some serious proclaimage) that it was going back.  I hope I get some say in what I get in exchange. Not bloodly likely though. Didn't something like this happen to Norman Bates? (incidently, as a child under the age of 12, wouldn't that have labelled him Master Bates? Isn't that reason enough alone to become a serial killer?)  So today at work, I get there, sit down with the BodherRotor and we discuss. We chit chat about clearance. About Glennis. About the little things that make work work. Conversation over...  Oh and, by the way. He pulls the fucking Columbo on me. I'm gobsmacked as he then details that first interview for the SMD program is *tomorrow*. Say wha? Yeah. That's right. Tomorrow. Here you go - the Management resum - fill that fucker out (Darcy's been working on his for a few weeks - I get one night) and, oh yeah, I need you to fill out this SMD Evaluation and Recommendation form as well, we'll compare it to what I have tomorrow. Gad - fucking - zooks.   So I sat down, converted the pdf into a doc and typed away - I'm not into the whole "Handwriting" thing - it's so very 20th. Worst part is, I'm completely self-horn-blowing. Not really in the business of telling people "yeah, I'm good, here's why". Meh.  We crushed target again tonight - that's always nice.  Then there's the big fat man who tried to steal things. I'm doing my rounds and Dave's there. He looks freaked. He says "Dude, the guy behind you just stuffed about five camcorder batteries down his pants". I turn around. Tubs and Crocket is standing there and he's at least 325lbs if he's an ounce. Black sweat pants. White high tops. Dirty white leafs shirt. Black Mossimo hat (go Zellers!). He's carrying a basket in which we have a single camcorder battery. A quick glance to the display shows a missing set of batteries, about four in total. I attach myself to his hip. Through the store I follow him, he's aware I'm doing it too. He starts to remove batteries from his pants. Disgusting. He's got all of them out and tries to walk out with the basket. One of the girls intercepts him. He goes to pay with a wad of cash, not even counting he says "oh, I don't have enough, I'll be right back, goin out to the car". I follow him outside. He stands outside, in the rain. His phone does not ring. He pulls it out, flips it open and without hitting a button begins a loud conversation. When he is done faking the conversation he turns to face me. I say "Do you have any other unpaid merchandise for which you'd like to pay?". He says "Are you accusing me of theft? What's your name. I want your card. Do you have a card?" To which I reply "Of course I have a card. I'm certainly not giving it to you. Name's on the tag, write it down if you have to." He steps right up to me, his 6'2 to my 5'10. I don't even fucking flinch. The rage is boiling right now, but I'm Kwai-Chang-fucking-Calm. Staring down at me and sweating he says "Are you accusing me of theft?!"  I have a zen like moment. Inside the butterfly in Peking of my right eyelid flaps it's wings and the veritable tempest of laughter nearly erupts out of the New York of my gut. I smile. "Perhaps you're hard of hearing. I asked you a simple yes or no question. Do you have any other unpaid merchandise for which you'd like to pay?"  "You can search me"  "I'd rather not. Yes or no?"  "No."  "Excellent. Have a lovely day. Feel free to come back anytime. I'll be sure to look for you." I stand fast. Fire clearly burns in his piggy little eyes, set so deep in his skull you can barely tell they're blue. His fu manchu moustache quivers as his lip flicks. He's searching desperately for a comeback, neurons firing like batteries of missles over the persian gulf... but... nothing. He squints, rolling the fat of his face together obscuring his ocularies. He turns. He strides off at an impressive pace for a waddler and answers another non-existant phone call. The drizzle falls. I return to my fortress of solitude.  We won. It's a beautiful thing, a phyrric victory sadly, but god damn, it felt good.

       urlLink CNN.com - Gene mutation makes tot super strong - Jun 24, 2004 : "(AP) -- Somewhere in Germany is a baby Superman, born in Berlin with bulging arm and leg muscles. Not yet 5, he can hold seven-pound weights with arms extended, something many adults cannot do. He has muscles twice the size of other kids his age and half their body fat."  What I wouldn't give to get my hands on whatever you use to turn off that protein. This little boy - born to a 24 year old "muscular" sprinter - from a family of muscular people... Could it be evil Nazi experiments trickling down after 50 years? Or Mutation(tm) finally popping up in reality and not just comic books?  I'm in. Hook me up. And find me a phone booth.

      I've had two technical support experiences of late - one with Futureshop's bonfire service, the other with Google's Gmail service. The first - I can't get the songs from Bonfire to play. The download wizard won't download them, the alternate download song won't play. To top it off, they're in WMA format. I think that's the sound of me losing interest. Come ooooooon iTunes. Secondly - Gmail, for some reason I couldn't get gmail to load up though IE on my PC - reason being, the "submit" button didn't show up on login. I add one site (https://www.google.com, oddly enough, not https://gmail.google.com,) and I've got access.  A single email from both companies, one regurgitating the nearly useless FAQ, the other provinding a specific reference to the fix and how to apply it. I'll let you decide which is which.  Strange whacked out dream last night. I was in Niagara Falls, but I was wanted by the Feds. They'd sent someone after me and two of my friends, we escaped in their car, which at the time was towing bottles of explosive gas. I "knew" we'd have to cross the border into the states, but they were watching... so how? That's when I woke up. Bizarre.

      Talking points:  Mary-Kate Olsen has an eating disorder. The world, apparently, is shocked. I hope you aren't, true believers; you're smarter than that.  I've got digital cable on my desktop now - using an ATI all in wonder card - for those of you unaware, ATI is the company that brings you video cards that a) outperform the competition while b) not requiring a breeder reactor to power them. It's cool, it's transparent, I'm wating it through this post.  Political ads on TV are terribly unimpressive - I'm glad that for the most part we've stayed away from the more hardcore mudslinging ads that the Americans have to suffer through. I'd probably vote conservative this year if it weren't for Steven Harper - motherfucker creeps me right out - he's like some kind of fembot - seems  too  smooth. I also get the feeling he'd embarass us on a Bush-like scale at some point. Jack Layton and the NDP are like Homer's view of solar enegery - a pipe dream. Whoops, I take that back - I just got to watch a Liberal ad labelled "Think Twice, Vote Once" - big old slam on the Harperino. Not sure I like that. I think the best thing for Canada at this point would be a minority government with the liberals at the helm. I'd like to see them co-operate with the conservatives to keep them fiscally responsible - seeing taxes drop would not be a bad thing at all. I'm sick of paying, and paying, and paying.  I enjoy creating a schedule for work and then having most of it thrown away without a thought. The three hours of my life that go into creating it really means nothing. *sigh*  I don't like the new Toronto Bluejays logo. It's Harper-esque in its slicknacity.  My HP camera is still sexay.  Euro 2004 is exciting. It's nice to watch both the Italians and the Germans sitting on the sidelines. We shall call them the "Axis of Spectation". We've got England v. Portugal tomorrow. I'll either be very happy or very sad.  I'm tempted to watch The Good, The Bad and the Ugly again. It's three hours... but, oh, those hours.  Finally: Glennis has been uber grumpy of late. I'm torn between trying to cheer him up and trying to piss him off. I'm tempted to bring him some canned goods or something - he's just... gah. What should I do? You've all got my email - discuss.

       urlLink The New York Times > Technology > Advertising: The Internet Ad You Are About to See Has Already Read Your E-Mail : "Frederick Marckini, the chief executive of iProspect, an advertising agency that specializes in search ads, praised this approach. 'There is no commercial application for hate,' he said. 'There are some words that advertisers are not going to want to be associated with.'"  It's interesting that there is no commercially application for hate. Does that, intrinsically, make hate anti-capitalist? The ethics of the cold war loom quietly in a question like that. I miss the Russians and their faceless, actionless evil. With the Russians it was all about cold hard cash, it made it easy to understand and simple to digest. With these mid-east terrorists - "I hate you cause God told me to..." - we're not going to see a crumbling of their Berlin wall. It's hard to see a resolution other than a lot of dirty pool and what some might eventually call Genocide(tm). It's hard when the motivation is religious - the base of most religions is faith - therefore the harder you hit them, the more "faith" it generates, they keep fighting, with the odd effect of redoubling their efforts to annihilate the great satan and the defilers. At that point you really haven't got much choice.   I just woke up from another nightmare. Not pleased about that. I got into my (very dusty) car (which I had apparently left unlocked). Two generic looking bullies (wouldn't you hate to be a generic looking bully?) walked up to me and tried to hold the door open, maintaining that this car was theirs. They pointed to the stuff in the back, which clearly wasn't mine. Bewildered, (yeah, that's right, I was fucking bewildered), I was about to turn the car over to them when I pulled some sort of ID card from the dash and realized it was my car. Hilarity ensued as I drove away, with the door open and these two lads attempting to dislodge me from my seat. Through the streets of San Fransico (what... the... Fuck??) I was being punched and pinched, while I in turn attempted to drive them into oncoming traffic and drop them off around corners by the specious application of physics to their feeble frames. My alarm went off before I could free myself of the second bully. I'd like to think he rolled under a garbage truck.  Nobody covets my ride.

      The Glennis was a joy today. An absolute ray of fucking sunshine. He didn't look me in the eyes once today, just went about his shit, moping, grumping and generally acting like a complete dick. Mike taunted him a little, which is akin to headbutting a jellyfish - I was shocked he didn't get stung.  I didn't get a joke today - which illustrated just how much I need sleep. I've been sleeping really badly over the past few days. That blows.  I feel physically bad, but mentally good. It's a weird fucked up place to be.  Maybe I'll come visit YOU.

On the other hand, some things do. I picked up a 5mb/s Rogers EXTREME modem today. The girl at the desk kept saying EXTREME like the word itself were all capitals and it held the utmost of urgency.  My internet is faster. One might say, were one inclined, that it is faster... to the EXTREME.  I'm going to bed; I'm tired of today.

      Adriano got fired today. He was one of those guys who'd been there for a long time and you didn't ever think he'd get the boot. Boot got gotten, as it were, and he headed - more quietly than I thought he would - into the sunset.  He was a fairly decent guy with a biting sense of humour who could be a complete dick at the slightest provocation. You could say we got along but that would be overstating the situation - I think Adriano merely tolerated people, not sure there was a lot of liking going on.  The Glennis was under the weather today. He kept saying "I feel like a dog's ass" over and over and over. I clamped my mouth shut. "How are you so intimately aware of the nature of the feeling associated with a dog's ass??", "You look/smell/sound like one too!" and "It's probably genetic, what with being a son of a bitch and all..." all died in my throat. He looked miserable enough already.  I had a morality issue at work last night. I caught someone doing something pretty offside and I didn't know what to do about it. I managed to get the situation safeguarded so it hopefully can't happen again, but it's tough to be put between your friends and your job. I don't like that at all.  I just had a meal of chicken and sausage, reheated. I should have taken more time and made something appetizing - that sucked.

It's the 4th of May.... Get it? May the 4th be with you? In any case, when this picture was taken I was in the process of getting the preliminaries of a burn. About an hour later I dropped 50$ US on a leather Indiana Jones hat that I simply had to have. I love that hat. I don't wear it, cause I look rediculous in hats, but it's still a source of pride for me.

      The test server on City of Heroes has posted a beta of the first update - "Through the Looking Glass". I had a chance to check out some of the new content - your hero can now change their look as they grow - that's neat as there are somethings I'd like to change to match my new powers (works with my backstory too). They've also added a character copy tool so I can test out new powers before I take them. I also started my own Supergroup on there - MI-6. Rule Brittania yo. Chances are the server is going to get wiped, but that's quite alright. Oh yes. If you're not playing City of Heroes, you should be. Mwaha.  It rained this morning. I like waking up to the rain on days when I'm working - they call it "Retail Sunshine". It makes me feel good that I don't have the day off.  I was contemplating posting a picture of the Glennis up here, but that could probably be more trouble than it is worth. It's a funny picture mind you, so it's a tough call.

      We've got a few things to tackle here, so you may want to sit down.  First and foremost: My family. Not my mom and dad, they're relatively normal; I speak of the second cousins, the great aunts and uncles, the general malais of folks who are somehow connected to me through some dubious genetic link. I don't see them very often; this is not a problem for me. In every city there is a distinct  right  and  wrong  side of the tracks. I'm not sure if they just had bad luck or if they were drawn to the most depressing part of town (dubbed, appropriately, de-Preston) but they've really nailed the po' white trash thing nicely.   It is interesting that they make some effort to "clean up" for family events - including, but not limited to, anniversaries, funerals, birthdays, christenings and the occasional "Congratulations on your recent Parole" party. This generally implies that all of the men will display their Irish heritage by dressing in dark slacks, white dress shirts and trimming their sideburns. There is an almost uniform appearance to these men: they are short with receding hairlines (curly hair, like Hobbits!), collars unbuttoned so as to intimate some shred of Elvis-like Presle-nacity, and one hand in a pocket while the other one (no Alanis jokes please) gestures wildly in front of them - this uncontrollable hand gesticulation is a distinct feature developed over time by the weighting of one hand, generally with a beer. Sans beer the limb is like a rabid animal. I say all of them men, but I should clarify - these are the blood relations. The relations by marriage, in the male persuasion, are all overly tall, overweight men with moustaches, mullets and pedophile glasses. They have no sense of dignity nor of the appropriate nature of behaviour in relation to the function you're attending. As an example par excellenc I will refer to yesterday's viewing wherein one of these sub-humans had the audacity to comment on the decedents promiscuous nature (four husbands) and mentioning that he would have "hit that" had the opportunity had presented itself. We nearly had a second funeral on our hands - the only thing that prevented it was the inability between my father and I in being able to decide who got to off the jackass.  The women aren't much better. There's a scene in the musical "The Music Man" where a group of ladies perform a song in which their actions compare them to barnyard fowl. It is much the same at family gatherings with the notable exceptions that there is no melody, veritably no humour and the song generally goes on for about three hours.  I needn't mention the young. They make me want to cut my eyes out in shame. Who wears a miniskirt and then doffs their shoes in a funeral home?  I told you this was going to take a while.    The funeral home was the same one in which Rob T was prepared. It was hard to see the room where I'd seen him last. It felt physically heavy to walk through there; smiling funerary employees do their best to put a gentle spin on the process - I have difficulty buying it.  I miss Rob T.   I think I need to shift gears at this point because the morbidity is really chewing at me here. I got my City of Heroes comic in the mail today - interesting. I hope I'm in it someday.  I've started using Windowblinds a little more - and I picked up Desktop X and Object Dock again - they seem to be less buggy this time. You can try them out at  urlLink Stardock.com   I tried out Futureshops new online music service. It crashed.  I'm loving the new camera. I have to start working on Chad's wedding video.  In fact, I'll do that right now.

      It seems like fortune swings back and forth with the occasional hiccup just to fuck with you. Allegorically you could liken this to Foucault's Pendulum (how's that for a segue from the title?) as it behaves before, during and after an eclipse.  I would imagine that not everyone reading this blog knows or remembers what a Foucault Pendulum is. A Foucault pendulum is a lot like any other pendulum that you would find out there; it's a weight attached to a wire. In the case of a Foucault pendulum it is usually a very long wire; this allowed for the pendulum to swing back and forth at a remarkably slow rate. They've got one at the UN.  Here's what makes it unique: There's a universal joint at the top allowing the pendulum to rotate in any direction around it's fixed point as it swings - it'll rotate at the rate of about .2 degrees per minute. Here's the mind bender: the pendulum isn't really rotating - the EARTH is, underneath it, which gives the appearance, yup, you guess it, of a rotating pendulum.  Alright - to the point of the tangent, as it were: During a solar eclipse, the pendulum doesn't rotate as advertised. In fact, according to physicist Maurice Allais, it ripped through a space of 13.5 degrees in 14 minutes during a total solar eclipse. Whacked out - what does that mean for gravity and our planet?  God damn hicup, that's what it means.  So today's been a down day, but suddenly I check my email and... if all goes well, I'm going to be a published author.  Yeah, my article was accepted. Very cool. It's nice to have a slightly bright spot on the evening.

      My happiness at achieving Prestige status at work (and the trappings it brings in the form of a new nametage and business cards) was tempered this afternoon by hearing the news that Pam died this morning. Pam was a close relative and friend - but someone I haven't seen in years. The guilt of disassociation and my general inability to maintain connections over time hurt and continues to hurt. I think it makes me a bad person.  Naturally I have some duties this evening that negate any plans that I had. However, when someone passes on, you have to do the right thing.  I hate myself a little right now.

      Take one Low Budget Sci-Fi Sleeper Hit(tm).  Add Budget.  Garnish with CGI.  Bake for 2 hours.  For flavour add Judy Dench.  Bingo: The Chronicles of Riddick - which, you may be surprised to learn (or not, if you know me at all) I enjoyed. I'm sure that tomorrow morning I'm going to hear it disparaged to the max by P to the Rizzo as it probably didn't contain nearly enough "Art" or "German Expressionism" or some shit that makes a movie incomprehensibly boring whilst similiarly devoid of intellectual stimulation.  To place the Riddickles, as I have come to know them in their proper context in the heirarchy of film I will now elaborate on my popcorn theory.  The popcorn theory is as follows: Should an entire bag of popcorn, when combined with a form of fusion, fail to distract me from the film either through the process of consumption or digestion it is A) a small bag = a film B) a medium bag = a movie or C) a mammoth fucking container dwarfing the very planet which birthed it = a flick.  The Riddickles falls happily and heavily in the category of flick. Were there bad moments? Sure. The option to fade the sounds of asskicking out to music in a certain scene was ill advised and generall disapointing. Did they at all reduce my enjoyment of the flick? Negatory good buddy.  Vinny whups a lot of ass. As an actor, he's built for asswhupping. That's not to say he doesn't have some depth (There are moments here, but if you're interested, check out Boiler Room). But frankly, he really should keep punching, slicing and well, whupping. It makes us happy precious.  I shall tune back in later in the week (well Tuesday) with what the animated Riddickle is like. As soon as I get a chance to play the videogame Riddickle, I'll get back to you on that one too.  If you're looking for a decent place to chuck your buck this weekend - Find somewhere playing your Riddickles. You'll thank me.

However, today I used the words "and that's my final decision" - that coupled with the rather austere look the suit provides, well, I just didn't get questioned. I miss suits.  I'm hungry a lot. Not down and out ravenous, just snack hungry. It's the worst kind of hunger because you know it's just there because you're used to it.

      Woke up at 6:45 in the AM (what does AM stand for anyway? Ante Meridiem while PM is the abbreviation for Post Meridiem. Thank you Google) and I haven't been able to return to sleep since. Inventory was quick last night - getting the file uploaded was not.   I was slightly disappointed that I had to spend the 60th Anniversary of D-Day at work as opposed to spending it with my family. My step-grandfather flew over Greece in World War II - on my dad's side. My Step-grandfather on my mother's side was probably off molesting sheep - not fond of the man, even in death. My real grandfathers? Who knows! On my mother's side he was probably collaborating with the Nazi's - Irish scoundrel that he was. On my father's side - well, I'd like to know. I really would. Maybe some day I'll find out. Needless to say, I'm happy to have the freedoms that I currently enjoy. I (and you) owe a lot to the few.   It puts this terrorism and Al Queda thing in perspective I think. The Nazi's were evil - evil in a BIG way. However, for the most part, from what I can glean from the accounts of those who were there, they'd give you a stand up fight. Neither side had any qualms about using every damned advantage they had, but they didn't strap explosives on their young and send them with cookies to their foes in the name of God. The culture of "The Great Satan" and so on - it's a whole new ballgame. How do you reconcile your differences with a sect of a people who think you're the very devil?   Venus makes a rare transit of the sun tomorrow. In North America we're only going to get to see the tail end of it at 7 in the morning. I guess I'm getting up with my welder's glass again. w00t.  And finally - sometimes a deal comes along that's just too fucking ridiculous to pass up. 5.1 megapixel HP Camera - retail $449. My price after rebate? FREE. Yeah. FUCKING FREE. The docking station is $20 BELOW FREE after rebate. THEY PAY YOU TO BUY IT.  I'm buying one in a few hours. Cause you'd be CRAAAAAZY not to.

      Marvin Heemeyer drove an armoured tank into the Colorado town of Granby. He knocked over the town hall, the library, several police cars and the cement factory that he perceived had wronged him. Then he shot himself.  I don't think this is the last time we're going to see, hear or read about an incident like this. Our democracies are little dictatorships. Our elected representatives lie boldly in the face of facts; campaign promises are forgotten in the face of the slightest opportunity to abandon them. The situation, while much worse in the US, is neither rosy nor charming here north of the border.  People are beginning to realize that they've had enough. I'm not sure if we're going to see a conservative backlash, or a liberal backlash or a non-partisan rage laced backlash, but I think the frustration and powerlessness that many people feel has begun to fester.  Marvin Heemeyer, according to accounts, did his best not to hurt people in his final hours. He simply wanted to lash out in anger at the ediface of government that mocked him. We may not be so lucky next time.

      Still no cash from my paycheck. That's a little aggravating but not unlivable. However it's very apparent how fragile our monetary distribution system is. In the tradition of sounding like a complete alarmist I'm going to keep two weeks wages in cash at home; you really can't trust your bank anymore.  Chad's wedding was quite lovely. I wasn't aware but he and his new wife both have lovely voices. I didn't eat much of the dinner, for some reason I wasn't really hungry.  Tonight is inventory - or "Full count" as it is referred to. That means I'm most likely going to get to work a 14 hour shift. When I scheduled it, I started at 5. Rob has me starting at one.  Sometimes the sheer vapidity of it escapes me.  Then there are times like this. I'm going to break something.

      I felt dizzy looking at my computer screen last night. Really dizzy. As I packed up and prepared to head for bed, I fell over. The room spun. And to add insult to the salt in the wound (mixed metaphor? check) it kept spinning. My head began to pound. I felt like I was going to be sick.  I had a hangover.  Problem is, I hadn't had a drop to drink (double whammy aliteration? check). I crawled up two flights of stairs and knelt before the toilet (note to self, toilet in basement much nicer to vomit in, toilet upstairs has thinner rim, less beneficial to rest head on. Also, less cooling.) I could see in the mirror that I had no colour to speak of, even my freckles had dropped shades becoming a sort of perlescent pink in favour of their usually melatonin orange.  I could not be sick.  I think that not being sick, in the instance where one should be sick, is indeed worse than being sick itself. The grumbling stomach that iterates it's intentions of rewinding the peristaltic process and producing your breakfast, lunch or dinner in an unceremonious presentation (check, check aaaaand check). The nausea that sweeps through every fibre of your being informs you that the sights and smells you are about to encounter should not be witness by those untrained in the medical arts. The heaving, of the dry variety, strips your throat of moisture and your person of dignity. A fine ballet of ghastly gastronomical gestations that births precisely squat. It's one of the most humiliating moments of being human.  I managed to haul myself to bed and ingest a pair of No-Name(tm) brand gravol substitutes which through some act of God had hidden themselve in my bedside table. Two little pink tablets and a pint of water later the room began to slow.  As I got off the Merry-Go-Round that was my perception of the world at that given moment I contemplated what I'd eaten today that varied from days before.  Feta cheese.  It's always the fucking Greeks, isn't it?

      Royal Bank, as some of you may know, appears to have a moth in one of their vacuum tubes (little ENIAC joke for you there) and so I did not get paid today.  Surprisingly enough, it pissed me off. Really there was nothing doing in the whole dealing with it phase, but I chose to embrace the rage in any case.  Meh.

      Interesting way to break into the waking world today. Less pain - no voice.   The dream I just left must have had some significance. I was at a product training - more like a vendor fair. Everyone was quite excited for the stash that was laid out in front of them - like the previous vendor fair there were serious gym bags full of *stuff*. Who doesn't love that kind of thing? I don't know. Someone looking like Bannerman won a PT cruiser - seemed very upset about it because he'd bought another car the week before - sounds like something that would happen to Bannerman too.   Another strange thing - I could read in the dream. Someone named Murray - but not any Murray I know (even the last name was the same - the person wasn't) had to leave early and asked me to take notes for him. He forgot his gym bag - I *read* the tag on it. I've been told (well, my source here is an episode of the animated Batman in which Bats realizes he's in a dream because he can't read the newspaper  - so along with this source - a grain of salt, please) that you can't read when you're in a dream because reading takes place on one side of the brain why dreaming takes place on the other. I'm going to investigate that.   I'm sick of being sick. I really want these tonsils out. Strep every few months sucks.

      Sit down. We've got some stuff to go over and I'd rather not do it twice. &nbsp; First: The last hour has been both enjoyable and excruciating. I was minding my own business playing some   urlLink Dungeon Siege: Legend of Aranna   (you know... Aranna... right?) when I was broadsided by a maternal mastication of magnificently malicious margins. I hate when that happens. Out of nowhere, even on a good day, death, doom and destruction strikes and suddenly I'm the  Great Satan (tm)*. I really wish I had some warning. So I have to bail from DS and go and placate the situation. It'd be like  urlLink Colin Powell  trying to coax  urlLink Osama's  finger off the button. It IS like that. And yet I manage to. It's a tough haul. In the process of these negotiations my throat was stripped of all its moisture setting my recovery back several decades. &nbsp;  *Great Satan is a registered trademark of Islamic Jihaad    &nbsp; Secondly:   urlLink RSS  ,  urlLink  ATOM   and   urlLink Aggregators  . If you read or publish a blog, chances are you've got an RSS/ATOM feed to go along with it. What is an RSS/ATOM feed? RSS stands for&nbsp;Really Simple Syndication - ATOM stands for... uh... truth, justice and home publishing.&nbsp;It's like a ticker tape of your blog (made with this special ingredient - XML - the&nbsp;Colonel's 11 th  spice)&nbsp;which can be picked up by an aggregator.  &nbsp; Essentially this is the way it works - every time you blog, it creates an entry into this file in the same directory as your blogger file. That file is usually called atom.xml* - if you're on blogger. This file can be  subscribed to  in your aggregator so that when changes are made, the aggregator sychronizes and  knows . It saves you wandering to blogs that haven't been updated (I hate that).  *you can change this to anything you'd like.xml  &nbsp; Right now I'm using BlogExpress Reader - first and foremost, it's free. Secondly, it's good - mwaha, price over quality every time. If you read my blog and you've got one of your own - investigate whether you have an RSS or ATOM feed - if you do, email me! If you'd like to subscribe to the feed here it's at  urlLink http://members.rogers.com/grahamw/atom.xml  &nbsp; I've just been told that Lucas is going back to the original trilogy and dressing them up for a new generation. Fucking hell. Hayden in RoTJ. Greedo shooting first. That rediculous Jabba scene in the first one. Random McDiarmid in Empire. I bet Bobba Fett is going to make it out of the Sarlacc pitt unharmed after the credits of RoTJ as well. FUCKING HELL. Glad I've got the originals on DVD already. Yeah, that's right. FUCK YOU MPAA! &nbsp; On that note, the force will be with the one who ends him.

      Today's sojourn through sleep was waylaid by another coughing fit. I was dreaming.     It was an interesting dream in that I'm not sure where elements of it came from. I was paintballing - an event that is to take place on Sunday night at Flag Raiders. However I was indoors in some sort of ice - rink/mall setting - didn't seem like our local mall at the time (which does indeed feature an Ice Rink, oddly enough). The paint was purple. The masks were smelly and uncomfortable, as per usual. Paul (old Paul) shot me in the hand at the same time I shot him in the hand.  At that point I noticed that no one else was wearing a mask - naturally I was alarmed - but from what I garnered this had become standard practice. Fearing for my expensive new eyes, I retreated, though to wear I was unsure; also I found myself steeped in nervousness due to a lack of barrel-plug (spark plugs??) availability (a major Paintball(tm) no-no when not on the field). Suddenly these massive overhead spinning hoses (this shit was not what you'd call a sprinkler) turned on and began distributing an almost Nikelodeon like cascade of purple paint - to the point where I fled to the safety of a small nook behind a collumn. It was at this point that I woke up coughing. Bizarre.    As I usually do when I get ill I woke up drenched in sweat cluntching at the covers screaming for my slain parents. Question the first: When I'm sick, why do I always think I'm Bruce Wayne?    I'm going to attempt to get some more work done on that article I'm writing ( I guess it's rapidly moving from article to "chapter"). Rough draft is due Aug. 1 and I'd hate to disappoint.    Throat's still swollen. I'm hoping, at some point today, to drop my Xbox off to Andrew and have him softmod it while I wait in the car. I dont' want to infect anyone.    Did Bastion's TF in City of Heroes last night. Got laid out like a cheerleader on prom night: Several times by all the boys. Oddly enough INTO and OUT OF debt probably six times during the entire TF. Got a prize I can't use for three levels. *rolls eyes*    If anyone's bored, drop me an IM or an email or a phone call. I can't talk, but I can "mmhmm" with relative ease.

      The difference a letter can make, eh?  So I've just returned from the Doctor's office wherein I was informed that I do indeed have strep throat again and this time, them tonsils, they gots to go. Great. More surgery.  As of right now I sit here with the following  A headache A mouthful of spit, cause it hurts to swallow A sore throat (duh) A pair of swollen glands on my throat The feeling of some ghostly amorphous hand reaching through my person and squeezing each joint as if it would yeild the blessed fluid of life and a bottle of antibiotics which should apparently make me better.  I now need to go and manufacture some sort of lunch through the consumption of which I shall find both sustinence and the time to take the aforementioned pills.  Then I'm going to hit myself in the head with a rock until consciousness flees from me like any poor sap who finds himself wandering alone in the first few minutes of any episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent.

      I sound like a muppet. My throat has once again swelled to the point where the sides nearly touch each other. Otherwise I feel fine, just my ears and throat in agony. How often does this have to fucking happen before our fine medical professionals realize that my tonsils need to be extricated and shipped to Iraq as some sort of weapon of biological mass destruction?? Christ almighty. My file is nearly four inches thick, 90% of it to do with various throat related ailments - LET IT END NOW! If this keeps up I'm going to grab a fork and do it myself. Yeah, that's right.  Doom 3 has gone gold. I remember nearly, what, 12 years ago when I pirated Doom for the first time. That, Doom 2 and Duke Nukem 3D were the most downloaded files off of any BBS. When I'd reached the holy grail of the internet - nearly 11 years ago - well, it was like a deep ocean of piracy wherein one would leap and bask upon the sands of IRC. Times have changed, they paved paradise, but there are still the lovely little Phillip K. Dick-like tanning booths/memory salons of Bit Torrent and the like. Hi speed sure is a lot higher. Needless to say Doom3 looks good. I shall be... picking it up.  Andrew's going to softmod my Xbox. I think. If I can ever get him to do it.  I've rescheduled all my meetings for today and I'm going to try to trade off my shift with someone. After all, would you like to address your managerial concerns to someone who sounds like Earnie from Seasame Street? Or Kermit the Frog - depending on my throat's disposition at the given moment. I may take up yodelling. Turning my head hurts. I hate all of you with healthy bits and pieces.

      My back has crunched itself into a slinky like compressed unit - it makes a sound delectably close to that of a certain breakfast cereal featuring three spritly elves. In short, the jet-skiing was fun. I will buy one of these.  The weekend went well, I enjoyed it. It looks as if the SuperUser(tm) community will actually mean something. I brought up several concerns that were addressed immediately, I nearly fell out of my chair on that one.  I managed to catch a cold - my throat hurts. Yesterday was the left side, today is the right. I'm glad my throat is an equal opportunity purveyor of pain.  I've been watching a lot of Bruce Timm's Batman: The Animated Series. It's nearly 12 years old - I had no idea. It's gorgeous. I love it.  That's all for now.

      I could almost hear the imperial march as the phone clicked on and the Glennis answered - he's back, with, or potentially without a vengeance. either way, he's there. My interview has been moved up to 1:45. So I'm off to get get scrubbed, get a hair cut and just generally make myself look pretty. Knock on wood y'all.

      I've been asked to clarify a few tidbits.  The Glennis - has gone man down. Neither hide, nor hair has been seen of our gorilla-like compatriot. There is a great deal of sympathy for him right now, because he may actually be promoting his way out of his marriage. He's got some sort of issue focusing - everything he's doing right now is leading him in a downward spiral. It wouldn't be remiss to say that he probably requires counselling and perhaps an elephantine does of some sort of drug ending in "-ac" or "-ax". When will he return? That's akin to asking "will it snow in Turkey tomorrow?" - damned if I know.  Secondly, in the past I have referred to The Glennis as an "Asshat". I was asked "if one were in the market for an Asshat, would one be searching for an Anal Haberdasher?" (A haberdasher, for those unawares, is a purveyor of fine hats and headgear). A wise, informed and self-indulgently intelligent question to ask. The answer, of course, is yes. Where do you find one of those? Ask your local Glennis.

      I was pretty close to right on the button when I named this thing - I simply can't sleep tonight. Got about three hours from 1-4 and that's about it.  Glen didn't come into to work Sunday. That led to all sorts of interesting things Sunday night - some things that I really shouldn't go into here, cause GOD DAMN the situation is screwed up. I end up having most of my day annihilated and the following day bites it as well because they need me to close. We show better results then we ever have on a Monday but it still wasn't enough to actually be classified as "good". Dan called it "the curse of the Glennis", I said we probably shouldn't speak ill of the dead.  Open box and clearance are goind well - we found out that one of the London stores was cheating - faking their results by manipulating the system - made me feel better about our current standing. Dennis called Tom a blowhard during our last conversation - I can see that point of view after I was "given the gears" today. I simply nodded and listened as he distributed information with what can only be described as a "wry smile" on his face. 90% of what he said was good, but I'm not going to put a shit eating grin on my face and lick his asshole for the other 10%. It needs fixing? C'est bon, let us fix.  I've got my SMD interview on Thursday - that's exciting. I've also got the details for a $400,000 sale in the works too - hope that goes through.  Spider-Man 2 the game is religious. *thwip* waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah *thwip* - lather, rinse, repeat for flavour.  City of Heroes is lovely. I'm level 26 now - I've got a new power that assaults small groups of villains - goes off like a little bomb with great range. I like.  I bought Batman the Animated Series Season One - god I loved that show. I've missed it. Kinda freaked me out to see I look a little like Bruce Timm - I guess I always expected him to be a pastel pink with a square jaw and two lines for eyes.  We've got paintball and soccer being organized through work. I've also been drafted into the Joint Health and Safety Comittee - as if I didn't have enough to do.  The fun never stops.  Never. Fucking. Stops.

      On the way home tonight I happened upon an elderly couple treking along townline road with a gas can in their hands. Six cars barrelled by them. I pulled over to the side of the road. Exiting my car I asked them if they needed help.  They did.  A quick trip and a jaunt down the 401 later we've got some gas into their car. I refused money, but they refused to get out of my car until I took ten bucks from them.  See, here's the thing. The ran out of gas ten yards from a sign readin "Next Service Station 46km".  That was the NEXT service station.  After the one 500 yards away.  I felt *so* bad for them.

      Some things I didn't touch on.  The Glennis has been in a right mood of late. He's been all raincloudy and so on. He did something delightful today and went behind my back and "tattled" on me - for something rather rediculous that I didn't even realize was a problem. As soon as I was made aware of it, the common sense solution presented itself and I rectified the issue - problem would have been solved if he'd just talked to me, instead he breeds bad blood.  I brought him a few slices of pizza. A few reasons behind this - when someone does something nice for you when you've been a dick you feel extra guilty. Secondly, it will let him know that even though he's being a dick, it doesn't have to be that way.  He's intimated to several people that there are problems at home. This is not the sort of thing we make fun of (nonfunctional testicles notwithstanding). His wife really needs to get with the program, he's got needs too.  Okay, I need to stop that line of thought now.  Spider-man 2 the game rocks. Plain and simple. Go play it.  The outline for the article I'm doing for Massively Multiplayer Gems (2) has been greenlighted. Woo. PUBLISHED AUTHOR BABY! (assuming my drafts don't suck)

      It's been an interesting week. I spend altogether far too much time at work.  The SMD thing is going well so far, I think. What it has done is destroy any chance that I might have to get away - creating an environment of hatred and rage towards me from a variety of friendlike sources. I'm sure Jeff and Liz aren't speaking to me at all right now. I blame that entirely on Rob. I'll get a day off soon, I swear it. BY GRABTHAR'S HAMMER!!   Zounds. City of Heroes debuted the first expansion. It's sexier than a room full of Leeloo's. I can *fly* while I'm *invisible*. Woo. I feel very  uber .  I bought the Megaman Collection. It's kicking my ass. I thought I'd gotten better at videogames - in reality they've just become easier. Oh the ego, it hurts.  Speaking of hurting, with all the god damn exercise I've been getting lately, I'm hurting, and I'm growing some kind of tissue all around my body.  I think it's called muscle. I'll have to ask one of the non-geeks at work.

      Alright, here's the breakdown after two weeks of not being here:  Doom 3 is out. Path of the Shell (Uru: CC) is phenomenal. Mysterium was a hell of a lot of fun. I got promoted to SMT.  In short, life's beautiful.  I've got to go feed my love-rocket to some flaming skulls, pardon me if I'm gone for a while.
