      I was recently awarded the SOM traveling fellowship, which involves my proposal to  take a trip around the US in an RV, parking in Walmarts to document and learn more about urban sprawl.   I have yet to find a convincing argument for or against sprawl.  Naturally I have a harder time being convinced that urban sprawl is good, although I have read plenty that make undeniable links to urban sprawl as good or not so bad thing.    At this point I do not have a clear objective.  Part of the reason I am opening up the discussion is to gather focus on certain areas involving urban sprawl.

      Portland is probably the best example of a highly programmed city.  The government has taken the initiative to guide growth within strictly drawn boundaries and access to public transportation is regarded as a high priority.  In many ways it has been seen as a model city for smart growth, although my question would be, what's next?  In cities such as Boulder, CO, a green belt lines the perimeter of the city to maintain a border of growth, but as land prices rise, poor neighborhoods are forced to the other side of the green belt.  These extended neighborhoods are disconnected from the city, creating new pockets of sprawl.  Controlling Sprawl in Boulder: Benefits and Pitfalls, Pollock, Peter  urlLink http://www.asu.edu/caed/proceedings98/Pollock/pollock.html   So what's the solution?    I am a little shocked at Kristoff's response, stating 'Architects are only tools in the hands of developers. Its who holds the purse strings that creates this world and its infrastructure.'  In other words, those who positions of economic power, create this world and its infrastructure.  This may be true to some extent,  but this problem of urban sprawl cannot be fixed with any amount of money.  There is no end to the orbits in which economic growth and urban sprawl follow.  Can you believe a single idea can transform the way people live their lives around the world?  The Industrial Revolution was sparked with a simple idea.  Change involves ideas.  Those who have ideas are those who hold the power to shift visions.

      CW, You mentioned NYC and Portland Oregon as two smart growth cities.... I recognize NYC as one but that is mainly a virtue of being on a series of islands... sprawl simply can't happen. What is it about Portland that makes it a smart growth city?

      Growing up in Texas there was a keen awareness for me of the brutal oppression that is parking lots. If the mall or the wall-mart (or whatever equivalent) can be considered the castle of commerce... the parking lot is a moat of despair. God help you if you can't find parking close to the castle, because in Texas the sun beating down on that black asphalt is unforgiving. It is possible to suffer heat stroke just trying to get to the indoors from the parking hinterland. We live in a consumptive society that's all about TAKE TAKE TAKE.... and there's no concept of giving anything back. Once upon a time, before the parking lot there was an *ECO-SYSTEM* where things moved in a complete cycle... There may have been grass that a cow ate, then shat upon which fertilized the grass that the cow ate and so on... That cow didn't know it but it was giving back just as much as it was taking... In our natural state we do the same, we breath out carbon dioxide that trees need who then breath out oxygen. Instead of completing a cycle in our building process we work in incomplete semi-circles... We create huge amounts of waste that do nothing for any ecological concerns. Parking lots of that magnitude are wasteful in just about every sense. Waste of space, wasteful in that there can be no relief from heat that trees and grass provide, even the desert has more opportunity for heat relief... They're wasteful in that rain water (which is distilled water) is so polluted after running off the oil slicked asphalt that its completely useless... and the water runs off so fast, there is no where for it to be absorbed so it over taxes the rainwater collection systems that townships have... Its wasteful in that it destroys the ecosystem that keeps our planet in balance... And in what capacity do these moats of despair give back to our own environment... And I'm not talking about trailer parties.... Kickin' it in the back of an RV doesn't count, as fun as that sounds. As damning as I sound in all this its not the Architects fault per say, its the result of a short sighted economy that's focused on short term gains that sound like "Take take gimme gimme. " Architects are only tools in the hands of developers. Its who holds the purse strings that creates this world and its infrastructure. And our economy cares less about our grandkid's way of life than about quarterly gains. Yes man has failed, we are the ultimate rapists. We have been pissing upstream from our drinking well and we may see in our lifetime a generation who has to bear the cost of that irresponsibility. Resigning in cynicism by saying we'll all die in the process of evolution is a total cop-out. Then why bother to get up in the morning? Why champion civil rights? Why fight for women's rights? Because this life is worth living to its fullest while we are here, and its worth making it better for those after us, not worse.

      Much of the discussion surrounding urban sprawl has been focused on smart growth.  Smart growth can loosely be defined as a program which encourages less stratified, higher population densities.  New York has been hailed for its ability to maintain a high population density as well as several highly concentrated economic centers.  Other regions labeled with smart growth such as Portland, have done exactly that.  They have grown strategically to lessen the burden of civilizations on themselves and on nature.  These strategies provide better public transportation, better communities, and a lesser environmental impact.  Yet this vision of growth remains.  It is continually fuel by our way of life, only to encounter small patches of relief.  We’ve been digging deeper into our hole, never looking upwards to see that we can’t dig ourselves out even if we dig slower.  What I find troubling is that growth is part of the vision we continue to live.  On one hand the global populations footprint can be seen nominally if you count the surface area occupied by humans, hence the fear of physical overpopulation seems far fetched.  On the other hand the measured impact of humans on global warming IS A FACT.  It seems many remain delusional and content, thinking it is still an issue up for debate.   We are nature.  We live and die, but our impact on the survival of other species is a responsibility we are unable to fathom.  Some claim “survival of the fittest”, as the justification of our dominance over other species and their elimination.  Evolution is not simply the survival of the fittest; it is also the growing diversity of the various species which inhabit our space.  The elimination of diversity is de-evolution.

      Everything is “familiarity.”  There is no “exotic.”  What is the significance of a stretch of earth untouched by human hands? ”unspoiled” is a term I hear so often exalting “nature” left free of man’s mark.  We are “nature.” We’ve set ourselves apart from our identity. We’ve denied the connection for so long we lack proper language. to allow for exploration of this simple fact that we are animals, a vital and justified species of/on this planet.  Every atrocity we’ve committed against ourselves (in our childish play with earth) is a part of the natural progression of life.  I think we are in a process of evolution, of the mind.  Free of “resignation, acceptance, damnation, forgiveness,” or any word denoting a failure in man, we will find ourselves loosed from the paradox of deciding ourselves unfit to judge.  We will recover a life much easier to live. We will come to a more lasting “freedom in familiarity.”

      Urban sprawl perversely affects both the built and natural environments.  To address the problems correctly, it is first necessary to understand the procedure in which it takes place both locally and globally.  There have been studies which show the global effects of sprawl through streams of politics and economics.  Several models have proven accurate in portraying diagrammatic links of cause and effect, yet have not been able to apply itself as an evolving strategy which incorporates participating individuals.   The ultimate downfall to any urban strategy is its reliance on programs.  Programs by definition are instituted to counter the norm.  For example, the problem of littering is countered by programs of street sweepers.  Littering is not lessened but rather bandaged to appear less severe.  Such programs divert attention into directions which provide relief but no solution.    There are approximately 2.8 million Americans who live full-time in motor homes, campers and trailers.  Through urban sprawl, the landscape of America has become homogenized and regional differences are being abolished.  People often visit exotic destinations (i.e., The Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls), yet many seek and congregate around the familiar (i.e., Walmart, Kmart).   There are particular RVers who participate in an ironic cycle of traversing the American landscape while parking overnight in Walmarts.  In some ways it seems like a perfect marriage.  The RVers park for free, and Walmart benefits from their patronage.  The aberrant irony is found in the homogeneity of the identical Walmarts strategically positioned across the entire asphalt-scape.  As one RVer put it, “consistently, wherever I go, a Walmart is a Walmart.”  This is said in the most approving tone.   Their destinations revolve around Walmarts, which they have no problem finding in the Rand McNally Walmart road atlas, which highlights every Walmart in the nation, of which there are over 3000.

      Could desktop architecture free us from the constraints of being embedded in the infrastructure of the landscape?  Desktop publishing and independent film making are beautiful ideas that have manifested as examples of accessible technology.  The idea of desktop architecture isn’t so far fetched.  The technology exists.  Laser cutting, cnc milling, stereolithography, and other emerging technologies are becoming everyday technologies.  Remember when a color printer was not a consumer item?  Can you imagine “printing” a remote control on  your desktop?  The 3D printer with embedded circuitry is here, and soon will be next to your color printer.    urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/09/24/wow.tech.santa.printer/   Computers and it’s many digital formats have made it possible for a home computer user to speak the same language of manufacturers of all scales.     How will these accelerating technologies merge with our needs for sustainability?

      The revolution after the Industrial has made it possilble for people to create virtual communities, publish independently, etc. This do-it-yourself trend has the potential to grow on a larger scale towards sustainability, where the 'create-your-own home/community' user-technology interface would be grounded in sustainability. Your project could set an example of not only the need for sustainability (which includes the end of sprawl) but it could inspire a new constructive interaction between the D.I.Y. mindset and the industrial industries, including the building industry. I think the success of the technological revolution towards home-publishing, independent filmmaking and the like are the carefully designed interfaces between the user and the technology. Perhaps you could explore this in your research to take it to an architectural scale.

      Sustainable architecture is catching on.  Take Cesar Pelli’s buildings in Battery Park City.    ”The green high-rise residential building 20 River Terrace is the first to be designed under an ambitious set of new building guidelines developed by the local Battery Park City Authority in New York. These guidelines have been developed to create a full-fledged environmentally friendly precinct within the city.”  urlLink http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/documents/pdfs/32679.pdf   So we’re still in the midst of government programs catching on.  Many environmentalists argue that it is economically advantageous for corporations to become “environmentally friendly”, so would it be such a bad for a new trend of being self sustainable  to emerge?  The first argument against my own question would be, that no one could have predicted the state of self annihilation we find ourselves living, when the industrial revolution was first catching on.

      why and how does the AIA stifle any possibility of advertisement or pro-active aquisition of clientel...? why must sprawl/growth continue? why cant you demolish what is there? do you mean you cant reverse the damage done?  to decide that one day the answers will be found (within this culture) and the mode of life that we chose will have no ill effects on us and our environment seems absolutely absurd....  our understanding, of even ourselves,  is so incomplete how can we ever propose to know any one way to build/live that will be "right" the largest atrocity this culture has inflicted upon itself is the lacking diversity of every form of life. it seems to me the proposed  sustainable architecture will be just as stifling when it catches on and is mobilized as govt./social programs.

      Wow CW, those are some awesome remarks you recieved there from some of the biggest American architects... Well done.   So are you shocked my what I said because I exposed some lack of vision? Or was it that I seemed cynical about how the world works...  I agree, Those with the Ideas have the power in this world because they have the future in their hands. True. Ghandi defeated the wealthiest country and most powerful navy in the world with his idea, his commitment to that vision and his actions consistant with that vision. Those are the three things needed to make a difference. Commitment, Possibility, and Action. An Idea alone doesn't make a difference.   Sprawl is a powerful force, even more powerful than the British military that Ghandi faced. I have a problem with our destructive relationship to nature, and sprawl is a great symptom of that relationship. I read Ishmael in High School and became so vocal about the ideas expressed in that book that I became despised by that administration and eventually thrown out. I didn't care... All I knew was that I was going to find a way to transform our relationship to our natural environment, even if it killed me.  There is no reason, with all the technology we have today that we can't transform our relationship to nature from one that is parasitic, to one that is symbiotic.   So when I muse about how wealth controls growth, I speak in the memory of Nicola Tesla who was backed by JP Morgan. He was building a shooter that took the electricity that resides naturally in the earth's crust out to the ionisphere. From there we could draw all of our electricity needs. Morgan loved the Idea, and many others that Tesla had ( AC instead of DC, remote control, internal combustion engines...). But once Morgan realized that he couldn't put a meter on that system of natural electricity, he pulled the plug on the project. Now we are left with big heavy and cumbersome systems that waste space, pollute, and are prone to blackouts just so profits can be made.   Cynical? If I stopped there, Yeah I would be. But I see the value of profits in this capitalistic society we've created, so I strive to cause this transformation while including that mindset. Besides, the new economies that could arise out of transforming our relationship to nature could be extremely profitable. So instead call me a skeptic. Skeptics want to know the cost of everything, Cynics know the value of nothing.    I talk about the power of wealth to transform, because i'm considering who must be inspired by the new possibility to bring forth the reality of an idea. Average people have to be inspired to desire such symbiotic dwellings, and the financeers who fund projects have to be inspired by the profits and the positive contribution to society. I should modify my claim that Architects are tools in the hands of developers, and say that they have been recently. There is so much focus on making things look pretty or funky and spatial juxtapostition of [Criticality] that they've alienated people with practical concerns. A great NYT article had the headlines to the effect that mortar isn't all that architects lay on thick. Architects have become the sophists of our time. No wonder these "great thinkers" have been passed up by walmart for someone who is practical and capable to get the job done without jargon and with profit in mind.   See, the way it works, the AIA has stifled any possibility of advertisement or pro-active aquisition of clientel. Somehow its honorable to just sit back and wait for the clients to roll in 'cause they like ya. So what is created in that space is a situation where the client comes to you and says here's what I want. This even happens to the big names, Richard Miers clients are rolling in saying "I want a white house and a flat roof". Puff Dady rolls into Miers office saying "I want a white house in the hamptons so that everybody can where white to my parties". So then Mier makes him what he wants. What needs to happen if we are to counter the trend of sprawl and get your ideas out there is to be able to cruise up to clients and say 'This is what you want, need and desire'. Until then, the people who do the wanting aren't going to know anything different than what they allready want.   What does this have to do with your focus on urban sprawl? Well i've avoided specific solution because i'm the big picture type. If we can get into the manual that all sub-urban sprawl builders use and tinker with that standard we can alter the results. We can't demolish what is already there, but we can alter the pattern of growth and development. Starting at the source of the problem will have a greater impact on the results. The source is the financeers who develope these projects (supply) and the people who buy into them (demand). Supply and demand are the key aspects to any economy along with land labor and capital. The results can be transformed into whatever you dream it to be. If you inspire the suppliers and demanders to strive towards your vision anything is possible.

      Chris makes a really interesting point.   It may take some convincing that Walmart is doing good, but in fact as a model of distribution, it is the best in the world.  It has been and remains the number one company in the fortune 500 listing.  It’s bare bones merchandise distribution is highly admired by corporations.   I think the idea of just-in-time production can be pushed even further to a localized level of the individual.  There have been recent products such as a refrigerator that knows when to order food. It tracks the food remaining in the refrigerator and orders food over the internet. Products such as the smart refrigerator could be coupled with grocery providers of choice, i.e. freshdirect.com, according to the product.  For example, eggs, from the local egg distributor, milk from the milkman in the next town, and bananas from Costa Rica.  There are other obvious extensions, such as a printer that knows when to order new ink and paper.  It is merely a matter of networking individual consumption with local and global distribution.  The link can happen through products that take these existing networks and providing the interface for individuals to take control.   The dilemma is in the hard facts of our relentless method of consumption, which could only accelerate with an efficient distribution network.  Is there a way to curb the way we consume as the cycles of production, consumption, and waste become closer knit?   urlLink http://www.lgappliances.com/demo.html   urlLink http://www.enn.com/news/wire-stories/2000/12/12232000/krt_toilet_40958.asp

      Hi people. I hope i'm not intruding with this non-arts-related post. I found  urlLink this article  (www.medscape.com/viewarticle/464688) today on medscape.com. There's not much to the article, since it's pretty short and full of quotes, but I figured it would at least be an interesting read. The link above takes you to the medscape website, which requires a (free) account to read articles. For those who don't want to sign up, I've conveniently copied the page (yes, against their terms-of-use, but what the hey)  urlLink on my site (x.quartertone.net/urban_sprawl.html).

      In regards to what your trip in April will involve, I think that it could serve as a study on the chain store as a potential 'network' that can be utilised in a similar way that the internet was adapted for the public before it was focused towards consumers. We know that Walmart is extremely efficient in its inventory, and that shipments are made every day from nodes of production and/or storage in order to supply only those shelves that need restocking, all due to computerized tracking of each product offered. We also know that more and more Walmarts are being built at an alarming rate in America alone. Can this network of production and distribution be integrated with the nomadic RV social group somehow to create a sustainable existence?

      As cw says, the problem is not efficiency of production, but our mentality of consumption.  Consumption is a mode of being that is taught to Americans (and the americanized) at an alarmingly young age by the media, our school system, and (this is the most dangerous and daunting) our parents.  The ideas are embedded in our culture.  I feel that we need educational reform and alternative research to combat this widespread disease.  Our efficiency should be focused on establishing and offering alternatives rather than on putting efficiency into the hands of profiteers.

      Is it possible to successfully limit our consumption? With the need to survive turned from hunting for food and shelter to hunting for a job (to earn the abstracted form of sustenance).... the more you have the safer you are.  The connection seems primitive and set deep within our collective conscience… but with these tendencies seeming to turn on us... making us fat, lazy, stupid and depressed... a desperate trend towards a more efficient way of life takes hold.  We damn ourselves for not being machines.... for having whims and irrational tendencies.  Those characteristics having also spawned from guilt... the cycle continues leaving us fat but unfulfilled.  If we were to be more accepting of our culture, then our consumption, waste, ignorance and fear would give way to a more productive and mutually beneficial way of life.  Whether that is through the individual's use of stainable architecture, biodegradable products, (produced by sweatshop-free labor), organic or free-range products... the change must come from within. Governmental regulations and mass media serve only to damn individuality, initiative and life. Their power is derived from our acceptance of fear and guilt as driving forces.  It seems now they turn our thoughts to self-immolation .... you must die for these products you love, and it will be painful and you deserve it.  In believing that hype we are consumed and immobilized by guilt, creativity falters and we find our selves escaping to a virtual world for self-expression and identity. The tangible world is made evil… so full of man’s desires made real, their forms mostly imposing, incomplete and expressive of an immature, schizophrenic society. Virtual reality is man’s creation, but sterile and safe in its anonymity. There is little chance to get dirty and complete control within this box. I am wary of this media, recognizing the opportunities and knowledge so readily available… it seems this wealth of information serves not to expand but instead to shrink our universe of understanding. Life is lost in the translation. All of this world must fit into a select few formats and programs… a very limited way to begin a way of life. We program ourselves to comprehend and function in a (real and virtual) world not made for the individual. We do this willingly, painfully and/or (un)consciously.  We buy, sell, work and pray to fit better into something, anything, as long as it is not our selves. Instead of consuming finished products we must utilize them as tools and raw materials. Every thing man-made, living or not, is an opportunity for self-exploration. Using materials smarter and re-creating products suited better for our individual purposes would lessen consumption, waste and lead to greater satisfaction with society.

       urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/business/yourmoney/11show.html   I just finished reading an article in the New York Times titled, “ urlLink Car Dealerships Face the Great Homogenization: by David Wethe .”  The article covers the branding of auto-dealerships.  The trend in major auto corporations is essentially to entice auto-dealerships to build single-brand architecture to convey a brand image.  My initial response as I read the piece was negative, as the article continued to stress the burden of a homogenous image.  It would be disheartening to see another onslaught of franchises spread across the asphalt-scape, yet I welcome the dealership branding movement.  From my personal experience, I have yet to see an architecturally distinguished dealership.  Prefabricated or not, they pretty much look the same, Volvo or Ford, they all have similar experiences.  The auto manufacturers have finally caught on.  Display cases sell. Architecture sells.  From the consumer’s point of view, the experience of purchasing a vehicle is sold with images through advertisements, so the dealerships of today are dropping the ball with their bland showrooms offering coffee and donuts as ambiance and atmosphere.  The new dealerships charm shoppers with an image through an architecture that shouts.  Hummer’s stand alone dealership features an off-road course complete with mud, logs, and steep inclines.  There is no doubt those who purchase an H2 from the new industrial-look Hummer showrooms will feel tingly each time she or he drives past the birthplace of their baby.   	It has happened before and it will happen again.  The little people with their family owned businesses will be forced out by big businesses and each suburban gathering will have all the familiar clumps of plastic signage glowing bright luring shoppers to buy things they never knew they needed.  Is this the way of things to come, or will corporations build local franchises that morph and reshape according to local forces?  The malleable nature of water allows for outside forces to change its course.  If franchises could be more sensitive and malleable, they would be more profitable and desirable.  Do they listen?  Have we spoken?  Do the masses desire the familiar?

      The general sentiment about urban sprawl here is that it is a good thing because of the network of familiarity and convenience that it offers to comfort-minded transients, and that it is a bad thing because it is a shining example of everything that is wrong with corporate globalisation. One thing I picked up from the RVers interviewed in the film "This Is Nowhere" is that every part of America, especially around Walmart which is usually situated on a strip mall, looks the same. This makes it hard to remember all the different places visited, and in an anti-globalisation point-of-view it is guilty of slowly wiping out the variety of ancient cultures in various countries. I think it is important to remember Che-Wei's attitudes towards design, which he expressed quite well in his writing about car dealerships. One of the most important ideas I learned about from Pratt was from John Lobell, when he spoke about how the digital age is a step up from the industrial age in terms of production. He said that the industrial age was characterized by mass production of the same thing over and over at an extremely efficient and economic rate which made products available to many people. He then foresaw that the potential of the digital age could make it possible to turn out variations of the same thing at the same pace and efficiency of production that the industrial age offered. This idea has been explored beautifully through Haresh's work with Milgo/Bufkin, which he likes to call an exercise in "mass customization". The question I'm leading up to is, can the modular/morphological ethic of design be a solution to an otherwise bland and dominating landscape?

      I think it is essential that when we talk of a new tribalism, the methods of connectivity are reconsidered.  It is also important to note that all virtual modes of interactivity lead to the eventual physical connection or remain as a simulation of what is physical.  Physical interaction may always be the quickest, strongest, and the most familiar, but greater leaps of interaction take place through the internet and other modes of interaction.  Anti-Global and anti-big box sentiment is abundantly expressed over the internet. The internet provides a platform for individuals who are not physically connected to create their own community.  As the global economy pushes for a more homogenous landscape, the physical limitations between our experiences become less relevant because we all live under similar conditions.  We live in our fragmented suburbs, connecting only by identifying with a tribe or with multiple tribes based on our common interests and / or our common enemy.  Take for example (among many others)  urlLink againstthewal.org .  This website organizes people from all around the country to meet physically to exchange thoughts and to protest Wal-Mart policies.

      Chris, your vision is a beautiful one.  In light of your response, I take back what I said earlier about nomadic societies having less of a tangible identity than domestic ones.  It must be a personal bias.  The tribal activities that we encounter in the animal kingdom also tend to be nomadic, even if they occupy territories.  It seems like the closer one is to sustainance survival the more likely is a strain of nomadism.  Another typical (and false) assumption I've made is that Tribal identity is a distinctly human activity.  I guess it all goes back to the question of animal consciousness and where we draw boundaries between the self-aware being and the embedded being which is never conscious of its actions.  I hate that question, but somehow it seems relevant.  Can you elaborate on ways that one might earn a living on the road?  You mentioned the internet - does that mean we're only talking information-based services, or do you include freelancing and such?  Could we achieve nomadic sustainance by subverting the postal system and creating 'free' or 'barter' delivery services?  I'm fascinated by the idea but I can't really tell where you're taking it.

      I appreciate very much the commentary that Che-wei has provided about the sprawl he has encountered, and I offer simply an idea that I could only have been inspired to on the road. For one, I love living nomadically and it has surpassed my expectations in many ways, yet the expense of it is evasive of most of my peers and contemporaries. So the challenge I have placed upon myself is to devise a self-sustaining lifestyle based on the comforts of technology I have encountered along the way, either in theory or in person. Walmart, for example is the perfect building block for such an existence. You arrive with your home, and immediately you have access to groceries, clothing, media, auto repair and supplies, seemingly everything you could possibly need to get through to the next day. One thing that's missing is access to the back-and-forth stream of information we currently know as the internet, which would ultimately provide a means for providing services, even locally, and receiving compensation in return that could be used at an everything-stop that we typically associate Walmart with. One company, that seems to provide everything to RV'ers that Walmart does not, is Flying J's, which is actually more geared to truckers. Flying J's offers free water and dump stations, wi-fi access as well as general internet access, showers, laundry machines, restaurants, telephones, restrooms, 'general merchandise' and the next best thing to a post office, all under the same roof. It's true, combining Walmart and Flying J's would make for a more transient, unkempt crowd, but it would provide just the type of network that a nomadic, 'working' person would need. Which brings me to my next point, that this everything-store could exist primarily off this new sub-class, that it would be policy for every RV'er, every travelling work-from-home businessman/inventor/artist, every trucker/familyman/ebay-enthusiast would willingly give a small amount of their time and effort into the sustaining of these nodes of commerce/culture/freespace to the point that they existed entirely on volunteerism, simliar to a co-op, but remarkably on different volunteers on a day-to-day basis. So I've personally undertaken the task of designing this system of transient units and accomodating nodes of contemporary sustainable nomadic living in the hopes that I might be able to live in such a way at some point in my life, hopefully before the ever-receding promise of retirement, ideally as a 'professional', possibly raising a family through home-schooling, travelling with a tribe of roving units, able to survive as just one, always happy to contribute and provide for the stable communities I encounter, and always travelling, which is the best part of this trip with Che-wei and Jeanee: going different places, getting to know different people, learning all kinds of things about history, humans, myself, the land, the wild... For me, travelling is the way to go.

      Albuquerque, NM Flagstaff, AZ Las Vegas, NV Henderson, NV San Bernardino, CA Los Angeles, CA  It seems, given the opportunity, every city in this country will sprawl.  Albuquerque, Flagstaff, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and its neighboring Henderson all have accelerated in claiming the flat landscape.   The intersections of major freeways are now the points of interest instead of city street corners.    In the past these sprawling cities must have seemed like growths with no end in sight.  Today some peripheries have reached natural boundaries forcing development in new directions.  Henderson is a typical bedroom community with commuting traffic to Las Vegas via the oversaturated outer loop freeway.  The loop itself is functioning beyond its capacity like a clogged artery.  New developments are being built without restrictions, taxing the freeways even further.  Los Angeles and its growing suburbs continue to create new cities with the same strip of retailers every so often.  Could Wal-Mart make the difference?  Could Wal-Mart re-organize the landscape of suburbia? As a major supporter of suburban communities, Wal-Mart is essentially the town center.  In some cases it can divide a city by placing several Wal-Marts on the outskirts of the city, reconfiguring local regions according to their distance to the closest Wal-Mart.  The problem with Wal-Mart as a town center is that it obliterates the importance of the town center, by re-signifying the program as a shopping center (often paving the way for other large retailers to join nearby, in which case the shared parking lot becomes the town center).  Although it seems appropriate for the accelerated consumerism of this culture, communication within a community is lost, therefore sprawl and the distancing of communities physically and emotionally follows predictably.     California has fought Wal-Mart’s attempts to set up its oversized architecture in large suburb-cities, although many smaller suburbs already have Wal-Marts as town centers and plenty more are on their way.  In recent events, Wal-Mart had lost a battle to open its Superstore (the size of 17 football fields) in Inglewood.  Many opposed the construction based on what we have seen all over the country.  Wal-Mart’s interests are solely to provide the lowest prices possible to attract the most customers possible, all in the name of profit and growth.  The side effects of such policies are abundant and significant.  Even after Wal-Mart’s one million dollar campaign to convince the public, the residents of Inglewood voted against Wal-Mart’s arrival.  It is surprising to find the widespread effects of Wal-Mart’s proposed influx do not end there.   “Last fall, some 70,000 grocery clerks throughout Southern California walked out on strike against the Ralphs, Vons, Albertsons, and Pavilions grocery stores; after four months and 18 days spent on picket lines, those workers agreed to a new labor contract full of concessions, including steep cuts in wages and health care benefits for newly hired employees.”( Voters in Inglewood, CA Reject Wal-Mart Superstore , Democracy Now!, Thursday, April 22nd, 2004  urlLink http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/22/150248 )   Even after their victory against Wal-Mart Supercenters, no retailer can go unharmed without opening to customers for over 4 months.  Today the morale and the inventory of the grocery stores are not to par.  Many customers who were forced to find new outlets have not returned to the stores that went on strike.  Has Wal-Mart become so powerful that it can put others out of business simply with a threat?  This is only the beginning to the many battles Wal-Mart is going to face, as the media and the public’s interest in Wal-Mart’s policies help establish opinions among the population.   Wal-Mart is currently testing the “Neighborhood Market” (among others), which is an attempt to provide a local grocery store to customers who avoid shopping at their massive Supercenters.  It will be interesting to see how this scenario pans out.  Other Wal-Mart stores being tested are banks and clothing stores.  If they are successful it would introduce a new model of localization of businesses by large retailers.  Perhaps the division of merchandising could be taken further, so other families of products could have their own spin offs as a solo storefront on a downtown street, recreating the mixed used downtown that most suburbs lack.  Current store managers of Wal-Marts are encouraged to treat their division within Wal-Mart (whether it is the sporting goods section or the auto repairs section) as a private store within a store, so in reality each section could have a storefront of its own.  I often hear people speaking of their “love, hate” relationship to Wal-Mart. Meanwhile they “go to find things I never new I needed.”  Wal-Mart has its own consumer culture.  There are those who love Wal-Mart and swear by their low prices and then there are those who cannot help shopping in what is familiar and convenient even with ethical dilemmas lingering in their minds.  Wal-Mart for many is the quickest solution, or the best bet in finding whatever merchandise is needed.  Why waste your time anywhere else, when you know Wal-Mart has what you want.  Ultimately it is the consumer who decides how Wal-Mart will change to best serve the populace.

      I've been tinkering with an idea for years now.  It is steeped in the all-encompassing and seemingly ineffable topic that seems to be the premise of  Freedom in Familiarity .  The  familiar  is rooted in the  family , the oldest tribe.  And as the family takes a back seat in the formation of humanity's perception of what is and what should be, the familiar takes over.  Jeanee and Chris strike many of the same notes in their posts here on the blog.  I call it  New Tribalism .  The essential questions are those of identity, familiarity, and the deeper syntax of our activities.  Perhaps the largest lesson to date is history, where we have catgalogued the transformation of these aspects across various cultures, economic ages, and social revolutions. From the problems we now face in mass media, consumerism and sprawl, and a lack of relevancy in education, we readily draw parallels to global industrialization of previous centuries.  There is abundant connective tissue in the realms of production, advertising, product identity, personal identity, illusions of media, the urge to blindly believe and follow our 'leaders', etc.  We tend to draw the line at Industrialism, forgetting that the forerunner to the Industrial Revolution was the printing press, an inescapable link to the middle ages that acts like a wormhole, skipping past the Scientific Enlightenment of the Rennaissance (which is possibly the birth of mass Capitalism), industrial booms, and  failed revolts of Communism, straight to our current dilemmas in the so-called Age of Information.  (See Frank Lloyd Wright's 'The Art and Craft of the Machine' in  Prairie Architecture )  To take it further, when we examine the middle ages in terms of the identity of the individual, the question arises: "How did the identity of these masses of people end up under the complete control of a few wealthy land-owners and religious leaders?"  Is it really much different now?  I argue that the majority of American population is still counted and exploited like so many head of cattle.  The answer to the question of domination lies in the transformation of human settlement, from the fallen ages of empire and conquest which brought about the middle ages back through the pre-imperial nation-states, the chieftains of the metal ages, the earliest domestic tribes and their cult of the female and fertility, and finally to the hunter-gatherers, paleolithic man, and even to the animal kingdom and our ongoing speculations over evolution, if you wish.  Somewhere in that massive history, there are turning points from idyllic societies to societies of domination, exploitation, and enslavement.   This goes far beyond the physical limits of the body, possessions, and even the rights of action.  It has always been about identity.  I can't even begin to answer it all here.  It may be a life's work.  I want to hear the ideas and opinions of everyone who reads this.  We are all engaging in New Tribalism: you have already been initiated by your eyes and your active comprehension of my words and those of so many others.  When Mankind banded together and formed settlements, the tendency of individuation and self-referential mentality was born.  It was only a seed and it has been transformed in so many ways.  Identity is an active mode of perception, wherein the part is separated form the whole.  Nomadic hunter-gatherers moved their settlements with the changing environment.  They had not reached a place of total identity, in which we find stability.  The first village settlements abandoned the embedded identity of displacement and subjective existence, seeing strength, stability, and objective identity in a stretch of unmoving earth.  There is a certain inherent violence in this act and we have lost our delicate control over the process.  For the vast majority, the identity of the self and the world is shaped and controlled by others.  It is actually a small fraction of humanity that consciously questions the nature of identity.  But the newly connected population of the world engages in the question as a subconscious act of subversion (see Michel de Certeau's  The Practice of Everyday Life ) in the active and selective creation of new communities, virtual spaces, unhindered discourses, new tribes, New Tribalism.  My proposal involves bringing these virtual domains back into the real world, back to the communal stretch of unmoving earth.  I feel that this needs to happen to selectively affirm the virtual domain by way of an investment real human energy in the corporeal world.  Most virtual communities are nomadic and the individual is able to participate on a whim wihtout exerting any real effort or sacrifice.  There is rarely a sense of solidarity, support, and dedication unless those involved are also taking part in an actual physical community as well.  Others will have different proposals.  I am posing the question now to all of you out there:   What is your New Tribalism and can it/how can it be be used to repossess the self, production, synergy,  and the perception of existence?

       April 10, 2004 Dallas, TX   After many visits to Wal-Mart centered towns, Dallas was refreshing.  In an effort to revitalize its downtown, downtown living spaces are being heavily marketed.  It seems the city still struggles to lure residents to spend time in its downtown area during the off hours and weekends.  Although the downtown area is surrounded by highways, creating a clear divide between the city’s respective zones, it is still ambiguous as to where the suburbs begin.  Across the highway from Dallas’ skyscrapers, suburban style houses pack the streets.  These neighborhoods, located at walking distances from the downtown area have characteristics of a suburban commuter town.  Even the few townhouses have clear architectural references to the single family dwelling.  Could it be the residue of suburban architecture seeping into the urban language?

       April 9, 2004 Bossier City, LA   Bossier City seems as if it is reaching its holding capacity.  What was once a small military town has boomed into a 6 Wal-Mart city.  It seems as though Wal-Mart literally paves the way for other large retailers, by replacing local malls and small business along the boulevards and intersections.  The sprawl becomes apparent when you see big box retailers at any major intersection opposite cotton fields waiting to be transformed into asphalt. Within the last ten years, boat casinos have altered the area into a destination for leisure.  After speaking to a casino employee it is apparent that Wal-Mart’s 24 hour convenience is important for people employed in any 24 hour entertainment business.    Bossier City is especially interesting because there are other large retailers experimenting with the supersizing of their services.  Target, another big box retailer has opened a Super Target, following Wal-Mart’s Supercenter model down to it’s slogan, Expect More, Pay Less (Wal-Mart’s slogan is We Sell for Less.)  It will be interesting to see how competition from other retailers will reshape Wal-Mart’s strategy.  Although Target isn’t Wal-Mart’s direct competitor since they claim to provide higher quality products, the race has begun for each retailer to take hold of its own loyal market and lure converts to shop from their store.  This is exciting because loyalty from the consumer’s standpoint gets into the realm of the experience of shopping.  I think most people will agree that Target provides better quality products in a warmer, less invasive environment.  Are people willing to pay the price for better quality and experience?  Or will the low prices always be the bottom line?  I think it is still too early to speak, but as other retailers such as Sears jump on the bandwagon to supersize their shopping experience, they will certainly be keeping their eyes and ears open to Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart shoppers as the tides shift or remain stagnant.  Bossier City’s Wal-Mart is second location visited to have a sheriff’s office inside.  I’m beginning to think it may be more common than I had thought.

       April 5th, 2004 Stockbridge, GA  The Wal-Marts in the Atlanta area lie on the outskirts of the city.  Of the 30 or so Wal-Marts / Sams Clubs in the Atlanta region, 2 are within the city of Atlanta.  As one of the worst sprawling cities, Atlanta’s big box retailers have managed to support the sprawling growth.  Pollution from commuting vehicles have become so bad, the government has stepped in banning any more construction of highways.    Pulling off the highway to the destination for the night, unsurprisingly, could have been anywhere.  There was the same strip of stores along a similar stretch of 4 lane street / highway.  Strangely enough, Wal-Mart uses an architectural language which changes over the years.  You can tell how old a Wal-Mart is, by looking at its elevation.  The colors and profile differ slightly.  This Wal-Mart was a little bit odd.  The sheriff’s office is inside this Supercenter.  Tucked in the vestibule between the two automatic sliding doors, the tinted glass doors read, Sheriff’s Office.  It speaks volumes.  Which came first, the town or Wal-Mart?  Either way, the absurdity of having the sheriff’s office in Wal-Mart remains.  If Wal-Mart was new in town, then the sheriff must have relocated his office to the center of town (a retail giant set half a mile back from the major intersection by its own parking lot).  And if Wal-Mart created this town, the sheriff is a creation of Wal-Mart, essentially a government security force based in a private retailer.

      I’ve been asked to give a brief synopsis of my travel proposal.  Now that I’ve started traveling, it seems like a good time to clarify my approach and biases.  My initial proposal to travel the United States in an RV to documents urban sprawl and its relationship to big box retail remains the same (inspired by the documentary, This is Nowhere).  My research and discussions prior to traveling have formed an approach which I feel is most effective in documenting sprawl.  My mediums are digital video and sound as well as photographs and writing.  My hope is by interviewing local residents, I can get a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding big box retail.  Retail as it exists today won’t remain forever, so it is up to us, the common people and the younger generations to recreate the landscape as we choose to live it.  I’ve noticed in my conversations with colleagues, that my bias towards Wal-Mart and other big box retailers seems less ruthless.  (My focus on Wal-Mart is due to the fact that it is the largest employer in this country as well as the Fortune #1 company.  Wal-Mart simply couldn’t be left out of a discussion on urban sprawl.)  I think most critics of Wal-Mart see the retailer as simply bad and seek to remove it completely.  Today we are at a point where this country can no longer afford to wipe out what is perhaps the backbone of the working class.  Critics must rethink Sam Walton’s vision which seemed full of potential in the name of the common people.  His vision to help communities and small business has somehow reshaped our landscape into strip malls and parking lots.  I think it is easy to say his vision didn’t carry through although his legacy of providing more for less has certainly remained.  What’s next for Wal-Mart?  As the population of anti-big box shoppers grows, corporations like Wal-Mart can’t afford to turn a blind eye to its critics.

       April 4, 2004 Mountaineer Mall, Morgantown, WV   A twisted story is about to reveal as Wal-Mart strategically places its new Supercenter in Morgantown.  Mountaineer Mall was a soon to be demolished mall, when Wal-Mart stepped in to rejuvenate local interest, specifically to its wing of the mall.  According to a local, all the best stores are in Wal-Mart’s proximity.  People are pleased with this Wal-Mart, providing what the mall couldn’t previously and saving several businesses as they moved in.  There’s more in the works.  Wal-Mart has decided to open a Supercenter, currently rumored to have three potential locations.  One of which would be a couple miles from Mountaineer Mall.  If Wal-Mart were to choose this path, we can only hope the Mountaineer Mall survives.  Another location is a Native American burial ground with staggering environmental consequences as well.  Will Wal-Mart make the right decisions?    One lady pointed out how Morgantown is becoming a tech town.  Growth to some is prosperity, but her concern was the potential change in the economy of Morgantown.  The land prices and the general costs of living could rise from the influx of tech jobs, forcing lower income residents to move.  Her tables displaying her woodwork sit directly in front of the mall entrance to Wal-Mart.  Her excitement for a new Supercenter, where she’ll be able to buy cheap groceries, is followed by some uneasiness as the personal economic consequences of supersizing a town are revealed. Rising land price and the exodus of lower income residents is a familiar sequence of urban sprawl we’ve seen many times.      April 03, 2004  Pittsburg + Century Three Mall, West Mifflin, PA  Pittsburg, a beautiful city occupying a delta has its own history in steel which forced a unique transformation on the city.  As the steel industry moved out, many lost their jobs and the city’s economy declined.  Did big box retail save the day?  The Wal-Mart Supercenter currently sits at the top of a hill overlooking the remainder of the Century Three Mall complex, a town of stripmalls.  Winding ramps and parking plateaus overlook the highways feeding the businesses from every direction.  The complex sits ironically on a dead steel mill site, perhaps hiring the same people who lost their jobs working the steel mills.  Has this retail conglomerate saved many from poverty or have they erased forever, the small businesses of downtown? A simplification of the current trend in Pittsburg is as follows.  The steel industry went through a decline, bringing with it, the entire economy of Pittsburgh.  The political leaders have little choice, but to raise taxes and spend less.  So the cycle of urban sprawl begins.  City residents move out to townships, only to commute to the city to make money which they spend outside the city at big box retailers whom have also chosen suburban locations to avoid high taxation.  How and when can this cycle be redirected?

We dreamed of such an America during the Great Depression, when there were no jobs. And then we fought and often died for that dream during the Second World War, when there was no peace.  But I know now that there is not a chance in hell of America’s becoming humane and reasonable. Because power corrupts us, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Human beings are chimpanzees who get crazy drunk on power. By saying that our leaders are power-drunk chimpanzees, am I in danger of wrecking the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East?

      Excerpt from NY Times, May 30, 2004 "AMERICAN DREAMERS | THE BUDGET SUITES  Seekers, Drawn to Las Vegas, Find a Broken Promised Land By DEAN E. MURPHY  AS VEGAS, May 29 — South on Las Vegas Boulevard, well beyond the casino-scraped skyline, there is a three-story hotel where tourists seldom go.   The parking lot is sprinkled with U-Haul trucks and trailers. A school bus stops at the front office. A sign on the lawn offers discounts for guests who stay a week or more.  Inside the no-frills rooms, where sheets and blankets cost extra, a desert city's promise of new beginnings is regularly put to the test. This busy hotel and others in the Budget Suites of America chain are the cinder-block equivalent of circled wagon trains, a community of dreamers, pioneers and strivers pulling up for a while en route to someplace and something better. "  The Series continues on Mon, May 31 thru Fri, June 4.

      A friend emailed me the recent article in Metropolis Magazine (June 2004 issue).   The article describes Wal-Mart’s architectural practice as a force that could change our landscape.  In recent years Wal-Mart has become architecturally flexible, accepting local archetypes. It holds hope for big box architecture.  The fear in Wal-Mart’s willingness to alter its classic big box image is that it may only serve as a mask for its policies.  The hope is, this is the first step to a more socially responsible retail industry.  A shift in Wal-Mart’s architecture would redefine our landscape which inevitably affects the way we interact as a community.

      Washington, MI  Yesterday’s encounter was very familiar. A supersize retailer was built a mile away from this existing stripmall, relocating the center of commerce as herds of big boxes caught on and moved in. The small grocery store’s parking lot was nearly empty. Upon entering, the poorly stocked shelves speak for themselves. Many shelves were completely empty and single items often stood on their own, signaling its end of stock and hinting at what had once filled the neighboring shelves. The store seemed so near death, I can only conclude that they have remained open to serve the few patrons who have continued to shop there. Sales couldn’t possibly cover the operating costs. The land will be nearly worthless. This soon to be abandoned space has all the local touches never to be found elsewhere. Aisles named after local schools decorate the ceiling with local mascots. The manager recalls their continued struggle politely to ensure no further controversy in her community. This experience was truly painful. I can only imagine what local supporters had gone through and continue to go through. Is this simply capitalism and the local grocer’s inability to revamp itself to the community’s needs? She ensured me that we, as a country are stepping on our own toes as we continue to sell more for less at the expense of others. It’s going to bite us in our ass, she said.

      Denver, CO  Traveling from Wal-Mart to Wal-Mart has become quite mundane and stressful, as the amount of time spent of the road wasn’t properly compensated by the dull reality so many suburbs exist within.  Each city held its own uniqueness, but the outer stretches of asphalt were always consistently the same. . . Mcdonald’s, Shell, Wal-Mart, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Lowe’s, etc.  What had become a search to find a hotspot of a Wal-Mart feud finally paid off. The Northwest of Denver is amidst a fierce battle between Wal-Mart’s proposed Neighborhood Market and the local residents.  I would like the opponents and the proponents speak for themselves through the final documentary film, so I’m going to refrain from speaking of the current situation at the Elitch site.  The repercussions of the site’s failure or success are not only a local issue, but rather a national issue.  This 40 acre site has the potential to set itself as an example for other new urban developments around the country with its thus far successful implementation of senior, low income, single family, live/work, and co-housing all within a single development.

      excerpt.    It's torn cities apart from Inglewood to Chicago and  engulfed the entire  state of Vermont. Now the conflict's  gone national as a presidential campaign  issue, with John  Kerry hammering the megaretailer for its abysmally  low  wages and Dick Cheney praising it for its "spirit of  enterprise, fair  dealing and integrity." This could be the  central battle of the 21st century:  Earth people versus the  Wal-Martians.     No one knows exactly when the  pod landed on our planet, but  it seemed normal enough during its early years  of gentle  expansion. Almost too normal, if you thought about it,  with  those smiley faces and red-white-and-blue bunting, like the  space  invaders in a 1950's sci-fi flick when they put on  their human suits.     excerpt.    No, Wal-Mart's only hope lies with its ostensible  opponents, like  Madeline Janis-Aparicio, who led the  successful fight against a new  superstore in Inglewood,  Calif. "The point is not to destroy them," she told  me,  "but to make them accountable." Similarly Andy Stern,  president of the  Service Employees International Union,  will soon begin a national effort to  "bring Wal-Mart up to  standards we can live with." He envisions a  nationwide  movement bringing together the unions, churches,  community  organizations and environmentalists who are already  standing up  to the company's recklessly metastatic growth.     Earth to Wal-Mars, or  wherever you come from: Live with us  or go back to the mother ship.

         Did anyone before Sam Walton ever imagine that lowering the margins of merchandise will lead to profits?    It runs completely in the opposite direction of the foundations of capitalism.    Profits, in the tradition market, are made when retailers are able to create larger margins of profits on their goods, hence the antitrust laws which prohibit monopolies, which in turn would allow a single merchant to mark their goods at any price.    Who would have thought the lowering of margins would increase profits by attracting customers in large numbers and at the same time wipe out the competition?    In hindsight it seems logical, yet it only works for the black sheep.    Once the competitions flips for the race to the bottom, the system breaks down; it’s Wal-Mart or nothing.    Wal-Mart has already set the requirements to compete in this race, by eliminating morals and ethics from their policies.    The race for the bottom has already drawn ill effects.    Wal-Mart’s policies are predicated on the fact that they are the largest retailer in the world.    Their policies could not possibly slide by, were they not the largest.    In some sense the race has already ended.    Wal-Mart has set the standards of the bottom, by cutting corners in ways considered unlawful by the standards of the Workers Rights Consortium.    How will any other retailers compete?    Is it a matter of time before the capitalistic mentality is to race for the bottom? Or is that how it already is?

         This perverse cocktail of politics, money, culture, and freedom orbit each other chaotically as the masses march in sync to the hypnotic beat.    Media influence, propaganda, politics reach down into cultures with the veil of freedom coercing the globe to line up to be fed the bytes of ethics and values.    Is architecture fluid enough to conform, react to or battle the pressure?

         The so called Wal-Mart culture relies on the sameness of its stores.    Its advertising targets the low to mid income families who find comfort in the sameness and predictability of cheapness in each store.    Stores provide a one stop solution to shopping, providing everything from groceries to bicycles at the lowest prices in town, making Wal-Mart the first choice for many shoppers.    Each town with a Wal-Mart becomes a Wal-Mart town.    Supercenters essentially act as an anchor store with their high shopper turnover, enticing other big box retailers to set up shop nearby.    In this way the network of corporate and media influence redistributes the patterns of cultural exchange.    Perhaps what is most feared by anti-globalists is the redistribution of local influence to a centrally commanded global policy.    What was once a village or community affair is becoming, or has become a national and global agenda.    Changes at Wal-Mart’s headquarters would affect several thousand communities and millions of people, all of whom have little or no voice in the decision.

         My travels have ended and the hope is that I could capture the feelings and thoughts that have found a place in my mind through writing, moving and still images.    The joy, sadness, and madness of this great experimental country have expanded my vision of how life in this country should and could be.    Unfortunately, I have answered fewer questions than I had sought out.    So as one adventure ends a new challenge begins as I piece together what I can into an attention span.

      just been invited to join another  urlLink blog  discussing the concept of "urban sprawl".  must have a little rumination.   also, went to the beach today.  and yesterday.  rio has been cloudy and/or rainy for the past three weeks so any little bit of sunshine sends the cariocas to the beach in what is reminiscent of parched herds stampeding to a newly discovered watering hole.  have been working on a tan.   what is different about rio as an urban development is the presence of the beach right smack bang in the middle of it all.  unlike barcelona, whose centre of action is firmly inland (though the beach is never too far away), in rio, the beach, or "zona sul" is so much part of daily life that it is difficult to ignore it.  brighton, as another example has this certain detachment from its beach that doesn't exist in rio.  what is also very funny is that when cariocas speak of são paulo, one of the first things they mention is, "there isn't a beach!", as if to say, how could anyone in their right mind even consider living there for a second?  i can't say how rio compares to los angeles cuz i've never been there, but i assume it's similar to rio.

      i went out last night, got drunk, got sweaty, came home, overslept for my first class, then tried to get in the shower but there was no water, so i went back to bed and didn't get up for another 3 hours while the three surrounding apartments receive a make-over.  which means really loud banging and drilling from 8am onwards.   i feel like death.

      some headway into this whole html thang...i am really at the very basics and therefore it is a little frustrating as i want to do a lot more than i can, but better late than never, i guess...am seriously considering taking some html lessons at the PUC.   apart from that, thoughts on blogs: i consider myself to be fairly socially conscious --i would  have  to be, really, with a B.A. in international relations and (almost) a master's degree in politics/development-- but find that i don't like voicing my opinion on what's happening.  well, not too loudly anyway.  and i feel as if expressing myself through a blog would be doing just that, so i don't really want this to turn into a poliblog.  i do enjoy reading others' blogs that deal with the state of world affairs, like  urlLink The Ground Up , which truly is a labour of love, as Chris the blogger states himself, and  urlLink Where is Raed?  (like everyone else, but everyone reads it for a reason).   this computer room smells of coffee-pee.   i've got a samba lesson coming up and i have to go home and leave my computer there first so ta for now.

      when a good brazilian friend (my on-site life-style coordinator) told me that here in brazil it doesn't matter whether the object of your affection is hitched or not, you can go for them anyway, i didn't really believe him.  but it's true.  he's sleeping with another friend of mine and they've both got serious partners.  like, marriage serious.  funny.   i'm going to see 1984 the film today, it's on on for free on campus. shit.  i'm pissed off.  i really wanted to see beth gibbons and now i'm going to have to pay a ton if i go.  well, i guess this way i'll be spared the k.d. lang experience.  maybe i'll see 2many djs instead.  yeah, maybe i'll do that.      fuck.

      so i'm going to this music festival here in rio this weekend, as a matter of fact it's starting tomorrow and i was stupidly excited because i thought i was going to see beth gibbons tomorrow, i didn't get the ticket myself but some friends had an extra one and i told them i'd take it so i thought that was that.  i was going.  i run into said friends and ask about tomorrow and they're like, oh, christoph came over last night and took the ticket.  WHAT?!?!?!?!  that was  MY  ticket!!!   bastard!!!!!!  and he knew that that ticket was mine!!!!  he's going to pay, silly pointy twat.   at leat i'm still seeing the super furry animals, the rapture and the white stripes, all in one night, for the unbelievable price of R$30 (less than 10 euros).  but i'm supposed to be going with christoph.  i'm so pissed off.  i'm going to call him right now and shout at him.  bastard.  sneaky, sneaky bastard.

       Amador Perez , an art professor at the PUC, produces some incredibly beautiful stuff.  check out his  urlLink site .  we went to a small exhibition he had on at a local gallery today, with the computer graphics class.  it was breathtaking, the attention he pays to detail and the reflection that goes into the different "layers" within a piece, the idea of reproduction and spectrum...fin, it was one of the best exhibitions i've seen in a long time.  plus, he was so  nice .  he took all this time out to explain the concept behind his work.  i think i'll go back before it ends on saturday.   in other news, herr pointy, who has a name (christoph) has started teaching me german.  i love german.  i've wanted to learn it for years.  i also suffer from this weird "a fish called wanda"-syndrome, where when i am spoken to in german, if the speaker is male and slightly attractive (even if his proven performance in bed leaves something to be wished for), i totally start falling.  it's really quite disconcerting how fast i start reconsidering the possibility of jumping back into bed with him, so far i have resisted but i think he knows it makes me swoon, seeing as he speaks to me in german every chance he gets.  yesterday's word: kissenschlacht.  pillow fight.   today's word: bauchlandung.  to fall flat on one's face (as in complete failure).   also, this land is crazy for running into people you know  and  people you don't know but are connected to: on thursday, at a party, i met this kid who used to live in japan for 15 years, went to international school and all and so we obviously know the same people.  like kenji chikada, with whom i lived for a while when i first moved to paris, and we used to go to raves together in london, and he's a really good friend of nadia.  well, this adam kid i met, he's like, best friends with kenji.  how random is that?  this is random encounter #2 since i moved here.  what's even more random is that he just came up to me and was like, "i use to see you all the time at the internet café in ipanema on vinicius de morais."  and then we got talking and we just kind of discovered our common past.  i like random encounters like that.

       So Paulo  for the bienale of architecture was great...did end up going with herr pointy, with whom i had a little chat before the departure, so things were clear.  no failed coital attmempts or any other unpleasantries i would have had to deal with later.  i had loads of fun, actually.  sampa is much more of the kind of city i'm used to: huge buildings everywhere, a japanese quarter, people in a hurry, an efficient subway system.  i'm glad to be back in rio but i suspect i would've had a whale of a time if i had done my semester in so paulo.  don't forget to check out the photos by clicking on the link on the right.  when i actually get round to uploading them...

      cannot believe elliott smith killed himself.  i found out yesterday when it was still some rumour floating around the web, but today i read an obit from the ny times.  damn.   in other news, i am having the "talk" with herr pointy today, to make sure he doesn't think we're actually having a relationship.  not sure how i'm going to broach the subject, but it must be done.   scanned a photo i took, will put it up so you can see my (limited) skills in monochrome photography.

       i have so far  succesfully avoided the pointy one...he is the one who looks like moby in the  urlLink brasil  photos.  he called  last night but i didn't answer, plus  i was revising anyway (she says when in truth she was updating her friendster profile...).  no news of him today, thank god, and plus i've got too much to do anyway (she says while having been online and smoking cigarettes for 2 hours now).   my next project: matt (or mateus, depends on when you catch him), young, lush 20 year old.  david lawton wrote me a letter!!!  he is so sexy.  he says he's looking forward to seeing  me and my smile   in paris.  i'm quite enjoying my newfound status as  croqueuse d'hommes , so he may just see more than my smile...

       having thought about  my so-called "defeat" from thursday night, i have decided that it's probably for the better.  his laugh scares me anyway.  now the problem is that we are going to the music festival together (rapture, super furries, white stripes) and it's just the two of us.  shit.   a good friend is leaving rio because he is depressed.  why?   i miss louis.  i received an email from him today and all i want to do is hug him and tell him he will be ok.  poor baby has thrown himself into brooklyn when what he like most is cheese and steak au poivre.  well, he does want to be a writer and paris isn't the best of places for that when you write in english.  oh whatever.  he'll get used to it.  but i wish i were there with him.

      i went over to a "potential's" house, had dinner with him and his flatmate, and then NOTHING HAPPENED.  and this is even as we were sleeping in the same room, our matresses next to each other...i was actually going to go home after watching "Deuce Bigelow Male Gigolo" on TV (as evidence of the superior programming on Brazilian television) but then he said i could stay, and it was pretty late etc etc and then NOTHING HAPPENED.  so today, i come home at 9.30 am and right when my flatmate's getting up and i had to admit to the defeat...alas...so i went to the beach with a friend, thought i'd get rid of the pantone palette on my butt caused by my change in bikini (regular -> minuscule brazilian), and instead, i got burnt.  fuck this.  i think i'll go home and take a nap.  plus i'm broke.  my face is on fire.

      i spent all of yesterday walking around  urlLink santa teresa , a neighbourhood on a hill in rio.  lots of winding streets, a  tram!!!  and gorgeous houses.  it was open doors day for artists, of which there are loads, sta teresa being a bit of a bobo hood and all, so we got to see some really nice dwellings...  it wasn't raining when we went and the clouds managed to contain themselves for most of the day, until we were almost at the bottom of the hill again, near lapa, when the skies opened and consequently got soaked through.  i went home, drenched, took a hot shower and went to bed.  it felt incredible to wake up this morning at 9 a.m., when one of the little m's, called me up from paris with some juicy gossip.  i like being woken up by a talking people column, especially after 13 hours of lush, uninterrupted sleep.

      came to an end yesterday...what will i do with my time from now on?  oh yeah, i forgot i live in rio... so, i saw  el mismo amor, la misma lluvia , an argentine film released in 1999 (can't remember the director's name, but his talent is recognised amongst those in the know) and it was very enjoyable.   in other news, my favourite person in the world has just moved to brooklyn, and i have received an email from him telling me how he had to pay $300 in surcharge for luggage and then they took away $80-worth of ciggarettes from him at the airport.  knowing how much he smokes, and how broke he is now, i do feel for him.  i think i may surprise him for his birthday, coming up soon, and send him a few cartons of  industria brasileira  lucky strikes.  or maybe he should just ask his dad, who works for british american tobacco, to send him some.  i should stop feeling sorry, or feeling  tout court , for him.  fuck the cigarettes.

      Rio is currently hosting the biggest film festival in Latin America, and I have been taking due advantage of the films being offered...especially refreshing when the usual choice is limited to the three big American blockbusters of the moment.    The first one I saw:  urlLink It's All About Love , directed by Thomas Vinterberg (of  Festen ) and with Joaquin Phoenix and Clare Danes, was a pleasant surprise (I had no idea what to expect).  I had an overemotional moment when there was a 2-second scene of Paris under the snow, and you hear a man say to his young son, "Allez, on va au Butte-Chaumont!", though I quickly got over it...  The film itself is beautifully shot, and despite it being set in the future it avoids any cliches like flying cars and the like.  It definitely concentrated on the universal and ageless emotions of love and affection, as the title suggests.  The story and the acting was reminiscent of the kind of drama you get in theatre, but it worked with the themes.  All in all, a great film.   I also saw  urlLink Lost in Translation , the new film by Sofia Coppola, and loved it.  I didn't really like The Virgin Suicides too much, so I was a little wary of seeing this one, but the fact that it's set in Tokyo and it's got Bill Murray convinced me.  It was so much fun!  She does it so gently, she pokes fun at Tokyo and its inhabitants, not as an obnoxious foreigner but as one who knows the city and its people affectionately, who despite the cultural differences can accept them and laugh with them.  The whole film was fragile yet had body, just like the evanescence of the experience she was trying to portray.  Left me missing Tokyo and the details of living in Japan.  Left me nostalgic.    Anyway, I also saw Fame, the musical, in the cinema in front of the square where I was mugged a few weeks ago.  The seats were comfortable but the AC was on super-high.  It was a pleasant experience none the less.  Long live film festivals.  What the hell am I going to do when it's over???  I guess I'll go see Pirates of the Carribean, which I haven't yet seen, I hear Johnny is quite the cheeky monkey in it.

       i'm back.   and not just physically, but figuratively.  i am back in rio, yes, from an incredible INCREDIBLE i repeat INCREDIBLE four days on a deserted beach.  there are no words for it.  it was pure paradise and i can't believe it really happened.  back in the city now, struggling to breathe amidst the aggressivity and pollution of rio de janeiro, but all is good because i have a killer tan, lovely skin,  and A MAN.  no, well, he's just a  ficante , as they say here, but whatever.  it's not l'amour de ma vie, far from it, but it's fun to just hang out, lie in hammocks and dance forro with someone who knows how, and is willing to teach you.  he is tellement chou and he plays the guitar really well, and sings and ok so maybe the setting blurred my vision (he  does  have long hair...nyeh...) but whatever.  tonight i'm seeing adam, the hot american, who's leaving tomorrow for the US, so it's my last chance to pounce on him, hopefully his flatmate who keeps calling me won't see.   goodness, and i'm 25 now.  i must say, the past week was the best way to celebrate my birthday.  oh and louis has finally changed his friendster status to single, and is "interested in meeting people for Dating (women)".  so i'm also looking for dates now.  haha!  the difference between him and me is that i've got them coming out of my ears!!!

      hmm.  i know someone who's going through something similar, but to a greater degree: suddenly, all this male attention!  men asking for numbers, men calling, cinema invitations, drink invitations etc etc.  but, i have to admit, none are all that cute.  alas, i am fated to attract the intellectual types who are ugly.  that sounds terrible, and beauty is not only skin-deep but also subjective, yet...  exceptions (2): matt and adam.  matt the young american/brazilian who has on several occasions admitted to an older-woman fancy, and adam the engineer with a heart i wrote about a couple of posts down.  the former has been showing a growing interest when i run into him --rather often, actually-- and he has even called me (admittedly, it was only to ask for a proffessor's name, but still...), he smiles, he touches my arm, he takes my hands when we say hi...*swoon*  as for adam, i saw him a couple of times this past week, once even by chance.  he is also tender and stuff, he said, "bye darling," last time i saw him, he is now de viagem in the pantanal, before he leaves the country to *again, swoon* help the kids he teaches build an annual robot.  he's coming back next week, i shall invite him to my birthday drinks.   speaking of, i can't believe i'm turning a quarter of a century old... oh, and there is a happy addendum to the mugging story: the lixo guys (the garbage men.  what heroes!) found my stuff in a bin or something and called some of the numbers they found in the agenda.  so i must go pick that up.  hopefully the other stuff is in there too.  especially keys.  if not, i will have to change the lock to my house.  i'm so freaked out lately, any little noise i hear i'm convinced it's the guys coming after the rest of the booty.   also, louis called me the other day.  that was a surprise and a half.  he doesn't seem to be liking it too much in ny.  or at least on that day.  it made me so happy to hear from him.  he manages to keep me on the leash.  which sucks, but i also don't want to not hear from him ever again.   someone in this room is farting some very stinky farts.   a l'ail , as they say.  same smell as the farts in the computer room yesterday...i think we've got a repeat offender here.

      again.  for the second time since i moved to rio.  this time i walked out of my house at 9 p.m. and got accosted by two teenage boys on bikes who escaped with my entire bag.  keys, agenda, id., everything.  oddly enough, though, they did not take my phone, which was in my hands as i was speaking to my friend charlie (the guy who has a carpet reminding him of the hockney piece).  anyway, this time it was a lot more aggressive and scary.  they forced down my head so they could grab the strap to my bag and did lots of shouting.  what sucks most is that this happened in front of my house.  oh well.      i think louis has decided to sever all ties, don't really know why, but i have a feeling i will not hear from him again.  i am so sad.  but i guess that was also meant to be.   today is my first typography workshop day!!  so excited.  and got my photos back from the photojournalism class and they came out really well.  i will scan the negatives and post them up soon.

      i should just stop calling louis altogether, seeing as i make a fool of myself everytime i do.  turns out i calculated the time difference in the wrong direction.  so who looks like a dumbass now?  anyway, i'm going to try not to mention him too often here;  there are more interesting things happening in my life.  aren't there?

      i have received two e-mails from louis, one in which he reveals the truth: he was lying in bed hungover.   anyway, i spent an obscene amount of money yesterday in rio sul.  now i need to go pay my rent.

      so i called louis yesterday to wish him a happy birthday.  i'm not supposed to make calls on my mother's card, as you may all know...so anyway, i call him.  it's around 1:30 in the afternoon.  not too late for a saturday, i think.  anyway, he picks up, sounds out of it, and, get this:  tells me to call later.   what the fuck???  this isn't the first time he pulls this one, so of course i didn't call him, but this has left me time to turn it over in my head (uncountable times).  there are three possibilities:  a) he was asleep, and the insensitive bastard that he can be, preferred to have a lie-in than speak to his ex-girlfriend who is calling from BRAZIL to wish his sorry ass a happy birthday. b) he was asleep, but with someone else, and found it uncomfortable to speak with the ex-girlfriend while laying next to a naked girl. c) he was at work (it's his first week) and couldn't speak.   of course, he hasn't actually written me or anything to apologise, explain himself or just chat.  whatever the truth may be, one thing is clear:  i have to get over him and stop getting my hopes up.  so, instead of moping around all day, i went to the beach with a ton of people, including my new  projet : adam the hot american who used to live in japan.  we know the same people from tokyo and has got the prettiest eyes and i won't even start about his body...suffice it to say he has been a capoeirista for 3 years now.  tall, tan and handsome...we went to see the streets and public enemy at the tim festival, got soaked through in the torrential rain and had a good dance.  nothing has happened and i doubt it will but alas, he's good to look at.  it would be convenient, though, cuz he's leaving at the end of november.  oh, he's so hot.  and funny and clever: he studied engineering at yale, but he has a heart (he teaches high school).  man, all the girls must be totally in love.   anyway, today it's pouring again and so i've decided to spend the day in rio sul, the huge mall in botafogo.

      i have nothing to say.  well, time is flying, my forro skills could use some perfecting, i don't want to leave brazil in 2 months.  i have been looking on the sciences po website for a projet collectif and i'm degoutee...aucune envie de rentrer...  quel horreur...  and it's freezing in paris, according to iht weather.    oh!  and they've caught saddam!  that was sudden.  well, at leat for me -- i haven't read the paper in approximately four months.  help...i don't want to leave.

      the photos are up.  i am losing my tan.  but according to my sources it is snowing in new york (snow?  what's that?), so i shouldn't complain.  man, things are getting hot over here, and it's not just the weather...the sexually explicit content of my day-to-day conversations is reaching record levels...and despite my newfound status as a libertine, i must admit the dirty adventures do not feature yours truly.  alas, one needs more of a "brazilian" look for that.  so no, it's not me that has foursomes and threesomes on a weekly basis with the hottest guys in rio, it's a very hot friend of mine.  of course, she's also very sweet and warm. anyhow, it makes for great in-class note passing.   so anyway, i am in the midst of end of term papers and have done none of them!  woo hoo!  come wednesday evening i shall be free.  in the meantime, i will type a few words every hour and dance forro in my room.

      yep, back in paris but you all knew this already.  i wonder if any of you read this anymore, but i'm just going to keep writing, try to get back into the habit.   so yes, my return...was difficult but all things considered, it was not that ugly.  this is principally due to maria and her welcome arms to console me, full of goodies like my winter coat, cleaning products and innumerable joints.  god bless her.  we would all be lost without the Goodlife.   it's been a month and a few days since i left brazil, and my bresiliennete is slowly creeping away...this cannot be!!!  anyway i need to get ready for sciences po and seeing as i finally did my laundry yesterday the decision process will be burdened by the prolific options of dress.  and i'll probably be late again.   oh, put up the brazil nordeste trip photos up on image station.  take a look, but be warned: there are 377 photos up.  including those with daniel!

      since i've returned to paris and i'm still all over the place, though it's slowly falling into place.  or is it?  everytime i'm with maria and we start talking about unemployment i get so panicked i either break out in a cold sweat, literally, or i'm taken over by a bout of uncontrollable hysterical laughter.  why cry when you can laugh i guess, but the laughter is pretty close to tears...my god i'm terrified. apart from the obvious shakes induced by my lack of prospects, i've been feeling pretty shitty about school...  returning to sciences po after 7 months in brazil and surtout the PUC, where i felt like a genius, the old inferiority complex has kicked in with full force.  no thanks to the pop quizzes they like to give in espace mondial: fill in the map and tell me exactly where francophone africa is, as well as chiapas and belize while you're at it.  actually, it's pretty straightforward stuff but i can't remember a thing.   and i spend too much time online, not even looking at worthwhile sites.  i spend too much time staring at friendster.   i'm going to new york on the 8th to the 16th to see louis.  that's going well.  or at least while he was here.  but that's going to be short-lived, i think.  our situation and our "future", if there is such a thing, will be discussed while there.  will leave ny with a long-distance boyfriend or nothing at all.  this half-assed shit, though it worked fine in brazil, won't work for much longer.  and the reason it worked in brazil was precisely because we had both thought we weren't ever going to get back together again.  i don't think either of us was expecting to still be in love 7 months later, to spend two blissful weeks forgetting the previous separation and the future one as well.   i think my friend elsa is getting married in september.  she keeps sending me cryptic messages about a "surprise" and saving the last weekend of septemeber.  i think there is only one possibility.  damn it, this is going to plunge me into self-doubt again, despite myself.

      and i'm off to new york!!!  i'm so excited i could pee in my pants.  it's been a month or so since louis left paris, and we've been keeping very close touch.  thank god for msn.  for now it's all about love and how much of it we have for each other, but i also know that we will have to come to some crucial decisions before i leave again...eight days later!  god, there is hardly any time.  i'm still stupidly, ridiculously excited about bk.  i really hope things work out.   apart from the anxious waiting, i've been getting drunk on a regular basis, and hence have gotten very little work done for sciences po.  i also have an ADSL connection now and spend an unhealthy amount of time surfing the web...  it was james' birthday party on saturday night at 15 reo.  i drank quite a bit but eventually i couldn't find any more wine and stopped.  which is probably what allowed me to keep up the flirting (maria:"ta cheirosa, ne?") with a certain julien, whom i ended up snogging in the kitchen at around 5.30am.  we exchanged phone numbers but nothing much else.  i won't be calling him before i leave, as i've got toomuch work and i have to save all my sexual energies for the next week.  but i'll probably ring him when i get back, if i'm not too depressed... i'm terrified at what i think the outcome will be.  i can't help but be convinced it will all end...i can't leave new york without knowing where i stand, what he wants to do.  but it is clear he has no idea and it would be stupid to force him to promise me anything, nothing is set.  i wish he knew what he wants to do, where he wants to go...i'll be unemployed and will have nothing to hold on to soon enough, so i need at least this to be set.  but i can't possibly envisage the relationship coming to halt.  it just doesn't make any sense in my head.  i have so much love for him.  so much, so much, it hurts.  everyone has gone through this... so for now, i've got plan B,C and D (or should i say J, P and N).  but i'm really hoping for plan A(belman).

      saw jacques last night for his birthday party at the rabbit hole.  he was wearing a long glowstick tied around his butt in such a manner it looked like a neon-green g-string.  he was looking good.  herv, who was covered in reflective tape and fruit-packaging shoulder pads, was rather drunk and ran around like an overexcited monkey.    jb and flo were there, it had been ages since i'd seen them.    yesterday i woke up and had an anxiety "attack", and kept it up until i was fed soup and spring rolls, not until around 5pm.  i'm sorry for those who had to live through that.  thank you for your patience.    it is so much fun having MUPUAM around.  it's like a slumber party everyday.  and she snores so i don't have to feel bad about my own loud sleeping habits.    uuuh, i had loads of fun stuff to say but now i'm braindead.  ah, yes:   i finally did my laundry!!!    four loads.  25 euros.  oh and i'm in the red again.

      miriam's back in town!  as these things go with her and ali, she announced her arrival on thursday, telling me she was getting in on friday, homeless, so she is staying at mine!  woohoo!  she showed up at around 8.30pm, we hung out, smoked cigarettes, dinner at l'occitanie (pav sauce poivre), pierro's birthday (left after 30 minutes), headed to l'le enchante, maria, lulu, nick and fabrice joined us when it was closing, headed to "steps" in tienne marcel where james, francesca, chris, james and dylan were hangin' out, julien turned up as well, and we stayed there til 5am, drinking, dancing, and getting twashed on ritalin.  then for a joint session at ro as a night cap, and headed home at around 7.30...eventually managed to get to sleep, chris woke us up at one point with a texto, "hello.  twirling i bed.  you manetmir?"    i dreamt of chris, hovering a few inches over his mattress, spinning and giving out a soft whirring sound.    and then, i dreamt of a mtro-musical, where everyone on the platforms would break out into dance to beyonc's "crazy in love".    am seriously considering taking some more ritalin, this time for academic reasons, to finally get this shit out of the fucking way.  it is incredibly warm outside.  i smell so good right now.  i feel so clean.    tomorrow, we play tennis.

      how about we get dressed up and go to  urlLink this ?    had drinks with peter!  he looks healthy.  healthier than me anyway.  another long night awaits...i have hence stocked up on nutella, two different kinds of bread, milk chocolate digestives, coffee and orange juice.    tomorrow i swear i'll do my laundry.

      while ruining her own.  but then again, i think i ruined my day a long time ago.    so chris has been locked in to his flat.  there is a key under the doormat.  i must go and open the door from the outside.  but, i haven't finished my fiche technique on la dette des PVD (that is why i am posting) and this just means i'm going to have to talk to the Copinschi, who already thinks i'm a complete airhead.  great.    oh when will this ever end?    i figured out, though, in a moment between sleep and awake, that my 4 credits from yoga last year (i knew they'd come in handy) will save my ass in italian, which i know i'm failing.  espace mondial, then, i can fail as well...i think...i'm not sure...anyway, i'm going to get that diplme even if it means...hmm..i'm not sure i'd go very far.  certainly no sexual favours.  i think copisnchi is gay anyway.  all i know is i couldn't take another semester in that twatty hole of a school.  no fucking way.    so, another dreaded thursday starts with a bang.

      the  urlLink conf-dbat on photojournalism  went off without a hitch, despite a last-minute call from polak, l'iconographe du Monde, saying he had an empechement de dernire minute and couldn't come.  the banana bread, made last night with lots of looove by maria and rodrick, was a hit with everyone.  more people than i expected showed up, including those i invited.  so thank you for coming.  even ben and patrick showed up!  yay!    creve.  good night.

      i have found my true identity in feathered hair, ghetto hoops and off-the-shoulder tops: i was the hottest bitch in club 5 last night.  oh yeah.   no, but seriously, i felt a little awkward going out like that, but it was fun and i think i pulled it off, nevermind the fact i looked like a 16-year-old with unusually shiny lips.  i was sadly missing the pointy black leather boots to go with the rest of my outifit, but the farrah fawcett hair and the earrings were a big hit.  aaahahaha.  and it was cool to see ben and patrick again.  they didn't recognise me for a second then they were both like, "waah you look so different!"  of course, they were seeing me in the J-Lo state, so surprise comprehensible.  shame my tan is completely gone.    oh! and went to the forr on friday.  it was fun, but man am i rusty!  just had one caipirinha and a few drags off a (very powerful) joint and soon enough my head was spinning and i had to sit down.  i left pretty soon after that, to pursue other fun activities, but shame i didn't get to dance more.  there was even a roda de samba atrais, it could've been anywhere in brazil...  i had so much food today...the service at the sainte-marthe (cte de boeuf, baby) was unusually good, and i fell for the  moelleux au chocolat kitu  pour une petite fin sucre...  i have done absolutely nothing "productive" during my entire holiday.  nothing at all.  just lots of, um, sleeping?...vive les vacances.  i think i'll go to bed and finish reading  urlLink pyongyang .    and something funny: checking my stats, i discovered that the search term "rio tits" on MSN sent an unknowing california resident to my blog...sorry to let you down!  only soppy and relatively boring melodrama here.

      our dear maria, whose UNESCO app is due out today, by midnight, has just called (11.30pm) to report that she went to the central post office by the louvre only to discover the building evacuated and surrounded by police...suspicious package.  fingers crossed.

      as usual the hermanussus is right.  listening to him describe the funk he is presently in, i couldn't empathise with him more...it's exactly how i feel: you're depressed.  external factors like the sun, friends, a film may temporarily and very briefly make you forget the shitty mood you've been in for months, but  the needle on your temper-meter wobbles a bit and flicks right back down to rage/self-pity/apathy/utter hopelessness/numbing boredom.  you trod along, fulfilling your "duties" as a friend, a student, a sexual being, and willingly, even, but somehow it just doesn't cut it.  and i just can't seem to  care .  not long enough to make a difference anyhow.    but then again, i'm probably just a spoilt brat, next week i'll forget i ever felt this way and wonder how anyone in my very privileged situation could be depressed.  oh i don't know.  i'm full of shit anyway.

      ded's sent me another recording, this time of one of paulinho da viola's classics on how samba inspiration hits only when you are longing for the one that broke your heart.  very pretty.  with pandeiro and all!    yesterday i lay by the bassin de la villette.  i think i may even have gotten some colour on may face.  i also learnt some words for my Grand O.  julien is teaching me useful phrases, for exemple, (said in a nasal, old-school french voice like those you hear in black and white films from the 50s), "il faut que tout chaaaange, pour que rien ne chaaaange." (taken from El Gato Pardo, Visconti, and regularly used in sociology conferences, apparently...).  also heard the premire partie de la biographie de michel foucault-LIVE, but i fell asleep around 1966 (it was very detailed).   some retained facts: foucault was born in poitiers, in a family of doctors, and he was urged to become one too, but his true passion was history.  in normal-sup, he was considered rather violent and a little nuts, he used to threaten his colleagues with a knife.    i noticed a poster for  urlLink noites do brasil  at the  urlLink glaz'art , on friday...with the orquestra do fub!  this time, i will be sure to go.  i've been itching to dance forr for some time now, it's gotten to the point where i'm dancing alone in my room, like when i was just learning back in rio.    i am now officially on holiday, but unofficially still very busy.  though not having class will make a big difference.  i wish i hadn't already used up my three-absences quota for all but one of my classes...my fault anyway.  i've got an italian exam coming up next tuesday, how i will pass i don't know, i really haven't retained a thing though my pronounciation has improved (very slightly).    laundry too...but my coin collection isn't big enough.  i haven't washed any clothes since BEFORE my holiday in new york...which means about a month?  starting to get dangerously close to the end of wearable underwear.  maybe today is the day...should i try a new laundrette?  the one on oberkampf looks friendlier than my regular laverie avenue de la rpublique.

      amazing the difference a couple of degrees makes, and SUN!  i'm in an incredible mood today, i think everyone is.  in for another night of work, this time with maria who's got her big oral tomorrow.    i went to the cours d'alphabtisation in the neuf-trois for the visite-terrain, my group project for my development class.  i sat in with the level 4 group.  everyone was very chatty and friendly, though i didn't get a chance to talk much to the students as class started straight away and i didn't want to disrupt the teacher.  i stupidly nodded off in the middle of the thing (it was three hours long and really warm and i only got 4 hours of sleep), it must've been obvious but everyone pretended not to notice.  then off to my brazil class, through which i slept as well, a lot more obviously though.    everything is happening at once, and somehow coming together despite all the stress of the previous 3 months.  our photojournalism dbat-confrence is taking place next tuesday already...wow!  i have no idea how it will turn out, but this weather makes everything seem ok, nothing really matters, it's sunny out!    my cat is rolling around on the  bed as if she'd just had catnip.    spring is really here!   yaaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaaaaahhhhhhheeeeeee!!!

      ded just sent me an mp3 of minha menina, with him on guitar and vocals!  one of the sweetest things anyone has done for me.  it brought back many memories of car rides and laying about singing and smoking.  he's got a really good voice too.  it was just very cute.    today i was having a lazy sunday, not moving much, reading, smoking, the usual, with the windows wide open to let the sun and warm air in, when the phone rang.  i don't really know why i picked it up because no one i know has that number, everyone just calls my mobile, and whenever it does ring it's a wrong number or a telemarketer.  well, i wasn't really thinking (my natural state) and answered.  on the other end, a very proffessional sounding masculine voice.  he told me he was carrying out a survey for some TV show blablabla, i would remain anonymous blablabla, and launched straight into the questions without giving me a chance to give him some weak excuse to hang up and continue my sunday lzardage in peace.    the questions started innocently enough, du genre "vous avez quel ge?  vous tes de quel origine?  vous fates quel taille?  et quel poitrine?  quel poid?"   then they got a little bit more os: "vous aviez quel ge quand vous avez fait l'amour pour la premire fois?  a c'est bien pass?"    then on to the "vous n'avez que rpondre oui ou non" questions (see, this was all very proffessional): "quand vous fates l'amour, vous fates le missionaire?"   "oui."    "et la levrette?"    "c'est quoi la levrette?  je connais pas les termes des positions sexuelles en franais."    "la levrette c'est quand la femme est sur les genoux et l'homme la pentre par derrire."   "ah, oui oui."    and onto sideways, lotus, etc, etc.  then, "et la sodomie?"    that, i understood.  "non, non, jamais."    "je vous explique, c'est comme la levrette mais l'homme vous pentre par l'anus."    "oui, je connais, mais non, je fais pas a."    "ah bon?  vous n'avez jamais fait a?"   "non, non, jamais."   and on and on, through "vous avalez?" and "vous ragissez comment pendant le sexe?  vous gemissez?  vous respirez profondment? vous hurlez?"   "ben, les trois, quoi, a dpend de l'ambiance aussi."    "ah, a doit tre bon avec vous."    "bah, chais pas, moi...coutez, vous tes sr que c'est un sondage pour la tl, a?"    "oui oui."   "ah bon."    "vous vous masturbez?  souvent?  c'tait quand la dernire fois?"  "je m'en souviens plus, a fait tellement longtemps."  "et vous faites quoi?  vous vous carresser?  vous vous mettez des doigts?"  ...hmm...  "vous aimez faire quoi pour donner plaisir  votre partenaire?"   "coutez, je suis plutt celle qui reot."    "ah bon.  mais il y surement quelque chose, comme la fellation."    "bah, oui, parfois."    "et vous le faites pendant combien de temps?"    "pas trs longtemps."    "une heure?"    "euh, non...plutt genre 5 minutes."  (c'est fatigant, quand mme!  i don't know a single person who will give a guy head for 30 minutes, let alone and hour!!)    i should've known something was fishy when he started making comments based on my answers, but he continued to be very proffessional and i didn't suspect a thing.  eventually, when we got to the end of the survey he asked me for the size of my trousers   "36 normalement, mais a dpend du magasin."  "vous avez des petites fesses, alors?"  "bah, ouais, un peu..."  and then, if i enjoyed phone sex, when had i tried, etc etc.  he then asked if we could exchange phone numbers.  no, thanks.  even if i leave you mine?  no, no, thanks.    "parce que je suis en train de me carresser."    "...euh...c'est pas un sondage pour la tl?"  "bah, non."    huh?  then i started laughing.  "coutez, merci pour votre intrt mais a m'intresse pas du tout."  "ah non?"  "non, non --hahaha-- merci quand mme, au revoir."  and that was that.  today, my record-breaking gullibility was once again made evident for all, or actually one very cheeky pervert, to enjoy.  i think i'll go touch myself now while thinking of getting sodomised.

      went to aphex twin...it was strange to say the least.  i arrived late and had to pick up my ticket from pierro's uncle at the bookshop, who scowled at me and didn't say a word as he handed it to me, i took my leave as quickly as i came in.  i entered the hall in which the show was in, it hadn't started, and managed to find pierro and his sister, who's name i was never told, and squeezed in onto the floor as we were all supposed to sit.  then there was announcement banning any smoking, drinking or dancing, that this wasn't a  boite  but a performance, and the show started.  richard d. james was nowhere to be seen, we were all facing what appeared to be a big screen.  the music began, well "music", more like very grinding beeps and what seemed like digitalised versions of breaking glass and pots and pans hitting the floor, then some, uh, artist behind the screen started to cut through it, turns out it was more like spandex, making little formations with holes and tying bits together here and there, while these "mini-tents" stuck above it grew and shrunk with annoying clicks.  meanwhile the noise continued and never did find a melody, or a beat of any sort for that matter, many people just walked out after 15 minutes.  as i had paid 20E i decided to sit it out, in the hopes that something exciting would eventually happen, but an hour and a half later nothing much had changed apart from the state of the spandex which now resembled a spiderweb through which you could catch glimpses of aphex twin in the back.  it ended with no climax, after all that racket i was expecting fireworks or something, but no, ended as abruptly and nonsensically as it had started.  i suppose it was meant to be very modern and clever and all that, but frankly i didn't get it and didn't enjoy it either.  hung out at the bookshop for a bit, where pierro's uncle finally talked to me, he told us that richard d. james had sat alone behind the screen all day without coming out and without talking to anyone.  i mean, i know he thinks he's ahead of everyone else, by five years to be exact (seth, a friend from brighton who is luke vibert's younger brother and used to get beaten up by richard and luke when he was younger, told me aphex twin had decided to take five years off between albums cuz that's how long it takes for the rest of the world to catch up with him...), but this was kind of silly.    anyway, we then headed for noura's, posh 16th lebanese fodder, for a sandwich and baklawa.  hors de prix, mais dlicieux!    have now come home, heading to bed, but i can now enjoy books in bed again thanks to my orange lamp so i'll probably stay up for too long and be late for the photojournalism meeting tomorrow.  we have finally gotten all our intervenants and can start on our "communications campaign".

      i had lunch with yehuda and charlotte at "Thai Classic", 41 rue de Belleville, trs bon resto (green curry not too spicy but very tasty, just how i like it).  missed another brazilian invite to a picnic in parc andr citron...shit.  they always call me about an hour before their rendez-vous, and by that point i've already arranged other things i can't drop, though i really really want to hang out with those kids.  especially now that i'll be taking the Oral de langues in portuguese.  plus they're brazilian.  so anyway, after lunch we walked down to mtro belleville and made our way down to pre lachaise as there was a super-fun brocante.  it took three hours and i'm 50? poorer.  yay...  no, but i got some cool stuff, like a completely useless cloth stool thing, very picnic-y and a '50s bright orange bedside lamp, an origami book in japanese (1?...i think i was his best client), two big bottles of contact cleaning liquid for 10?, a clock for my kitchen...nothing i  really  needed, but i couldn't help myself.  i saw a very very cool red bag, it said "STIMOROL chewing gum" on it, the stimorol was in blue and white, with these white lines in the background, chewing gum small on the side.  it was incredibly kitsch and i wanted it but for some reason 10? sounded like a lot.   tonight, aphex twin!  i think i'll be lending a hand at the bookshop of the palais de tokyo with pierro and his sister, apparently show nights are always very hectic and lots of book-knicking goes on.   i'm incredibly excited about my mac-session with adrien next week, when he will back up all my files on his superspeedy external hard drive and will perform a clean install of Panther on my computer, who is starting to have serious problems dealing with the load at the moment.  nothing seems to be working anymore.  well, no, it works but a mouline, a mouline...poisoned is completely dead.  norton antivirus quits itself without even opening.  dvds don't get automatically detected anymore, and neither to cameras.  i think i got carried away with downloading music and apps.   blablabla computer talk.  i sound  ridiculous.   i think my cat has an eye infection.  i need to take her to the vet anyway to update her shots, so i think i'll get her a general check-up as well.  we're both falling to pieces.   super sunny and warm today, makes me happy.

      mmmmmmmm....  went to my dner de confrence with my portuguese class at the caf carioca, rue de turenne, presqu' rpu.  the portions are not brazilian, but the food is good.  i like the level 4 group, the people are definitely not typique sciences po (like my italian class) and everyone's got something to say, people like to poke fun at each other and it's a good laugh all in all.  there's even a doctor in my class who's given me his card just in case i'm still ill next week, he has contacts and can get me appointments, he says.  so i consulted him about my back, which has been hurting quite insistently since i woke up from my sieste today.  i think it's stress.  it really hurts.  he suggested a kin, i am going down the same road as the Goodlife.  who's got the big french exam tomorrow.  all my thoughts with her.      things with louis have gone completely wobbly.  i was very happy a couple of days ago when out of the blue he  "promised" to try to come to some sort of decision.  it was a step forward.  but then yesterday he took it all back in the usual manner, i.e. "i can't give you what you need, live your life, you're doing it anyway, i'm not there."  as if it were all my fault.  as if he knows what i need. as if nothing at all is better.  i have ceased to comprehend.  it's the same line he used when i went to brazil, which means i know exactly what he's thinking, but it hurts to admit this to myself.  i fell for it again.  i feel pathetic.  i thought i was dealing with this okay, but at one point in our msn chat (always through damn messenger) i couldn't help but cry.  it's not something i've done in a very long time.  i've tried to explain to him in every way i can, but he doesn't get it.  or actually he does, but it's just not the right time for him or maybe i'm just not the right one.  i don't know.  he seems to think i'm forgetting him.  if he only knew.  i could talk about him endlessly and i would if it weren't for the fact that maria manages to change the subject once in a while.  bless.  anyway, it's very frustrating.  he's probably bored with the whole thing and forgetting me.  this fucking sucks.     i miss him.  poop.    going for lunch with my friend yehuda and his girlfriend charlotte tomorrow, in belleville.  i'll finally hear what went so wrong in cameroon.    miriam and ali were in town!!  actually, miriam is still here but she is leaving tomorrow for amsterdam, to spend a month in a flat her father's rented.  i may drop by for a visit next weekend when i've got time off from tuesday p.m.!  this weekend, though, promises to be a killer.  i've got  urlLink aphex twin  tomorrow night at the  urlLink palais de tokyo  to look forward to (pierro's uncle works there and got us tickets, which is cool because apparently it was as violent as the soldes prives).  he is going to have 54 speakers there!!!  it's going to be mad.  so anyway, miriam and ali.  we all went for dinner at les philosophes on wednesday evening and it was so much fun!  like old times, my year one at the IHT...james was spilling wine on himself, being silly but not annoying, and ali was simply hilarious as per usual.  miriam's hair has grown and she is getting blonder by the month!  nadia came with her irishman, marc got yasmine to come, nicolas showed up, thuy-tien as well.  she sent me a texto later saying she had found nicolas cute.  yes, and?  he fancied me first.  ha!  not that i'm going to make any moves.  this has grown kind of stale, considering it's been more than a year now.  i used to find him very attractive but now he's just kind of  fade .  he's very sympa.  maybe he's just too ginger.  what to do when you want someone to come along and sweep you off your feet to forget someone else, except you want that someone to be the one you want to forget?

      after having spent 7 months in brazil, i got over my relative indifference to "excessive" physical contact between friends and acquaintances.  "excessive" because before my conversion to public displays of affection, not just to significant others, i didn't actually think it was unnecessary, i just wasn't that bothered about it.  sure, i'd hug someone if they wanted a hug, but i wasn't doling them out un requested, and often felt slightly uncomfortable in the face of such overt, honest signs of affection.  all this changed with the help of my friends leo, vanessa and natalia, who are a bunch of lovey-dovey affection-giving big teddy bears i could hug and kiss all day.  i had forgotten how good it makes you feel to give and receive such manifestations of friendship and genuine caring, despite the fact that when i lived in japan it was everyday-fodder between my friends and me.  it sometimes felt uncomfortable seeing my parents be physical, as when i was little that didn't happen too often.  living in the united kingdom and in france, having to build new friendships from scratch and not being familiar with the limits others are accustomed to when it comes to contact, you tend to stick to the safe limits of physical affection so as to not offend or put your friends in uncomfortable positions.  and with that, i lost the habit.  it would still come back when i'd be in japan for the holidays, because my friends there continue to be very warm and affectionate, walking down streets with our arms around each other or hand in hand.  it was only with boyfriends that i felt completely at ease to give out hugs and kisses and hand-squeezes for no real reason, just to let them know how much i felt for them, to ease that feeling you get when the love you have, no matter how cheesy this sounds, is literally overflowing, pouring out, and the only thing you can do is to translate it into physical affection.  so anyway, with brazil, i've returned to a healthy fearless state of physical affection.  i like giving it, and it feels especially good when you get it back.  unfortunately, as predicted, my friends here are not all that up for it, so i've stopped showing it that much.  but,  urlLink this piece  in the new york times has made me wonder how people would react to this kind of behaviour in paris, where the  bise  is the only real acceptable greetings, with regional variations and spinoffs depending on the level of intimacy.  but, if it works to a certain extent in new york, could it work here?  it would be funny to see, but it certainly won't be me that's going to stand at les halles trying my luck.

         !!!!!!!  it's taken me half a year to discover the accent-friendly setting in the formatting.  i'm so happy!!!!   so, anyway, still ill as a dog.  i dont't know why, this is bizarre.  i've been in this blubbering, breathing through my mouth noisily, coughing up my lungs and cradling my head in my hands state since sunday.  and meanwhile i've been taking 4, yes 4 different kinds of medication to get this out of my system.  of cours i've completely forgotten about the vitamin C, so maybe that's where i've gone wrong.  i feel like death personnified.  i even missed an invitation to go eat some saturday feijoada with a bunch of brazilians at etienne marcel.  damn it.   the weather has been unblieavably shitty.  it is the 8th of may and we are currently at 10, todays maximum, and it's raining.  no, i will not leave the house.  people can come to me.  please come to me.  hello?  anyone?   actually there is a fte marocaine (ooo, look at that accent circonflexe!  it's a beauty, ainnit?) at a friend's house, but that is later.  on the other side of the city, so i probably won't stay for long.   i'd like to give J a ring to see what he is up to, just because i really enjoy spending time with him, but i don't want to come off as too keen.  because i'm not.  hmmm.  should i just wait for him to call me?  we're past the initial who calls first and how long do you wait phase (officially, 3 days, but who's counting?), and we've hung out enough to be allowed to ignore any rules on the frequency of phone calls, and yet i hesitate.   i think i'm going to crawl  back into bed and watch avril bris.   cough cough cough...

       urlLink eurotrash , a blog written by a brit in new york, has a hilarious  urlLink post  about her night out at the new york city ballet.  personally, i quite enjoy a night out at the theatre and, dare i say, is an annual ritual i perform with my mother when i go back to tokyo.  she always buys some tickets to see a piece on at that moment, invariably swan lake.  i've seen swan lake performed by every ballet company in the world, i think.  i could probably do some bits from it myself, if i got really drunk.  and i, too, have on some occasions attended very badly executed performances.  and the way eurotrash describes it is right on the spot.    today i went to a lecture at sciences po given by a brazilian economics proffessor, on the uniqueness of brazil as a nation through an analysis of its colonisation.  it was really interesting, shame he talked too much and never got to the end of his story.  but he was funny and it was nice to sit for 2 hours and listen to a sotaque brasileiro from a friendly face.    am no longer broke!!  the cashish from mommy has landed safely into my bank account, and i can start eating normally again.  on the bus home some worker of the ratp went up to the bus driver and complained rather aggressively about the latter's driving.  generalised shouting and fist-waving soon ensued, passengers taking sides, etc, the ratp worker got off and the bus driver gave us a speech.  then home.    borrowed some dvds and i plan to take "legally blonde 2" before turning in for the night.  tomorrow, "abril despeda?ado" (walter salles), with rodrigo santoro...mmmmm...  will also read "Histoire de Rio de Janeiro" for my putain de fiche de lecture due in a week.  it's from week 1...

      i finally had my expose today on "democratie et droits de l'homme: specificites occidentales?" for espace mondial.  it was ok.  my map was a bit crap, really.  but i think i may have gotten some sympathy from my maitre de conf as i brought in my medical slip from last week and this week i've got some flu or something.  slowly trying to nurse my why back into health, with the help of julien who cooked me a really nice dinner over at his house today after the bacon exhibit, which was good, though i doubt i actually took anything in as i was practically falling asleep on my feet.    after the musee maillol we walked to the luxembourg and sat in the sun for an ahour or so.  he's giving a conference this summer in english so i gave him an improvised phonetics lesson as he read "recycling the garbage can: bla bla bla" (some essay on some sociology theory called A Garbage Can Model).  didn't understand what he was saying, not because of his accent (which is good though it could use improvement.  hence, me) but because of what the article actually said.  crazy sociologists.  we were going to head home but then he invited me over to his and offered to make me dinner.  so we went to stalingrad, and i fell asleep in his bed (good matress).  two hours later he woke me up as food was on the table.  it was really good!  chicken in a turmeric and onion cream sauce with rice.  we ate with his flamates mattias who is soon heading to ougadougou for 4 years(!!!) and robin, who told us a story about a friend of his ending up with his girlfriend in a really nice house for one night thanks to some random (very generous) guy they met at dinner.  they even got free champagne on ice and a huge bowl of strawberries!  i hung out a little more at julien's, met some people that kept coming in and out of the house.  it really is a very social flat.  then eventually decided to come home as i have class tomorrow and i needed to catch up on the sleep i'd lost last night thanks to the expose.    louis was online this morning and he told me something that made me realise this is never going to work.  the more i think about it, the more it angers and saddens me: his dad offered a free weekend in paris (apres demain) and he turned it down, on account of it being too short and too much time traveling.  i couldn't quite believe it, and told him if my dad offered me the same deal to new york i wouldn't think twice and i would be on a plane in a heartbeat.  louis, on the other hand, would rather stay i new york and hang out with his friends and potential shags, i suppose, than come and see me, despite his declarations of love.  completely contradictory in my opinion, but there you have it.  actions speak so much louder than words.  i'm glad, i must admit, that i met julien when i did and that we are getting along so well together.  if it weren't for that one pleasant distraction in my life at the moment i would've probably freaked.  i often wonder why i keep realising louis is really not THAT into me, not enough for my standards anyway, and yet i keep going back to him in the naive hope that maybe, just maybe, this time he will realise that what we've got is incredible and must be maintained at all costs.  am i just holding onto a false image of what we are?  am i just too blinded by the pathetic hope that he is my soulmate when in fact he is just the equivalent of a pimple on a rhinocerous' butt?  why do i keep going back to someone that disappoints me  every time ?    julien is really nice.  i like him a lot.  we get along well, we laugh, we talk about stuff, he takes me seriously and i don't feel intellectually "inferior" as i do sometimes with louis.  and i have a gnawing feeling that louis never got fully over his ex-girlfriend daniela.  i should just move on.  thank god this is proving to be easier this time around, the last year has helped a lot.  this only has to happen a couple more times and i'll be cured!

       life has taken some unexpected turns.   i returned from new york on the 16th, for maria's birthday which i ended up not attending as my head was spinning and i thought i was going to fall over.  i went home early and went straight to bed, not waking up until 3pm the next day.  since, it's been a ton of work for sciences po that i never manage to finish (still working on it!) and some interesting developments in the multi-part plan.     plan Abelman:  we came to no decision.  or rather, i passed him the ball and he decided to hit it into the net, and neither one of us is willing to go and get it.  and if i try to go get another tennis partner while he decides on whether or not he can afford to go get the damn ball, he gets all huffy and puffy and practically blames me for his poor forehand skills.  i kept bringing up the need to decide on something concrete --either we stay together and plan a proper reunion, one that lasts longer than two weeks, or we decide to call it off-- but he kept avoiding question and we ended up deciding on not deciding, which is a decision in itself.  as i understand it, we are free to do whatever we please with whomever we please.  which made me sad.  because i would commit to him in a heartbeat, if he asked me to and promised me he would do the same.  does he know this?  i think so.     plan J:  working wonders.  wasn't at all sure i wanted to see him again, not so soon anyway, when i first returned from new york.  i certainly wasn't going to call him!  so in my passivity, other people decided to take matters into their own hands.  more precisely, maria.  or rather, she just facilitated the process, shall we say...  as i was going home from sciences po one evening i got a call when i was around st. michel in the metro.  maria telling me to go the boys', and that a certain someone was there too.  i don't know why but i went.  and proceeded to ignore julien for the whole evening.  which was weird...we made some eye contact, namely when he passed me a joint at some point, but all in all we exchanged very few words.  then that same night...i don't know what came over me...i wrote him a texto saying we should get together for drinks or something after i was done with all my work.  which he replied to saying "thursday or friday?"  no news until friday when he called me.  and we went to the trois tetards.  and he ended up coming over.  it was odd but i discovered he is dede the brazilian cunniking's parisian counterpart!  hip hip hooray!  he did confront me about the presence of another man in my life (everyone told him about louis), we talked about it, all is clear and cool.   we saw each other again on sunday, but with the kids at the park by the canal.  had pho and spring rolls at huong duong with simon maria and julien, then went home i think...?  can't remember.  no actually, he came over again!  didn't see him until the next friday, when he joined us at the popin for sylvie's birthday, which was kind of lame.  the popin is really on again off again...this time it was most certainly very very off.  music was less than mediocre and the men were slimey.  not to mention it was packed, as usual, and impossible to hear what anyone was saying.  i don't know why we keep going back there.    anyway, that whole little offhand meeting unfurled into quite the commendable weekend...he stayed over again, the next day we went for pho and spring rolls at huong duong, comme d'hab, then a walk up to his place in stalingrad (uncomfortably close to lou's old place...i'd actually noticed that building before) and met his flatmates.  he lives in what is the parisian equivalent of the houses i lived in with my mates in brighton.  very studenty, lots of smoking, video games, people walking in and out, chilled out.  then joined maria and troy at l'arlequin pour le festival de cinema bresilien to see "deus e brasileiro".  nice film, nothing spectacular.  we were all going home, our separate ways, when julien's phone rang and his friend agnes excitedly told him about the "chapiteau electrique", some modern-day circus in stalingrad, so we decided to all go, but first stopped by his house for a bit.  which turned into a lot, the chapiteau plan fell through and the party was held there at the house.  met some more people, got hungry, julien made me some food, and i ended up accepting his offer to sleep at his.  it was really nice.  really really nice.    the next day we got up pretty late, had tea, talked about sociology, multiculturalism, etc, watched a video from the '70s of chomsky vs foucault, he showed me his memoire de DEA (on la recherche agronome...?), hung out, smoked, watched "groundhog day", listened to hip hop, watched a kourtrajme video (very funny kebab action), smoked some more, and went to join troy and maria at oberkampf for a steak.  he left then, it was a very brief goodbye, weird considering we were basically attached at the waist during the previous 48 hours, but there was a kiss involved.  i emailed him the link to  424 sound monster  and thomas's  blond frog .  he emailed me a  link  of his own.  i replied with yet another   link .  no news since then...  but!  we  did  plan to see the  francis bacon exhibit  together this week.  will he reply to my mail one of these days?  according to maria and troy, a sharing of noam and michel can not be dismissed lightly...although i would have interpreted this more as cheeky sunday amusement...not sure...either way, i had a really nice weekend with julien, and i hope i see him again.  soon.     on the N(icolas) front:  finally saw him with marc and his friend noura and a friend of hers.  they all suddenly decided they needed to go home at around 11pm, so nico and i stayed on for a bit at the bar and chatted about stuff, mainly our need to leave paris, my stay in brazil, kim in colombia (who's apparently bought a bar!!?!), his upcoming time at his mates' house for a proper metrosexual weekend, etc.  i sent him the links to the brazil photos, and he wrote back straight away saying they were really nice and that i looked very cute in them.  hmmm...  i like nico, but right now, i'm leaning more towards julien.     louis in all of this ::  not happy.  but, when was he ever happy?  i told him how i felt, he didn't want to commit, so this leaves us to do what we wish, no?  he kept insisting i tell him about julien, so i told him i snogged him.  then he got all upset, defensive, sad...i don't know what i'm supposed to do to make him happy, but my actions were not wrong.  i still love him, but i'm a little pissed off at him right now.  he said some pretty shitty things to me on msn today.  he needs to sort it out.

      jessterday, we go to zoo!!  many flaked out, citing moral qualms/cousins in town/can't be arsed, but us three (simon, julien and i), the sunday troopers, we went and had a whaaale of a time.  (pardon the pun, we didn't actually see any though.)  what we  did  see:   baboons sticking fingers up each other's butts! the zoo-choo-choo! the nostrils of a hippo!  a female zookeeper, looking very sexy in her thigh-high wellington boots, wading through the gibbons's moat.    several zebras! even more giraffes! a rasta-man rhyming to his baby girl about "le loup antartique"! l'enfant-mullet!    the hippo-nains had decided to hide in the thick shrubbery and thetigers decided to do the same, but the baboons were immensely entertaining and the giraffes, despite their little brains, were very pretty.  it was more entertaining than watching fasion tv in the middle of the night.  julien fed an abandoned fish to an obese seal by poking the fish with a long stick over into the pool.    we laughed lots at the enfant-mullet and i even took a picture.  click on mai/juin on the right for the updated album.  also, videos of the baboons.  hell yeah.  later we ooohed and aaahed at the  muse des arts d'afrique et de l'ocanie  building.  we had a bit of a lie-about by the lake, then headed for soup (yay!).    today, i revised ALL DAY.  incroyable.  it's so much easier to revise when i'm not at home.  i also ate all day.  my, uh, belly is growing, and i'm not the only one that thinks so.  heh, heheh...  oh whatever, i'll eventually join yves at the pool.  i'll lose it soon enough.    oh and i ate a ton of cherries today.  it has been a succesful weekend.  now, hardcore until wednesday afternoon and then i am officially unemployed, hurrah!  and let us all welcome the two new additions to the blogging world this week: luizinho et natouche!

      saw  la bataille d'alger  yesterday...left me speechless, breathless, completely blown away.  what a film.    i've also noticed my thought processes have changed recently.  i think my revision and exams  are getting to me, but i like it.  i feel like i'm awake again.  also, having miriam and yves around to listen to makes me feel like i'm taking it all in and it's making me smarter.  whether it actually is is a different story.     been reading too, and not just stuff for school.  finally picked up  russian dbutante's handbook .  he is going to prava now.  the crazy catalan and peach cadillacs was hilarious.    as a matter of fact, i think i'll go to bed now and read before turning in for the night.

      et que c'est bon!   urlLink  avignon, il fait beau 300 jours par an!     yesterday:  la mala educacin .  liked it a lot.  the end, actually, may have been a little too much explanation, but maybe he did that do show the "dirtier" side of reality.  i dunno.  i still really liked it.  the pool scene was beautifully shot.    today:  shrek 2 .  fun, lots of pop-culture references, miriam got teary-eyed at the end.  i prefered the first one, though.  antonio banderas/puss-in-boots was great.  especially the "iz not mine, man."    a '50s band was playing at the mairie du 3me this evening.  it felt like we were in a little village of france.  i like summer in paris.    simon, leila, thuy-tien, adam and marc all had their grand O today, and they prepared all in the same room.  kind of funny.    my cat is sitting under the bed for no reason.  she can stare at a spot on the floor forever.

      uh, this is why i'm broke: everytime i've finished a synthse/fiche/expos/exam, i go shopping.  and spend at least 100 Euros.  everytime.  today was no exception.  but i got the prettiest green dress  ever , and a green top, and a white off-the shoulder shirt as well.    i've also been told that perrineau is more of a politologue than a sociologue.  all he does is write entire books about election results.  i can't imagine anything more tiresome than spending your entire life analysing the political and sociological meaning of voter statistics, but hey, chacun son truc.    going to see  la mala educacin  with chris in a bit!  yay!  i'm practically on holiday!

      had my oral de langues.  text on lula and how he has filled the role of the leader amongst the developing countries, especially in latin america.  c'tait tranquil.  being the airhead that i am, i got to school at 11h, though my exam was not until 14h30.  so i was obliged to stay and "hang out" at sciences po.  read about three  urlLink vejas  at the library, read my february issue of  urlLink bravo  cover to cover.    woooo!  i'm going to avignon for four days after my grand O!!!    i am no longer bored and annoyed.  that was just a minor hiccup...sorted itself out almost miraculously...funny how much one thing going wrong can turn the rest of your life into poop.  now it's all about OPTIMISM!  CONFIDENCE! INDEPENDENCE!  THE WORLD IS MY OYSTER! or something...  so, i've discovered that the prsident du jury for my grand oral is  urlLink pascal perrineau , head of the  urlLink CEVIPOF , which is terrifying, but apparently he is a sociologist and it will probably be very  caf du commerce ...so i plan to engage julien in many a sociological conversation and religiously read and memorise le monde from today til the first of july.  although i am extremely scared of the grand O itself, i am not at all worried about the outcome, as less than 50% of students pass anyway, the moyenne being somewhere around 6 or 7.  it would be kind of nice to pass though.    i was also very surprised to find out that a lot more people than i thought are obliged to take the grand crit because they failed the exam for enjeux po or espace mondial.  i am not alone, though it is still a bit of an embarrassment.    so, today being fte de la musique i thought i would be very bitter about having to stay in and re-revise my espace mondial for my 8h30 tomorrow.  but it's shitty out, even cold, and it could never beat last year's wild night/morning, so i'm quite content about taking it easy and maxing out my highlighters.  any phonecalls/emails of encouragement/distraction are, however, most welcome.

      it has been one of the crazier weeks of late...and just so i can keep it straight in mind, i will provide you with a recap:  the improvised satllit session on  saturday  (and when is the satllit not improvised) was only really worth it for richard's lips.  oh those luscious lips.  i was thoroughly wasted, yet didn't notice them until we were all sitting on the terre-plein at richard lenoir, and i was trying to stop his hiccups, unfortunately by talking to him and not, as i should've, by jumping on him.  well, i'm sure we'll be seeing more of him this summer.     sunday  was a painfully slow day if there ever was one.  i kept going back to bed while pretending to miriam that i was helping with the writing of the mejicano's page.  we did get it done, though, at 2 in the morning.  results out tonight!   monday:  still recovering from the saturday madness, had a soup with maria at the conference room/canteen.  we then headed to l'autre for a coffee and i tried to revise after she left, got interrupted by a slightly demanding julien, headed home, tried to revise some more, went to bed.     tuesday  was big exam day, where i got to spend four hours writing with the bullshit-pen.  about "globalisation, libert et coercition".  yeh, you can take it in any fucking direction, so i led it in the general direction of my ass.  my map (last half hour) was really funny too.  with all sorts of colours: red, green, pink, blue, orange...much needed break at marc's, then lovely dinner at the charbon with ali baba, masha and marie.  who has humongous tits.    that night, being maria's last, was when the Es didn't work, but the dancing came anyway.    sylvie came, cried, took a million pictures and disappeared at 2am.  the remainder of us hobbled up to the nouveau casino, only to find it firmly shut, so citha it was.  what a crap bar.     wednesday , d-day, fnac(books), maria's (delivery and joints), shoved her into a taxi, waved a teary good-bye, had another soup w miriam, headed home to try to do the fiche (aaaahaha), only to fail miserably with the help of julien.  ah, at least i got  something  out of that night.  and not just a free nutella crpe.   next day:  zadig & voltaire w miriam, i love sales, even if they are not  really  sales.  really, -30% is not nearly enough.  i got a black jacket and a really nice pink top anyway.  coffee w amir and marie.  oh man, amir is HOT!  he is so cute.  and he knows how to keep the eye contact going.  oh i was all flustered inside, i think miriam was too.    the highlight of the day must've been my dinner in the 14th with pauline and the rest of them, including benji.  he had lost 7kg and none of his endearing qualities: one of the first things he said to me was, "wow, you really lost some weight!" and then throughout the night we were given the privilege of hearing about his most recent sexual exploits, including his latest fuck who has implants.  apparently it is true that they stay up even when lying down, and "c'est dmentiel."  he's also fucking a set of twins.  he did have a big cock, that's one thing he had going for him.    so anyway, saw amir again that night, at the canal w yves marc marie & co.  the french kids left, and we headed to ste marthe for a nightcap.  ooooh, amir is so cute...so cute, so cute...  later, going home, and thank god yves accompanied me with a percolator in one hand and a newspaper in the other (for that slapstick element), st maur once again proved itself to be the seediest of streets in paris.    surfing my usual web-stops, i found  urlLink this  good read. made me giggle/sweat in self-recognition...and shame?  most of it is basically a word-to-word transcript of my last year and a half, so why the fuck am i still allowing any of it affect me?  and i respond, despite meself... and so this is to those guys who can't make their minds up (and there are so many...), and then regret it later: fuck off!  stop playing your damn games!  if you can't follow through, don't even start.  and i hate maria even more!!!!!  she knows why  ;-)

      after the first few arrivals, the departures have begun.  what will we do with ourselves now that maria is gone?  miriam, though, is the proud new subletter of the sainte-marthe Blackhole Of Love.     wow, i painfully miss maria already.  but knowing that she's going to be lying on the beach or going to football matches (can you do the two at once?) for the next month before embarking on the southern-europe car tour kind of makes me hate her.  bitch.    oh my god, how silly is marie?  and how silly is ali?? ("keeping the cobwebs off my flesh"???)    when will Es start working again?  why does ritalin get me higher than ecstasy?    tomorrow we go to the zadig & voltaire soldes prives...and tt has no idea.  and why is her "people are in town" radar so powerful?  why is she always THERE?  well whatever, favela last night was loads of fun though the last-resort citha was somewhat of a disaster.  9 euro cocktails and seedy men in hoodies lurking in dark corners.  the bartender, though, was disconcertingly cheerul.    i'm going to try to put my hammock up in my room this week.  it's long enough to hang across my room, by the window, so my head will be right where the sun comes in in late afternoon.  it's also the best hammock in the world, bought at a market in fortaleza for R$16.  nap-time before i tackle the fiche the lecture.

      so, i tried today, to make an effort.  i called J after revising for an hour or so at l'autre and he came by to say hi.  mais nooooon!  how is it i'm bored already?  shit.    honestly, i'd rather be spending the time revising, which is saying a lot.  but i fear that even if i didn't have all this revision right now, i'd still prefer hanging out with  everyone  else.   o qu que pode fazeeeer, um corao machucaaaadoooo?   o qu que pode fazeeeer, um corao imprudeeeenteeee, se no fugir um poquinho do seu bater descuidaaaadooo?     back to work, then...

      sometimes i wonder where chris comes from.  excerpts from a few textos that were exchanged this morning, 4h30 (i was in bed):  "Mnita, eres acaso slo un espejismo de lo que fue entre mis sueos?" i was asleep, and confused, so i ignored it.  3 minutes later:  "where ARE you?" to which i replied that i was in bed, exam tomorrow, and had he taken ritalin again?  then: "i don't do that shiite.  body's a temple.  Xs leave me wordless, dont, i feel, rep a uald ex. do you lve in Prs?"   ...??????  i replied saying oh, then it's probably your boozin' night.  i'm touched by your poetry, see you at the picnic, good night or something along those lines, i didn't hear from him again.  maybe he got the wrong number?  i am very confused.    of course i overslept by two hours.  and a just in case recheck of my exam time has saved me: they have changed it and pulled it forward by two hours.    been getting some interesting replies to my new email message.  there too, je me pose des questions.

      a few random thoughts that have crossed my mind since i woke up:     i prefer brown sugar to white sugar (especially in my fromage blanc)    my cat is the best-smelling cat in the world    must change my sheets    why are brazil nuts called brazil nuts instead of cashew nuts being called brazil nuts?  i don't even know what a brazil nut looks like (though they are apparently present in my cereal)    the spot on the side of my face, which looks more like an insect bite, really hurts    should i sit at my desk and revise or sit at the chat noir and take notes there?   as you can see, i have not done much thinking since marc woke me up at half past noon.  i have smoked several cigarettes and have not even had my coffee.  marc did his 20-page mmoire in a night, while playing with gmail.  he even created a macro in word that changed his outlook-imported email addresses from yahoo into text files, to paste into his official "i have moved" mass email.  in the middle of the night.  i have created a monster.  but he still managed to finish his mmoire.    watch  urlLink this .  this month's  urlLink technikart  has a group of articles on the modern-day demise of long-term relationships:  "Copains, femmes, enfants, boulot, tout le monde se quitte sans vraiment en avoir envie.  Casse-toi, mon amour !  serait-il devenu le slogan de la dcennie ?" .  when we start seeing someone, we assume it's going to end anyway.  and when there is no reason, we make one (or several) up.  it rung true.  it is unavailable online, perhaps i will transcribe the best bits.  in the middle of the night.

      i have succumbed to the procrastination bug and have given my blog a completely new look.  i have appropriated this blog to such an extent i use it as a shopping substitute: when the cash is sparse, instead of going to h&m i give the blog a makeover.    i have just realised that my new deodorant smells of thuy-tien's old perfume.  objectively, this is good, as she always smelled very nice.  subjectively, though...i guess i will get used to it.  it really does smell very good though.    i had my last lesson at sciences po today.  i passed espace mondial.  i failed brsil: diversit comme identit, as i never did hand in the fiche de lecture.  oops.  but yes, those yoga credits...i didn't have to use them for italian, which i miraculously managed to pass as well.  i have turned into such an under-average student.  this does not make me proud.  too late now.  perhaps i will dchirer for my exams.  like my grand O.  hahahaha.  ha.    honey, look!  comment tags have appeared beneath each post!  a euro-cent for your thoughts.

      all this pink might make you a little self-conscious, especially if you're reading this from your workplace (elbow elbow, etc etc), but i'm getting really tired of my template and for now i'll just change the colours while i decide to finally make the big jump and changer de look.  i may just adopt a ready-made blogger template and fiddle with it.  when i'm revising for exams.  like now.    ooooh!  some weird gossip concerning richard descoings, notre cher directeur de sciences po.  so, he was overtly homosexual, was  PaCS  and everything, until two weeks ago when he gets married to...Nadia Granier-Deferre, directrice-adjointe de l'IEP.  surname sound familiar?  yes, she is karine's (from library) step-mother, or was, i guess?  anyway, this has a political twist to it as descoings is said to be up for the education minister job.  he used to be in the PS, but G-D is conseillre  l'ducation at the UMP.  apparently toutes les grosses ttes de l'UMP were at the wedding.    orage demain?  it was so incredibly hot today.  i think my tan is slowly being reactivated.  funny, it's basically the same weather in new york, paris and rio.

      (systematically in the red, systematically late, systematically lazy as fuck)  but we're getting there.   summer is HERE.   none of this "kind of warm" bullshit, 30C and people getting burnt!  this past weekend was a blast, what with miriam in town and yves as well!  saturday: printemps des rue with the chinese lanterns on the canal.  sunday: late lunch at le charbon with yves and miriam, mini-expedition to the butte-chaumont, armed with le monde diplo, le monde weekend, le courrier international and technikart, where we lay about for the entire afternoon, then dinner at nashwa (maff au poulet, eaten by yves with his fingers and with cutlery by the rest of us), and a "nightcap" at maria's that inevitably ended with the initiation wig.    attending my last classes this week...funny to think it's all over.  i wish i'd done some more work, but i guess i'll just have to wing it saturday onwards, when my exams start.    some interesting freelance ideas have been flying around, as we are all encouraging miriam to write this summer before she joins the conservatives in bologna: the flower vendor story, for starters.  james has apparently come back from nice with practically a third degree burn.    it's sleeping-with-the-windows-wide-open season again.  and this year round, i've got the nifty electric fan my subletter bought, a relic of last year's canicule i was lucky enough to miss.  we are wondering, can heatwaves occur two years in a row??    new favourite saucisson:   urlLink figatelli!!!    corsican salami with liver, slightly smoked.  delicious.  i have never had salami so addictive.

       "The tongue, on the other hand, is under our direct control, has no time constraints and can be manipulated with expert precision. Unlike the penis, it's effective when hard or soft, and never gets over-heated. When using his tongue, a man doesn't have to worry about fatiguing, nor does he need fret over premature ejaculation or impotence. He can relax and enjoy the act of giving.    But having the right tool is just a start; you need to know how to use it.  Many women complain woefully about men's oral techniques:  the lack of consistent, rhythmic pressure; their roughness; the mad stampede for the clitoris."    i'm sure this isn't a first, but finally a book dedicated fully to the art of cunnilingus.   urlLink read more

      in someone's playstation, maybe?  we had finally decided on doing the goonies dvd viewing that had been put off for so long.  after my last portuguese lesson i rushed to the video store on parmentier to rent it out, only to be told the last person who had borrowed it had returned a playstation cd in place of the film!!  so no  goonies , so  lost in la mancha  instead.  it was fun but really, it would've been better with  the goonies .    tonight: canal festival!  last year was beautiful, despite the paraffin-scented breeze.  this year, it's chinese lanterns.    the weather is warmer again.  exams start in exactly a week.    miriam will be living in maria's flat this summer.  yves is in town.  people are slowly warming up, the summer promises to be legendary.  i am very excited.    i've also decided to stay in paris.  i feel as if i've just returned from brazil, haven't yet had time to take a breather.  i want to find a job and live for a bit before i run off again and live out of a suitcase.  even when i'm fed up and bored of everything, i can't bring myself to leave.  weekends away, sure.  but in some way, the best part about going away for short trips is the fact you can always  come back  to paris.  i love this place.  i love it i love it i love it.   oh, a very funny  urlLink article  louis sent me on the WBM, or the White Boy Mope.  does judy mcguire know the same guy i know?  i didn't realise this was such a widespread phenomenon.

      (unless you're miriam, in which case, i'm your technological/life advisor)  i love it.  harry potter was loads of fun though we were disappointed in sirius black...julien and i had both imagined him a lot "cleaner" and tall dark and handsome.  harry, though, is looking gooood!!!  draco has grown a ton.  hermione is getting prettier and growing breasts.  ron is looking atrocious.    i am on ritalin and coffee, finishing up my multiculturalism synthse at 3.25am, i have convinced miriam to start reading the harry potter books and she is doing so on my bed, half asleep.  strangely resembling my cat.    nice this weekend...is off...too much to do, exams next week, books to read, sleep to catch up on.  DANCING TO BE DONE.    donnie wahlberg was my favourite new kid.  danny wood my least favourite.  where are they now?  oh my god miriam just told me that jordan knight just came out with a solo album and she also has joey mcintyre's autograph!  oh oh oh oh oh, the right stuff.

      i am so incredibly excited... aaaaaaaaaHARRYPOTTERCOMESOUTTOMORROW!!!!!!!!!!!  two days before it comes out anywhere else.  oh yeah.    i have even downloaded the trailers (both of them), after having seen them several times.  now i can watch them over and over again until i get to go to the cinema tomorrow.  oh my god.  i am so excited.  for those of you haven't seen it (or have, but would like to see it again.  and again.  and again...), you can download the two trailers  urlLink here .  and if you get bored with the trailers, go get yourself  urlLink sorted .  i'm a gryffindor.  cuz i'm cool like that.  ehrm...still procrastinating furiously.  it's all cold and rainy again.    had coffee and cigarettes with thomas today, when he gave me a copy of his new book of illustrations to be translated by friday.  i think it may be kind of fun.  toto is really such a good guy.  he's really funny too.  and he knew, of course.  hahaha.

      i had dinner with my friend takeo today.  takeo and i go back to 6th grade, and we were really good friends in high school.  we went interrailing together summer after graduation.  he is one of the few people i have kept in touch with since moving to europe.  he is now working for bloomberg, living with his girlfriend in a really nice studio (tokyo terms, which means they're also paying about 2000 euros per month), and is getting married in march.  he then continued on to a club with  our friend ken bengoa, fellow nippo-espagnol, whom i hadn't seen in years and years.  tomorrow we are all going to hang out in daikanyama, a quieter neighbourhood than shibuya or harajuku but with really nice cafs and thrift stores and little cute shops.    today, on our way to dinner, we came upon a summer festival:

      after a day of travel (barcelona-paris-tokyo) i have finally landed (softly, softly) on my parents' couch, looking not unlike their obese cat, who has been oddly friendly to me this time. usually she just ignores me, today i even got her to purr.  it is humid here. just as muggy as rio on a hot summer day, but summer in japan doesn't smell like any season anywhere else in the world. it sends me hurtling back to my childhood (sticky arms, bug inspections, climbing over walls, water balloons and the smell of rubber, fire crackers). right now, sitting at the dining table, i can smell scents so japanese and so familiar i can't believe i hadn't smelled them for years now: rice cooking, fuzzy white peaches, their fragrance being picked up by the soft breeze coming through the kitchen window, the spiciness of humid wood. come to think of it, japanese summers have very much of a  wind-up bird chronicle  atmosphere about them. and miyazaki. totoro. no matter how old you get, the forest really could have several resident furry forest gods, and you could be picked up by the cat bus in the middle of the night.  finished  white teeth  (loved it!) and started  rien de grave , by justine lvy (daughter of bernarnd henri-lvy), the book about her husband raphal enthoven running off with carla bruni (her husbands's dad's girlfriend) and her mother and her grandmother dying the same year, pure drama and tragedy, but it all sparked my morbid  pipole  interest back in march, when one day i saw her on canal +.   so far, it is exactly what i expected.

      oh man, my family is driving me nuts.&nbsp; today i had my first argument with my aunt.&nbsp; i'm fed up.&nbsp; everyone thinks i'm this spoilt brat, that all i do is spend my mother's money.&nbsp; everyone seems to have conveniently forgotten the fact that i actually worked for two years and paid for sciences po myself, and that i've actually gotten myself a masters at the best political science institute in france.&nbsp; and never failed a year.&nbsp; and paid for brazil myself.&nbsp; and only because my mother has had to bail me out this past semester,&nbsp; i'm back to be treated like the little princess they think i am.&nbsp; ok, so i live well, but it's like that's some kind of crime.&nbsp; what is wrong with working hard and living it up at the same time.&nbsp; nevermind the fact that i don't kill myself, but last year when i was working and studying i think i was working pretty hard.&nbsp; anyway, it's only been a week and i want to leave already.&nbsp; fuck pool and sun.&nbsp; i can't deal with never being taken seriously because apparently all my life i've had everything served to me on a silver platter.&nbsp;  there is a gorgeous sunset outside, and all i can think is how angry this makes me feel.&nbsp; my family has this way of making me feel like a teenager all over again.&nbsp; nothing is good enough for them.&nbsp;  i need a cigarette.&nbsp; oh that's another thing they are constantly lecturing me about.&nbsp; i can not deal.&nbsp;

      look-y here, a photo from the birthday party this weekend:   pretty nice, eh?  we could see a vineyard down below, and mountains.  according to julien's grandfather, a group of tziganes settled down there in the 18th century and created their own little republic.    the weather is atrocious, totally inacceptable for the month of july, the mto is having yet another existential crisis and is acting as if it were october.  thank god for my lovely zadig & voltaire jacket...   we had dinner at the palais de tokyo, and it really is a quite the discovery.  their food is excellent.  their music was a lot of fun too.  i think i really am in heat.  yesterday i flirted like mad with the bartender at andy whaloo, qui "a craqu" pour moi!  he was flaming, though, so i'm not sure how that works.    aussi: i've been listening to  urlLink this  every day this past week.  it's a little mosaic of prose and poems read outloud, with musical intervals from the 50s and 60s, bits of films here and there.  have a little listen.

      new links added to the sidebar:  urlLink avignon photos , chapelle's show  urlLink videos page , and, la crme de la crme:  urlLink elektronik supersonik (via L, thank you, oh, thank you).    as some of you know already, since i finished  russian debutante,  all my dreams have been about russian mafiosi.  i wake up every morning feeling like vladimir girshkin.    last night we went to see  urlLink fahrenheit 9/11 .  though obviously one-sided and manipulative, i still found it to be powerful and am very glad it is enjoying success in the US.  as a matter of fact, it has been doing incredibly well in france as well.  only yesterday: 100,000 spectators in france, 30,000 in paris.  pretty good for a first day, no?  started reading  les particules lmentaires  de michel houellebecq, though i still need to finish  anna karenina ,  love in the time of cholera ,  blindness  and  les choses .    on my pending pile:     white teeth (z. smith)    the fight (n. mailer)     a clockwork orange (s. burgess)    le brsil, terre d'avenir (s. zweig)    si c'est un homme (p. levi)    homage to catalonia (g. orwell)    absalom, absalom! (w. faulkner)    histoire de la sexualit (m. foucault)    w, ou le souvenir d'enfance (g. perec)    ada, or ardor (v. nabokov) **actually, i want to read more of his stuff before i read this one.  suggestions?     anything else any of you think i should be reading, let me know!

      avignon was  lovely .  four days of laziness and poolside  bronzette  punctuated by three-hour long meals, apricots falling from trees and refills of ros, with evenings dedicated to parties in mansions perched on mountaintops and never-ending  apros  in town.  all but mattias from stal were in avignon, so familiar faces abounded.  simon and leila dropped by on monday: we celebrated with a barbecue.  went to  urlLink sixpack , did a little t-shirt gift exchange with julien ( urlLink this  for him).  the  urlLink guy  that owns the store used to graf with julien back in the day, they were even going to do some t-shirts together but never did.    julien's parents were cool, very chilled out and like to eat, which suited me fine.  his grandparents were hip too, i especially liked his grandfather.  we had lunch with them twice.  the second time i came out of it a little frazzled, a bit choked up.  they reminded me too much of my own grandparents, who are not doing well at all right now.    so today is my mother's birthday.  i rang her this morning, she was at the hospital with my grandmother.  my grandmother sounds good, but she's not yet deemed well enough to get out of bed.  i also spoke to my grandfather, who was at home.  he left the house for a fifteen minute walk today!  diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, prostate problems...they are getting old.  i am having trouble fully realising this simple fact.    also just finished  the russian debutante's handbook .  it was loads of fun.  i am slowly making my way through the pending pile.  i am very much enjoying being a ble to read without feeling guilty.

      i am officially on holiday and unemployed!  had my grand oral (" peut-on caractriser l'identit d'un peuple? "), the jury were friendly enough, pascal perrineau effectively had a  mche , and i lost my train of thought in the middle of a reply or forgot my words, as predicted.  but l'essentiel c'est que c'est fini!!!    so we had dinner at les philosophes with miriam, nika, nadia, her boyfriend simon aaaaaand...mauricio....*sigh*  oooh... the man oozes sex from every pore.  and we discovered our mutual love for forr...oh, i can only image what it is like to dance a xote bem coladinho with him.  my goodness.  so it turns out he is always at all the brazilian nights in ny, including black betty's on sundays.  miriam and nika both thought that he was into me, but they failed to tell me this before it was too late, when we all went our separate ways after failing to get some kind of dancing outing started.  what, was i supposed to know?  but seriously, i did sense something there, i had just put it down to my animal attraction for the guy.  anyhow, the idea that i should just show up at his door (nadia, with whom he is staying, had gone to spend the night at simon's) got thrown around a bit.  but no, 'twas too late.  and now i will never see him again.   the tragic frustration!  but today i go to avignon!  woo hoo!  holiday from everything.  and lots of food.

      something really funny, but great for julien: he's been asked if he wants to teach sociology to first-years at sciences po next year!  wow.  i think this is funny for two reasons: just for the fact that someone i know quite intimately may be, in someone's else's eyes, that fucking matre de conf you can't stand, or au contraire, the young female students' crush.  i also giggle at this because i wonder if he'll be very serious or be the "cool" teacher, integrating into his confrence speech the slang he uses all the time with us ("zaaazaa!" and "coco", notably).  plus, it's not like he's got a very imposing physique, being only slightly taller than me.  but, i think this is GREAT.  he will make an excellent matre de confrence, not only because he has a huge brain but also because he is very good at all that is pedagogical, and is patient and knows how to explain things in interesting ways without dumbing down the question.  and he'd like to teach anyway.  i'm so happy for him!  plus, his credibility can't go anywhere but up by having teaching at sciences po on his cv.    so yay for julien!

      sorry i've been lazy with this, disappointing my, uh, faithful readers on a daily basis. but i'm sure you've got plenty of other stuff to read, things to write, people to interview, places to go. well anyway, updates,updates. what i've done since last week:      (finally) learned the rules of baseball. they aren't so complicated! what was the trouble before? i think i may start following it. i'd like to go to a game. why did i not do this before i dropped by new york? that would've been a ton of fun.      gone to the beach alone and gotten harassed by some japanese college guy who had seen me on the train with my mother two nights before. he even pulled down the hem of my skirt that had gone up with the wind. weirdo. i left in a hurry, after i managed to wring my hand out of his very strong grip. ew.      watched japan beat china in the asian cup final!!! we really couldn't lose that game. i remember when algeria booed during the french national anthem during a friendly, chirac made official statements and all. we won 3-1, and the stadium emptied a minute before the end of the match. only the handful of japanese fans that had braved it to beijing were left to watch the ceremony. they were then escorted home by the military on special buses, and chinese fans threw stuff at them. on a scariness level, i think i'd prefer british soccer hooligans to angry chinese fans...     gone to my first dentist appointment. today i go to my second. one cavity fixed, about 20 to go. they've found a ton. plus the holes from my fillings that fell out while i was in brazil.      finished  sputnik sweetheart .  liked it, but finding it similar to  wind-up bird , was a little disappointed in its brevity.  am now reading  bend sinister  (nabokov).     was told by my friend takeo that i have a "masculine way of coughing", reconfirming my reasons for not wanting to come back and live here, ever.      i've started feeling the usual claustrophobia creep up. it's not that i miss paris that much, though i do, i just don't want to be here for much longer anymore. but i've still got about two weeks left. damn. i'm so anxious.  also, all my carioca babies have returned to paris. i guess i just want to be there and see them. i've missed them so much! i can't wait to meet up with the three and gossip like old ipanema times...ooooh, it's going to be madness.

      finished  blindness  (em portugus) last night, at 4 in the morning. i liked it a lot, but when i read in languages other than english, i always come out feeling like i was stoned throughout the book.  odd.  started reading  sputnik sweetheart  today, and am halfway through. enjoying it loads as well. not as twisted as wind-up bird, but then again, i had to stop right when things were getting strage as i was at my station. the good thing about living an hour away from the city is that i have a ton of time to read.  yesterday i spent the entire afternoon in another of my favourite tokyo neighbourhoods, daikan-yama, with saya and renna, two friends from school. i bought some stuff (ehem, ehem)...oh and i also bought the funniest rubber sponge to wipe off cat hair from clothes. tried it at home, works wonders, will buy another one to take back to paris.  today i went shopping again with my mam...and bought a dress for the elsa wedding in september...at marc jacobs!! so pretty. but i need to buy myself some new breasts to fill it out a litte. thank god i don't live in tokyo, i'd be broke in three days.  some fish i see every day on the way to the station:    i also inherited my father's nikon reflex that he's had since forever, i'm very very very happy about this.

      yesterday i went to renew my passport with my dad. thank god he came with me because, as expected, they put up a fuss about the two Ns in my name. my name, you see, is written in japanese as if it had only one N. two Ns, in japanese, would mean saying my name as man-na, which isn't the way it's pronounced. so, my dad, who is amazing at arguing and making a fuss right back, had to come over and rescue me. the passport people kept leaving and sending their superiors to deal with my father's unrelenting arguments, and eventually we won and they lost. the japanese do not know how to deal with a rogue element within the ranks. their minds are too square, you either give orders or you follow them. nothing in between. they get confused sinon.  after our victory we had lunch in the chinatown in yokohama. also many memories, from childhood to meals with tse-wei and his family.  i spent the rest of the day walking around one of my favourite neighbourhoods in tokyo,  urlLink harajuku . ( urlLink this  is what it was like when i used to go with my mother when i was little)  i stopped by muji, spent three hours in  urlLink laforet , the pseudo-department store dedicated to dressing all the kawaii harajuku girls, walked to shibuya and found my next pair of all-stars (grey, with green stitching, and blue laces). spent 8000 on five more books (almost done with blindness), popped into tokyu hands, the japanese (and therefore far superior) version of bhv's basement, met up with my dad and headed over to a vernissage to join my mother. the artist is colour-blind. got some very nice free t-shirts, sponsored by  urlLink lois .  had dinner with my parents and a friend of my mother's who's in the middle of a divorce because she's having an affair with a diplomat.  oh my goodness!!!  i have one of those phones!  with a camera and all!  so one thing i felt yesterday: it really is such a pleasure to shop in japan! no mess! everything in neat rows! sorted by colour! air-conditioning everywhere! everybody is so polite and so nice! the service is incredible! it really is like coming home.

        stayed out all night because i missed the last train. or rather, i din't even bother trying to make it. i'd just had my first drink and the thought of getting back on a stuffy train to smell middle-aged men's beer and sake breath for an hour and a half was not appealing on a saturday night. so, mission: to be entertained for 6 hours until i could get back home. tokyo is the best city in the world to be stuck in, especially if you've got some spare cash. takeo chickened out early and went home assuring me i could crash at his at whatever time of night. so renna, saya and ken and i hung out at some very cool bars, i ate twice, at around 4h30 we went bowling. i got and impressive score of 94 hahaha. no but really, i even got a couple of strikes. saya got 106, ken 98, and renna 93. we are all just about equally crap.  walking around tokyo at dawn always feels like such a treat, no one on the streets, huge empty avenues with the odd taxi whizzing by.  got home at around 7h30, went straight to bed.
