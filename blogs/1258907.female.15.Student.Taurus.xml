      "Winter Breeze" The Cold wind smacks against my face I shift and rock back and forth in a steady pace Glancing around I see smoke stacks shooting for chimineys I soon get the feeling of being lonely.

      "Stalker" Following me around Not making any sound Staying near to the ground My personal stalker Staying out of sight Hiding out in the night Being ready to fight My personal stalker Trying to be like me Purched upon a tree They dont think I can see My personal stalker I just dont understand They live on my command I thought I was so bland My personal Stalker

       Five minutes of Love  At One o'clock I sit in bed I think of all the things I should have said Conversations spinning in my head  At One O' one I grab my phone But all I hear is a dialtone  Now at One O'two I lay back down I lay in silence, but hear a sound  Someone wispers "I love you" in my ear I open my eyes and there forms a tear  You sit beside me on my bed You explain the things you wish you'd said  At One O' five I stare at you I look deep into your eyes and say "I love you too".

       Not Reality  Sometimes I wonder what life would be like if a mere decision were to be changed Would everything I know today Become just a memory in my data base?  ((If my parents chose to be wed at a later date Maybe their marriage could have survived And if you think deeply into that concept There is a chance I wouldnt be alive.))  Sometimes I wonder what life would be like In a whole other situation, time, and place Would everything I know at this age Become just a picture in a picture frame?

       THE BEST FEELING  I WOULD HAVE TO SAY WHEN U ARE IN THE AIR AND U ARE FALLING I LOVE THAT FEELING OR AN ADRENALIN RUSH   Just standing outside, after the rain  love    The feeling when you lay in bed, and your pillow is cool, and everything just feels, right.   i guess after i write a really good, hard guitar part on a music program, and then realizing that i can play it....a feeling of accomplishment i guess..... kisses  Holding my two kids in my arms and singing "Allewishes" to them  when your jumping into freezing water and the moment you hit ice cold water is the best  content...safe   knowing that im loved  well i like the feeling that every thing is right in the wotld no matter what i do or say   when u go out wit a girl a couple of times and afta ya drop her off, u realize u like her and u get all the butterflies in ur stomach and all u wanna do is be wit her  being with someone u love   i love the feelin of the water and sand from the beaches between your toes and the sound of the ocean! (shan shan )  happiness   THE FEELING OF LAUGHING SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD

       "Just 10 more minutes"  One minute and you wake up from your sleep Two minutes and you change to something clean Another minute and your fighting with your mom That's just three minutes of your day. Four minutes and you leave after the fight Five minutes and you see a great big light Six minutes and your lying on the ground That's just six minutes of your day Seven minutes and you feel like you could fly Eight minutes and you can see some people cry Nine minutes and you know your gonna' die Thats the last 10 minutes of your life

      Don't you love the way the sun glows against the trees as the autumn leaves drift away? They drift through misty cold mid-evening sky, Do you find yourself wishing they could stay?  You wait all season for small little snow flakes to drift down from the sky. When they finally fall out and brighten your day, Do you find yourself wishing they would never say goodbye?  Then comes the day when the large drops of rain drop through the air. The day clears up, allowing the sun to gleam around, Do you find yourself wishing the sun could compare?  And stays the sun for a few months to come. The sun shines down to show us our way, Do you find yourself wishing you knew what would become?  So now comes the time when autumn begins. You go through the cycle all over again. Don't you find yourself wishing you could skip this year and await the next to begin?

       Time stood still  Our eyes met Time stood still Your heart skipped a beat You looked ill You shed a tear Time stood still I held you close You looked ill You looked really sick Time stood still I came quick You were ill Our eyes met As I had said Her life is over My soul-mate is dead.  (the other perspective of "Time to live")

       Just Another Day  Voices running around in my head Wispering lies to me Telling me I should be dead.  Should I listen? Should I care? Or should I pretend that they aren't there?  Would I use a blade? Would I use a knife? Would I ignore the voices? Or would I take my life?  Could I cut my wrist? Or hang myself with some rope? Could I just not listen? Or could I cut my throat?  I have the tools to do this, The question is will I succeed? Will I end up living? Or move to something in-between?  Voices, Voices, running in my head I think I'm gonna' take care of them, I'll make them wish they were dead!

       "Just Another Night"  A single tear shed from my eye I lay in bed thinking How I've lived my life in a lie.  All these years of being me I remember laying in bed 5 years ago I cannot believe what I see  Look at me, so naive I slept in that perfect bed Is that really how it used to be?  Is it all what I used to believe? I'd slept in that perfect bed Dreaming of my very own "Prince Ali"  Thinking of the person I would become I'd lay in that perfect bed I never thought I'd be this dumb  Sitting here and counting  lamb  I lay on this imperfect bed And realize that this is who I am.

       "Her eyes"   Her eyes  Reveal her thoughts Her hopes, her fears, her love; And let me see into her soul A soul that is pure to love  Her eyes  Show that she cares About everyone around And that her heart is true In her love and all her sounds  Hey eyes  Reflect the world So that everyone she sees Will soon then become As still as it can be!

       "X-Mas"  "It's Christmas, It's Christmas!" I would yell I was very excited Can't ya' tell? I ran to the tree And grabbed a gift I jumped up and down And shook a bit I yelled for Mom Then for Dad I waited a minute Then got sad I ran upstairs And looked around I knocked on their door Then heard a sound I smiled widely And opened the door I stared in shock They were on the floor I burst into tears As I stared ahead I fell to my knees My parents were dead.

       "Blankey"  It's just one of those things That you refuse to let go It's just so hard It make you feel low  You want to give it away Everyone knows you should But it's way too hard for you And you really wish you could  You feel a great connection to it But you finally decide to part You give away your blanket And feel a warmth in your heart

      Please dont judge me by my face, by my religion or my race.  Please dont laugh at what i wear, or how I look or do my hair.  Please look a little deeper,  way down deep inside.  And although you may not see it,  I have a lot to hide.  Behind my clothes the secrets lie,  behind my smile, I softly cry.  Please look a little deeper, a nod maybe you will see. The lonely little girl,  that lives inside of me. Please listen carefully to her,  she'll show that she is insecure Please try to be a friend to her, and show her that you care.  Please just get to know her,  and maybe you will see. That if you just look deep enough,  you'll find the real me.   (great poem, not written by me)

       "Love Triangle"  An unreturned feeling Is where I'm left to stand A love for another Who feels nothing toward me  An Unreturned feeling Is where I put someone else I didnt mean to leave them In a situation such as this  An Unreturned feeling Is something we all do The problem is sometimes we dont notice That someones inlove with you.

      "Starry Nights" Lookinh into the sky Alone in my bedroom Staring out my window Was that a witch on a broom? Up into the sky I stare up from my special place Looking out my window Was that an astronaut in space? Way into the sky I watch with my eyes Seeing out my window Was that somebody I knew who died? Staring into the sky Laying on the grass Thinking of the time That I know must have past.

You've answered me before But I wasn't sure what you meant Most of all I need to know What people think of me Am I a door-mat to be walked on? Or am I the keeper of the key?

       "In-Between"  The light shines right in your face The light shows you your way The light gives you comfort When others are away The dark makes you blend in The dark brings out your fears The dark helps you sleep And keeps your family near Light and dark create a shadow A seperation between two worlds They equal things to a point And keep you a bit more pure

       "Fad"  "But it's what everyone is doing!" Said the bratty little blonde With her huge bouncy curls As she runs to the pond After removing her clothes And jumping head-first She slams down hard And feels a great thirst A thirst for what, you may ask A thirst for life? A thirst for death? A thirst for time she will not get? Well it's her own fault For going to the pond For diving head first She didn't ubnderstand Understand she might die Die from herself Herself in a sence you may not know A sence she died to prove oneself Oneself to be willing And too willing she was She wanted so bad And too bad we know To be one of them, of them who knew It was only a fad.

      "Darkened Thoughts" Breathing slows Eyes begin to shut Inner mind takes control Your entering a new world  Your running down a hall Trying to reach a door The door continues to grow farther away The new world fills your soul  Your falling You know your asleep and you try to wake up But you cant and you hit the ground The new world becomes reality  Inner thoughts fill your head Breathing quickens Eyes spring to life The new world is a faded memory

      "The Craving" She walks within the darkness In search for human blood The only light she sees is that of what she lusts The smell of blood is intoxicating The thirst itself can kill She decides to find a human Quickly, before she gets ill She finally finds the right person She brings him to her lair After drinking his sweet mortal blood He falls, with a deadly stare.

       4:06 AM  Watching life pass you by,  souring,  tumbling sailing through an endless diamond sky Wathcing people leave you there Walking Running Cruising Leaving no room to spair Watching clocks spin around Spinning Swirling Twisting Until theres no longer any sounds Watching life pass you by Souring Tumbling Flying Through an endless diamond sky. This whole new world Fantastic Wonderful Marvelous Things to see but when Im way over here Its crystal clear That this whole new world is not the place for me...

      "Just a thought" In all the lives I've lived before, And all the sleep I've slept, I've never had a dream  quite like, The dream that I had dreampt, I visualized a man of gold, could not be bought could not be sold, A man whos knowledge I've been told, Is from a land, Where words are old. The voice is something obsolete, While thought and gesture You complete And so in love I hold him near And hope to God, That he will hear.

       Typical Man  The first time I met you... I thought you were just another guy I thought you didn't notice me I later found you were far from shy  The second time I met you... Things were basically the same You didn't once talk to me Yet it seemed you were playing a game  The third time I met you... I wished you'd talk to me I wondered deep inside, Just what you thought of me  The fourth time I met you... You came to me and talked I listened quite intently You asked me to take a walk  The fifth time I met you.. We were walking down the hall My heart was beating rapidly You told me you would call  The sixth time I met you... You asked me on a date You said tomorrow at 9:30 Although that was pretty late  The seventh time I met you... You seemed to be a sweet guy You made me feel comfortable You made sure I wasn't shy  The eighth time I met you You seemed to have lost interest You were sweet talking the next girl You'd found dating at its simplest  The ninth time I met you... You tried to apologize You acted like Mr. Innocent You acted like you hated my size.  The tenth time I met you... I wouldn't look you in the eye You repulsed me to my limit You were another typical guy.

       Graduation  Of all the years I've been in school And all the work I've done  I've never had a year quite like The year that I have spent  The friends I've made The laughs we've shared Are like none other before.  I'll never forget my teachers and how they made sure it was never a bore.  I learned to write And how to draw And the things I should never do.  The key was to  Trust And dont you forget  Respect Is also a key, Responsibility Was never frowned upon And  Fairness  is a guarentee, Caring  always helps And Citizenship Is the key to agree.  So throughout the years I spent at school And all the work I've done  I'll never forget the things that count Especially at Addams, with Character Counts.

        Broken Glass  Similiar to glass Tough yet easily damaged Strong, yet so very weak  This is me Rarely recognized for anything other than appearance  That is you Constantly noticed for the beauty within  But what are we?  If combined, what will we be?  Will the people ever see  That there is more to me than they concieve?  If dropped, do we not all brake? If pushed too far, do we not all shake? If we want, do we not all take?  I fail to see the difference, I fail to change the ways.  We are similar to glass. Tough, yet easily damaged. Strong, yet so very weak.

I say You never tried To stop the walls  From tumbling down You never tried to help me up when i was down I would have broke through I would have been strong I would have let go If I could Stop the echo of you Running Fast I go Everything I dont want You have What I need Coming back Everywhere I go There you are You ask What did I do? I say You never tried to stop my life From crumbling  You never tried to talk to me When no one was around I would break through I would be strong But I just cant stop the echo of you I walk away Dont leave Im going away Believe me I will stop the echo Of you!

       Clear  Can you tell that Im in pain? Can you tell that Im not to blame? Can you tell that I always cry? Can you tell that I want to die?  I thought it was obvious But again, I am wrong I thought it was obvious That I just dont belong  Can you tell that I am scared? Can you tell that Im unprepared? Can you tell that I am weak? Can you tell that Im a freak?  It must be obvious That Its not meant to be It must be obvious By the falling debris It must be obvious I cannot see It must be obvious You cant disagree

       Promise me  Will you always be there for me? When I need you there.. Will you be there if I call you in the middle of the night? Will you keep the tears from falling right down from my eyes? Can you promise? Will you promise? Just please be there.. Will you take care of me? Take my darkest thoughts, and make them bright for me? Will you be there to make me strong, and to lean on... When my heart is just, so cold.. Will you be the one, thats there for me most? Will you be there if I call you in the middle of the night? Will you keep the tears from falling right down from my eyes? Can you promise? Will you promise? Just please be there.. Do you even love me at all today? Will just anything take that love away? When I need someone Will you be that one, I need? Can you promise? Will you promise? That you'll always be there for me...

       Pain  Theres pain in my heart When will it go? Why is it here? I just want to know Is it almost over? The pain I feel inside Is it almost over? Must I run and hide? When will it end? When will I see? Where can I hide? From the falling debris My heart is locked But is it protected? My heart is locked But somehow got infected Theres pain in my heart Will it ever go away? Why is it here? My heart is astray.

       Downward Spiral  Things fell apart The combination failed You cannot comprihend The downfall  In a dark place Shadows lurking around You cannot see The downfall  No human contact for house The feeling of boxed in You dont understand The downfall  Searching all directions But no one can you find You just cant feel The downfall

       When will it end?  They say its over But is that reality? I know what it would be like i'd have a sence of normality!  At first it was unbearable And now its the same I dont feel any different Just alot of blame  I think alot Day through night To talk with Dad But thats not in sight  When the day is over I'm nothing but sad I dont know what to do Without my Dad.  ((Just a thought of what it would be like if Dad dies in surgery next week. On..Friday the 13th...))

       Crimson Cry     Its always little things That my life around me brings Helpless amounts of Pain Fear behind my smile  Ive lost all of the way And left so many things behind Along my precious path Theres some things I should not hide  Theres a dagger in my heart And I keep falling down So lead the way I need silence not love Wheres the halo above my head? Im sick of spinning around I dont know Am I alive or dead? A daggers in my head I cant help but cry.

       Just run away  I've gone away I am losing sight I am sick of just Hiding out in the night  I look in the mirror And I fear what I find The face staring back at me I wish it wasnt really mine.  Is the mirror broken? Or is that just my face? Is it possible to change it? Or just leave without a trace?  Could I leave and not come back? Could I run and never look back?  Would people even notice? The ugly face that has now just gone Would people even notice? That I had left at the crack of dawn?  Goodbye to all, For now its time, For me to run And for me to find A place to go And a place to stay A place for me To stay astray.

       My awoken slumber  its a dark and stomy night And im overcome with fright I lay awake, tossing and turning Inside, my heart is burning Frustration sets the tone Yet again, I am all alone This stormy weather is not my friend But I hear it calling my name And even though its not my friend i follow, all the same For it was me this voice was luring And I dont know what else I'll be enduring It pulls me deeper and deeper until It tells me Im not to be so sad and ill The only light is the moonlight beaming I wonder if in fact Im dreaming So now the louder are those voices I look around, with minimal choices I beg and plead and fall on my knees I beg and plead for them to set me free But on this dark and dreary night My fear soon turns to their delight They laugh and laugh as my face goes pale And begin to tell me a creepy tale The voices tell me what is to come And as they finish, I turn numb For they had said I would die today And that was why they'd lured me away The voices said that my life was off track They told me it was God that I did lack Quietly now, they spoke to me, glaring Finally a reason, they were sharing And in my shame I went back to bed I lay and cried, but it wasnt tears that I shed It was blood that spilled out, instead That night I died, as the voices said The last thing they shared, was that I was born again.

       Spiral Paper  All I see is an empty page Plain white and clean The lines running across the paper Seeming to capture my screams Ive attempted in using the paper thats rare But I have found that it doesnt compare For nobody knows me like you do With your boring lines of grayish blue And it was you who kept my secrets You comforted me in my greatest sorrow Youve accepted me and the way I am And given me hope for a better tomorrow Throughout the pain and moments of glory You have been there to hear my story For you have provided line after line And just for that I give you my time But I cant help but wonder what you'd have said If I'd chosen some rare paper instead It is you, my paper, that I hold close to my heart I can only hope that we wont ever be apart.

       Reaching for nothing  Reaching for a hand Nobody seems to care I cant reach any further Nobody is there  It hurts, having to reach so far I wish you were near Where are you? Why is it me that you cant seem to hear?  All I need is for you to reach out Show a  sense that our friendship is alive Do memories mean nothing? I just hope our friendship will survive  Im sick of reaching to the past I dont want to be on my own I thought you were worth the effort I suppose I'll just stay alone.

       Forever Friend's proper goodbye  I never thought I'd see the day That it was you, who went away I thought that we'd be forever friends I thought it'd be that way 'til the end But you've moved on, and dont need me anymore You've moved on, and shut this door So now Im left with all this pain that Im sure you didnt intend I only wish that you would continue to be my forever friend Theres so many stories that I havent shared Now Its me wishing that it was you who cared Im left with these tears, that I have to cry My only wish, is for a proper goodbye.

       A Foggy Night  Whenever the rain clouds come to play My life becomes this weary gray Everywhere around I see Something crashing as falling debris The thunder roars and brings out my fears My life crumbles into tears The lightning strikes and sends down pain Sometimes its too hard to obtain The rain falls to do some cleaning But with each raindrop comes a meaning Sometimes its pain or to cause sorrow Sometimes its to bring a better tomorrow And although there is no black anymore Things wont be as they were before No longer will there be any white Things will be different tomorrow night Whenever the rain comes out to play Dont think that you cant just pray And even though I can only see This thick fog surrounding me I know Im not alone today For someday the clouds will be blown away.

       Selfish  Never will I wish for death to ease the pain I will forever be selfish in that way I will always find someone else to blame And I dont care what anyone else has to say For I will always want him to sing to me I will always want him to smile in my direction I will always want him to be there with the spare key And I never want to lose this feeling of protection I want my Dad here with me today I want him here without the pain I dont want to need somebody to blame For I will only care what he has to say He has been there throughout my troubled childhood He was there supporting me throughout my pathetic punk stage No matter what stupid thing I did, he just said he understood My Dad was there for me no matter what was my age I love my Dad to death and back But never will I wish him death to ease the pain The only wish I will make for for the pain to just go away I love my Dad to death and back And for this readon, I'll be selfish like that

       Childhood   I was a child, watching the fights Trying to ignore them, the screams in the night Burried in my pillow, sobbing with tears I would never have thought it would haunt my years But it was my parents that I tried not to hate They didnt realize the fighting and the pain that it made If only they would realize, take notice, and see That someone was crying and it had to be me For now I am scared to fall inlove, and fear to be alone Its too much to bare, all the pain that I've known I may not be a little girl, but there is one thing that I will say I cant forget these memories Because they haunt me everyday.

       Sleeping pills  Lying wide awake in the dark Taking a walk through the park Watching flowers bloom with the sun Reading a book just for fun Going on a low budget shopping spree Always hoping to find something for free Watching reruns on my TV set Chatting with people on the net Staring at the rain hit the ground Listening to every little sound Things like this were just fine And thats what i did when I had time

       faith  days are short but nights are long i may be weak but i stay strong time does seem to go by so slow the light in me is just a glow tick tock is the only sound that i can hear as the clock goes 'round but I am strong and can handle this i no longer wait for some sweet bliss just take me away from this awful place i drew out my life, so let me erase! show me the stairway to heaven above get me away from the people i love no longer can i cause any pain someone please, take me out of my shame The prayers i weep each night in bed are the things my life should be instead but I am strong and can handle this so when i die, i want to be missed i praise the Lord every week in church I dont think its fair that I have to search I show my faith to neighbors and friends so why continue to make amends? I am strong and will handle this But Its hard to belive that a the Lord exists.

       Graduation 2  Yearbook in hand And tears on my face Remembering the friendships That can never be replaced Friends sit by me On that last day of school Tears on all our cheeks Why is life so cruel? I found myself wondering why the second that I made friends The year was over and had come to its end Graduation practice was over It was almost time to say goodbye A tear dripped down my cheek And I began to cry This year was gone I had made some friends I knew I couldnt say goodbye So it was graduation, that I didnt attend.

         Reflections  Mirror Mirror on the wall Am I the ugliest one of all? Why is it the mirror breaks, Everytime it sees my face? Why is it that I burn the eyes? Is it my face I must disguise? Just kill me now And kill me fast This mirror image must be my last Mirror Mirror help me please Cure me of this sick disease Take away the pain inside Somehow make my looks subside So one day the mirror wont brake I will be pretty when I awake Just make it end Make it stop Its the world I want to be ontop Mirror mirror ill go away And because you cant help, I wont stay The beauty is within, and I know that now I will prove it, but I dont know how. So Mirror Mirror on the wall Its time for you to take your fall Ill smash you up to bits and pieces And then its time, that my confidence increases.

       My constant enemy  A storm cloud hangs above my head It represents the tears ive shed 'cause every time my life seems better In the mail I recieve that letter Dear Naomi, things arent too good I would be there if only I could But yet again, things have gone wrong And all I can hope is for you to stay strong Its this letter that I always fear its this letter that brings that tear 'Cause every time my life looks good I know that I have misunderstood Never again will I ever doubt That no matter what the bottom falls out.

       Black Rainbow  There are no longer any colors The rainbow left them behind So far along my journey I cant help but hide  But the rainbow has turned black And the rain keeps falling down It used to lead my way But now Im left to drown I feel alone but Im okay Tis' true my life has gone astray But for now I am not dead The pains inside my head And one day, it will go  The colors may not return My heart may forever burn But this black rainbow inside of me Wont be the lock, but it'll be the key The colors are gone They have all turned black And I am stuck in this crack But Ive lived like this for many years And my path has gone astray And unless someone helps me out I will forever, cease to pray.

         Tick Tock  The eyes of death are watching me Everywhere I go, they see But this is the life that I have to live I have no choice, but to forgive I am the only one to blame Its my fault that I live in shame Its my fault, I caused the pain I treated life like it was a game But my time is almost over and Im next on the list The worst part about this is that I know I wont be missed The eyes of death are watching me Watching my life crumble into a falling debris Family and friends, they watch in laughter I am gone, they live happily ever after.

       Not a fiarytale  Cloudy skies Stars dont shine Cool winds Creep up my spine  Rain drops Down to the ground Pitter Patter Is the only sound  All alone tonight in my room It really seems That this is my doom  I am lost In my life I could end it.. With a knife  Rain drips As tears spill My Life Goes downhill  A mere memory Holds me down Im sick of these tears Im sick of this frown  I am stuck With pretending That this is my life No happy ending.

       Darkened light  For every tear that I cry There is a star in the sky Holding all the pain I feel Way down deep inside Its a promise to me That to every door, there is a key That to all darkness, there is light That to every day, there is a night For every problem that I share There is a God to hear my prayer Trying to push my pain aside While helping everyone, worldwide He holds a promise, to not only me That He is the keeper of the key That to all evil, there is goodness And to all things sad, there is happiness.

       Darkness Falls  Who's to say you left? When it cant possibly be true I know that when the darkness falls All I can see is you  I admit, at first it seemed blurry But now, its as clear as can be I know that when the lights go out It is only you and me  it is you I think of all day While awaiting for the night I wait all day to be with you It's the only thing that really feels right  When the darkness falls it is you, that I always see We are all alone It is just you and me  Nobody is there to bother me In my few minutes with you And although reality seems a lie My dreams at night are true.

       A difficult goodbye  Im watching a show on our television set But nothing anymore, seems the same There is an emptiness, where you once were And I wonder who is to blame  But now whenever I go in your room It is you, that I dont see Im supposed to visit you later today But I am not yet filled with glee  I should be excited, to see you again But inside, I am mostly scared You tought me many thing throughout my life But for this Dad, I am unprepared  I dont know how to say goodbye And its something I may never learn Some people seem to do it fine It may be a blessing that I must earn  But either way, you are not here And because of that, I am scared Not because you are not here But because Im so badly unprepared.

       A breeze so sweet it's bitter  Sparkling stars so bright buried in a midnight sky the breeze, humming so sweet singing a soft goodbye  A fully bloomed flower Sitting plump in its bed Flowing in the breeze so sweet A petal so bright is shed  A blissful breeze at night Soaring through the city lights Passing homes, watching families fight For not everything is a pleasant sight  But the wind watches in no judgement Merely drifting with memories forgotten Passing towns and streets of sorrow Giving people a new tomorrow  Forever long, the wind will blow Through streets and towns so small Going where the world may need it Following at every beckon call.

       Our Last Goodbye  T'was a mere day later when I cried in my bed "I wont ever leave" were the words you had said You promised me every single day You promised me you wouldnt ever go away But you called last night and said you apologize And that it was time for our last goodbyes The doctors said you were going to die And in that moment, I started to cry I never expressed my love for you And thats something I'll never get to do For it was last night that you broke your promise You left me alone and now things are ominous I'll never get to show you just how much I care I'll never get to show you that my love for you is rare Its only a day later after you called me in the night And already, my heart has gone tight Its because of you my heart is closed Its to this pain, that I wont be exposed I may have gotten the chance to tell you I love you to death But never did I expect that you'd soon breathe your last breath For the rest of my life I'll speak with you at night And in books, its about you that I'll write In my dreams, only you will be there Only in my dreams, will you see how much I care.

       TITANIC  LasT night there was a tragedy And to no one It seemed reality But on June 12th they lost hospitality For everyone around had curiosity  They boarded the ship that evening, excited It was to America, they were inivited But when horror struck, they somehow united Shooting flaires, in hopes to be sighted  Eventually, the ship went down The womaN, dressed in their nicest gowns It was too bad, the ship was icebound If only they could have sooner been found  They hit an Iceburg, it was their fate Husbands and wives, lost their mates If only the watchers didnt wait To warn the Captain, of their mistake.

       My Beloved  The very first time I saw you I knew it was meant to be I'd never let you leave me side I would never set you free But days went by and you had left When I awoke, you were not there I tried my best to move on without you But nothing seemed to compare For it was my own fault you left I had become very obesessive It was my fault, my love for you Had become so very agressive Because every morning it was you I wanted But one day you were gone I lived without you long enough I needed you at the stike of dawn I left my house and drove around But luckily, you found me I spent my morning alone with you Until you were gone, my precious coffee.

       The difference  Some rules need to be followed You, you just ignore them It's good enough to say your christian Right? To just live your life in sin? We may all break the rules sometimes And I, I try to follow them as I live But you just do as you please Without asking God to forgive There's a difference between you and me And it's one people barely see Yes, were both christians, as we admit The difference is, your a hypocrite Always saying you were saved And that you live your life for Him The one thing you dont care about Is the fact that you always sin

       It took a tragedy (9/11)  Planes crashed Buildings burn People mourn But never learn Fire Fighters rush As people cry Countries laugh At the people who died It took racism And it took pain It took hatred But we're all to blame Planes crashed Buildings burned People mourned But never learned Filled with ignorance No pride to spare It took a tragedy To make people care Children lost parents Husbands lost wives We're all to blame For the loss of these lives Planes crashed Buildings burned People mourned but never learned It took a tragedy To show some patriotism Yet we still continue To pursue this racism It took a tragedy To come together as one To turn to God for help And still, this war is not won Years go by The same mistakes get repeated People never learn So these wars are never completed The racism continues This war is fought in vain Because people need to learn To take their pride away Our lady liberty was wounded And then the towers fell Whether anyone was a hero We cant ever really tell Planes crashed Buildings burned People mourned But never learned

       Boiled Blood  Something near, makes me blurry eyed wishing there was something, to stop the pain inside knowing where that one place is to hide I wonder whats the reason that I am alive  My blood is boiling Burning at sight My blood is boiling Sizzling bright  Something near, makes my crimson blood quiver wheres the place I bring this pain I deliver Tell me, what's the reason I shiver Find me that place where blood flows like a river  My blood is boiling Burning at sight My blood is boiling Sizzling bright  Something near, makes my flesh decay at sight Im searching for the place where my pain is delight I found a world where with blood we will write I no longer hope to find a meaning to life  My blood is boiling Burning at sight My blood is boiling Sizzling bright  x2

       Counting Sheep  Lying there Peaceful in bed Praying that the fear inside Is only in your head Keep counting sheep, little one Dont shut your precious eyes Keep counting sheep, my little one Or say you sweet goodbyes The voice so far away And those glowing yellow eyes Staying under your covers Is what anyone would advise But there, lurking in the shadows Something far, yet way too near Living in your nightmares And feeding off your fear Waiting for the second You let your guard down And close your eyes to go to sleep So it can prance right off the ground Dont go to sleep, little child For when you do, he will be there Dont go to sleep, little child For no fear will ever compare Hes waiting for the moment That your eyes begin to close So dont go to sleep, little child For where he is, nobody knows

       Headline News  Worship of an anti-hero Deep down Feelings of scorn  In my heart These feelings are born In a post modern society We scream to be heard So many different varieties Causing so many hearts to burn A quake of racism A rumble of pain A shake of hated And tears of rain No more happy hour In the world we live Houses burnt to the ground we walk Uninformed people we wont forgive But all for what? A moment of worship to some anti-hero  A who-did-what person with a moment of shine A low life gang banger with nothing to lose Saved some people from a burning building  In a sad attempt for some headline news Don't worship that low life gang banging anti-hero with no love to spread Turn to our God and worship the truth instead Don't cry out in vain for that pain that you feel Don't ask our God why that pain in you is real Just take a moment and ask yourself why Take a moment and think of those people who died Turn to the truth, not some anti-hero with nothing to lose Hoping to make some boring headline news Don't stare at some old TV set, waiting for the next horror to hit  Go outside, see the hate crimes and the people who wont ever admit That for one measly second, a person becomes a star But every star has its moment, and burns out in good time Every person around has committed some crime Don't worship that anti-hero with nothing to lose Living their life to make headline news Worship our God, and the truth you will find That the feelings of scorn that were born inside Will soon go away and will have easily died Flip on the TV set and I promise you will see That same fantasy hero you once worshipped on sight Will have committed some hate crime the very next night Flip on that TV set and I promise you will see It was an anti-hero with nothing to lose Still hoping to make some headline news.

       Like no other day  Today was a day I will not ever forget.  Its one of those days you look back at your whole life,  and think of all the little things you could have done differently.  Its one of those days that you know no matter what you changed,  the outcome would be the same.  Yes, it was one of those days. 	 One of those days that you cant ever stop thinking about,  but no matter how hard you try,  you cant talk about.  When time goes on,  and life continues,  but the pain inside never goes away.  Its one of those days. 	 	 I know we have all had one of these days.  I, myself, have had many.  But this one most definately beats out all of the other days like today.  I think my day beats everyone elses day like today.  I could argue why it does,  but what difference would it really make?  I cant go back in time, and change  all the little things I could do differently that day.  My only option is to go on.  My only problem is, I dont want to.

       Silent Screams  In a movie Just acting It's a sad movie People only see it To make themselves feel better About their poor, pathetic lives There's a difference though... I'm not waiting for the happy ending I'm just waiting for the ending credits And then the pain My heart is screaming And soon The pain meets my throat But no sound comes out I'm silent And nobody can hear The ear piercing screams

       Outspoken Truth  Dazed and confused Looking for a part-time God For their own private use Too scared To put on a public display To show their affection For the God to which they pray Dazed and confused Religion is not only skin deep Not for personal use God is not some secret that your supposed to keep You are not alone  When things go bad, He will come through The important thing to remember Is that God is watching over you You dont have to be dazed and confused Looking for some God for your own personal use Only praying when things go wrong Worshipping Him when you dont belong Trying to deny the faith you feel Always trying to make some deal Never willing to go all the way Never will you for the God to which you pray You dont seem to see that religion is not only skin deep And that God is not some secret that your supposed to keep.

       Change  A constant fear of change The fear that someone will find your weakness That theyll label you as strange A fear of change in your life You hope and pray the strongest you can For the thought that this change could maybe be your last Because.... Having seen your struggles last time You know you cant make it through again Even if the change is good, you know you cant go back And all you want to do is go where youve been A familiar place with familiar faces A place of warmth in the cold world A bit of light in all this darkness You cant again Not when things are just starting to make sense Not if it means you have to make another choice No way could you risk making the wrong one! For that constant fear of change in you is eating you away We all need a familiar place with familiar faces And because of that, we cant more on For that constant fear of change inside Is eating you away And you have nothing left to spare.

       Subliminal Messaging  People feel so empty They hold no base Gripping onto to something fake Worship of an empty face Baseball cards Sports teams Watching games on the TV set Letting out some silent screams When that team loses People mourne and fall into depression Tumbling into dark oblivion Worshiping this world were stuck living in Trapped in a false faith Nothing to lose No pride to waste Forced worship sent from the media Infected by the sports teams bacteria Trying to fit into one criteria Looking up words in the encylopedia Tumbling into dark oblivion Squeezing into some invisible meridian People feel so empty Looking to grip some base Trying to find truth in this world Imagine all the energy they waste Trying to find the right thing to worship And choosing to worship a sports team who makes way too much money in the time they spend doing what they love Denying the truth and all the love our God sends down to us from above

       Hallusinations  It feels like the walls are closing in Causing my pain to burn, way down deep within Making my heart break into pieces As the hurting inside only increases Sounds like some thunder, as a storm brews inside If only I could be rid myself of all this sick pride And I feel so abandoned Im so sick of being left alone and stranded Im sick of couting my days, till death has me stuck No more will I concider death to be great luck I've been ready for my next days Im sick of just wasting away Sitting in self denial Waiting for my eternal trial And I just want to fly away from this I want it to be the moon that I can kiss I want to stop hallusinating And go somewhere instead of waiting Im really ready for the next day So I dont just have to waste away Sitting in my self denial Waiting for my eternal trial.

       The battle of life on earth  Most children cry when their mommys leave Saying goodbye to them is something too rare to achieve Forever they'll be wondering where they should start While trying to mend their torn and broken heart For each of their lives, they'll be waiting to return Trying to stop their faces and the pain that will burn But for me, things are different, in more ways than one This war with my mom had yet to be won The battle procedes, back and forth throughout my days Of course, I could end it, in more than one way But the pride inside tears me up and rips me to shreads At some points of this battle, I'd just rather be dead

I dont think you would notice The absence of someone so little as me I dont think you would notice I ran from the falling debris The falling debris you left on my life The falling debris that brought all the strife If I were to cry, would you stay by my side? If I were to die, would you feel the pain inside? If I were to stop, would you slow down? If I were to ask for help, would you make any sound? I dont think you'd notice The absence of someone so little as me I dont think you would notice I left so I could be free Be free from the world I've come to live Free from the world where people wont forgive If I were to die, would you write my obituary? Would you stop and wonder, if i were institutionary? If I were to leave, would you see me go? If I were to scream, would you even know? If I were to move, would you even care? If I were to run, would you see I wasnt there? I dont think so Beecause I am gone, and you dont care.

       New Years Vow  Staring over Writing a new story that I have yet to live I seem to always lose, I cant ever win This time around, Im going to move slow As people speed past me,  And images fade I soon begin to realize that I have been betrayed I screamed for aid and I cried out and prayed Im gonna' slow down, I cant go fast Im too busy holding on to my past I washed it off, and scrubbed with soap In dire need to track down my hope Im gonna' slow down, like in a dance I'll sing to myself in sweet romance Im writing a story that I have yet to live Maybe I'll change to ending.. Instead of losing, I will win.

       Burnt Doll House  Thou shall not cry I'll wipe away your tears Thou shall not fly I'll hold down your fears Thou shall not die I'll watch you through the years Thou shall not cry I'll wipe away your tears Come to me daughter Im always here for you I am your father I watched you as you grew As fire burns in your eyes I will always rise As immortal fears speak words so clear Through the broken walls, that scream I hear! As strangers come and send you pain I will be there for you to gain As temptaion comes, and beats like your heart Deep in your veins, just like an art Black masked and strong Dark horns dont belong Fire burns in your eyes But I will always rise! Dont cry, my daughter Thou shall not cry (I will wipe away your tears) Thou shall not kill Turn to your father Thou shall not fall Chained like a prisoner Thou shall not feel The love thats in your mother Such lonliness....

       Tobi's sleeping    I watch him as he sleeps So small, so fragile His soft chest moving up and down As he heaves in and out I watch him, sleeping I watch him, dreaming Legs twitching Hes running but from what? His legs twitching Back and forth Is he running free? In a field of dreams? Soon he calms The only movement is his soft chest Moving up and down As he heaves in and out I could go to sleep But I like watching him So peacful, so cute I choose to sit here, in bed Watching him sleep Watching him dream   I miss him I miss watching him sleep And I miss the way his small legs Would twitch back and forth When he slept, running in his dreams I miss the smell of him The look in his eyes I miss watching his chest Move up and down As he breathed in and out I miss his nose And his ears I miss Tobi

       In the middle of the night I wake  Images fade As my eyes open And my breathing turns into a gasp As I sit up quickly And my hair falls into my face As my eyes burn And my nose tingles Waking up is hard to do I am always dreaming of you Its hard, to wake up Because its like I have you back And your taken away all over again In seconds.. Making me reach for you But never quite grasping you Waking up is hard to do And I cant lay back down again I cant shut my eyes I cant breathe, I cant think I love sleeping, but I hate waking up To the harsh reality that smacks me in the face Leaving the images of you To dance around in my head I wont sleep in my bed Where you used to lay, beside me Images fade But memories stay My love for you, wont go away I love you.

       The note  Between your lips you mumble lies To me, though, its no suprise When you write me notes, filled with scorn I often wonder where those feelings were born I really dont know what I did wrong Not enough for you to say I dont belong To say everyone hates me, in many ways To say my friend hates me, and to go away Between your lips you mumble lies The words you say I really despise You yell at me, in the hall or on the phone Tell your friends not to talk to me Leaving me to sit all alone Well, guess what?! I dont care, its easy to pretend that your not there It doesnt bother me, you immaturity What bothers me is How you blame me for your insecurity Between your lips, all you can mumble is lies Your completely oblivious To your own disguise You dont seem to realize Gods love for you How Jesus died on the cross, you cant construe So you turn to something false  higher than you are Then you blame me for your religious troubles To me this is completely bizarre Between your lips, you mumbles lies about me Words crashing, like falling debris Who is what and why and how We dont agree Its like your hatred Is growing on a tree And still, you dont see That I dont like you either.

       Fallen Angel  Broken wings Soaring through the sky Tears falling from my eyes As I scream out and cry Halo fallen Flames burning my wings Looking down on me, my King While the other Angels sing Complete solitude Inside, Im going insane To me it seems you feed off my pain But my fallen halo tells me Im to blame I scream "Lord save me, Dont send me back to Hell! Dont lock me in a cell Please, dont send me down to yell" Hope and anguish Screams from my soul The pain I cant control From all the hatred I hold A living nightmare Night as my curse Sorrow immerced I ride in a hearse On the way to hell You sent me down To Hell Im bound Cant mutter a sound My halo has fallen And my wings are charred I dropped my guard Now, my heart is scarred.

       Masked  I pretend Im happy, full of smiles In reality, its all denial I have no friends because they cause pain And to me, that leaves nothing to gain Six feet under is where I am The me you see is all an act Above ground, I wear a mask Hiding inside the pain and tears Never revealing my thoughts and fears

       Lips sewn shut  It burns when I breathe Something Im sure no one can see The frog in my throat Clogging my lungs Seizing the air Like I've been hung Gasping for more With each breath I take suffocating waiting for my neck to break It burns to breathe Something Im sure no one can see Under my skin Charred inside Blackened lips Staining my pride Reaching And crying out To find the one without a doubt To save me Give me air Fill my lungs Dont allow My neck to tear I cant breathe Nobody can see That inside me Lies a child Waiting to scream Like in a dream A repeated theme Where lies me A child Buried in debris Drowning In the sea Suffocating  Cannot breathe About to tear Nobody cares Lost it all Complete despair I cant breathe And though I know no one can see I want them to know To see me struggling And to care

       Chained Prisoner  Locked up to an ebony black, stone cold wall Hands behind back, pulled tightly to a close Poisoned cloth balled up, stuffed between the lips hair pulled back, face exposed iron chains gripping the wrists head hanging, eyes swollen and black teeth chattering, lips trembling fear inside, of the next attack something cold, grasping the key across the face lies faded eyeliner deathly cold hands slash at the face locked up to the wall, as a chained prisoner

       Elmers Glue  Your life is part of my story In this, the truth I can not bend Something, Somewhere, took your life And your journey came to an end The anger builds in me The pain fills me inside Lost in hope and anguish After your untimely demise The pain shows in my eyes As tears drip down my face But nobody can understand The knowledge I cant erase Your life is part of my story In me, they will find you Im being torn apart Like paper stuck to glue

       The floor you cant fall below  Winter blew in cold this year Only the intense coldness prospered Its bitter breeze Its intricate paths The breeze knocked the door Blew away the key Locked me out Never did I think The day would come Not now not ever The bitter winter breeze took my key and stole it Wont give it back And im locked outside Cold and shivering Tears in my eyes Blurred vision Kneeled on the floor Cant help but cry.

       Workshop  I have the will but cant find my way The words I hear Dont seem to explain Where to go Which way to turn? What is love? When will I learn? Without faith I am lost To turn my cheek Has a cost What I believe Wont shine through My heart is blinded When I talk with you I cant say Goodbye to you Goodbye To everything I knew Goodbye To all the things I hold on to I have the will Yet, still I cant find my way Whats right is left And left is wrong I sing the words And talk the song I scream in silence And talk in tears I live in faith And dream in prayers

       Sitting alone in the cafeteria scene  I walk through the hall And you walk past me Without saying anything I wonder... If I cut my hair If I changed my clothes If I lose some weight If I peirce my nose Would you even care? Would you notice me? Would you say anything? I see you at lunch You look at me But just walk right by I want to cry You didnt notice me If I dye my hair If I make my clothes Is it the way I talk? Or are you just my foe? I see you with that girl... Walking through the school Like you are so cool And you dont even care The tears, falling down my face The pain I cant erase Like Heaven's crying It's raining outside But you are filled with pride You wont....you wont sit by my side... If I did my hair If I changed my clothes If I talked like her If I peirced my nose... Would you notice me?

       Should have called...  I look at my caller ID I see every number Except the one I want to see I want to scream, break down and cry Get away, 10,000 miles Lately, I have been a shred of myself Not completely me I cant seem to hide The feelings of weak, deep in me The memories, they haunt me still Lying down, on a hill Staring, up in the sky I want to scream out and cry Take the knife And watch me die Through my flesh Through my bones Through my organs And hear my moans Im falling apart, with memories of you I can not forget Filled with regret So much sorrow So much pain Blood spilt Drips like rain I dont cry rivers I now cry floods I drown in my sorrow And scream for help As I gurgle the water And my tears seem to melt I looked at the caller ID Twas your number I didn't see Blankess filled the screen In that moment, I cried out and screamed I took the knife, and finish my dream.

       Diary entry 1: Act 1 Scene 5  O' thy sight hath been stolen by the beauty of one such as she! For which my love reaches an infinate degree Her skin, of porclein so sweet Yet far too frail for my rude hand to meet! Her eyes as stirring as an ocean wave To see more closely, my heart doth crave Woe it be the day our fate tis' parted A war in my soul will surely hath started For I shall die without her hand in mine I long to know such a sweet divine From the sky shall fall true loves debris Should I know not a love so free!   Diary entry 2: Act 3 Scene 3  Tis' the epitome of torture! I, Romeo, can not fathom the rigour of this atrocity! The grass may know her feet more well than I Nay, even a horses back shall know her better! A fool of a price if he, Escalus, to banish I I, Romeo! Romeo Montague! Should just as well dig a mortal wound into my heart of hearts! For banishment for Romeo means death, without thy fair Juliet!   Diary Entry 3: Act 4 Scene 1  Swear it be the day! My Juliet, with eyes as stirring as an ocean wave But now, ne're again shall I assuage what I crave Now I, Romeo, am banished in a different light To where she is, I shall ne're set my sight For tonight, as the moon shall rise The dagger shall bring Romeo such sweet demise! One last visit, to rest by your side For surely a groom shall die with his bride The epitome of turtue, Has reached it's peek For now, death, Romeo shall meet.

       Dog collar  I hear that jingle Familiar to me ears The tags on your collar The images appear Clear as day Infont of my face Like a movie in my mind That I cant erase I can hit pause Fast forward and rewind But to this movie The world is blind I hear that jingle Ringing in my head Like your right behind me Sleeping in my bed

       The Irony  I lay in bed, waiting for the night to pass As the clock ticks, so slowly The scent of pee drifting around me room My stuffed dog resting on my bed Tobi, lying against my pillows, His chest heaving as he gasps for breath In the car, rushing to the vet Time passing Minutes vanishing into nothingness In the neighbors van The stench of cigarettes intoxicating my nose My face buried in Tobis fur The night it over Minutes gone, an hour past This night together was our last I lay in bed, tears staining my face Eyes puffy, cheeks red Humid air filling my room Time is gone, cant go back And still, the clock ticks, so slowly.

       All for me / He loves  Why me? Why did God go through so much pain For me, just one soul to gain Why me? Why did He stay by my side And walk with me through my pride Who am I? What am I? That the Lord, He died for me Why did He, set me free From all the pain I felt? He gave me His bone He gave me His blood He gave me a chance With Jesus, His son He showed me the truth He showed me new life He showed me the way To not live in strife Why me? Why did God clothe me when I had nothing to wear? He created me in all that is fair Why me? Why did God love me through all my rejection? He stayed with me through each progression Who am I? What am I? That the Lord, He died for me Why did He, set me free From all the pain I felt? He gave His bone He gave His blood He gave me a chance With Jesus His son He showed me the truth He showed me new life He showed me a way To not live in strife

       Witness  On my knees, I bow down and pray To be sent the words, I need to say Pleading and asking our Lord and King Through worship and prayer; hands raised as I sing To protect those I know; lost, without faith In all they know, to find Gods grace  So I try, and I cry Out to God, to save their souls So, when I die, I will find Them there, to meet with me again  Father, when will they see? The truth, behind the words they read Open their eyes, soften their hearts Show them the truth that sets them apart Send me the words to help them find A way, to give You their all; soul, heart, and mind  Lord I try, and I cry Out to You, to save their soul So, when I die, I will find them there To meet with me again  He is flawless They are faithless I will witness To them But Im not perfect Im not flawless Though not faithless I too, had a witness  Lord I try, and I cry Out to You, to save their soul So, when I die, I will find them there To meet with me again

       Tomorrow  Why am I scared? I shouldn't even care Im starting to grow stronger I can last a little longer Im not afraid of tomorrow Or scared of death Watching your holy fire Taking my last breath I cant run any faster Running out of gas Under so much pressure Everyone, waiting for me to crash Life is just a complication One big humiliation Im waiting for tomorrow For my bodies death Waiting for the rapture For my last earthly breath  -This poem did not work. No doubt. I tried to revise it, but its a lost cause. What I wanted it to imply was that Im getting sick of the world and Im just waiting for the rapture.  I just want to be in Heaven with God. -

         - A You n g Boys Be a uty Queen -        &nbsp;    I dont mind spending everyday  With this guy who cant find his way  I saw his sky turn from blue to gray  When he got off the bus in the pouring rain  Crying out to God for strength  Teardrops streaming down his face      Where is his heart and where should it be?  The chariot holding his beauty queen  What can he do to ease the pain inside?  What can he do instead of hide?  He needs to be loved, God  Please show him your love   I wouldnt mind spending every night  Praying for, this boy in white  I saw him once, cheerful and bright  But now he seems so sad and contrite  Always waiting to reunite  With his queen, it just isnt right       Where is his heart and where should it be?  The chariot holding his beauty queen  What can he do to ease the pain inside?  What can he do instead of hide?  He needs to be loved, God  Please show him your love   A tap on his window, a knock on his door  Outside his house the rain continues to pour  Tears from his eyes will just hit the floor  Screaming in pain, and just asking for, a minute more  Hes crying out to our Lord for strength  And the teardrops are wiped right off his face!       You know his heart and where it should be  You've got hold of his beauty queen  Your just waiting for this boy to decide  Will he accept You or will he hide?  He will find Your love  Yes Lord, he will find Your love
