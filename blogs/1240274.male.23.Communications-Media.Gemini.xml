       All around me are familiar faces Worn out places, worn out faces Bright and early for their daily races Going nowhere, going nowhere And their tears are filling up their glasses No expression, no expression Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow No tommorow, no tommorow And I find it kind of funny I find it kind of sad The dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you 'Cos I find it hard to take When people run in circles It's a very, very Mad World  Children waiting for the day they feel good Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday Made to feel the way that every child should Sit and listen, sit and listen Went to school and I was very nervous No one knew me, no one knew me Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson Look right through me, look right through me  Mad World. Tears for Fears

       three days gone again, missing my girl, bittersweet angel. wish she would be here with me i'd listen if she'd talk make her out to be a princess to my head she's royalty.  tell me when we really begin, loving eachother like others in love kisses in twilight making love to the sound of two hearts drum.  tell me when we see more of eachother, and really communicate. stop my mind from racing, second guessing, let's not twist the knife, hurt eachother with silence, tempting our fate. i want to be with you i thought you wanted the same to laugh and cry and share ourselves but all these restless thoughts, they get the best of me here deep within they permeate, symbiotically tempting me, my fears they encapsulate.  so please celena, just come over. my heart is open. be honest with me about how you're feeling, let's not have this carry on, it hurts me so when i see that to me your eyes don't focus on what's going down in our world, dammitt Celena i feel they're hardly open.  if they were you'd be around again kissing me, touching, and loving me more often.  maybe i'm just insane, or unwhole and lonely. either way i need security, i need to hear it from you, that you feel love, and all you want is me.

       now i wonder,  if i disapeared again would anyone notice? now i wonder,  am i alone here as i was there? now i wonder,  why am i feeling the way i do --so much longing. now i wonder,  why i'm thinking there used to be more to life than all of this. what is she hiding?  i sense it on her touch, i wish she wasn't so distant. i taste it on her kiss. what is it that she's missing?  she isn't getting what she needs from me. i wish she'd express what she's feeling, cover the hole that i always seem to miss.  does she still love me or did i fuck that up too?

       it's funny, ya' know. how getting out and going on a doomed over night road trip, makes you feel good as soon as it's over. not that i didn't have a good time, bennet ;)  --in fact the opposite. everytime we talk, seeing you reminds me that i always come to you with the same tired story. made my problems seem trivial and stuff like that keeps me optimistic. the thing with life for me is, you gotta' savour lifes bitter moments. it makes the sweet spots sweeter.  getting ready for my first day back at a job since calgary. that's over a month of hellish tormenting stress :)

       Health And Happiness (The Wallflowers)   Maybe it's not That I don't care anymore Maybe I just never did You can't say  That I have ever lied Because I keep the truth well hid Tell me what's wrong Is something wrong? You can't be sad When something you have never had Suddenly feels gone  I wish you health  I wish happiness  But absolutely nothing else  I'm not here to keep an eye on you I think you misunderstood I could make things easy for you I won't  But I could Does that make you sad? Cause you look sad You should be glad For what you've had And don't feel bad I could wish less for you  I wish you health  I wish you happiness But absolutely nothing else  There is no distance here To get across There's nothing to grip  Or get a hold The emptiness you feel Is nothing at all Now nobody broke any bones It could be worse Yeah, it can get worse You've got your strength And you have got your health You should be worried 'bout Somebody else

       monday 3rd of march         "i just want you to know: life is a black sucking vortex of anguish and despair, filled with brief moments of false hope and empty joy all the while dragging you inevitably closer to a final, absolute and eternal death. life?  this isn't life.  it can't possibly count as life. i derive pleasure by bitching at you.  were i dead, i could not.  fuck you."  -ct.   this is the popular opinion among a few of my close friends, loves. not wanting to take the helm of the issue just yet, i am wondering what any of you have to say about it? observations? write it in the guestbook? serious submissions need only be written.

       just a brick, too soon gone, prevents you from being, and doing, anything along the way of carrying on.  just a prick, with his head on wrong. doesn't understand the why,  and WHO he is.  he keeps awful control of the ship he's on.  just a kid, too soon out of favour, wonders why he's alone, confined, stuck on this one-way street he's spawned.  just a hypocrite, he tries to be Christian, but his ways are too wicked. so here and there you see him stumble. never aware of where he's been, or where he's going to.  just confused, and all mixed up, wishing he was something he already is.  neurotic and thick, always craving loves lust, and daily adventure wishes he was with her, yet then he'd be too soon tied.  so this is what he does instead prays to God to cease the demons, screaming, wrenching, fighting in his head. lives every day, the same as the last, forgets the numbers that just don't add up, wishes he was someone else, someone in love, wishes his bride would be sent from above.  ignoring the piles so high, the time so quickly to pass this boy by.  what will he do? where will he go?  when the outside world turns callow, cruel, and cold. he'd have been a lover long ago, a success, a caregiver,  on a path of envy, righteousness, and husbandry.  if only he saw the fork up ahead, when he would have to decide with his head; ignorance, for love and happiness. ..or misery for the real, unraptured society.  no fairytale ending in sight, no release to his plight, unable to tread life's scorn, he took his own life instead.  . . .unaware   of       the   ones       he stole with            it. . .

       ..sitting here last night thinking, walking, waiting for something to come, some distraction always thinking my life, my world, my actions and disolutions. gone in a half-year moment, oh i could never leave you God, Just get lost in my false intrusions, pretending i was wanted..  So as I go, no one knows, snapping at heels, and shoebuckles, unseen. wishing i was clear, wishing i was clean, wishing i was not alone, electric, shiny and free. wishing i'd find her, willing to make herself a part of me. Not worried about length, breadth, and span, would rather have just me, not worried about why i'm here, my sins that make up who i am, Simple love, respect, and passion, Not the focus of my sinful ruin, Not for money, words, or apathetic union, she'd love who and why i am, and see what it is i aspire, if only i could find a woman who'd light my fire. Put some closure on this confusion.   Instead I took my pills, pink, orange, and yellow. stood inside this comfortable rainbow, held me, carry'd me to sleep, my only love is here with me, she doesn't want change, money, or purity, as long as we are together, she is my security.  --m.a.    Just sitting. awakening. long sleep again last night. anyone like a good jeff buckley track?? snag this: "Last Goodbye". Wikkidd track. wo0t!

" Mother,  do you think they'll drop the bomb ? Mother, do you think they'll like this song? Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls? Ooooowaa Mother, should I build a wall? Mother, should I run for President? Mother, should I trust the government? Mother, will they put me in the firing line? Ooooowaa Is it  just a waste of time ? Hush, my baby. Baby, don't you cry.  Momma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true. Momma's gonna put all of her fears into you. Momma's gonna keep you right here under her wing. She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing.  Momma's gonna keep Baby cozy and warm. Oooo Babe. Oooo Babe. Ooo Babe, of course Momma's gonna help build a wall. Mother, do you think she's good enough,For me? Mother, do you think she's dangerous, To me? Mother will she tear your little boy apart? Ooooowaa Mother, will she break my heart? Hush, my baby. Baby, don't you cry. Momma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you. Momma won't let anyone dirty get through. Momma's gonna wait up until you get in. Momma will always find out where you've been.

       i see you looking down from somewhere above what are you wishing whom do you love?    memories rush back to the crossroads.. the day my heart was torn, my tears darkened the sky that day, made a difficult decision, i had opted to walk away.  now here you are again. an angel before me      or a devil's vixen? you enter my dreams, you walk through my life, day to day basis, you really don't want to see me with my 'same old', my rigorous strife.  sick of it then, so tired now. if you're here to stick around, why not just catch me, let me rest, gird my strength, did you ever really believe in me anyhow? what comes next is the change, i know you do it to us well, possibly save us, or at least grab our focus, place it on high, for Him to see, have Him look deep within me.  -m.a.

       calgary.  there once was a day when nothing mattered. carefree, careless. going nowhere, yet being everywhere. omnipresent and loving every gapped out, blissful moment. i will go back there to my kingdom above the trees. the hapless caress of God on my fingertips. so visceral and seemingly infinite was my time here while it lasted.  just a glimpse, a memory in a place and time. never to encapsulate how it really felt. i was a living being. on edge, gaping over the precipice that stood before me. something big stirred in lifes' manevolent belly. madison. celena. brothers. sisters. parents.  thus is life, i guess. here for a moment, gone eternally. yet lived out every minute of every day in my shadowy realm of memory and dreams. and because of this i am torn. always waiting for the new day to come.

       matthew good : the man from harold wood.  everytime i would see someone who just lived far from home, a friend of a friend, what have you.. I could almost always see this glint in their eye. I can't describe it in words, only in my work, but it is apparent when i look at them. . . you live a life for x years/months/weeks and then fwump, for whatever reason, here you are back in home sweet home.. you're smack dab right where --and WHO you were when you left. in THEIR eyes anyway. the friends your old persona loved, needed, clung to before the change. you don't get a choice. it cripples any growth processes that were going on in the inside. think of it as reminiscent to how God knew Adam had eaten from the tree of life. other than the fact they were running for cover, -nakedness- and what not, but it's present in the eye of Adam i bet, when he looks over at his longtime ally, God, it slips. . .  now that i am back, i keep thinking i still gotta cut the cord. lose my pre-teen-esque addiction to social behaviour and friends. damn pre-teens, always doing shit for their friends, little for themselves, and nothing for their family. i don't wanna' be alone, but i want to stop spreading myself so thinly and make more time for the real friends i have, which, at this point, is down to ...two or three out of the dozens of so-called, old'school buddies of yore. not to mention my family. my mom and dad are amazing people, and who knows where and when they will leave me.  with an end in sight, g'bye ;)

       aw yeah. listening to James: "Wah Wah". killer album. pressure's on.  in the world today, seems like more injustice: "ABCNews is reporting on a 19-year-old college student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. He created a site named ChewPlastic.com where students could search for files on the university network. Mind you, this is not a music file sharing software, this is just a search engine. Presumably, the search engine was being used to search for music files as well. The folks over at the RIAA did not take too kindly to the idea, and sued the student. He settled but denies any wrongdoing. What was settlement, you ask? His life's savings."  ..if that was me..............................................................................  see fightclub ?

       1. stress surrounding "future". 2. too busy to find time for personal human contact. (ie. friends, lovers, family. . .) 3. you think about money more times than sex any given day. (ie. problems, how to spend it, what you *want*) 4. picking up more hours at work. 5. less patience with people. 6. don't forget about the gym, it is bikini season after all.  7. depression. 8. more value is placed on material things than the 'single serving' people you meet. 9. you're on some sort of medication.  sound like you?  yeah. i'd say that 2,3,4,5,6,8,9 are definately issues these days. just because we're all in the same boat, doesn't make it right. so this is to all those people who look out the window on a sunny day and think "shopping". to those who bitch at the cashier and then go home and love up their pet cat. to the scared ones who take the pills their doctor gets paid well to give you --just to cope with this new dynamic, GLOBAL society. where do you place personal value? in a world where "revolutionary" and "value" are simple marketing words, do you really think all this is going to last forever? even until the end of your own life? (selfish if you don't care 'cause you beleive you'll be dead when it all goes to hell) ..and now even the wars aren't black and white anymore. bush being the perfect example. don't try and guess his motives or the thought police will get you. . . . . .and we're becoming more antisocial (this web log culture is a good example) and it's affecting our kids big time. i donno. i am just losing faith in people. what hurts more is that i lost faith in my own self long before today. . .

       with a million varieties of the way you can get pears in a can. with all those shiny toys out there to be bought. money to be made and spent. cancer to get removed. cigarettes to smoke. people to kill over oil. deadlines to bump up because with all the innovations in technology --you're saving time anyway, right?  with all the aborted babies and sexy models. city buses and free global trade. the fbi, the riaa. bell canada, and microsoft. with all the groovy clothing, dead animals on our feet, perfect teeth and OFF! Skintastic Spray. with the internet, gasoline, and vibrators. meal supplements, antibiotics, toxicity and wires.  with all the styrofoam, VISA, carloans, cardboard, and itchy skin. the death air, greenhouse, lights, and signage.    . . is it more selfish to have children,  or get clipped ?

        Josephine  (The Wallflowers)  Josephine You're so good to me And I know It ain't easy Josephine You're so sweet You must taste just like sugar & tangerines  I won't make a sound Sleep on the ground When you wake I will Drive you into town I missed your smile Your schoolgirl style But I never had much fun Maybe the very first mile  Don't you know I watched you walkin' home from school Your friends on the old playgrounds You never looked so down Won't you come and help me  with these cuts of mine? I've disconnected my heart And cut myself  on the wires, Josephine  I know I was wrong I knew all along But I got so far from my home I never thought I'd be so lonesome

       lots of thought being put into a short film i wanna' make. think tragic, starcrossed lover syndrome, suicide, triumph and failure, the bland and the abstract. perhaps a wedding¿ it's gonna' be about 10 minutes long, and the plot won't be understood by most.. never made anything with video before, so it's gonna' be a learning experience. no dialogue, and it's to the beat of  Viðrar Vel Til . by  Sigur Ros . the music is key for this. . .  by autumn i'd like to start something up (in the way of a vid or anything promotional) for my buddy danoh, a great musician without an audience --yet. if down the line you see what you like, got some ideas and some musical talent of your own, drop me a line? i'd be glad to help ye. stay tuned?  in other news, i caught some headlines this week, about 'the mother that was never born'.. apparently the unborn can have children too. that is, an aborted fetus can be used in the genetic manufacturing of another babe that  isn't  a clone. i see a plot begging to be used, no? one has to wonder where researchers even acquire these fetuses.. it's like circumcisions. are hospitals allowed to do whatever they want with your biological 'waste' (for a lack of a better word) --your dna? all these questions. . .  my folks take off today as of 8:30 am, for a week. this means i finally get some time alone to relax. write. walk around in the buff, and live vicariously for a bit --wo0t! it'll still be hard to get back the feeling of living alone in a big place --with all the old people shit around the house-- like windmills and gnomes in the garden, ducky bedroom border, and country garb hanging in the kitchen. aw well. no parentals = fine with me :|  meh. time to run away, if you're reading this check my site:  urlLink www.serotoninambition.cjb.net  and sign my brand spankin' new  urlLink guestbook .  cheers! m.a.

       [ :: Monday, March 10, 2003 :: ]  just a brick, too soon gone, prevents you from being, and doing, anything along the way of carrying on.  just a prick, with his head on wrong. doesn't understand the why,  and WHO he is.  he keeps awful control of the ship he's on.   just a kid, too soon out of favour, wonders why he's alone, confined, stuck on this one-way street he's spawned.   just a hypocrite, he tries to be Christian, but his ways are too wicked. so here and there you see him stumble. never aware of where he's been, or where he's going to.   just confused, and all mixed up, wishing he was something he already is.   neurotic and thick, always craving loves lust, and daily adventure wishes he was with her, yet then he'd be too soon tied.   so this is what he does instead prays to God to cease the demons, screaming, wrenching, fighting in his head. lives every day, the same as the last, forgets the numbers that just don't add up, wishes he was someone else, someone in love, wishes his bride would be sent from above.   ignoring the piles so high, the time so quickly to pass this boy by.   what will he do? where will he go?   when the outside world turns callow, cruel, and cold. he'd have been a lover long ago, a success, a caregiver,  on a path of envy, righteousness, and husbandry.   if only he saw the fork up ahead, when he would have to decide with his head; ignorance, for love and happiness. ..or misery for the real, unraptured society.   no fairytale ending in sight, no release to his plight, unable to tread life's scorn, he took his own life instead.   . . .unaware of the ones he stole with it. . .   michaelanton.

       Yesterday I got a ride to my new placement through my temp agency, at Stanley Tools in Oakville. Never takes long to get there on the highway (it's just past Trafalgar, and I started from the neighborhood of IKEA in Burlington. Now that my own car is off the road, I am learning a few things about time when travelling. Making myself suffer enough to know better to let things slide --as far as my car goes, anyway :P ..so I asked me mum to drop my bike off and I rode home. One hour and a half taking Lakeshore, the more scenic route.   Riding along, you start to notice more. The creeks you never knew were there. The great shots you could take with your camera, when the sun seethes through the trees. The amazing graffitti art under ancient bridges. ..and the little naunces along the way to entertain your mind. Like how you can tell a fellow biker, even if they're in a car. How old ladies think I am a punk kid on a bike. How the Catholic School Board is so easy to take a jab at. Ok, ok, I gotta' elabourate a little on this one I guess..   I ride by the location of where I beleive they are going build a new school. The only thing I notice on the sign in front of the destroyed trees is "Believing in you, believing in us" --or something to that effect, I'm not sure how fast I was going when I flew by it, but... yeah. What about the "Believing in God" part? .. but FACK, 5:30am, gotta' jett if I wanna be at work for 7. Cheers. . .

       right now i am sitting at my desk, in my living room, in calgary. thinking over choices i will make, ones i made. where to next. which cafe i will visit in the morning to write the letters i already wrote. feeling so....  sigur ros . nothing can touch me now, in my world above the trees, far from my past lives, half lived in caves, and the rest in loss of mind, doped up. asleep.  i couldn't sleep tonight. i was haunted by Elisabeth, and how she made me feel the second day in calgary. how angry she made me. how things were left rotten and so... not right. i keep going into my past and pulling people out like teeth, dusting em' off, and placing them before me to fix the way i had left them. i hate bad blood between myself, and people i may never see again. it just sits wrong and even years later, disrupts my happy world, and troubled sleep. keeps me from thinking about what comes next, but instead what shouldn't have been at all? or maybe, ... ....  i sometimes feel like God Himself shows me His hand once in awhile. whether it be my gut, or sixth sense, i know what's gonna' come next. or what's supposed to. what shouldn't. i know everyone has thoughts like this, only different,  i can't explain it. it's like nothing else. it's intense. i sort of feel that i lost hold of things, and thought after seeing the cards, that things would still play out the way they should. i got cocky. confused. didn't know why things were happening the way they were --it was never supposed to take such a u-turn. it isn't so much that this is excess baggage, but more so that i am convinced she felt my sleeplessness, a year later, tonight. she felt it not because she isn't over me, or me for her. but because it played out wrong. i think deep down, we both would agree.   if the final moments we had shared were a painting -there was too much red, and not enough yellow, green and purple...  the rest of the faces come back, and the lines aren't as accurate as i'd hoped for. the stresses seemed so important at the time, and i lost touch with where the fuck i was, and why i was there. what i was really doing. i'd kick myself for coming home if i could allow my pride to dwindle a little more.   these days i sort of feel like people are getting the right idea now. i was getting real sick of always being a projection of their own insecurities. it ate at me a lot, and made me start to beleive i was what they manifested me to be. glad i got a break.  right now i am sitting at my desk, in my bedroom, in burlington. thinking over choices i will make, ones i made. where to next.

       Yeah. I am really starting to dig this  urlLink Google toolbar with Blogger add on . I'm a big fan of  urlLink Slashdot , and i found yet again, something that totally blew me away when i woke up today (at 4am! wo0t!)   urlLink Terra Wind Home : "Introducing the world's first luxury Amphibious Motor coach / Yacht"  Yep, yep. Anyhoo. Through a twist of fate I do in fact have a car now. Go figure --yesterday, when we went to see how long the registration place would be open for today (Friday) it turned out the place had extended hours Thursdays only ~until 7pm.  mmmm. driving to work. something i took SO for granted because i always worked up the street. now i work in oakville, and biking an hour and a half wasn't in the cards for long. neither was taking the go-train/buses for an hour and 45 mins. i beleive the term would be "blaurgh"...  right andy ?  with amon tobin on my ears and an  urlLink XENARC CP-1000  in my web browser, i drool.  meh. time to clean my room and drink more coffee. latz. mikeanton.  ..p.s. can you beleive that the USA put photos of the corpses of Saddam's kids on the web? corpses. i mean photo's could still lie, it could be propaganda..... but either way it's a fucking sick world we live in when my unborn kids can hop on to sites where the government puts up shit like that? not going into the war, i think the news has also covered a lot of the lies being spread (i had my hunch since the get-go) by Bush and Blair, and the death of that weapons inspector reaks of controversy........ all i wanna' point out is that 'we' think the other smaller, less well off countries involved are being brainwashed by their media.

Yeah, so who digs Canada now? On this article is an actual list of some of the user names that are gonna' get nailed. Hoping there's a few lawyers in there too. . . I'd say that for myself, I am beginning to feel the immorality of downloading music. The stakes are higher for you Americans out there too! I know that the artists already take it in the ass on their end money/contract wise. playing "robinhood" with your music collection is a low-class way to justify yourself as well, as there are millions of us leaving much more than a dent in their pocket books. . . not saying i won't download ever again but I am not gonna' share my whole collection online anymore, that's for sure. although, because of this whole mp3 fiasco, ever notice how the smarter labels are starting to offer DVD discs along with music cd's for the same price? because of this we ARE getting more for our money. i say twist the knife a little longer and make that stick. then cease the madness of downloading whole albums just to have that complete collection, and cut it down to just making wikkidd mixes. if it wasn't for the mp3 and web broadcasting, i wouldn't know of half the bands i do now, so it is great free advertising. the sound quality IS lacking as well, so the real store-bought deal is always gonna' be better anyway, right? just my thoughts... moderation is key. it's the little kiddies that go over board that are killin' it for everyone.

       a little confused. yesterday night i sort of went loco. when i used to get all neurotic, i referred to those moments as "spikes". like my mind/heart gets all tangled up and tries to go two ways at once. some people take meds for this sort of behaviour. hell, i even used to.. before the day was out, i cut deep into my right hand man's head with negative. the things we sometimes think, but never say --i said, totally forgetting the reasons why we don't say 'em. i wanted a stir. wanted the world to catch the drift i was on, and it wasn't working. so instead it flipped around on me and before i caught it i ate my own words. . then there's my other buddy. in a hospital bed, and for some reason i'm totally confounded as to why i am so numb/cold. it was inhuman. i woulda' been better off starting a fight and getting my ass kicked by a punk kid, than saying such bullshit to my boy. egh.   wish i could stay in character all the time, and i wish i could find some sort of equilibrium. i can't be this one person 6 days a week, and then switch it up, and get all condescending and harsh the next. it's not me. it's not fair. wish i wasn't such a fucking two faced pompous ass. it's times like this i sort of need though .. i guess. keeps me humble, on my toes, and in focus. i wanna' go back to the days when i could look in the mirror and be the  only one  who can see the complete lack of humanity, cold, and ugly. when other people see it it hurts so much. . .

        thats odd. not one person is on msn right now..  reading august 10th's entry, and then driving about my city tonight was all too crazy. people fluttering around town, buying up all the gas/food/water they could. fat people rescuing the icecream. oh. and batteries. for those unnaffected, and haven't heard about it in the news already,  urlLink big blackout  along the east coast. yep. although from the time i got home from work, until now, my power has mircaculously been unaffected ;)   i sort of crave this sort of thing --the destruction of this western empire we live in. acts of chaos and terror all over the place. maybe some sort of fallout. then the terror ends, and you come out of hiding. . . bartering for gas. everything is looted, or being looted. finally all that matters is those you love and survival. then small new communities are formed among the destroyed former civilization. you form packs, and everyone must play a role to the greater good of the group. protectors. food gatherers. cooks, babysitters and mechanics. no such thing as taxes, rrsps, visa, tommy hilfiger. people would have to learn again. how to fix things. establish new homes/camps. not be so dependant on the automatic. hopefully learn to never go back to the shit hole we made life to be. no more pills.. (condoms would be high priced commodoties in the underground market :| that sucks). but nonetheless, you get the point. after this example of how easily our security in buildings, purchasing abilities, mobility, drinking water, etc... can be knocked out by a power failure. ever think about the unexpected shit that might happen? chaos, without power, the mad carnal nature of people to go to arms when chaos and anarchy is in the air?   the musicians of the world sing of it. the bible, and other prophesies speak of it  . .  but i wonder how it will really go down. by no means am i trying to play on current events to incite a panic; it's just quite simply a thought not to write off because it is disturbing.. always wanted a gasmask in my closet or trunk for days like those.  mikenaton.   urlLink [ _radiohead: one more work day_]

        " you must be on your guard. you will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. on account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them. . . . . .    brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. all men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm in the end will be saved."  when you see 'the abomination that cases desolation' standing where it does not belong --let the reader understand-- then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains. let no one on the  roof  of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out. let no one in the field go back to get his cloak. how dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! pray that this will not take place in the winter, because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now --and never to be equaled again. if the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. but for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them. at that time if anyone says to you 'look! here is the Christ!' or 'look, there he is!' do not believe it. for false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to decieve the elect -if that were possible.   so be on your guard; i have told you everything ahead of time .   'but in those days, following that distress, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'   at that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. and he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.     now learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near,  right at the door  .

       Pointless legal proceedings: - Topless law in the Greater Toronto Area.  After all that shite , i have seen two topless women. A stupid law fought by stupid people? Stupid people who later chose to not even make use of it themselves? (Although I am NOT against equal rights. I am all for equality of the sexes. if a guy can do it, women can too ..as far as i am concerned. i just don't think it's cool for 'auntie faye' to let my non-existent children to see her knockers ;)  - The whole pot thing. In the GTA we can have 15 grahams with a slap on the wrist. WIKKIDD cool. ( I have since quit the habit , but . . ) why make the consequences for selling it way worse than before in the process?  --when the government is allowing it for medicinal use? fucked in the head, right?  - now look across the border where culture is wasted. culture = history = our roots. religion is as much part of our culture as our ancestors themelves are, right? what they beleived in affected everything from how we buried our dead, cleaned up human waste, wrote music, communicate. . . all the way to our present day laws. that said, i think most people realize that no matter how anti-religious one may be, you respect (most) our laws. the very same laws founded upon Christian beliefs (ie. the ten commandments). You can't erase that. It's already history. it happened. forget the God part if you feel the need to and look at it as purely a cultural thing. i choose not to look at it that way, but that's just me. even if you take away God from our everyday life, like our society has chosen to do, you cannot unwrite the laws we've founded that are based on the bible, because they  make sense .   like a historical statue at a lookout at a  'window to the lake' . ..like a statue of old war 'heroes'.  why  is a statue of the ten commandments in front of a courthouse in the  united  (yah. right.) states of america ILLEGAL...?

       well. it is 6:27pm.  Pyramid Song . A glass of California wine, and pizza. how spoiled am i? meh. not really into going into actual details of my day to day, but egad! i got to get an oil change tonight (3 changes behind...or wait. four? uh oh. . ) then its back to cut the grass. clean out my car. clean my room. do laundry. drink more wine. dream more of the radiohead show i didn't see. then pay bills. then sleep for tommorrow i work. mmm.  punch-up at a wedding  --another sweet radiohead song. sigh. i got it bad..  work. the bine of my existence. it doesn't help that i work for a stressed out and greedy yappy dog. the most annoying part? could it be getting called into  johnny's  office for punching in 2 minutes late? or the fact that i am treated like a moron by a Bill Paxton-esque hick boy (referring to his role in Aliens (Pt. 2) "Gaaamee overr man --G A M E  O V E R. yeah. he talks like that. Looking like Howard the duck doesn't help his case either.) or maybe it's the sun and heat of the lumber yard.. nope. it's  the hick .   rant over ;) sorry kids!  (not too) funny how only the negative and lonliness get transferred over the the world wide web, as i tend to leave out the good stuff in my life, so maybe stay tuned. when i start to feel the love later on tonight, from the wine, i wanna' write some happy joy. wo0t. suprized how many (cute, cool, and mysterious) folks suprize me by referring back to the things i write, especially when i haven't talked to 'em in awhile, .. or ever. feedback is always welcome, wanted, and valued.  take it easy kids,   mikeanton.   no really.

       for the first time i find myself not longing for the past.  hooked on nostalgia  --wishing i was someplace i'd been before. without thinking of the future, i wish i'd manifested some sort of stable relationship by now. i want to hold out for the next one. that one girl that comes from the very hand of God to touch my life. the one that was always meant for me. the one maybe i've walked along with before, lifetimes ago. the click i feel starts off almost like deja vu. then it's an unspoken, seemingly pre-existing bond. a common plane we're both on. the more we talk, the more the story unfolds before us..   getting itchy feet again as well. last year at this time i just started debating the little thought-of question of calgary. it wasn't until september that i made that come to fruition, and by that time this year the strain of the need to stretch will be unbearable. whether it be getting out on my own in burlington, or hopping on a plane some place at random.. again. it will be done right. my mind is meandering around this decision, and will for some time. when the call comes from inside me someplace, it will be uprupt. it will be absolute and without warning. i can't live here anymore. on this street, in this skin, with these choices, people, and mindfuck.   have you hugged a stranger lately?   mikeanton.

       stepping on the brakes never felt so good. . .  today was the first day of carpooling to work with a fellow whom i had hooked up with a job; temping at the lumber yard. as he drove, i got a chance to look out my window, listen to the music  he  played on his stereo, (somewhat a bonus, considering mine was stolen pre-calgary) and lose myself in thought.  talking cars never really interested me. neither did stupid music about getting "to the centre of oh, ooh", and fucking men of many races. what is the profound message in that?  that you've got the clap?  what gets me most, is that because of these kind of people, boys like me look awful and like vile liars. " i say what i mean ". " i am different than most other guys ". " i am not looking for a cheap fuck, i want something concrete ." " i love you ". " what's in your heart and what you stand for are what is really getting to me ". All things said by friendly, genuine people. In addition to that, also said by shameless players. I understand the game is so hard to play when people can bend the rules at will, and fool us all. Maybe that's why I am not playing anymore. . . No, really. I feign from considering asking girls out, purely on the basis that for one, i have to deprogram everything they have come to beleive about the opposite sex. it's getting to be a pain in the ass. that is also assuming they're an innocent in the first place. which brings me to my other key goal; to discern their ambitions. it's hard when they have amazing eyes. i'm an eyes guy. it's tough.    not too sure where i am going with this. . i guess my point is this. thanks for ruining it for me.  you know who you are , you faking, dishonourable, pointless existences.  thanks a lot ;)   {and by no means whatsoever am i referring to anyone i know in particular}  heh, a little harsh, but is it? i don't mean it to be! in fact,  i'm in a good mood today . -- bold because it probably SEEMS rare, based on how i write, and the subject matter i choose. i assure you all, i am a very happy person :D   thinking about how good it feels to have a smaller role in the lives around me. to be breaking free one day at a time. not to say i'm never going to partake in party-favours again, no way. i'm just feeling like... like comfy clothes feel. wee!   i used to surround myself with people who had a story. it was all about the story. i overlooked their lack of morals, for ..the story.  the more out there, intriguing, mysterious, moral or not, i was right there. i also had a thing for the lost sheep of the world, convinced i could save them. assist them in cleaning up. taking their next step. trying to keep my own in queue, and not fall into their hole was somewhat easy at first. for about a day. i am getting sick of all the selfishness in the world. yet at the same time, i am bothered by the fact that friendliness is quite often received as stupidy. a hidden agenda. and a free spout to milk from. these days i am trying to be a little more selective of who i let in, and the rest, i put on a stupid face.   people always so easily underestimate you when you're happy all the time.   well. another day over, another one for the books --if you read this far, cool for giving a damn.  michael anton.

       3 days until  urlLink www.serotoninambition.cjb.net  loses it's web host ( urlLink Maggie  WRAWKS for all she's done for me--it's been almost the whole year. Thanks hun) and it could be a little bit of doing before I get it back up --and updated to version 3.0. If you take a gander, keep in mind none of my new art/photographs are on it.. A small taste of things to come? Maybe. Not too sure yet ;)  Also, I need some info! --Regarding  Radiohead 's post-poned Toronto show! Anyone got the scoop? House of Blues doesn't have anything on it that I can see.......  Michael Anton.

       in a neo-punk kinda' mood. ah yes, the memories associated with blink182...................... good times. work felt so short today. which immediately puts me on a good level ;) today was my bro's first day back to school...in 10 years. proud of the man. one of the men behind this man. feels good when i look to him as a great influence again, it's been too long..  another groovy beat; favourite game. cardigans. before they turned to crap. woohoo.  aw well. feelin good, and wasting it in front of a  magical box 'o' radiation  and networked goodness, as great as that sounds, is done for now. CHEERS..!  mike ry-doo-dah .

       ".. And always, if he had a little money, a man could get drunk. The hard edges gone, and the warmth. Then there was no loneliness, for a man could people his brain with friends, and he could find his enemies and destroy them. Sitting in a ditch, the earth grew soft under him. Failures dulled and the future was no threat. And hunger did not skulk about, but the world was soft and easy, and a man could reach the place he started for. The stars came down wonderfully close and the sky was soft. Death was a friend, and sleep was death's brother. The old times came back - a girl with pretty feet, who danced one time at home - a horse - a long time ago. A horse and a saddle. And the leather was carved. When was that? Ought to find a girl to talk to. That's nice. Might lay with her, too. But warm here. And the stars down so close, and sadness and pleasure so close together, really the same thing. Like to stay drunk all the time. Who say's it's bad? Who dares to say it's bad? Preachers -but they got their own kinda' drunkenness. Thin, barren women, but they're too miserable to know. Reformers -but they don't bite deep enough into living to know. No -the stars are close and dear and I have joined the brotherhood of the worlds. And everything's holy ..everything, even me."  The Grapes of Wrath; John Steinbeck.

        Two jumps in a week I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy Flying on your motorcycle Watching all the ground beneath you drop You'd kill yourself for recognition Kill yourself to never ever stop You broke another mirror You're turning into something you are not  Drying up in conversation You will be the one who cannot talk & all your insides fall to pieces You just sit there wishing you could still make love They're the ones who'll hate you when you think you've got the world all sussed out They're the ones who'll spit at you You will be the one screaming out  It's the best thing that you ever had It's the best thing that you ever had The best thing that you've had has gone away  Don't leave me high don't leave me dry   radiohead: high and dry    ...summer is gone and the party --like the people, the life, and the drugs ..have    all   gone    stale.   moving on past the single moments, the dry eyes, and broken hearts. it's autumn now and all i can think of right now is how nice it is when the crashing waves dull the wrenching in my head and heart....... how nice it's gonna be to shut up and start over clean.  from this point on, (not sure how long it'll last)  i think i am turning back to my tattered notebook for my thoughts, and writings. it's been fun, and meeting new people through this web log was a cool experience. hope everyone had as amazing a summer as i, and if we ever shared a talk, and you haven't heard from me in awhile, drop me a line..  michael anton, over. and  out . roofsessions@hotmail.com

       So yeah. I'm now writing on this thing again.  &nbsp;  Seems like a lot has changed since I last started writing in here, and no need to re-cap. It'll all work itself out eventually, but what bothers me is that all my decent posts have been removed. Those being the older ones. Maybe I did it with another web log? who knows. So basically all you can see is what happened when i just moved back from calgary just under two years ago I think? it's pretty un-interesting to say the least. . .&nbsp; If you're new to my posts, no point in reading up on me, or you'll&nbsp;discover i am a dry read..  &nbsp;  Regardless,  More big stuff is in queue for me. Stay tuned. I got all this time on lunch break now because I quit smoking. Grooven times.  &nbsp;  'Till later-- Cheers!  Mike.

        not much going on.   started a text messaging network for employees at my job tonight. i work at a call centre and cell phones are forbidden, but we all use em for text messaging anyways. i figure if we all had a forum to shoot the shit, while we are talking on calls, we could be pretty ..connected. make plans after work, or spaz out and rant. sure would be a great way to plan some sort of movement. maybe a walkout, or at a certain time we all go into "systems down". hell yeah. this could be fun.    urlLink http://upoc.com/group.jsp?group=ttodot &nbsp;   anyhoo.  nothing much goin on. just passin the time and getting in a memorable moment whenever i can. been really chillin' out lately, and worrying about the future less. i'm not so much concerned with the outcome of things anymore and am just accepting things more often. life is great when you don't have to pass every minute of every day with a gut wrenching knot in your chest.   yep.  drop me a  urlLink line  sometime if you're reading this and are bored, or got something to say. cheers!

        no, i'm not moving just yet. maybe i won't. but if i do you know i am going to do it proper.  &nbsp;  but why is it every six months i run away? in the past, 6 months time meant the end of a relationship with a girl. or it meant the job i&nbsp; had got stale. or maybe it's the amount of time of silence before i pick up an old friend where we left off. it's how long i pick anything up, or the amount of time i put something down.  &nbsp;  never let anyone too close or they might figure me out.  &nbsp;  nevertheless,  i am not referring to anything too much in particular. i was initially debating moving in with a buddy to barrie. start a t-shirt company. get a life. keep the girl. move  forward and keep my place in line .  &nbsp;  now as if almost by instinct i am sealing a different fate. i am opening the door wide to air out the fire in the hole. i am selling my computer in the coming weeks. i am turning my back on natalie ( my car ) and freeing myself up  a la  fight club.  &nbsp;  i did it before.  &nbsp;  this time seems like it will have longer lasting effects to linger. when the car is gone this time, it won't just be hiding under a sheet in my parents garage. the computer will not be replaced by a laptop. the idea is to free myself up for something,  somewhere &nbsp;better. $500/month for a car (payments + insurance)&nbsp;plus gas and parking tix is a bit much, wouldn't you think? --and how many of you can boast selling off everything you own more than once just to know what it feels like to walk down the street with your life on your back? last time i did this it failed because i was not prepared to do it completely naked. i did not trust my guts and i got burned. i kept the car in the garage, and told my folks it wasn't forever. the car payments, and the poor living choices out west were my end.  &nbsp;  my girl thinks i am crazy, but realizes the liberation this feeling of wreckless abandon brings. it's like a girl cutting her hair off. i'm not saying i am running off to far away lands. i'm not saying i am even formulating a plan --more of a  feeling .  &nbsp;  the weightlessness is inspiring.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    Oh noose tied myself in, tied myself too tightLooking kind of anxious in your cross armed stanceLike a bad tempered prom queen at a homecoming danceAnd I claim I'm not excited with my life any moreSo I blame this town, this job, these friendsThe truth is it's myselfAnd I'm trying to understand myselfand pinpoint where i amBy the time I get things figured outI've change the whole damn planOh noose tied myself in, tied myself too tightTalking shit about a pretty sunsetBlanketing opinions that i'll probably reget soonI've changed my mind so much I cant even trust itMy mind changed me so much I cant even trust myself&nbsp;  : lyrcis by Modest Mouse : "Talkin' shit about a pretty sunset."       ..btw. if you've read this far maybe you'd be interested in helping me out with a server to host only my images? i am turning this into a photoblog..

         i am jacks&nbsp;usurped addictive nature .   the fact that i hate the stupidity that follows after i hit a bong. the dirty feeling in my veins when i drink. the crispy burnt out feeling the days following --if i don't smoke&nbsp;another sesh.&nbsp;the people i can often associate with upon acquiring my ganja. the money i spend. . . there really is no reason for me to continue with this current  high infatuation .   it's going to take some time before i can be clean with myself. free myself up from this. go out the way i came in and never look back. i make everything sound so drama on this thing --i am tired of killing myself from the inside out. i am sick of being another face on the couch that noone remember's the next day. . . i am tired of forgetting just about anything.   i hate how all this said; yet&nbsp;the slight smell of it, or session invite will be my undoing. i hate how the addiction trumps all. with any luck i can quit pot like i did cigarettes. with any luck i can free up $2,500 in the coming weeks.  with any luck. . .

       Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of it has caught my eye And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing I am captivated {Chorus} I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me So isoloated, so motivated I am certain now that {Chorus} So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away (3x) So let me slip against the current So let me slip away (4x) {Chorus} Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption..  vindicated. dashboard confessionals.
