        Many of you understand the difficulty in being drop dead gorgeous.   Peabs  understands more than anybody, for I am the most beautiful man to have ever lived.  Schmobvs.  But  Peabs  wasn't always as confident as I am today-  The New York Times  calls it  "obnoxious arrogance" , but they can ess my fucking cock.    Do you have any idea how hard it is to be seven years old and have a 19-inch D&trade;?  Shmears.  While certainly I have been taking part in kinky, dirty sex since birth,  Peabs  still found it awkward when my professors used to hit on me.  Sure, I know what you're saying; this is what  Peabs  should expect if you're a well-endowed Oxford-educated scholar, attending Harvard Law before the age of ten.  This is why I turned to drugs.  Well, that and  Dr. Bill Cosby .  Robvs.  I remember vividly, at age 10, when  Coz  and yours effing truly were high-profile scenesters within the NYC club circuit.  It was a great way to blow off steam in between fashion shoots and bar exams.  Obvs.   Peabs  had already been exclusively blowing rails since 1965, but I had never tried E.  Okay, that's a lie.   Peabs  actually used to deal E out of my Tribeca loft in '79 in exchange for hand jobs and Gyne-Lotrimin.  At any rate, everybody in the scene wanted to fuck me (a ten-year-old A-list supermodel, who wouldn't want to fuck this perfect body?).  And let's not forget about  Coz ; he was still riding high from the worldwide success of " urlLink Leonard Part 6 ."  Schmobvs.    Anywizz, one particular night,  Cosby  and  Peabs  were at the closing of the late, great  urlLink Paradise Garage , in Greenwich Village.  I was fucking  Cheryl Tiegs  at the time, and  Coz  was with multiple women.  This happened to be the night of my first ecstasy-induced public orgy.  Hey,  Peabs  was a late-bloomer, so suck it!  Gobble, gobble!  My lovely supermodel fuck-buddy felt it would be a good idea to pop about 5 or 6 pills and find a bunch of other really amazing-looking people and have wild, exhibitionist sex with them.  With that,  Peabs  turned to her and responded:   "Tigs."   Now, let's set the record straight.  I meant to say  "Tiegs" , but it came out wrong, which I attribute to the half-dozen bumps of K  Peabs  had ingested for dinner.  Be that as it may, this was an epic night.  Not only did I take part in my very first (of many, duhvs) ecstasy-induced public orgy, but I also created a word that is still used to this very day in everybody's everyday language.  Tigs.   Peabs  knows what's on your mind.  You're wondering:  where the fuck is this fucking fuck-up going with all this brilliant nonsense?   And that's a legit question.  Right now,  Coz  and my pretty motherfucking self are driving to my hometown of Detroit, to attend  urlLink Uncle Grambo 's 30th birthday extravaganza.  Let's just say we plan to create even more unintelligible phrases and take part in ecstasy-induced public orgies all evening long.  Bovs on everyone's tees, you fucking vibrators!    Happy birthday,  Bizness .   Peabs  loves you.  Obvs.  And so does  Dr. Bill Cosby .  Right,  Coz ?   Happy flazzum, Grizzum Grazzum!   beauty makes terms with time and his worms, when loveliness says sweetly Yes to wind and cold; and how much earth is Madge worth? Inquire of the flower that sways in the autumn she will never guess. but i know  my heart fell dead before: obvs in '04&trade;

        Shmears.   Peabs  isn't a terribly religious man.  This may or may not be a factor in the upcoming election, but it doesn't change the fact the I love to have sex with nuns.  They're just so damn sexually repressed, they get a little wild in the sack, if you know what  Peabs  means; and what I mean is, they love it in the ass.  Hard.  Bovs.  Anyway, before  Peabs  pisses off every religious activist in the country, let me at least come clean and say that I did some realization last evening, with the help of a coked-out  Dr. Bill Cosby .  If I want to be President this or any year, I am going to need to broaden my religious horizons to something more than just nun-fucking.  As arrogant and wonderful and popular and pretty and, as the French say  cru, animalistic, avec un grand âne  as  Peabs  is, I am not bigger than  Jesus .  Close.  Certainly there have been times when on 'shrooms in which  Peabs  thought I was the son of God, but who hasn't?  Shmears.  I also think I'm a fucking turkey, so suck it.  Gobble, gobble!  Okay, I am clearly babbling this morning, so I will atttempt to get to the point.  Upon arriving in the States last evening,  Coz  and yours effing truly decided to have an  Obvs in '04 Campaign  fundraiser, and invite the most powerful religious figures in the United States.   urlLink  Kerry  and  Bush  can battle for votes in Iowa all they effing want ; no way in fucking hell could they match the debaucherous display  Peabs  and  Dr. Bill Cosby  put on last night.  Duhvs.  The night, admittedly, began a little awkward.  One of the first guests to arrive was  Sister Betty Obal , of the Sisters of Loretto.  I knew  Betty  from back in my swinging days at Hopkins med, and she actually claims that  Peabs  was the reason she joined the clergy.  Hey, I didn't force my D&trade; in your mouth, or that special K up your nose, Sister, so don't blame  Peabs  if you used to be a kinky mama!  Needless to say, I was a bit nervous when I saw her walk through the door; but this changed when our eyes met.  It was like we were in a Baltimore bathhouse again.  Schmobvs.     Coz  also had himself quite a night.  I know what you're thinking;  obvs  Coz  did .  And while every night is party night for  Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable , he never seizes to amaze  Peabs .  Last night was no exception.  In all honesty, most religious figures are not very pretty- none nearly as pretty as  Peabs , but you could make a milkshake out of  Jude Law  and  Brad Pitt 's jazz, insert it into  Gisele 's vaggie vag, and the result would still be maybe a quarter as pretty as my right cheekbone.  Shmears.  Anywizz,  Coz  made sure that we'd have some call girls and crank at the fundraiser in order to liven up the party.  Let's just say, the last I saw of  Coz  was when he grabbed former president of Union Theological Seminary,  Rev. Donald W. Shriver Jr. , and led him into a room full of methed-out prostitutes, each named after the respective  urlLink seven natural wonders of the world .  I've heard that the  Lighthouse of Alexandria  tosses a mean fucking salad.  Is that true,  Dr. Bill Cosby ?   You bet your bazzle bozzum flozzle!  Flazzum!   Even if you hate me, you can't stop reading  Peabs .  Face it, I'm the most fascinating person in the fucking universe.  Duh.  my girl's tall with hard long eyes as she stands, with her long hard hands keeping silence on her dress, good for  obvs in  '04&trade;

        If there's anything everybody knows about  Peabs , it's that I love women.  Dirty, skanky whores, to be exact.  Sure, we shan't forget my lustful appetite for narcotics, alcohol and designer clothes.  But filthy-ass, diseased, crack-addicted sluts are my main vice.    Dr. Bill Cosby 's, as wizz.  Obvs.  Contrary to popular belief,  Peabs  was not always in Thailand during my sabbatical.  Oh no.  I can only stand being away from American gentleman's clubs for so long.  Duh.  A few weeks back, yours effing truly and  Coz  decided to make a low-key visit to the States, to take part in the bachelor party for the  Obvs in '04 Campaign  archivist,  C. Friggs .  Now, while  Peabs  doesn't condone marriage of any kind, I do condone bachelor parties.   I mean, shmears; how can one not enjoy mindless fun- like doing bongtokes of afghan kush and getting fingerfucked by strippers named after seasons?  Ess my effing D&trade;, you fucking clit-rings.  Gobble!  Anyway, whilst bovsing on numerous tees,  Peabs  became smitten with one particular lass.  Her name was  Sequoia  ( "you know, like, after the tree!" ).  She was wildly stupid, but gave one sloppy motherfucking beej; I had not had a hummer like that since I was running Warner Bros. and hosting the premiere for  urlLink "Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead" .  Thanks go out to  Joanna Cassidy  and  Keith Coogan  for that miraculous suckjob!  Shmears.     Moving on, it wasn't just the head that turned me onto  Sequoia .  While normally  Peabs  digs chicks with brains- and by brains, I really mean gigantic fucking tees, oooh-jah, boohjah!- I was really into this particular girl's lack of knowledge about any fucking thing imaginable.  When I mentioned to her that I wrote  Catcher in the Rye , her response was:  "oh, well, did you play baseball?" .  Now,  Peabs  has heard this response before.  But she really fucking meant it.  And with that, I whipped out my cock and blew a hot load onto her left ear.  Schmobvs.  Currently, I am on a flight back to Detroit.  The next few days should be absolute madness; I plan to do countless interviews with the media, ass-fuck at least anywhere between four and one thousand and forty call girls, and blow rails with  Dr. Bill Cosby .  Aren't you excited,  Coz ?   Youuuuuuuuu've gots to know that my flazzum is still a little flizzum on the bazzle bozzle!     Understandably so,  Coz  is a little weary about coming back into the public eye.  And for good reason.  I'm sure you all heard about  urlLink his comments towards African-Americans, the way they speak, and their economic status .  If anything, I find it laughable, considering my running mizz made all of his money speaking absolute fucking nonsense on television for so many years.  If I wasn't tripping my fucking balls off on blotter acid and AMT right now,  Peabs  wouldn't be able to understand what the fuck "flazzum bozzle bop" meant eiths.  Robvs.  So, with that, I'm going to pop a bottle of oxy and try to relax on the remainder of my flight (i.e. give the flight attendant a  John Wilkes Booth , duhvs).  More from the campaign trail tomorrow.  Ejaculate all over your effing breasts, you dildo-loving hussies!  Bovs.  six are in a room's dark around)  five (six are in a room's) one  is red  and(six are in) four obvs in  '04&trade;

        Bovs.  A wise man once said:  " Peabs , I used to long to be like you... to fist Chlamydia-infested harlots; to snort countless grams of ketamine. And with your retirement, my attempts to achieve the American Dream have become futile. Please come back,  Peabs . You are everything to me. A guru, a patron saint. An adonis."    And while  Peabs  agrees with everything  Joe Lieberdurst  has to say about yours effing truly, it was still difficult to leave the lifestyle I had been enraptured with these past few months. Duhvs.  So, y'all are probably wondering a few things. Don’t you worry, my lovelies;  Peabs  just blew an eight-ball of Arm & Hammer&reg;, and freebased some Midol&reg;. Schmobvs. I'm ready to answer any of your questions. Below, I have transcribed a  urlLink CNN  exclusive interview  Peabs  recently took part in; my first interview in months:   CNN:     Peabs , where have you been all this time?    PEABS:    Peabs  has been partying on the west coast of Thailand- the  urlLink Phang-nga bay , snatch. Most of my days consist of speaking with my American contacts regarding the  Obvs in '04&trade; Campaign , mainlining Thai heroin into my toes (no trackmarks, obvs), and taking part in filthy assfucking orgies with my friend and yours,  Dr. Bill Cosby . I've also found time to collectively bovs upon the tees of everyone within a 400 mile radius. Mmmmmm, ain't nothing hotter than  urlLink Krabi  vag.  Except for my hot fucking D&trade;.  Hogsviously.     CNN:    Speaking of  Coz , how is he?    PEABS:   Why don't I let him answer that for himself?   DR. BILL COSBY:   Youuuuuuuuuuu've gots to know that the flazzum bozzle is bazzle razzle, like the flizzum puddin' falafel boffle!    CNN:    Is it true,  Rep. Peabs , that your campaign has gone south since your hiatus?    PEABS:   Let's face it, fictional CNN reporter.  I was delusional.   Peabs  honestly thought that I could make a run at the White House.  And to be honest, for a while there, I really had a shot.  America was coming around.  But, unfortunately, we're  years away from getting someone like  Peabs  into office.  I still plan to make some noise come this November, don't get me wrong.  But it's the kind of noise you hear when I'm in midst of fingerbanging your grandmother.  Or smoking crack with  Louis Farrakhan .    COSBY:   Bozzle!   CNN:    Is it true that you think that you're a turkey?    PEABS:  Peabs  is indeed a turkey.  But you best try me with an assload of gravy, because sometimes I get a little dry.  Gobble, gobble!   CNN:     Rep. Peabs, Dr. Bill Cosby , we thank you for your time.    PEABS:   And I'd like to thank you for that hot effing rim-job you gave me.  Shmears on your fucking lab-maj.  So, needless to say,  Peabs  is back.  I know you're all breathing a sigh of relief.  I understand my relevance in American pop culture;  Peabs  is a fucking phenomenon, a beacon if you will.  And without me, well, your lives would be ordinary.  Filled with ennui.  I exist only to be pretty, brilliant and high.  And to make your life worth living.  And to give the  Bush  twins a bukkake casserole for lunch.  Obvs.  Stay tuned for more as yours effing truly and  Coz  make our way back to the States, and into your bedroom.  Speedballs will be provided.  Bovs on your fucking tees, you handjobs.  children guessed(but only a few and down they forgot as up they grew autumn winter spring summer) that noone loved him more by more" obvs in  '04&trade;
