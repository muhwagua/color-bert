       urlLink Here  is another good article about the US push for war in Syria. Watch out for US trying to worm it's way into invading Syria. Most of the arguements are bullshit, and the US admin knows   it. The US feels they can do anything now. Write your goverment and tell them not to give the US war machine there permission.

      The quote for today comes from Pierre Joesph Proudhon: "To be governed is to be watched over, inspected, spied on, directed, legislated at, regulated, docketed, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, assessed, weighed, censored, ordered about.... To be goverened means to be, at each transaction, at each movement, noted, registered, taxed, stamped, measured, evaluated, patented, licensed, authorized, endorsed, admonished, hampered, reformed, rebuked, arrested,... held to ransom, exploited, monopolized, extorted, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed, and then, at the least resistance, ... to be repressed, fined, imprisoned, machine-gunned, judged, condemmed, deported, flayed, sold, betrayed, and finally mocked, ridiculed, insulted, dishonored."

      A good article on the state of US enviromental regulations can be found  urlLink here . Beware it is streaming audio. I find the way the United States treats the enviroment disgusting. Although the US has better enviromental regulations then most of the world this isn't saying much since most of the 3rd world can't vote. I think if we really cared about our children, like the politicans say almost every day, then we wouldn't destroy the world they are going to be living in. Oh ya don't eat lettuce.

       urlLink Penny Arcade  has a good point today about branding. How often have you given directions by saying take a left at the Arby's or some such corporate store. This links peoples location with brand names. People will always link your house , either consciously or unconsciously, with said corporate name. Your very geography becomes integrated with corporate brands. Try to give directions only using street names at least until corporations start buying street names.

      Sorry for no posts yesterday I got up late and was to busy with chores and getting ready to play  urlLink D&D  so I didn't have the time. Their is a good article on  urlLink Indymedia  about the destruction of the free press. With the corporate media being escorted by the us goverment, and the non-corporate media being target by the US miltary and being restricted in Israel very little information will be pubished. Only propaganda is being fed to the people it is very disgraceful. Without a semi-objective view point we will al be in the dark. What journalist would want to go do a fair report when they could be  urlLink targeted .

      Went and saw the concert at unm today. The Donnas were playing however I left before they got on stage. I was too hot and I didn't have enough water. I'm going to get some sushi tonight with my girlfriend few things in life are better then sushi. My surreal experiance continues as I was about to leave my friend Mikey's I hear a knocking on the window it is my friend Taylor. He got into a fight with his girl, who he lives with, and he needed a place to chill out for a while. It was very wierd trying to talk him calm just as I thought the night was done. He eventually left and I was stuck going to bed at 4:00am not a good time for bed. To early to do anything but to late to say you had a hell of a night. Besides all that I'm starting to have an obsession with fractals appearing in nature. I look and a dandilion and it gets a little wierd.

      What to do about the world? We meander along like blind elephants in a rice paper story. We destroy and loot everything we can get our hands on. I know that our instincts have a powerful hold upon our actions, but can't we overcome our history. The primate instincts of survival and competition are making it so that we won't be able to survive for much longer. Maybe genetic modification is the anwser. Maybe we can recreate ourselves into something that doesn't destroy everything around it. Maybe we could change into a people who love learning and art instead of money and power.

      Me personally I have trouble with porn because I always want to know the star's storys.  How old are they really, how did they get into porn, are long term relationships diffecult to mantain in the industry etc...  I wish someone would do a really killer documintry of the life of porn stars.  One of those no holds barred deals you know.  I also have a habit of people watching something I picked up from dear old dad who would sit on a bench in the mall for hours just watching.  Working in a restrant gives me plenty of people to watch today for instance: guy comes into the shop sits, girl comes into shop and sits. Guy spills salt shaker on girl. They talk he moves to sit down across from her.  they drink and talk salt still sits on floor because everytime someone tries to clean it up guy and girl say thats alright we'll get it.  They never clean up salt they do leave together and thus become the talk of Il Vicino staff for the better part of an hour. Speculation about the after lunch activities for the two ran the gambit. Point is you never know you might just be the most intresting thing going on.

      My life is like a dream sometimes. I'm just not sure what details are important and what is just background noise. I have a sneaking suspicion that everything is important. What to do then? How can I take everything in at once? Or maybe it is all a dream. I would like to get a good look at the universe for perspective, but then again it would be through my perspective. If I could only be someone else just for a minute I think that would help me get away from my biases and from my ego. Maybe we as humanity should change into a hivemind structure that would get us away for this self-focus that plagues our society. I hate it when I see people who think about no one else. I constently wonder what people are thinking, going, feeling, or seeing. What are the storys that people have? Who are those people on the freeway? Ahh questions which may never be anwsered.

      Quote for today is from Lewis Carrol:   "`I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty--'    `That's right,' said the Queen, patting her on the head, which Alice didn't like at all, `though, when you say "garden,"--I'VE seen gardens, compared with which this would be a wilderness.'    Alice didn't dare to argue the point, but went on: `--and I thought I'd try and find my way to the top of that hill--'    `When you say "hill,"' the Queen interrupted, `_I_ could show you hills, in comparison with which you'd call that a valley.'    `No, I shouldn't,' said Alice, surprised into contradicting her at last:  `a hill CAN'T be a valley, you know.  That would be nonsense--'    The Red Queen shook her head, `You may call it "nonsense" if you like,' she said, `but I'VE heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!'"

      Well I took my math test and I think I did pretty well. A huge weight has been lifted off of me now I just have the final to go. I've started on my final essay for philosophy. I'm trying to link quantum physics with existentialism. In other non school related thoughts I keep getting freaked out by this country I live in. What is the deal with people who are around me I can't find an intellegent conversation to save my life. Do people really watch those realty tv shows? What kind of thought process is running through peoples minds when they want to go to war in iraq and now syria. Do people think that the privates in the army went into the armed forces to serve the US or to escape their oppresive economic situation. Does the majority of americans think that the us goverment doesn't abuse it's power or that Bush actually has their best intrests in mind? Please people don't let me loose my faith in humanity.

      Friday is here and I have a major math test on monday. I predict that I will be able to do nothing but study this weekend. I need to score at least an 83 to keep up my average but if I could get an A that would be fantastic. Of course no matter what my average is if I fail the final I fail the class. So I need to start studying for that as well. Sorry I'll stop ranting about school. So Imperial America is gearing up for an invasion of Syria. The excuse is the same self-defence of course we still haven't found chemical weapons in Iraq.

With only a couple weeks left of school I really need to make sure I do everything I can to get good grades, but I have this natural lazyness that always gets in my way.

      Well it turns out that both of my classes were cancelled today, which is nice. It would be a lot nicer if I didn't have to study for tests that happen next week. The wind is blowing here I don't know if you all know about New Mexican winds, but there are few things worse then the endless dust and howling. Susan is sick today which is unfortunate since not only is she unwell but the likelyhood of me becoming sick has risen quite a bit. The syria situation is becoming worse.

      So Syria looks like it is next on the list for US invasion. With allegedly selling arms to Iraq(along with Russia, US, and China) and allegedly hiding Iraqy leaders their future prospects don't look very good. I'm curious as to how big the American empire will reach within the next 5 years or the next 10. We have decided to do anything to support our lifestyle including invading other countrys so we can strip their resources. Syria will become the next big Adidas manufacturer. Now that we've supposedly won the war by taking Baghdad the press is going to vanish. There will be no coverage for the puppet goverment or the exploitation of the Iraq's oil.

      Another thursday here with another week of classes over. The semester is nearly done which means tests and essays coming in droves. I recieved the schedule for next semester yesterday and I 've been looking at what I need to take, but I have an open 3 credit class slot if anybody knows of any really cool classes I should take.

      A pen register is an electronic device which records all numbers dialed from a particular phone line.  A trap and trace device records the originating phone numbers of all incoming calls on a particular phone line.  hope this clears that up.

      Maybe someone can clarify a few things for me regarding the patriot act 2.  First off, what are pen registers and trap and trace devices?  Here's some context: The same definition of terrorist activities would also apply through cross-referencing provisions, see 18 U.S.C. § 2711(1) and 3127(1) (as amended), in the chapters of the criminal code that govern accessing stored communications and the use of  pen registers  and  trap and trace devices  (chapters 121 and 206).

      Here is a  urlLink story  about just how scary things are getting. Please Please march on April 12th nothing will change if you just sit around and bitch. Very few things bother me as much as people who care about an issue but do nothing to promote that issue. How much better a place if everyone actually promoted their  agendas instead of just bitching that they aren't getting their way.

      "'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.  Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. 'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.  'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.  'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.  'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said the March Hare."               --Lewis Carroll

      Yet another day to reach enlightenment. You know it's really hard work trying to think enlightened thoughts all day, but seriously folks today is a good day to read some poetry or view some paintings or just read philosphy. After all nothing is more important then following your intellectual pursuits. I am off to class soon to enjoy the teachings of my professors. This semester has been a lot of fun and I am definitly looking forward to next semester when I finally get into some real math and physics classes no more of that intro shit for me. On the war front I think that  urlLink this  article sums up some of my views quite succinctly. I've still been trying to find any mention in the press about the current economic depression with out success. Apparently since there is a war going on noone is actually out of work. Ah when will we learn?

      So I went out searching for a job again today. I understand that my application is less then impressive and that my handwritting makes it look like the application was filled out by a four year old on acid, but you'd think I'd be able to find something somewhere. Oh well I must continue to soldier on. In other news the  urlLink Czar  and his men are invading Baghdad. I hope that his Proconsul will actually give these people something better then what they had, but after our past  urlLink attempts  I have little hope.

      Sorry that I haven't posted much this past week, but I just haven't been home that much. I feel that any week where I'm out and about as much as possible is a good week. I'm planning on going to the zoo on Saturday I haven't been in a couple weeks and I love to walk around there. I've been thinking about the way our political system works. It seems to me that a controlling group see the people as stupid. Now I see the people as maybe a little ignorent but they are not stupid. I think the greatest fear of many is that the people will start to control their own destiny.  I think that many of the rich see the people as scum to be ignored. The amount of control that money related institutions exerts upon the people on a regular basis is scary. I find it mind boggoling that people would want to control other peoples lives at all.

I just hope this feeling of dread in the back of my head goes away soon otherwise it will really start to get on my nerves.

      This is the third time I have to do this response. AAAAHHHHHH. 1. Globilization is not Global village. Globilization is a WTO and IMF process. 2. Karzai is not the most legitimate guy he was "elected" by commitee a commitee that was appointed. 3. Th library thing is true. You have to get support from FISA who has only once turned down the goverment since it came into existence. That denial can be found in my archieves somewhere. 4. "What's the point of getting people killed just to be consistent?" This stinks of cynicism. If we're not consistent whats the point of having policy at all. 5.  If the WMD exist it's by luck not because we knew they were there. Most of the state department's claims can't be  urlLink verified . 7. The embedded reborters are not objective. The US has  urlLink something  against the unembedded reporters. 8. The contracts are very suspect. The American people are paying for this war and the big profits are going to some very unfortunate companies like Halburtin(spell). 9. Perhaps if Syria hands over it's WMD Israel should do the same. 10. A prevailing system does not make it a right one. The arguement that because something has been around for a long time makes it ok is a pretty bad one.  The Article isn't perfect isn't even a great one but I thought it was interesting and apparently so did you. The writter did get some facts wrong, but your philosphy seems to be that either nothing can be done about it or this is the way it has always been. I think that is very cynical.

It is constructed by divisive and discriminatory laws, inflexible organisations, acquisitive ideologies of wealth, a deeply rooted class system and policies which serve privilege in the short term and destroy society in the long term."" -- Peter Townshend

      For you nanotech fans out there  urlLink this  is your cup of tea. Warning it is a pdf document. It is about the use of nanotech in defense. I also found another pdf about a comprehensive energy strategy for the US that doesn't use fossil fuels. You can find the doc  urlLink here . I would argue that we need to move away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible I can think of several viable alternatives that already exist. Yet the oil companies have a strangle hold on energy policy. The sooner we move to a non polluting fuel the better. Unfortuantly capatilism gets in the way every time. I hate economics not because I don't understand it, but because I don't understand why we have to have greed in the first place. I wish people would understand that this endless cycle of economics isn't getting anyone anywhere. Learning, art, love, and beauty should be our values instead of greed, economic growth, and competition.

      Reaching back many posts: I think that jury nullification will happen, but that it ought not to.  UPDATE:  Ugh.  That didn't explain anything either.  Add, "before we further empower juries viz judges and lawyers," to the above sentence.  The reason is that I think it would mean less and less support for jury trials, and more decisions by opaque bureaucracy.  Here's  urlLink Reynolds'  conclusion: "Reempowering the jury, through both appropriately couched nullification instructions and other structural mechanisms, is likely to improve the situation considerably. "  What I was referring to as a bad thing was prosecutors bypassing juries to get around this, which is what he talks about at the beginning of the article.  Sorry I cluttered up your weblog with that mess...

      I've started writting my final paper for my philosophy class. My thesis is "This paper does not exist." Maybe I need more sanity in my life but I think it's a great topic for a philosophy paper. In other news I'm a little hung over from a night on the town with Adam and Susan. When will I learn that drinking to much will fuck me up the next day? Oh well at least I don't have anything other then standard classes today.

      Very good article Sam. Which inspires today's quote: "Every jury in the land is tampered with and falsely instructed by the judge when it is told that it must accept as the law that which has been given to them, or that they can decide only the facts in the case"    --Lord Denham, O'Connell v. Rex (1884)  p.s. Sam I'm a little confused you say the jury nullification is bad news but the article you pointed to supports jury nullification. Do you support jury nullification?

      So I've been working a bunch lately and I have to say I'd much rather be doing school work. At least when I'm doing school work my mind becomes sharper or at least doesn't turn into mush. When I'm at work I can feel my brain being destroyed by the mindlessness of it all. I can't wait till school starts again I'm looking forward to this next semester. In other news everything is going pretty good I haven't been maimed in a horrible farm combine accident, which is a good thing. I'm currently trying to plan something cool to do for me and susan's 1st cycle. Any ideas would be much appreciated.

My one year anniversary with susan is coming up which I still need to plan for. My friend Erica is having a hard time out in California and I'm trying to think of a way to help her. I haven't been hanging out with my friends much for two reasons one because I have been working a whole bunch and two I have been on a sort of intellectual kick lately and my friends haven't been so it's kind of harder to have conversations when I want to talk about poltics and philosphy and my friends don't.

      So that's it Susan came over tonight and we talked for a while and it was decided that because of irrecicilbe differences that we should no longer be together. I feel like shit however I do have a arrogant bastard to cheer me up. I wish I could share the problems that led up to this break up with my millions of readers however I don't think it would be appropriate. I wish things could have worked out. Oh well at least now I'm free to live my prepubescent fantasies. Unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen damn why can't life be more like porno films. I'm just rambling now I should get back to my arrogant bastard and then I found a stone which from the same place that should help to drown my sorrows.

      So last wed. my girlfriend and I decided to take a "break" from our relationship. I am not very happy about this in fact you could say I'm very unhappy about the whole situation. Why are we taking a "break"? I guess that we have both become very frustrated with everything around us and we've been taking it out on each other. However I'm still very much in love with susan and I would hate for this to be the end I do have my doubts on wether this relationship will continue though. When Susan came over to tell me that she wanted to take a break she allready had all my stuff from her place packed and in her car. So it was a foregone conclusion for her. There are other things that also lead me to doubt our future together however I don't think this is the place or time to talk about them. So I'm fucking bummed about the whole situation. I could use some advice if anyone with knowledge about relationships has any to offer please e-mail me by clicking on the contact button.

      So my weekend is over which means I get to stop working and go to school the endless cycle. I am currently rereading the Tao of Pooh and the book is definitly is helping to stop the hate that builds up inside. I'd like to be more upbeat but it is really hard to when shitty things keep happening. I need a vacation I need to go somewhere where I don't know anyone and wander about for a couple weeks looking at art and doing improving myself.

      So the saddness and self-loathing have pretty much taken over my life now. It's getting way to hard to get out of bed. Which of course makes me screw myself when it comes to school. So far I haven't reached a point of no return in my school work but I am affraid I'm going to have to drop my phil 156 course because I've just missed to many classes because I can't get out of bed. The problem is there is no one to blame but myself which increases my self loathing which makes me screw up more of my life it's a nasty cycle. I have no idea how I can begin to help myself get out of this shit. This sucks.

      No posts for over a month that is a record for me. Things have been very wierd for me I've been feeling very detachted from everything around me. That feeling is never good it gets me into a lot of trouble. I have a math test coming up that is going to take a lot of prep and while I've started doing this prep I don't know if I can motivate myself enough to actually do enough work. I'm very tired I just can't seem to get into anything lately, and I have a lot more anger now then I usually do. I need to take stock of my self get better control over myself unfortunatly I don't seem to have the time.

      I thought  urlLink this  comic was pretty good. I'm doing good today no work so I get to relax. I've managed to calm down a lot in the past couple of days and I think that everyone around me would agree that that is a good thing. In other news I finely got off my ass and joined a gym I hope to become super buff or at least in some sort of shape. I'm planning to go out to La during the 5th and 6th of december to go visit my sister and jon. That should be a great time. I think it will also be nice just to get out of albq for a while.

      Things are going pretty good today. I've not been feeling very fell today but I'm at least in a pretty good mood. I have to work all weekend. I just can't say how much I hate working these morning weekend shifts.  Way to many people in this town order pizza for lunch don't they relize that pizza is terrible for you.  Oh well I guess it's my job to serve them until they die or there fingers become to fat to use the phone.

      I didn't make it to the new matrix movie today which is unfortunate, but I don't really mind that much.

      So I'm doing better then I was. I think that I am through the worst of my "down cycle". While life may not be full of roses it's been better then it was a week ago. I have been keeping myself busy and have been reading a bunch of books on Taoism which I find interesting. I've been hanging out with mike a bunch which I think is good for both of us. I'll post some more in the morning inculding a review of the new matrix movie.

      So I've been writing short stories lately. It's a good outlet for creativity that hasn't had an outlet in the past couple of months. I'm writing two one is auto biographical crap and the other is a sci fi story that is also kind of cheesy however I'd like to improve my creative writing especially now that I have my laptop. There is nothing like sitting at a coffee house and having a mini world setup before you. I need to some serious self- examming and fix the parts that I find lacking. I also need to get back into shape. I'm thinking of joining a gym so that at least I'll have access to a couple machines.

      Hello everybody. I finished my big ass math test and even though it was damn tough I think I did ok. I stayed up WAY to late last night playing civ III with epw. That game has to be the most addictive fun game ever made. I've got a bunch of homework that I need to do this week which is ok the worst thing right now is that my body is trying to kill me with allergies. Susan's folks left after a visit that she enjoyed, but I think she's pretty happy to have her apartment to herself again. Here is a couple of stories that caught my attention:  urlLink This stuff  is so cool the least dense substance ever found it's carbon nano-foam.   urlLink Here  is a article about 52 people arrested in south Africa due to a law that has been around since the apartheid era, and this law is pretty nasty.  urlLink Here  is a good story about the 9/11 commission and the white house's lack of cooperation. That's all for now I'll try and update some more either later tonight or tomorrow.

      Hello all here I am on my spring break trying to catch up on school work. I have a Calc test on Monday that I need to do well on and a paper due soon after for my philosophy class. I've also picked up an extra two shifts at work so that I can get a nice sized paycheck this pay period. Susan's folks are coming into town on Thursday so she's stressed out cleaning and making everything ready for their visit. She also has a test on Thursday in her bio class which sucks because she's going to be working all day at O'neils on St. Patty's day wed so she'll be tired and stressed on Thursday when her test and parents arrive. I wish I could do more to help her. In other news we're going to go spend a weekend up in Colorado on April 10th and 11th( my birthday)  which is going to be very fun.

      Lots and lots of work to do this week. This is the week before spring break so all my teachers have tests and papers do this week so I'm spending all my time at the library writing, studying, and doing problems. Other then being super stressed out though I'm doing pretty good. Susan is also stressed out because her classes are also pushing her hard. Mikey's job seems to be pushing him really hard and I don't think he gets as much time to relax as he should. Epw has a new job as a computer repair guy. Adam is doing pretty good.

      So my trip was a whole bunch of fun. We made it to Creede right in front of a snow storm which dumped 6 inchs of snow as we watched. We truged through the snow to Mac's Old Mine which is the local bar and grapped ourselves a whole lot of drinks. A couple too man actually. The next day we walked around for a while admiring the mountians and the old mining setups. The easter brunch at the bar was full of fantastic food which we managed to eat a some of dispite our hang overs. We took a nap and got up walked around some more and ate the left overs at the bar. On monday we slept in and took off back home stopping in Santa Fe to walk around and look in some shops. All in all it was a great trip.

      My insomnia is in full swing I didn't get to slep last night until 5:30 in the morning which I'm sure impacted my physics test today. I'm leaving on saturday with Susan to spend the weekend up in colorodo. It's going to very very nice to be able to get out of town with my girlfriend for a weekend. I just hope I can get all of my homework done before saturday morning since I won't be back until monday afternoon. I'll see If can't get some good updates between now and saturday.

      Another weekend of work. I worked so much I didn't get to finish my homework over the weekend which really suckd i was trying to finish it sunday night after I got off of work but I fell asleep at my books which means that I didn't finish my physics homework that was due today and because I didn't  fall asleep near my alarm I didn't make it to my physics class this morning. In other news happy birthday to adam whose birthday was yesterday.

      Susan and I bought Adam a bottle of Mescal for his birthday on sunday the 4th, so we had a mini party last night that was a hell of a lot of fun. We drank beer and mescal and watched sports night and played some old school kid icarus. So Happy Birthday Adam.

      Sorry about the lack of updates lately. I recently saw Fahrenheit 9/11 and it was a fantastic film. I enjoyed how witty it was and it made lots of good points. I recommend it to anyone. I also recently picked up City of God which is also a fantastic movie about living in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. It has fantastic story and really pretty cinamtograpy. In other news the great web comic  urlLink Goats  is trying to raise money just as  urlLink Something Positive  did a while back. I recommend checking out goats and reading the archives and if you enjoy it donating a dollar or two.

      Pentagon Prepares To Send 15,000 More Troops To Iraq CNN is reporting the Pentagon is preparing to send as many as 15,000 more ground troops to Iraq if violence worsens. This news comes as the death toll from fighting yesterday has risen to over 100. At least 320 people were injured. Members of the Iraqi resistance launched coordinated uprisings in five cities: Baghdad, Mosul, Baquba, Fallujah and Ramadi. The Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for the attacks.

      Here is a quote by Richard Feynman: What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourth year of graduate schooland you think Im going to explain it to you so you can understand it? No, youre not going to be able to understand it. Why, then, am I going to bother you with all this? Why are you going to sit here all this time, when you wont be able to understand what I am going to say? It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you dont understand it. You see, my physics student dont understand it either. That is because I dont understand it. Nobody does.

      So Susan and I borke up last week which is really unfortunate. Sometimes things just don't work out. I hope that we'll remain good friends, but I'm sure that we will never again have a boyfriend/girlfiend relationship. It makes me sad that I will never have that with her again, but I am upbeat and I have decided it was for the best. Now all I have to do is get out there and start meeting new people. I've decided that I need to get more involved with school and get mor involved with the undergraduate physics student association. I also think that I should join some other type of social club. We'll I'll give it some thought and post more about it later.

      ok more stuff:    AFGHANISTAN  DOCTORS FORCED TO THE BORDERS:  They stayed through the Soviet invasion. They lasted through civil war. They even soldiered on through the brutally repressive Taliban regime. But now security problems are so egregious that the Nobel Peace Prize-winning aid group  Doctors Without Borders is pulling out of Afghanistan . The group "denounced the U.S. military's use of aid to persuade Afghans to snitch on insurgents, saying it risked turning all relief workers into targets. It was also dismayed that Taliban rebels tried to claim responsibility for the June 2 attack on its staff." Since March 2003, more than 30 aid workers have been killed in the country, "rendering much of the south and east off-limits." In a public statement, secretary general of the group, Marine Buissonnière, said, "After having worked nearly without interruption alongside the most vulnerable Afghan people since 1980,  it is with outrage and bitterness that we take the decision to abandon them . But we simply cannot sacrifice the security of our volunteers while warring parties seek to target and kill humanitarian workers. Ultimately it is the sick and destitute that suffer."     IRAQ  HALLIBURTON'S FAILURES REWARDED WITH MORE CONTRACTS:  The same day the government revealed Halliburton had lost $18.6 million worth of government property the company "was awarded a contract worth up to  $500 million  to provide private sector construction and related services to the U.S. Navy and other defense department agencies."     IMMIGRATION  CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE REPUBLICAN:  New citizens received a shocking lesson about the right to vote last month. After a naturalization ceremony in Jacksonville, FL, "an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged the them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies." Here's the twist: "Those handing out forms were Republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had  been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the GOP ."

      Ok two more quick things:    ENVIRO  PESTICIDES WITHOUT SUPERVISION:  Under new rules issued by the Bush administration "the Environmental Protection Agency will be  free to approve pesticides without consulting wildlife agencies  to determine if the chemical might harm plants and animals" currently protected by the Endangered Species Act. "The new rule benefits the pesticide industry at the expense of endangered species," said Aaron Colangelo, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. The EPA claimed the old tests were complicated; instead, it's easier to just get rid of them. Easier, maybe, but not better for the environment. The old law, for example, was "successfully used by environmental groups in a recent lawsuit seeking to mitigate the effects of pesticides on salmon in the Pacific Northwest. A federal judge found that the EPA had failed to abide by a requirement that it consult with federal wildlife agencies over the potential harm from pesticides." Now, however, the EPA instead "will conduct its own scientific evaluation."      RIGHT-WING  YOU MUST SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO BUSH-CHENEY:  The Albuquerque Journal reports that New Mexico locals hoping to attend a rally for Vice President Dick Cheney in Rio Rancho were " asked to sign an endorsement form if they couldn't be verified as Bush-Cheney supporters ." The requirement to pledge allegiance to the Bush-Cheney ticket in order to attend the event was confirmed by a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. The endorsement read: ""I, (full name) ... do herby (sic) endorse George W. Bush for reelection of the United States." It later adds that, "In signing the above endorsement you are consenting to use and release of your name by Bush-Cheney as an endorser of President Bush."

Local residents are being  urlLink advised to stay indoors during the convention , the  NY Daily News  dropped an unsubstantiated front-page  urlLink fear-bomb  claiming that "internet-using anarchists" were planning to fool bomb-sniffing dogs into sounding the alarm and a local paper even wrote an  urlLink editorial  equating direct action with terrorism. This is only the latest chapter in a long history of  urlLink fear-mongering by the corporate press  prior to major protests. || urlLink An analysis of the politics of fear     But while many New Yorkers may now fear protesters, more  urlLink hate the Republicans .

Responding to a publicity and solidarity campaign by Indymedia, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus has been  forced to admit  that they were acting under orders from the US Government to carry out an intelligence investigation of   Cyprus Indymedia   and of one of its founding members, Petros Evdokas, in order to assess whether he "constitutes a threat to US interests."   After a series of Government lies and denials about the case collapsed, Members of the Parliament, the ruling Party, and member Parties of the ruling coalition were drawn into the public dialogue and shamed into taking a position on the issue. The Union of Editors - the most influential institution of establishment journalism - issued a rare and scathing critique of the way the affair is being handled demanding an investigation and response from the Government. And now the  Minister of Justice and Public Order  has been shamed into issuing a written statement admitting to the facts, including a directive to the Police in polite words which are equivalent to "get back on the leash", instructing them how to handle issues revolving around the right to free expression.

      Via an  urlLink atricle  on Slashdot, I found the  urlLink OpenEEG  website.  From their site:  The OpenEEG project is about making plans and software for do-it-yourself EEG devices available for free (as in GPL). It is aimed toward amateurs who would like to experiment with EEG. However, if you are a pro in any of the fields of electronics, neurofeedback, software development etc., you are of course welcome to join the mailing-list and share your wisdom.  Right now, this site is mostly about the hardware; schematics, part lists, building instructions etc. However, a few members have developed some useful software which is hosted on their own websites. You can find these through the software pages.  EEG, for those that don't know, stands for electroencephalogram, which is a method for measuring the electrical activity of the brain.  They have plans that may someday make it easy to create your own device that could be used to transmit information directly from your brain to your computer.

      SAN FRANCISCO, Bay Area - Political prisoner  urlLink Sherman Austin , who made headlines last year after being  urlLink targetted as one of the first casualties of the infamous USA PATRIOT Act , was released from prison and left Arizona Monday morning to return to Los Angeles, California. The nightmare doesn't end there for Sherman, though. He will be remanded to the custody of a halfway house where he will serve the remainder of his sentence until August 2004. Starting now and continuing through the next three years, Sherman will be serving an  urlLink additional sentence of federal probation , under which he will not be allowed to use a cell phone, computer or other digital device unless designated by the government. In addition, Sherman has been forbidden any contact with "anarchist groups," who the federal government maintains "advocate violence as a means of disrupting order and achieving social, economic and political change."[  urlLink Read More  ]         urlLink KILL RADIO  in LA aired an interview with Sherman upon his release

       Congress Bars Rep. From Saying 2000 Was Stolen    This news from Capitol Hill, the House has voted to bar any federal official from requesting that the United Nations formally observe the November presidential elections. During the discussion on the vote, the Republican-led House took the unusual move of striking a word from the Congressional Record after Democratic Congress member Corrine Brown said Republicans stole the 2000 election. Brown said to Republicans "I come from Florida, where you and others participated in what I call the United States coup d'etat. We need to make sure it doesn't happen again. Over and over again after the election - when you stole the election - you came back here and said, 'Get over it.' No, we're not going to get over it. And we want verification from the world." After Brown's comment, the presiding officer of the House ruled that Brown's words violated a House rule that members should not accuse other members of committing a crime. The House then voted along party lines to strike the word "stole" from the Congressional Record.

       Bush Cuts $34M from UN Population Fund    On Friday, President Bush announced he would withhold $34 million from the UN Population Fund for a third year in a row. According to the UN, the money could have helped prevent 77,000 infant and child deaths, 800,000 induced abortions and maternal deaths as well as 2 million unwanted pregnancies. Congress member Carolyn Maloney of New York accused Bush of putting politics above the health of women. She said, ''This is simply pandering to the right-wing mullahs of this country.

        AMNESTY CONCERNS:   With this track record, many are wary about the one-month amnesty the  Saudis have extended to terrorists. Bill sponsors said their concerns  about Saudi's commitment to fighting terrorism "were exacerbated  yesterday when a suspected al-Qaeda loyalist, Khalid bin Odeh bin  Mohammed al-Harbi, surrendered to Saudi authorities under the kingdom's  month long amnesty offer to wanted militants and made comments  expressing his relief at being under the control of Saudi authorities."  Said Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-NY): "Time and again, the Saudis have shown  that they are not our allies in the war on terror."

      Lenin Cali Nájera at 23 years of age, national leader of the Pachakutik youth and founding member of Indymedia Guayaquil(Ecuadar) was assassinated on the night of the 29 of June.  Lenin was a young person who showed great promise amist the difficult environment in guayaqil, where the local oligarchy controls politics with blood and fire, not allowing any space for the development of the left. The executions by the death squads and the police are continuous. Indymedia Ecuador shares the deep pain of Lenin's family and friends and will keep vigil over the investigation and punishment of those guilty for this cowardly and vile crime.  .... all the other stuff on the ecuador site at this time are comments, solidarity, grief, poetry, etc. so far there is no additional information has been made available.  i did notice that a reporters without borders person had asked for more information, wondering if he was killed because of his reporting or for his activism -- stating that if he was not killed for his reporting then they would not be able to help him out.

The march came on the seventh anniversary of Chinese retaking control of Hong Kong. Opposition to Beijing has intensified since China ruled earlier this year that Hong Kong would not be given the right to directly choose its next leader. Organizers said the total number of protesters topped 350,000 despite intense heat.

      Allright two quick articles:    IRAQ  NEOCON DARLING A WANTED MAN:  In seven short months, Ahmad Chalabi has gone from being President Bush's special guest at the State of the Union (seated behind First Lady Laura Bush) to having an arrest warrant hanging over his head. An Iraqi judge issued an arrest warrant for the former darling of the Bush administration for counterfeiting Iraqi currency and money laundering. (He also has been under investigation for passing U.S. secrets to Iran.) His nephew,  Salem Chalabi , the chief prosecutor in the case against Saddam Hussein, has also been charged with participation in the June murder of an Iraqi official who had been investigating the Chalabi family and the Iraqi National Congress for illegally seizing hundreds of properties after the U.S.-led invasion last year. The  Los Angeles Times  reports, "Supporters like Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz were not available for comment."     ECONOMY  WAL-MART IS NO BARGAIN:  CBS News reports Americans are paying a stiff price for bargains at the mega corporation  Wal-Mart . According to a recent University of California, Berkeley study, Wal-Mart actually takes a lot more from communities than it gives back  in low prices. "Because of the low wages and because people do not have health insurance through their employer, people rely on public support to make ends meet," says the school's Ken Jacobs. In California, taxpayers pay an estimated $82-million a year to take care of health care, food stamps, and other social services for Wal-Mart employees.

      Allright so this is a long one but very important:    More Work for Less Pay      President Bush's  assault on overtime pay continues . His administration has already issued rules  scheduled to take effect August 23  that will strip overtime pay from an estimated  6 million workers . Yesterday in Ohio, President Bush touted two new proposals which go by the deceptively appealing names "flex time" and "comp time." Bush claims that the proposals are motivated by a concern for working mothers and other members of the work force with demanding schedules. In reality, the proposals would allow businesses to have their employees work more than 40 hours a week without getting paid overtime.        CURRENT LAW ALREADY ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY:  Current law does not prevent an employee and an employer from negotiating a schedule where the employee works, for example, 50 hours one week and 30 hours the next. The employer is simply required to  pay time-and-a-half for the extra 10 hours  in the first week. "Comp time" would allow the employee to "choose" to substitute the extra pay for additional time off. It opens the door for employers to pressure workers to "accept time off instead of overtime pay." Even absent explicit pressure, employers would be free to "channel overtime work to those who were willing to take comp time."  Moreover, "employees would have to take their earned time off when it suits their employer rather than when it suited the employee."        FLEXTIME MEANS NO COMPENSATION AT ALL FOR LONGER HOURS:  Bush's other proposal  "flex time", would allow employers to set work schedules on an 80-hour, two-week period. This is essentially a mechanism for employers to schedule overtime without providing any overtime compensation. Like comp time, it promotes  irregular work weeks  that may reduce workers' income or reduce leisure time.        EMPLOYEES FINANCE INTEREST-FREE LOAN TO EMPLOYER:  Comp time proposals that have been introduced in Congress would permit employers "to deny use of comp time for a year or more." The effect would be that employers would " receive an interest-free loan from their employees , while workers who gave up premium pay would get shortchanged by devalued banked comp time." If some of the banked comp time hours end up unused, "the employees are likely to wind up working longer annual hours than they would have without a comp time program." AFL-CIO President John Sweeney explains, "comp time is 'paid leave' only in the sense that it is  'paid for' by the workers' own lost overtime earning , minus interest.        LESS EXPENSIVE OVERTIME MEANS MORE OVERTIME:  Allowing the substitution of time off for overtime will "lower the marginal cost of scheduling overtime" and "intensif[y] the economic incentives for employers to  lengthen the number of overtime hours scheduled per week ." The result would be longer and more unpredictable work weeks  a development that is anything but "family friendly."        PUBLIC SECTOR IS NOT A GOOD MODEL:  Advocates of comp time note that it has been available for some time within the public sector. But that doesn't mean it is a good idea for the private sector. Specifically, "there is a real danger of losing comp time accruals [in the private sector] in the event of a  business failure ." For example, In 2000  when the economy was still booming  550,000 U.S. businesses closed. Also, "the relative absence of unions in the private sector leaves employees vulnerable to employer abuse." Finally, since private sector employees are not required to provide any paid leave for vacations at all there is nothing than would "prevent an employer from reducing or eliminating the paid leave it provides now and substituting comp time in its place."

      Ok some more articles of intrest:    AIDS  DRUG COMPANIES GOUGE, BUSH STANDS ASIDE:  This week the Bush administration "refused to override patents on the AIDS drug Norvir,  effectively allowing a quintupling of the price to stand despite consumer groups' accusations of price gouging ." After Abbott Laboratories raised the price of the 8-year-old Norvir to $8.57 a day from $1.71 late last year, patient groups and some members of Congress pushed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to take action, arguing it was warranted because Norvir's discovery was partially funded by taxpayer dollars. But the president has accepted more than  $21,000 from Abbott executives , and the Republican National Committee has raked in  more than $440,000  in soft money from the company, and thus the administration refused. A new  survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation  finds that Americans consider HIV/AIDS to be the second most pressing health problem facing the nation behind cancer, and among African-Americans it ranks first. Two thirds of young African-Americans say the US is losing ground in battling the epidemic.     WAR ON TERROR  SAUDIS LAVISH BUSHES WITH JEWELS:  According to Knight Ridder, the  Saudi royal family showered the Bush family  and top Bush officials with "$127,600 in jewelry and other presents" in 2003. Though there remain serious questions about the  Saudi government's financial ties to al Qaeda , the Bush family nonetheless accepted $95,500 worth of diamond-and-sapphire jewelry for first lady Laura Bush, two sets of diamond and white-gold jewelry and an $8,500 mantel clock "elaborately detailed in silver and gold vermeil." At the very same time U.S. law enforcement officials were expressing " deep frustration " with the Saudis' unwillingness to cooperate in the war on terror, White House Chief of Staff Andy Card and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice accepted two ornamental daggers; Secretary of State Colin Powell accepted an ornamental sword; and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accepted a small golden statue. The Saudi royal family's gifts "dwarfed those of other world leaders, according to the tally, and easily eclipsed Abdullah's $55,020 in gifts in 2002."     IRAQ  CHILDREN DETAINED BY CPA:  An investigation by Scotland's Sunday Herald alleges that  coalition forces are holding more than 100 children in jails such as Abu Ghraib across Iraq . "Witnesses claim that the detainees  some as young as 10  are also being subjected to rape and torture." The Herald's investigation is based in part on an internal UNICEF report written in June, which contains "a key section on child protection, headed 'Children in Conflict with the Law or with Coalition Forces,'" The report contains vague details about detention centers set up for children in Baghdad, but UNICEF was denied visits to the centers.  German journalists were the first to pursue that and other reports of child abuse in Iraq , including a claim made by an Iraqi TV reporter of atrocities committed in "Abu Ghraib's children's wing." The UNICEF report outlines the long-term damage such detentions could cause: "The perceived unjust detention of Iraqi males, including youths, for suspected activities against the occupying forces has become one of the leading causes for the mounting frustration among Iraqi youths and the potential for radicalization of this population group."

      Ok some quick articles:    RELIGION  BUSH HAS NO FAITH IN THE LAW:  A  new article  by the Progress Report's Judd Legum takes a look at the gap between the Bush administration's high-minded rhetoric on religious freedom and its noncompliance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, meant to promote religious freedoms around the world. In particular, the State Department has disregarded "the recommendation of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom -- an independent body created by the IRFA  -- to list Saudi Arabia as a country of 'particular concern for religious freedom .'The State Department also turned a blind eye to its own findings on Pakistan, Eritrea and Turkmenistan and failed to list them as countries of 'particular concern.'" Legum concludes: "For all the White House's talk about religious freedom and its open appeal to religious constituencies in the election campaign, Bush's record in this area is stunning for its lack of interest, consistency and results."           THE ARMY'S 300-PAGE WHITEWASH:  The most disgraceful attempt to date to deflect blame was a 300-page "investigation" released in July by the Army's inspector general. Astoundingly, the report found no "systemic" problems with the treatment of detainees by the military. The inspector general reached that conclusion "even though there were  94 documented cases of prisoner abuse ...even though only four prisons of the 16 they visited had copies of the Geneva Conventions...even though the military police were improperly involved in interrogations; even though young people plucked from civilian life were sent to guard prisoners...with no training." The so-called investigation "did not dig into the abuse cases, but merely listed them." The report also "made no attempt to find out who had authorized threatening prisoners with dogs and sexually humiliating hooded men." The inspector general was satisfied with merely reviewing the official Army field manual and noting those techniques in the manual.         WITHHOLDING RED CROSS REPORTS FROM SENATE INVESTIGATORS:  For months, the Pentagon  refused to share Red Cross reports  documenting the conditions in American military prisons. In July, they finally agreed to show the reports "briefly to senators and a few members of the Armed Services Committee staff after the senators' personal aides were ushered out." The reports were then brought back to the Pentagon.

      Ok here are two quick things:     HEALTH CARE  COLLAPSING COVERAGE:  USA Today reports, "The percentage of people who get health insurance through employers fell sharply from 2001 to 2003,  resulting in 9 million fewer people with employer coverage  after accounting for population growth, researchers said Tuesday." Unemployment and skyrocketing insurance costs were to blame: "Job losses caused by the sluggish economy were the main reason for the drop in people covered by employer health plans. But insurance premiums that increased 28 percent during the period also contributed to the decline, as some employers stopped offering coverage, while at some firms workers decided not to enroll because their share of the cost rose." And that means more Americans in government-sponsored programs or without insurance altogether.        DEFICIT  DEBT SOARING TO NEW HEIGHTS:  With the Bush administration forecasting a  record $639 billion budget deficit  in 2003-04, BBC reports, "US Treasury Secretary John Snow has urged Congress to  raise the government's debt ceiling , or face a cash crunch in the autumn. He warned that Washington was on track to breach the current limit of $7.4 trillion in late September." The U.S. national debt - the sum of previous annual budget deficits - currently stands at nearly $7.3 trillion and the ceiling has already been raised twice since Bush took office in 2000. The administration likes to blame the fight against terrorism and the war in Iraq for the deficits, but the Boston Globe points out $290 billion of the current deficit is directly attributable to the Bush tax cuts. "Just 3 1/2 years ago, the Office of Management and Budget was  projecting a surplus of $387 billion for the 2004 fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30."

        Wells Fargo Grilled Over Environmental Policies  	     	 As part of its " urlLink BBQ The Banks "  national campaign, the San Francisco-based   urlLink Rainforest Action Network  held a barbecue at  the headquarters of Wells Fargo to protest the bank's lack of environmentally-responsible  investment policies. While  other banks, such as the enormous Citibank and Bank of America have adopted  policies regarding the funding of environmentally destructive practices, Wells  Fargo has yet to adopt any such policy. Tofu pups and veggie  burgers abounded during the lunchtime rally downtown.   urlLink Read more  | Photos:  urlLink 1  |  urlLink 2  |  urlLink 3  |  urlLink 4
