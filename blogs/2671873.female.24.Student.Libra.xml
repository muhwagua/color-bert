      Why are goodbyes so stinkin' hard?!?!  It's like losing a part of yourself into an abyss of nothing, uncertainty, and sadness.  Starting from scratch but not willing or wanting to fill the void of one friendship with another.  What can you do to control the sadness that occurs when you walk by that friends house?  How do you react when you go to ring them and you realize they won't answer?  Is it possible to cope when you have something funny happen to you and they aren't there to share the moment with you?  What can you do to move on when you are used to spending every waking (and some sleeping) moment with one another?  Once you find a friend that compliments you so well how do you move on?    Making and maintaining friends is a process that should be a familiar one to me. Since I have lived in 5 cities, 2 countries, and traveled most of the EU all since I was 18.  But, each time I say goodbye to these friends it seems all that much more difficult.  Yes, I can get through almost any situation, be it a travel mishap or a housemate issue, but this friendship thing is a killer.    In an ideal world I would be able to have all my friends, that I have acquired over time, live in one place where we could always see each other and utilize our friendships as need be.  There would be no more goodbyes, no more tears, and no more contemplating when and how you will see one another again.  Moving away is like dying...somehow a part of you is missing, maybe not permanently but the sense of loss is always there.

      Is it inherent that all 18 year old boys have no respect for others, not even themselves?!  I feel like Wendy in Peter Pan, being a mother to the 'lost boys'.  Here I am in Ireland and somehow have found myself living with 3 18 year-old boys.  And then there is me the 24 year old den mother.  Dear lord in heaven.  I only express my exasperation because this past Friday these wonderful boys decided to have a party.  I did not know about it, and when I came home the following day at 1:30 I found that all our fire alarms had been broken (ya know those little red ones just like the ones in hotels) and a sweatshirt I had all packaged up to post to Seattle had been stolen.  I found the packaging and letter outside.  When I expressed my absolute disgust in the situation the boys replied with a shrug and continued to state that they had no control of the party and they didn't know  there was a sweatshirt in the package.  No apology, no offer to buy a new sweatshirt, more or less a cop out of the choices they have made.  Then yesterday one of the boys had the audacity to ask me for money for an air freshener he bought for the sitting room they get high in every night of the week.  Blech!  I wish there was a remedy to this situation, but I will just have to hold on for 4 months till school is over.  Then I can live in an environment that is conducive to my living habits.

      I am in Dublin now and was approached by an old woman who had a nose the size of Alabama an hair the color of New Mexico mud.  Her name is Maria she likes the drink and the poor woman's brother died today....but as she was telling my friends and I this she continued to tell us other random facts of her family and life (in 6 weeks she has lost 4 brothers and a husband) and in her 70 years I am sure has seen a lot. Yes to most this should be tragic however for my friend (we'll call her Sarah) she found utter humor in this.  And as Maria continued to tell our wee group of college age girls the sorrows of her life Sarah's eyes well up with tears....are these tears of sorrow....oh wait no....tears of huge laughter.  I know as you read this you find no humor....however if you have ever met an old random irish person in a pub you understand the humor.  Thank God  I made it out alive.  Lets just hope I make it through the day tomorrow as I meet with the South Africa ambassador and other important peeps.  And as we go out for a night on the town (May I win the lottery to pay for it) I pray I meet no more characters like Maria....I've had enough for one weekend.

      That's what it is folks.  I am just after finishing exams (thank god!!) and now have a week off to ponder the workings of this world.  Or maybe just go to Dublin and meet some Peace and Conflict folks, then ponder the workings of the world.  Then that is it....second semester begins and my life officially ends.  However, I must say that I would rather be totally slammed for time rather than chill in my house playing mother to my 18 year old male house mates.  I guess I should take this time and savor it.  Forget the stress of the world and just enjoy the beauty that is here in this country, allow the waves of life to take me where they may.

      Living in a foreign country can force one to think an awful lot. Even when its against their will.  However, I have come to realize that it is through this thought that I have grown, matured, lived.  As I was in bed unable to sleep last night I began to think of this world we live in and all its complexities.  Here I am in the North West part of Ireland (known to many as Northern Ireland) studying Peace and Conflict, yet I have discovered the essence of what I study is right before me (not in the form of a national problem, rather one that is intrapersonal)  The peace and the conflict.  Is it possible to help others deal and solve their conflict when you aren't able to solve your own?  I'm not sure.  Can you strive for world peace when there isn't even life peace in your life?  Still unknown.  But what I do know is that I want to make a difference in lives, and recently have discovered that maybe I need to start with my own...rather than looking from the outside in.  It could be best summed up by an illustration of my Professor, Dr. Paul Arthur, you need to get off the dance floor and into the balcony.  Only then can you truly make a difference to your life and others.

      Well here it is 26 February 2004, and there is about 3 inches of snow outside.  I feel like I have been transported to Montana.  Its so odd, because the daffodils are peaking through the snow and you can tell Mother Nature did not expect this sudden surprise.  However, I must admit it has been fun to throw a snow ball or two and walk outside and feel the crunch of the snow beneath my feet (ok so its not snow...its slush).  I wish I had a digital camera so I could show all of you this amazing view and snow covered hills.  I don't think I have really seen anything like it.  Snow covered mountains, yes....snow covered hills in Ireland NO.  So today I am grateful for God for giving me one more reason to love this country even more.  There is something to be said for sunshine and snow all in the same day.  I guess it just shows that God is good....All the time.  Hopefully I will have a picture to share.

      So lately I have been thinking and I am really really interested in this.  I would like to start a business here in Ireland.  Yes, I know I am insane...but here is my idea.  In the past year I have been making Chocolate Chip Cookies, and other random desserts.  And have received high praises from my Irish friends.  So I have been thinking that maybe a "Clementine's Cookies" shop would sell over here.  Kinda like the whole Mrs. Fields idea in the states.  It is impossible to get fresh baked cookies here in this part of the world, and most people don't even know a recipe to make fresh cookies here.  So that is where I would come in....not only would it be a cookie shop, but it would also be a place where people could order those ever creative cookie bouquets.  I SERIOUSLY want to do this, but don't have a clue where to start, and how to do it being American.  (why couldn't I be an EU citizen?!) What do you think?  Again I would love my friends input.  I know this is out of the blue, but I have really been thinking about this...and would like to see this become a reality.  I think there is genuinely a market for it here.  Maybe not in Derry, but definitely in Galway.  I look forward to hearing your comments!

      I have decided that thinking is a health hazard.  Lately I have had so much running through my mind, and as my thoughts continue my health seems to be getting worse.  Actually I think its the change in the weather, but I like to blame it on all the hard work I am doing here. (or lack there of) This term has been absolutely crazy, and as I look at all the work I have done I realize I have done nothing of great importance.  I have read a couple articles describing the Peace Making failures in recent times, and I have come to question the importance of a democratic government, or at least a democratic super power.  So I guess one would say that my course is going well...making me question what is so natural for me to assume is right.  Now its time to get that ever dreaded dissertation started.  But that leads to another question...where do you start.  I don't really have a specific peace related subject to start with.  I was thinking about doing something on Latin America and justice, but as I said earlier...where to start.  If any of you have suggestions please please please let me know.  I am at such a loss.  But I have nearly 11 months to figure it out, so its not all that bad.  My biggest concern now is what to do with my life when May approaches.  Where do I move and what field of Peace and Conflict to I want to enter into.  And how do I apply and get a job when I am living in Ireland?  I know it will all fall into place when it needs to, but I have this ever large debt to the American government for my education and don't know where to start to pay it back.  Blech. Maybe I should fake my death then I would be able to have my loans forgiven and start debt free.  OOOOOh, there is a good plan.  hehehe.  Well this is my mindless and bizarre ramblings for this week. Sorry to subject you all to the randomness that is my mind.  :)

      I have come to notice that relationships here in the Emerald Isle are quite strange....pretty much a boy and girl meet the boy and girl kiss and then this goes on for a while until one day they are eventually boyfriend and girlfriend.  Very odd if you ask me.  I like the traditional dinner and a movie I think.  However I have also noticed there is a casual nature in kissing here.  It is not uncommon for a boy/girl to kiss more than one person in a night....and it isn't uncommon for those that they kiss to be friends and think nothing of it.  Quite odd.  Just a random observation I thought I would share.

      I recieved this recently, and found it quite thought provoking.  It's quite long....but worth the read and laugh.  Oh the logics of American Politics...  Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq? A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction honey Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction A: That's because they Iraqis were hiding them. Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq? A: Yup. Invasions always work better than inspections Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons of mass destruction, did we? A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden.  Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election. Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass destruction? A: To use them in a war, silly. Q: I'm confused.  If thy had all those weapons that they planned to use in war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we went to war with them? A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had those weapons, so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves. Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy.  Why would they choose to die if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with? A: It's a different culture.  It's not supposed to make sense. Q: I don't know about you, bit I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did. A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons.  We had another good reason to invade them anyway. Q: And what was that? A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country. Q: Why?  What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country? A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people. Q: Kind of like what they do in China? A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq.  China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make US corporations richer. Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people? A: Right Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured? A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing their government.  People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured. Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China? A: I told you, China is different Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq? A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by Ba'ath party, while China is Communist Q: Didn't you one tell me Communists were bad? A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad. Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad? A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured. Q: Like Iraq? A: Exactly. Q: And like in China, too? A: I told you, China’s a good economic competitor.  Cuba, on the other hand is not. Q: How come Cuba isn’t a good economic competitor? A: Well, you see, back in the 1960’s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us. Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba and started doing business with them, wouldn’t that help the Cubans become Capitalists? A: Don’t be a smart-ass Q: I didn’t think I was being one. A: Well, anyway, they also don’t have freedom of religion in Cuba Q: Kind of like China and the Falun Gong movement? A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway, Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he’s not really a legitimate leader anyway. Q: What’s a military coup? A: That’s when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States Q: Didn’t the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup? A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend. Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate? A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate. Q: Didn’t you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader? A: Only Saddam Hussein.  Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan. Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan? A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th. Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th? A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked our four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings, killing over 3,000 Americans. Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that? A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban. Q: Aren’t the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people’s heads and hands? A: Yes, that is exactly who they were.  Not only did they chop off people’s heads and hands, but they oppressed women too. Q: Didn’t the Bush administration give the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001? A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs. Q: Fighting drugs? A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies. Q: How did they do such a good job? A: Simple.  If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off. Q: So when the Taliban but off people’s heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK. But, not if they cut people’s heads and hands off for other reasons? A: Yes. It’s OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people’s hand for growing flowers, but it’s cruel if they cut of people’s hands for stealing bread. Q: Don’t they also cut off people’s hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?  A: That’s different.  Afghanistan was ruled by tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burquas whenever they were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply. Q: Don’t Saudi women have to wear burqas in public, too? A: No, Saudi women merely wear a tradition Islamic body covering Q: What’s the difference? A: The traditional Islamic covering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman’s body except for her eyes and fingers.  The burqa on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman’s body except for her eyes and fingers. Q: Is sounds like the same thing with a different name. A: Now, don’t go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.  The Saudis are our friends. Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.  A: Yes but they trained in Afghanistan Q: Who trained them? A: A very bad man, Osama bin Laden. Q: Was he from Afghanistan? A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too.  But he was a bad man, a very bad man. Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once. A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980’s. Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire Ronald Regan talked about? A: There are no more Soviets.  The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or thereabouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us.  We call them Russians now. Q: So the Soviets…I mean Russians are our friends? A: Well, not really.  You see they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, but then they decided no to support our invasion of Iraq, so we’re mad at them now.  We’re also mad at the French and Germans because they didn’t help us invade Iraq either. Q: So the French and Germans are evil too? A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom fries and Freedom toast. Q: Do we always rename food whenever another country doesn’t do what we want them to do? A: No, we just do that to our friends.  Our enemies, we invade. Q: But wasn’t Iraq one of our friends back in the 1980’s? A: Well, yeah.  For a while. Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then? A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily. Q: Why did that make him our friend? A: Because at the time, Iran was our enemy. Q: Isn’t that when he gassed the Kurds? A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him that we were his friend. Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend? A: Most of the time, yes. Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy? A: Sometimes that’s true too.  However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all the better. Q: Why? A: Because was is good for the economy, which means war is good for America.  Also, since God is on America’s side, anyone who opposes war is a godless un-American Communist.  Do you understand why we attacked Iraq? Q: I think so.  We attacked them because God wanted us to, right? A: Yes. Q: But how did we know God wonted us to attack Iraq? A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do. Q: So basically, what you’re saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush heard voices in his head? A: Yes! You finally understand how the world works.  Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep.  Good Night. Good night Daddy!

      Lately I have been talking to a few friends near and far and it has occurred to me that this twenty something time of life is hell.  We all reach this point in our lives where we must make the choice to follow those dreams we have set since the age of 5, or do what seems practical and make a living to support a family...blah blah blah.  We all have some sort of outline in our heads as to what we expect our life to be.  But recently I realized that maybe what I always dreamed of as perfect and wonderful isn't really what will make me happy.  Like most girls I have thought about the house I will live in when I am older and have a family, and the car I will drive when I haul that family around, and even the type of dress I want to wear at my wedding (seeing that there is a wedding in the future).  But as I think of this perfect life I have created within my imagination, I recently realized it lacked something....substance.  Not that all families that seem perfect are shallow, but there is something more there that I know I don't see, something that I know creates substance.  Having the Cooper Mini, and living in a 4 bedroom house on a hill overlooking a body of water no longer appeals to me.  Somewhere between graduating high school, and traveling the world I have discovered that I am no longer fearful of success (or lack there of).  I no longer need to worry about getting an education to cover my immense debt I have acquired over the years.  Rather I need to focus on being happy, and loving what I am doing and where I am.  If I am alone doing this, so be it.  However I never want to be so far away I can't see my family and friends, because that is what makes me happy as well.  I no longer want to look for that special someone who has the right job or the right car, rather I want to find someone who has the right happiness.  Is this possible, or am I just living in this delusion I call life.  Possibly it is this simple form of thinking that will allow me prosper in life, perhaps it will set me up for doom....either way it will be an adventure no matter the course I take.  I know this is the thought process of every twenty something, as I have had many talks with those twenty somethings in my life.  But I feel that this confusing part of my life is only the beginning of an adventure that will take me to far away places to see far away things.  If this is the adventure I get to take then I am willing and ready to take it!  My only question is are you?

      Yes folks I did it.  I am half way to my full marathon.  I completed the Omagh (pronounced O-MAH) 1/2 marathon yesterday in 2.09 hours.  It was fulfilling and fun.  I am a bit sore today but nothing too bad.  I am ready to keep increasing my distance and tackle that ever dreaded 26.2 miles.  So come 3rd May I will be off on the streets of Belfast to claim ultimate victory!

      Well I think I have officially gone the longest ever in my lifetime without checking my email.  I was in Belgium this past week and had  no time or way of checking my email.  Quite an experience, when as an American I check my email 100 times a day.  So here I am back on the Blog.  The time abroad was interesting to say the least.  I almost missed the bus, due to trying to get an hour of sleep before we left at 4am.  Then I had a little falling out with some of the girls in my class....well I should clarify....there was no falling out just a feeling of complete exile.  Mix that with a visit to WWI war memorials and grave sites, and a concentration camp visit and it provides a very emotionally stimulating week (or not).  Not to mention all that was mixed with Paddy's day and 8.5-11% alcohol level beer.  I didn't partake in the libations really for fear that I may emotionally lose it and if that were to happen no one around me would be there for the support I needed.  Now I am back in Derry (Praise God).  And I am working like none other to get my work done before Easter break and my family's visit mid April!  Other than that, no profound thoughts or perils of wisdom.  That will have to come after I write a shit-load of papers.

      So I just got a call from Booty call boy and he was SUPER apologetic!  He should be.  Actually he was real embarrassed!  Serves him right...waking me in the middle of the night!  hehehe.  I am mean.  Glad to know that in his non inebriated state he can think clearly and is aware of his actions.  I am such a star!

      So I have been flat out lately.  I went to Dublin for a basket ball tournament...more like a drinking marathon...and we got slaughtered by Trinity, however we had fun and some how in the last 2 minutes managed to play on the court with 6 players and didn't get called.  I like basket ball a lot more here....its less serious than in the states.  Our men's team won the plate (of the losers bracket) but that is great since Magee never wins ANYTHING!!! Now I am back for 5 days and will work 3 of them, have to write a paper, train for my marathon, and get ready to leave for Belgium on Saturday at 4am.    I will be in Belgium for a week hob nobbing with the likes of EU politicians and visiting NATO, not to mention visiting a concentration camp and other historical areas.  Speaking of hob nobbing...I was able to meet the Prime Minister of Ireland (and the current EU president), Bertie Ahern and Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume last week when Mr. Ahern came and talked to the college about Peace within the EU.  So life has been full to say the least.  Now on to my real tangent.  I went out last night (it was the international students night in the union) and then after the union closed went home and got ready for bed....now by the time I finally get into my bed its 2am and suddenly the phone rings.  Its this boy who I haven't seen or talked to in weeks...I kissed him once but that was months ago.  So I get this call from this boy and he asks what I am up to and if I want to meet up later....WHAT....I AM IN BED.....NO I DON'T WANT TO MEET UP!!!!  So I just go back to sleep after telling him I am home in my bed.  Then this morning I wake up to 3 text messages, and a missed call!  Sheesh talk about a hard core booty call....what is with this people.  Boys...don't you understand?!?!?  You can't call a girl randomly after not talking for weeks and expect that she will jump at the chance to hook up with you!  It just doesn't work that way! And if it does for some girls they should be shot....Late night random booty calls are ok....but not when they are out of the blue.  Sheesh....  Ok. Tangent over.  Discuss.

      Yes last night was an amazing highlight of my life.  I went to a dance club with my friends and at the door the bouncer asked me if I had ID.  Luckily I brought it with me (so weird because I never bring ID with me...I'm 24 for crying out loud).  I chuckled and laughed at the bouncer telling him I was 24 and he didn't believe me.  So out came the good ol' Montana drivers license stating that I indeed was born in the late 70's.  Then he told me I looked like I was 18.  So funny!  I wouldn't have been so pleased but the drinking age is 18 here and I got carded.  Its like being 30 in the states and getting carded.  So that is the latest breakthrough in my life...I look 18!  (Addy that means I could pass as your LITTLE sister).  Tomorrow I am off to Dublin to play in a Basketball Tournament.  Wait...Stop laughing!  I'm serious.  Yes I know I should bring a video camera and tape the whole thing, because it will be well entertaining!  Then in a weeks time I am off to Belgium to visit EU parliament and NATO.  It should be a good time, being in Belgium with the Irish folk over St. Paddy's day...ahhh resting in the home of good Stella Artois with the Irish...life couldn't be any better!

      So here I am 24 years of age, and since the dawn of time have not been able to maintain any sort of relationship (family and friends don't count) longer than 3 months.  It really is quite odd.  This all started my senior year of high school and has continued on now into my twenty-something life.  Most people by this time have had at least one if not many long-term relationships. In my time here I have had 2 relationships each of which lasted 3 months.  In California it was the same...only 3 months.  So what is this you ask?  Is this a case of Julia Roberts syndrome?  Ya know, after 3 months commitment seems impossible.  Well a few years ago I would have said yes. But as time is progressing and I find myself getting older I am realizing that a solid relationship, although not necessary, would be a nice touch in my life.  I had a conversation with a friend recently who told me the day I rang him to tell him I was in a serious relationship would be the day he would have a heart attack and perhaps even die.  This didn't upset me, because he's been saying this since we were 13, but it did get me thinking.  And thinking is all I have done since.  Perhaps it isn't me at all who is the one phobic of commitment but instead the roll is reversed.  It could also be that in the last 4 years I haven't lived in one place longer than a year without getting up and moving out.  So that could be part of it.  No matter what the reason, its quite wired.  The day this 3 month curse expires will be a happy day.  But until then it is back to life as usual.  Keeping busy and making and maintaining friendships.  Its a good thing I am content being single.  :)  Well there is my random venting.    2 weeks and counting till the marathon.  Dear Lord!  I am nervous already.  Pray for good weather (no rain) it will make the run much more enjoyable.    Well this is me signing off!  Thanks for reading!

      So there it is folks the last international student has left the building.  Wow!  What an emotional rollercoster.  However I must say that I have met some amazing folks here this semester and I feel blessed.  As the summer progresses I can see my life blooming like the spring flowers outside.  Yet this season has terminated and I must make room for the new seasons flowers to bloom.  A hard step, but one that must occur inevitably.  Its now time for me to pack my bags and move house.  Its time to smile at the world around me, and pave the future.  An exciting yet nerve wracking step.

      Its odd how in just one week your entire perspective of life can change.  In this week I have had to say good-bye to many of my friends here in Derry who originally lived in other EU countries.  That has been hard, and harder yet is knowing that throughout the summer I am not going to be able to just randomly visit duncreggan (the student village) and see all my friends, as none of them will be there.    I am also questioning my life's ambitions.  Do I really want to start Clementine's Cookies and live here for many years.  Do I want to take that risk?  Will I be able to make an income to pay off my student loans?  And do I really want to stay here as I once thought I did?  None of these have answers and I haven't worried about these questions until today when I had time to let my mind wander and time to just think.  Its hard.  Since returning from Montana I am really questioning my place in the world.  What do I want to do with my life?  And if I can answer that question, how am I going to get there?    Being 20-something suck I have decided.  I lack direction and need guidance yet it seems everyone I know who has encountered such difficulties feels the same and has no recommendations on how to pass these years with out going through a quarter life crisis.  I know these are some of the best years of my life, but the quarter life crisis has kicked in full gear!  Booo!!!

      Well I am back in Derry...whew that was a quick trip.  I flew home to Montana on Thursday and then after 30+ hours of being awake yesterday finally got back to my house here.    Montana was brilliant, I had a great time, beautiful wedding, good friends, and no sleep.  I wish I had more time there but none the less I had a good time.  I am looking forward to September when I have more time to chill and relax.  And hopefully by that time it won't be snowing.  Yes folks you heard me correctly.  It was snowing back in Montana.  Yes its May, and yes there was snow.  Oh well.  I hadn't seen snow for a while and really had miss seeing snow in the Mountains.  I guess you just have to be careful at what you wish for...it may just come true 5 months later.    Now I am in Derry and have to look for jobs in the next few days.  ICK!  I need a job that is flexable and one that pays enough for me to pay my rent each month.  :)  Well these are the ramblings of Clementine....Enjoy!

      I wonder sometimes what goes through peoples heads when they make plans with you and then simotaniously make plans with someone else, and then forfeits their plans with you.  Or why when you ask someone to ring you if they are going out or have a party they don't and ask why you weren't there.  Is this common, or is it just a simple way of being self absorbed.  Either way it drives me crazy.  Oh well.  I am off to Montana on Thrusday and can't wait!  Get to catch up with some old friends and get away from some of the silly shit going on here in Ireland.  Although short and sweet it will be loads of fun!

      So I received a message recently from a friends mom.  My friend Lora died nearly 5 years ago, and still there isn't a day I don't think of her.  Its weird every time I sing, I think that she is there with the harmony (we sang together on worship team in high school) every time I play volleyball I know that she is there coaching me on the side.  Every time I say something silly she is there laughing with me or at me more likely.  And every time I am sad I know that she is there saying that everything will be ok.  Yes after 5 years things have gotten better, but after 5 years her memory is just as vivid now as it was when we finished high school.  I still wish I was able to talk to her before God took her home, but I will have to wait until my day comes to meet her in Heaven.  Until then only pictures and memories will have to keep her alive in this world.  She was an amazing girl, one I will always admire, and one I always was jealous of.  She seemed perfect, and everyone who met her loved her.  I know now, after 5 years, that the jealousy was foolish, but the admiration was sweet, and beautiful.  I only can pray that after this time Lora still looks down, smiles, laughs and cries when I want her here.  I pray that in these 5 years while we haven't forgotten her here she hasn't forgotten us there.  Lora Beth, you are a star!  And you have touched so much of the world....still your dream is being lived by all of us who knew you!  Lora made all of us want to be better people, and for that I am grateful!  This is a little tribute her mom has created in Columbus OH, its a huge billboard on the side of the highway.  For those of you not privvy...Lora was killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel, when driving from the movies with her friends.      urlLink

      Just found out the dollar is getting stronger....no more of that $1.90 to every £1. Now according to XE.com it is $1.75 to every £1.00.  YAY!!!  That means I can begin to pay off my tuition again.  Whew, I was afraid that I wasn't going to graduate due to lack of money and paying my fees.  Lets just pray it keeps going down (to the traditional $1.50)  That would be nice, real nice!

      As my year of study is coming to a close I can't help but want to write ramblings about nothing.  This is because I have been reading and writing about a subject all to heavy to do in one go (Child Combatants and Trauma all in the setting of war) Whew!  Talk about an easy read...or not.  But I must admit I am excited to get started on my dissertation and begin another chapter in my life.  This time it will be a chapter of risks and chance.  I have committed to myself that Clementine's Cookies is going to become a reality.  I have started preparing my business plan, and have been doing my research.  Although that is on hold for the moment.  Its quite crazy, I think about doing this and just think "wow this could be real big" but then I wonder if I am just a silly dreamer who thinks this could be a viable option here in the North.  I guess only time and money will tell, as I can't start the business without the monetary funding.  But by this time next year I hope to have the cookie shop open both here in the North and online.  So we'll see what I can do in the next few months I have here.  It is going to be a busy summer.  On another note, I am off to H-town next week.  Can't wait.  It will be good to see family and friends and see one of my best guy friends in the world get married.  Geez, we are all growing up so fast. I can't believe we have known each other for 13 years nearly 14.  If someone would have asked me the first day of 6th grade if I would maintain friendships to this extent in my home room class I would have thought they were crazy, but alas I am not only good friends but SUPER close and have been through a lot with Jim.  It makes my heart smile to see him getting married and adding a new chapter onto his life.  Well procrastination must end.

      Well folks.  It is done in the words of Caesar: veni, vidi, vici.  Yes folks.  I came, I saw and I conquered!  I put that marathon to shame!  I ran nearly to the point of tears and I pushed on.  That 18th mile couldn't force me to quit.  I just saw the finish line just a few miles a head.  Even though the knees were about to give out and my lower back felt as though I broke my tail bone, I ran my way to the finish line.  So in the time of 5:24 I finished my first marathon.  Perhaps the first of many, but definitely an accomplishment for the first quarter of my life.  Maybe I'll have to train for Dublin in October?  We'll see...but for now its recovery time for me.

      Ok so life is pretty boring....or should I say non eventful.  I moved house!  PRAISE GOD! Now I live with my friend Francie, his girlfriend Paula and another friend Grace in a beautiful new house.  I am working a shitty bar job that pays shitty and has messed up my sleeping habits but its money.  I think I am going to look for a part time day job so I can reduce my hours at the Strand Bar.  I have met a few randoms working at the bar but that always seems to happen.  Other than that I'm just hanging out for the summer then only God knows what's in store.  I am anxious to find out.  For those of you who read this shoot me an email or something.  I am getting home/friend sick.  And want updates.

      Well I started my joby job and it seems good.  Late nights but what can ya do huh?  I may have to find another job that is during day hours so I can make more money.  I guess the less I go out the more money I save huh?  I am absolutely shattered today.  I was out last night with some interns from Church, and then worked Friday and Saturday nights...meaning very little sleep for poor Clementine.    I finally am moving out of my house on Friday! WAHOO!!!  I can't wait, I get to live in a tidy house with people I am friends with.  No more listening to folks vomit in sinks next door...no more parties till 6am when I am trying to sleep, and no more disrespectful teenage boys.  I couldn't be more excited.    Unfortunately life isn't all that exciting.  No fun travels or anything else.  I just don't have the funds.  I did however get a new digital camera when I was home so I will try to post more pics when I  have a bit more time.

      I have a job for the summer and it took no effort on my part AT ALL!  Well maybe a wee bit but that is it.  I walked into a pub I was told was hiring and asked if they had open positions.  I told the manager that I had a bit of experience and was asked to sit down and wait for an on the spot interview.  Sheesh talk about easy.  And the best part is that I start Friday night!  She said that these next couple weeks I would only be working a few nights but as my time there increased and I provided good customer service I would get more hours and hours I wanted.  WAHOO!!!  Needless to say I am a happy camper.  I will be working full time this summer to help make some money for next year.  And because I will be working weekends and night mostly I will have less time to go out and spend all my money.  So it wall works out well.

      So my sister has a blog ( urlLink http://hmmthatsinteresting.blogspot.com &nbsp;) and &nbsp; I have been too lazy to put a link to it however, her blog about Helena not being home made me think.&nbsp; It all started with the comment I left her:    Sister of mine, you have moved into the world of social behaviour! I am so proud of you! j/k. Glad to see you are following the natural progression of growing up...Helena isn't home, its where you grew up, where your memories are. It isn't even comfortable, its soothing... knowing that it will always be there even if you move. So keep growing exploring and plant seed everywhere...someday they'll grow into roots and you'll stay planted. &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp; It got me thinking.&nbsp; How did I grow out of Helena, or better yet, did I grow out of Helena?&nbsp; Maybe it was Helena that grew up and not me...but due to observation I doubt that.&nbsp; My dad once said something to me and I think for many it holds true "Helena sucks so bad, it will suck you right back." Fortunately for me I have never been back for over 3 months at a go, but that doesn't mean that I don't miss it.&nbsp; Living 3000 miles away has made me remember what&nbsp;I do love about MT, and why I love going back.&nbsp; Moutains, snow, forrests, fresh air, sun, beautiful sunsets.&nbsp; All of those things are memories I have, with each word I can think of a happy memory, and that is why its good to go back to Helena.&nbsp; What kid from Helena hasn't experienced the Parrot, or the Ox?&nbsp; You say those words and any true Helenan has some memory if not many memories of that place.&nbsp; It great.&nbsp;  &nbsp;But now I think and reflect to my current life, my home since I was 18 has been Seattle, Galway Ireland, San Diego, Derry Ireland, and I am sure there may be a few more before my roots grow and keep me stationary.&nbsp; I am not anticipating where that will be, I know God has plans and its my job to follow, and that is just what I have been doing.&nbsp; But the one constant that remains is Helena and my friends and family.&nbsp; The one thing I long for most (well 2 things) are friends/family and Montana.&nbsp; Its in my heart and in my soul.&nbsp; It has made me the person I am today and for that I am thankful, but its now my time to venture out into this wild world and create a home for my children to be that will someday be there place of soothing, and serenity.&nbsp; Until then, I hope my adventures continue to occur.

      So today I just found out I don't get my deposit from the house I rented this year, because the boys I lived with destroyed it before the moved out.&nbsp; The fire place in the sitting room was torn from the wall, and the fire extinguishers were all emptied, and they stole the kitchen table.&nbsp; On top of that there is an outstanding electric bill that I refuse to pay.&nbsp; I am exasperated to say the least, and that mixed with home sickness just makes me want to jump on a plane tomorrow and go home.&nbsp; I know in Helena I would have a job that would allow me to save my money, and here I am always broke.&nbsp; I am supposed to go to Galway next weekend, but have no clue how I will ever get the money for it since my hours have been reduced at the bar.&nbsp; I know I am wining but I can't help it, I am so frustrated.&nbsp; Just when things start to look good some big dark cloud comes and makes them seem so impossible.&nbsp; I know money isn't everything, and that I have never been let down, but things just seem so hard right now.&nbsp; I will quit sulking now.  Oh yeah...Anthony who are you? Do I know you?

      I know that doesn't sound like me, but I am in a hurry.  I am doing a Vacation Bible school type thing here in Derry this week and its tons of fun.  Nevermind the cold I am getting and the working insane hours at the bar as well, but whatever that is all fluff.  :)  So my life this week has been endless and alas I have to leave again to make it up to our teen program tonight.  I am still looking forward to going home, but the more I am here the more this town has grown on me.  Oh yeah the 12th went well, well all except some silly fight in Belfast, but I guess that is what happens when you combine drink and pig headed folks who can't compromise.  WAHOO for stubborn drunk jackasses!  Or not.  Well that's me signing off.    Peace!

      Since someone who won't tell me their true identity has commented on my lack of updates, I feel as though I should write a bit more.  I am still working TOO much, and this week am doing a Kids Week with my church here in Derry.  It should be a fun sleep deprived week, geez, I forgot what sleep deprivation truely was.  WAHOO!  Well I am at just the begining, and I have a feeling that come next week I am just gonna crash.    I wish I had some juicy gossip to share about my life but I don't.  I highlighted my hair so now I have light brown hair (not dark brown)  I still have no prospects on the guy thing...but that is over rated.    And now I am just counting down the weeks until I get to come home and relax for a month.  (only 6 weeks and counting).  So that is my uneventful life.  The 12th of July parades are tomorrow ( SCARY!!! ) but oh well...I am not involved, I just hope they go on without a hitch.  Oh yeah the Ulster Final is today, but no news on the results.

      Hey All!  I am sure I have lost some viewers along the way since my posts are now few and far between.  I have been sooo busy with work and catching up on sleep that when I do check my email writing on my blog just takes too much time.    Life in N. Ireland is good.  I was recently accepted to a graduate programme that is a 35 week internship/placement all paid.  I just have to find a company to work for.  It starts in October and I could end up in Asia, Australia, America, Canada, or somewhere in the Middle East.  God only knows.  But I made it this far which is a feat.  I have had to do an application, assessment with group work and now have to interview with individual companies.  I also have to start my dissertation before I head back state side in September.  For all of you Americanos there in the states I am gonna be in  Seattle at the end of Sept.  I would love to meet up.  Other than that I am just working insane hours at the Strand Bar here in Derry and trying to get back in shape after my marathon...I have only been running 3 times sine it ended...YIKES!    Well that is my life sorry I haven't been updating more often.

      So I was at work Saturday night and was tired and grumpy, with a migrane on top.  I started thinking...and I had a great idea for a blog, but then I woke up yesterday still tired and not so grumpy and couldn't remember.  Now its Monday and I still can't remember this great blog topic.  Maybe tonight at work I'll remember.   Lets see I don't know what to say here on this ever so interesting blog.  I had a busy week last week I went to Galway, then was back for 2 days (worked) left for Belfast on Wed and Dublin on Thurs. and returned to Derry for work on Friday.  Whew just talking about it nearly exhausts me.  Life is good here.  I just am working and now starting to begin my dissertation.  I go home in 3 weeks and am quite excited for another journey back to the States, this one thankfully will be longer and more diverse.  I start in Denver to visit the sister.  Then drive to Montana for Hillary's weddng ( urlLink www.hillandmick.com ) then will fly to Seattle and celebrate the big 25 with my friends there.  Then shortly after I hit that mid-20's mark I fly back to Ireland to finish that dissertation and figure out what the future holds for me.   I know this isn't a profound insightful blog, rather an update.  Oh well.  I'm not using my brain today...its on holidays.
