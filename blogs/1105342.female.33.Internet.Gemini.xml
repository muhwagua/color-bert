      Last week I was going through all my old emails and I came across one from a really old friend named Ben Davis. I hadn't heard from him in awhile and his email address was no longer valid. I had tried to email him once before and it had been returned. Ben was a really good friend of mine back in 1995-97 roughly. We used to collect action figures together and hang out together all the time. I loved Ben and I miss his friendship a lot. He even came to my college graduation. Around the summer of '97 I started going out with this guy in Santa Cruz and stopped hanging out with Ben so much.  At one point, I remember this day clearly, we all went to Betty's Ocean View Diner for breakfast. I recall he said something to me that really irritated me and I dumped my juice on his breakfast plate. He got really upset by that, as well he should, and I was very unapologetic. Suffice to say that was the beginning of the end of our friendship. I've always regretted that day and it took me two years after that to really figure out some things about myself. Those things were what alienated an ex of mine and alienated Ben as well. I don't really want to go into what the root cause was or what changed but let's just say things got A LOT better.  Anyway, last Tuesday I was watching last Friday's 20/20 on my UltimateTV box. Now I never watch 20/20 but for some lame reason I wanted to see the Posh Spice/David Beckham interview. So I sat through the whole show because I was too lazy to turn it off after the interview. At the end of the show there was a preview for next week (this friday's) show. It was about a woman who had been searching for the son she'd given up at birth when she was very young. Now this woman lives in Florida and somehow the daughter out in California just happened to meet her long lost brother via a mutual friend 34 years later. What are the chances?? So the camera pans to the son and goshdarnit if it isn't Ben! I was totally freaked out. I had to write an email to my friend Xochi immediately who filled me in on what he knew. What an amazing story! It was great to see Ben too. I was really happy for him and it made me think again about contacting him. Maybe I'll drop him an email and see how life is. And maybe one day he might read this and drop me an email. You never know...

      My friend Kammie gave me her potted Jasmine to plant in my yard since she's moving to Vermont and was getting rid of her plants. It wasn't very happy here so I wound up laying it to rest and buying a new Jasmine which I planted last Saturday. It's a Pink Jasmine, it's taller than I am and it smells wonderful! I have a piece of it in my room right now and it the smell of jasmine is everywhere. This guy was a lot of work though. I spent hours carefully untangling the vines and tying it to the trellis. I sure hope this one makes it. I have great intentions for my plants, but since I'm so new at doing this it's taking awhile to make my brown thumb less brown. If I could I'd have a yard full of scented flowers like jasmine, wisteria, honeysuckle and trumpet trees. Here's a before and after picture.      Oh and the 4 plants I have in my office are actually still alive and thriving! I'm so proud. Even after one of them got gnats and I had to wash all the soil off its roots and transplant it. Yay me! Crap, did I just jinx myself?

      Okay so I was scoping out someone else's blog and saw the coolest thing. Someone actually built a monorail they can ride around in their yard! A local no less, located in Fremont, CA. You gotta see this for yourself:  http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/Niles.html .

      A nice guy by the name of Allen wrote me a note to let me know that for some reason all he can see on this page is the picture of the squid flashing and nothing else. He has IE 5.0. I told him to upgrade. This blogger thinggie uses a template that I personally don't want to sit around trying to debug. I'm hoping he takes my advice on this.  On a sad note the three goldfish I gave up for adoption last November have died.  Read for yourself:   -----Original Message----- From: R. Joseph Heagany IV  Sent: Saturday, April 19, 2003 1:15 PM To: Marian Burgess Subject: Re: Fishies  hi marian!  well, i'm sorry to say this.. but they didn't survive.  they didn't all go at once.. but 2 weeks ago i had to burry the big one (who lasted the longest)  friday morning i woke-up and he was swimming upside down (as the others did) i didn't think much about it - but i had to go out of town for the weekend.. anyway, i came back and my entire apartment smelled like rotten fish.. and i heard it got quite hot that weekend too. ugh, gross.  well, they were fun while they lasted.  sorta freaked my friends out though with those big crazy eyes.  glad you're enjoying yer new city. cheers, joe  Joe was a guy I met last fall in Oakland when I bought his elliptical. He emailed me afterwards wondering about my apartment since I'd mentioned I was moving and he needed to move out of his place pretty quickly. He wound up finding another place and I wound up getting him to adopt my fish.   I'd had those fish for almost four years. My friend Dave foisted them on me after he'd found them abandoned in a rental his parents had after the speed freaks that lived there had moved out and been gone for three weeks. They were suprised to find the fish in the first place since the tank was full of murky brown water. A little stirring and voila, three fish! I took those guys in and added two more to the fold. Over those years one of the ones I bought died and one that I'd adopted died. So I was left with two adopted fish and one that I'd gotten from the pet store that was once black and had mutated and turned gold. My favorite of the adoptees I named Dave. He was a BIG goldfish. They all had those goofy bubble eyes but he was the coolest. I was pretty proud of how big he got.  It got tiresome to own fish though and I was tired of ruining carpets and furniture due to all the water involved. I don't know how other folks do it but it was a pretty messy process to upkeep those guys. Joe already had some fish so I figured he was a good candidate to take them in. Now I'm not sure what really happened and I thought Goldfish live a long long time so who knows. I'm just sorry they didn't make it. Oh well, Dave would have probably flushed them down the toilet so they got a few extra years of life out of it. No more fish for me anyways. Too much work!

      I fixed the ugly whacky color comments box due to a couple of complaints I got on how hard it was to read. That's the color the darn thing came with! I did put some time into making it a lovely shade of pink. At least it's not red or lime green per Jenn's request and it's quite readable now. I think. Also be sure to put in the http:// before your URL in the Hompage field or the link won't work when you leave your comment. Yes, yes, that's dumb, I know. I'll look into fixing that later. For now please just add the http://. Thank you!

      I'm a little lax on the entries lately. I spent the entire weekend playing  Age of Mythology  until the wee hours of the morning with Chris, Fred and Scott. Really fun game except the computer almost always kicks our butts for some reason. Maybe we all just suck. Oh except for Fred, he's pretty good. Anyway I highly recommend picking it up if you're into PC Strategy Games. Basically you choose a God and as quickly as you can you build up your economy, earn favor, create mythical creatures and armies and try to take out the enemy before they take you out. Personally I really like all the buildling aspects of the game. Kind of like Sim City except you have people level control as opposed to just city level. The part I'm lousy at is building the armies and fighting. If for some reason you decide to pick up this game be sure to check out  Planet Age of Mythology .  This is one of the best sites out there on how to play the game and what kind of strategies to use. Okay, okay, enough boring game talk.     On another note,  Friendster  is enforcing their photo policy which states you can't have celebrity, copyrighted or pet photos displayed as your primary photo. As a result Olivia's pic as well as many of her new pet "friends" no longer have photos in their profile. This really sucks because there were some funny profiles, such as the one I listed in the last entry, that will eventually lose their photos. Also Jenn was telling me that when we joined the number of  Friendster  members was in the 59/60K range. It's now over 100K members and we've only been on there a month! Crazy!  And last but not least  "Detective Story"  is available for download from the  Animatrix  site. This is the 3rd of 4 shorts  the Matrix  folks will make available on the web before the DVD comes out June 3rd. There will be a total 9 episodes on the DVD. In case you don't know what this is these are animated and CG short stories based off of the Matrix. "The Second Renaissance Parts 1 and 2" deal with how  the Matrix  came to be, "Program" is about a training program and "Detective Story" deals with a 40's style detective trying to track down Trinity. So far I really dig the "The Second Renaissance Part 1" the best and I can't wait for the 2nd part to come out next month. Check them out if you can. They are large downloads but worth the wait!

      My friend Raul recently got me to sign up for a service called  Friendster . It's not unlike many dating sites, except its less like a meat market and more like just a way to have fun and meet new friends or keep in touch with old friends. It turns out that I know quite a few people on there from back in the old sfnet bbs days. I've seen their profiles on there but it's hard to contact folks you haven't talked to in 7 years. I got my friend Jenn to sign up recently and next thing I know she's met some cute, gainfully employed man named Spot. Go figure. If you're interested in sites like this you should sign up, it's pretty cool. You can even  look me up  on there if you like!   There are also some darn funny profiles on there too. I have to include a pic here of one of the funnier ones. This pic is from the profile of " Dr. Dre & His Peeps ":

      Oh, I have to add another entry... My co-worker Paul pointed me to this site today. He was telling me about a post someone made having to do with why people create blogs or profiles for their pets and how these particular people are whacky. Now there's nothing wrong with having a little fun in my opinion, which is precisely why my cat has her own  Friendster  profile. She's met quite a few new friends this way too! More than I have that's for sure. Anyways, I have to point everyone to this site:  The Misused, Generally Ignored LJ Pets Talk Back's journal   Here's an excerpt: ________________________________  I got spayed today.  Mommy and daddy took me to this big scarey place (I was so scared) - they put something on my face and I feel asleep. When I woke up I had a tummy ache and they put a funny collar around my neck. I'm sleepy and I just want to lie around. I feel funny.  -Prey current mood:  groggy

      So what's up with the whacky ketchup colors? Does this make kids want to eat more ketchup? Does this stuff really sell? Don't get me wrong... I love whacky colors, otherwise I wouldn't have purple hair, but there's something just not right about weird colored food items. Take Crystal Pepsi for example, that tanked. Why? Because drinking clear "7-up" looking liquid just didn't taste the same in people's heads. It's all psychological. Kids must dig it though because the H.J. Heinz Co. has sold ketchup in   red  ,   green  ,    purple  ,   pink  ,    orange   and   teal  , and now their new color,   BLUE  . Actually until today I thought Heniz had only put out green and purple ketchup, I've never even heard of all those other colors. Yikes! So... has anyone tried any of these colored condiments?

      Okay I've done some emergency surgery on my lavendar plant.   Sunday : I used a combination of Paul and Jenn's advice. I replanted the lavendar with  vermiculite  and sand. I mixed them into the soil and put some at the bottom of the hole. I'd never even heard of  vermiculite  before Jenn left some comments in my blog about it so this has been a pretty cool learning experience for me.  Here's a definition of what it is: &quot;Heat expanded mica, used to increase water absorbing capacity. Also used to cover seeds that need light for germination.&quot; -and- &quot;Vermiculite is lightweight,  spongelike granules useful in conditioning container soils as they hold both water and air.&quot; This stuff is light as air! Reminds me a bit of puffed wheat.  Anyways, after I replanted the thing I went to pick up Chris at the airport and head down to Santa Cruz. While down there I started to ponder the state of the plant when I pulled it out of the ground. The roots were pot shaped still and very tight. I started doing a bit of research on what it means for a plant to be  rootbound . I started to realize that this may be the real culprit and not just overwatering due to rain.   Today:  After work I rushed home and dug the plant back up. Considering it wasn't buried very deep it wasn't a big deal to pull it back out. Taking some pruning shears I cut into the root ball in four places. I cut the same into the bottom of it then pulled it apart so the roots could be spread out. I then replanted it and watered it with some plant food. It was looking pretty sad today.  Some of my ice plants weren't looking too happy either. My azaela's are looking great but my white rhododendron has some browning of the petals in places. Is that due to the wet weather lately or....? Any more tips?

      An email from my friend Amrah today:  "adjectives, girl.  you have cool things to talk about, but you are almost too concise, you write in a very polished, magazine style.  Which is cool cause you are indeed informing us of stuff.  But maybe you want to liven it up with more descriptions and personal opinions and insights.  Keep going."  Good advice, especially coming from her since she's a writer by trade. I think it'll take me a little while to really get back in tune with writing and add some more personality to my entries. Thanks Amrah!

      I've been collecting quite a bit of Miller Chalkware from  Ebay  lately. Keeping in line with my usual love of vintage kitsch I guess. I've decorated my bathroom with quite a few pieces of chalkware fish. These were popular to have in your bathroom in the 60's. If you're really interested in chalkware you can check out what Ebay has to offer. I usually do a search for  Miller Chalkware . I'd better not see the prices skyrocket on these things now that I've shared it here for the world to see! Here's a pic of some pot holder wall hangings I purchased recently.

      I'm fascinated by the idea of there being species of "Giant" and now "Colossal" squids living in the world that we've never seen and will probably never see. I think it would be very cool if there were squids the size of the one in  20,000 leagues under the sea . You never know...  Photo: Auckland University of Technolgy researchers Dr. Steve O'Shea and Cat Bolstad, are seen with a Colossal Squid at the Te Papa research laboratory in Wellington, Wednesday April 2, 2003.The squid, which was found by fishermen in the Ross Sea, Antarctic, last week, is thought to be the largest intact specimen to have been found. The 150-Kilogram (330 pound) 5-meter (16 foot) immature female 'Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni' squid has eyes as big as dinner plates and razor-sharp hooks on the tentacles.

      I just planted lavender on Sunday. It was nice and perky. Now it's very wilty. It's probably because after I planted and watered it, it rained for two days. Can it be saved??

I'm heading up to good ole Corporate HQ tomorrow in Redmond, WA to take the "Buidling NetSmart Applications" class. Doesn't that sound thrilling? At least I can cruise Seattle with my co-worker and check out the town a bit. Usually when I head up that way it's to see family and we don't cruise the town... ever. Any good restaurant suggestions?  [Listening to: Summertime -  Sarah Vaughan  - Verve Unmixed (02:54)]

      Second Renaissance - Part 2 is out now on the  Animatrix website !  loved Part 1 and can't wait to see this new one. It's a pretty fat download so it'll probably be awhile. Just thought I'd mention that before I head off to bed. Boring post, I know. I've already been told by more than one person I gotta liven things up. I'm working on it!

      I read on a co-worker's blog that WMP 9 has new visualization and blogger plug-ins. I just installed them and now I'm trying out the blogger plug-in. Basically it will insert what I'm listening too into my blog for me. How Fun! How Automated! Whoopity Doo!  Oh I'm also using w.bloggar now to interface with my blogger.com blog. I like it much better than mucking around on their super slow website. Plus this is the only way the plug-in works with the blogger service. It seems cooler except for some reason when I click on "Post and Publish" in w.bloggar it posts to my blogger blog but it doesn't publish to my website blog which is driving me nuts. I even put the FTP info into w.bloggar to get it to post for me. So it seems retarded right now to use another tool just to post one blog entry. Anyone out there know what the heck the problem is?

         I just read on CNN that there's a new book on who the Black Dahila killer is. This time a detective named, Steve Hodel claims his late father, a respected LA doctor is the killer. The book is called "Black Dahila Avenger: The True Story". It's funny that I saw this last night because yesterday during the day my friend Cristy and I were watching the Johnny Depp movie "From Hell" on Showtime and were talking about why Jack the Ripper was such a famous case. I said that it was because at the time the killings were so shocking and notorious and the fact that they never caught anyone made it even more sensational. I said it was similar in my mind to the case of the Black Dahlia and how no one was ever caught in that case, and that it too was a sensational case (the body had been severed in half, pretty shocking for the 40's).  When I read the article later that evening I read that the detective also likened his father to Jack the Ripper, which was an interesting coincidence.         I read a book that I picked up at Rite Aid last fall called "Daddy was the Black Dahila Killer" which was pretty bad. The author, Janice Knowlton claimed that her abusive father was the killer and she only realized this 40 years later after lots of therapy and memory regression. I'm not sure I'd recommend that one as a good read, but if you're into the Dahila case, why not. The most popular Dahila book out there is "Severed" by John Gilmore. Lots of photos, more seemingly factual than the other book, although in the last chapter(s) it exlains who the supposed killer is as well, which of course can't be proven. I'd probably recommend reading "Severed" first before any of the other two mentioned above. Although I'll probably read the Avenger book when it's out in paperback. I like unsolved mysteries, true crime books, stuff like that. Probably goes along with my love of the horror genre.  I have to add though that the best Dahila book I ever read was the fictional  Black Dahlia  by James Ellroy. Great story! He takes the characters and some of the facts from the original case and weaves his own tale of what might have happened. This book really made me a fan of James Ellroy. It's the first book in a series of 4 L.A .crime novels which includes  L.A. Confidential  ( Black Dahlia ,  Big Nowhere ,  L.A. Confidential ,  White Jazz ), all of which are really excellent books. Here's the link to the the  CNN article  on the new Dahila book if you're a Dahila fan like I am and want to check it out.

      On Sunday I went to the wedding of my boyfriend's friend Yvonne, who also happened to be my last manager at work. The wedding took place at the Mill Pond in Soquel which was a really lovely spot. My only real gripe about the day was the temperature and the fact that I wore a summery dress with a light shawl so I wound up freezing most of the day since the whole thing was outdoors including the reception.  When I first knew I was going to the wedding I wasn't really excited about it. I generally hate the idea of weddings because I'm not sure if I'll ever get married and I'm a bit bitter in general about love/relationshps. Sometimes I feel like marriage and kids are something that society tells you that you're supposed to be doing at a certain age and if you don't there's something wrong with you. I know some of my friends (not many) really feel strongly about it and are bothered by the fact that I'm not always sure about it.     I went to the wedding and loved it. It was such an incredibly nice wedding. I know that they didn't spend tons of money on it but it was so lovely just the way it was that I can't see how they would have put much more into it than they did. I really liked that there weren't bridesmaids and groomsmen, it was so simple with just the two of them. I also really liked the music they played during the wedding. The bride walked down the aisle to "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstong. The bride also wore an orange dress which she made. Now when I first heard it was orange I wasn't sure what to think but when I saw it I have to admit that it was very nice. It was Indian style with an orange (and red) beaded coat over an orange dress with a butterfly clasp. And you know that old adage about radiant brides? It was true. I don't think I've ever seen her look as lovely as that day. The food at the reception was delicious, and the outdoor woodsy setting with the pond was very nice as well. I'm pretty much gushing about it at this point but I was really impressed by it and one day if I ever get married I'm sure I'll want to steal some ideas from their wedding. Basically it was nice to see someone have a great wedding without doing the overblown $30K plus wedding. The two of them look perfect together and I know they are going to have a really wonderful life together. They're pretty darn lucky and I have to say I'm a bit envious. I wish them the best though.       I did get pretty emotional about the whole thing. It made me think a lot about life and the future and what I want out of it. I'm still not 100% sure but I think that I have a better idea now then I ever did before in my life. I'm always evolving as a person and I have to hope that if things are meant to happen for me they will. I really can't control my future but I can hope for the best.

      My friend Xochi was kind enough to send me an email the other day saying that he'd found the pesky blogger code which was causing squids to flash and older browsers to not want to like my site. Here's what he had to say about it:  Your doctype is XHTML 1.0 transitional - probably not even your choice.  I used XHTML on the  Ashpool  site since I had a lot of time on my hands but there's really no reason for it.  And it breaks a TON of code that is otherwise copacetic within HTML 4.01. Check this out:  syntax check____ XHTML 1.0 file: 222 errors, 9 warning swap out that doctype for the ol' HTML 4.01 TRANSITIONAL and you get: HTML 4.01 18 errors, 1 warning ----- What I took out________   (note from marian: I took out the    !DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"          "DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">  What I put in__________ !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"         "http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd"> -----  Now this was what came with my blogger code so if anyone else has any blogger/legacy browser issues, take note! I haven't tested it yet. Pretty funny since I'm a tester but Xochi was kind enough to say he'd do it for me. And Allen if you're out there, let me know if it's still being whacko or if you think it's fixed.   AND there were some birthday's this week (and one more a few weeks ago). So...   HAPPY BIRTHDAY   to:  CHRIS , my boyfriend/smoochiepants.  DAVE , My oldest/best friend and high school compadre.  AMRAH , My most lovely, artistic and one of the most widly gifted friends I have and last but not least....  XOCHI , another old friend who I haven't seen in ages, but who I promise to come hang with one of these days cause I miss him.

      Perry the cute little pooch in my last entry could use some sponsors. I gave into tempation and called about him today but the foster mom wouldn't let me come see him unless I was willing to take him right there and then. I guess I don't blame her. The unfortunate part was that after hearing his story I probably now more than ever can't take him. The probability of him going blind is high and he'll need the eye medication for the rest of his life. The only way to get around the eye medication is to pay for a surgicial procedure that costs $3K. That's a whole lotta dough.  I wish I had that kind of money let me tell ya. I thought about putting a tip jar out at work to raise it. Considering I work at Microsoft there are a few loaded folks there. Maybe I could prey on some animal lovers sympathy til I raised 3 thousand dollars to pay for Perry's eye surgery. Hey I can live my little fantasy can't I?? Anyway, you can do your part and donate to help care for Perry or another South Bay Purebred Rescue Dog. Just go to this link:  http://www.sbprdogs.org/dog_photo_gallery.htm  and scroll down to sweet little Perry's section, click on the PAYPAL link and donate some money for his care. Be Perry's Sponsor Today!! OR you could paypal me some dough and I'll go adopt him and get him eye surgery. Just paypal me! :) It's worth a shot, right?

      Every year I go through a period of wanting a dog. I generally see someone's dog and start longing for one of my own to follow me everywhere I go. I have a cat but she definitely does her own thing. I love her a lot though. She's pretty smart for a cat and I'm not just saying that. I mean I'm not a cat lover AT ALL. But for some reason Olivia really warms my cold dark heart. :)   What's really fueling this desire to get a dog is that for the past two plus years I've worked at a place where you can bring your pets to work. Year before last I was not in a stable place to have a dog. I lived in a small apartment in Oakland which was about an hour and a half commute from work. I was out and about WAY too much to devote any time to a dog. Bringing a cat to work is no fun. You can't take them outside to poop and there are way too many dogs around to make that a safe situation. Cats are much more comfy in their home environment. Mine tends to not like to be taken anywhere ever.     Anyway today after playing with a co-worker's dog (tug of war over a chew toy) and seeing another co-worker's dog during a meeting it really tipped me over the obsessive "must get a dog" edge again. Last time it went on for a few months. Driving my boyfriend insane with "I want a pug! I want a pug! I want a pug!". Lately it's been "I want a norwich terrier!". I tend to glom on to whatever cute small dog I see. The real truth of the matter is that I can't get a dog like a pug (sheds too much, too many health conditions) and I probably can't get a terrier (like to hunt cats... BAAADD).   So I went and looked at all the dog shelter websites I have bookmarked knowing that the best dog I'll probably ever find may be a mutt and will most deifnitely be an adult dog versus having to devote time to housebreaking and all kinds of other training you have to do for a puppy. I saw two excellent dogs today though. I wanted to run right out and get them! One's a West Highland White Terrier. Very pretty, very cute, nice and young, pure bred and sociable (has a broken leg but on the mend - Terrier does equal bad with cats as stated above). The other was a shih tzu/schnauzer/poodle mix. I love this dog! LOVED IT! Wanted to bring him home NOW! Only downside? DRY EYE! What the heck? May be permanent must be treated often with eye ointment. Great. That just sucks. Now I'm going to long for this dog I can probably never have.    urlLink         Of course I'm not mentioning the other downsides which are a) I'm going to Europe in August and will be gone for two weeks and b) my landlord says no dogs even though I have a large garden private patio area, just perfect for a small dog. I suspect that my neighbors have a dog though or have one part time at least. And the neighbors over the fence have two loud yappy dogs that could mask any barking my own dog would do. Or I could at least blame them for any noise.  PLUS the landlords don't live onsite so that's a bonus. Anyways I might just go see "Perry" to see if he's worth all the fuss. The eye thing might not be as bad as it could be and could potentially go away. If he's around when I get back from Europe then maybe it was meant to be? No no no, gotta stop right here! No way do I have the type of lifestyle where I can take on a special needs dog. Unfortunate, but true.

      I'd like to thank Jenn for sending me this great link to the "Belief-O-Matic". She sent that in response to my last posting. She came out 100% Secular Humanism and surprise surprise so did I! Here's a link to the quiz so you can take it for yourselves:  http://www.beliefnet.com/story/76/story_7665_1.html  .  Here's the definition of Secular Humanism:   What Secular Humanists Believe   Belief in Deity Not considered important. Most Humanists are atheists or agnostics.   • Incarnations Same as above.   • Origin of Universe and Life The scientific method is most respected as the means for revealing the mysteries of the origins of the universe and life.   • After Death An afterlife or spiritual existence after death is not recognized.   • Why Evil? No concept of “evil.” Reasons for wrongdoing are explored through scientific methods, e.g. through study of sociology, psychology, criminology.   • Salvation No concept of afterlife or spiritual liberation or salvation. Realizing ones personal potential and working for the betterment of humanity through ethical consciousness and social works are considered paramount, but from a naturalistic rather than supernatural standpoint.    • Undeserved Suffering No spiritual reasons but rather a matter of human vulnerability to misfortune, illness, and victimization.    • Contemporary Issues The American Humanist Association endorses elective abortion. Other contemporary views include working for equality for homosexuals, gender equality, a secular approach to divorce and remarriage, working to end poverty, promoting peace and nonviolence, and environmental protection.     I took the quiz again with what I used to believe in and I got "Mainline to Liberal Christian Protestant". That resulted from my former belief that there was a God and some sort of afterlife but that everything else was due to human effort and not via religious means. Whacky.  I'm still not sure that I feel better about dying being the END. But I know I sure do treasure life a whole lot more than I already did. And if this is the only life we get then I hope that I live it to its fullest and I don't grow old with regrets of what could have been....

      I was brought up with a religious background. My dad's a Christian and so are my grandparents et al. I went to Christian missionary schools for  4 years of grade school and I attended two years of Christian high school. So I was brought up with the concept of heaven and hell and what you need to do to go to the better of the two.  Last night for some bizzare reason I had a lot of trouble sleeping and I started to think about what really happens when you die. I came to the conclusion that nothing happens when you die. You just die. I mean why does there have to be a lot of hocus pocus or faith or what have you in the concept of death? This is just to make us feel better about dying! Now this isn't a new concept to me. I've thought this before, but for some reason last night it really hit home. I got a mini panic attack over the whole thing and thought what a complete waste it is to just die and turn to dust and lose everything that makes you a unique person and all the things that you put into being you. But then I also thought what makes us humans so special that we get an afterlife? What happens when ants die? Do they go to ant heaven or just turn to dust? What's the deal there?? I put in the search term "What happens when you die" into Google tonight and came up with many religious websites and a few wills and trusts sites. I did come across this person's blog though:  http://extremesloth.com/blog/archives/000150.shtml . What this guy wrote on his site sums up a lot of what folks I know think. Well except for the eternal dream part.. but in a nutshell... Anyway, the popular opinion is that religion is what helps people get through the day and not be afraid to die when their time comes. (Religion also helps keep people moral and good) Otherwise you've got people like me panicking about turning to dust. Or as I've also heard you could be of the mind set that once you're dead you don't know any differently so there's nothing to worry about or miss or be sad about so who cares about dying. No worries there.  What do you think?

      Sorry I was back east all last week in Virginia visiting my dad and stepmom. This week has been pretty busy at work so I haven't had much time to write. I did want to drop an entry here to let folks know that I'm selling stuff on ebay again.   Take a look!   My ebay user id is Violet02. I'll be adding more items next week but this is just to get started. I do want to highlight the fact that I'm selling two cameras. An underwater camera and a canon s330 digital camera. Both primo items! So if you're interested come on by and bid!

      So there I am today getting ready for work, minding my own business when the lady on KCBS (740AM, yes I listen to AM radio, I've turned into my father) says there is breaking news that the  Eiffel Tower is on fire . Oh great I think. My first time ever going to Paris in August and the Eiffel Tower is going to burn down (or at least be damaged and closed, heh). Luckily the fire was on the top floor and was most likely caused by some sort of faulty wiring or something like that. Which to me means yes, I'll still be able to go up to the tourist portions of the Eiffel Tower in t-minus three weeks and counting!   I'm started to get psyched for my trip although it still hasn't set in yet that I'm finally heading to Europe again after years and years of not being there. First stop London for four days then Paris for six. I wish we could have gone for longer but this is how it was orginally planned and due to the great deal we got we were unable to change it. 10 days is great though. 10 1/2 technically but who's counting. I also think we probably should have gone to paris for all 10 but live and learn. I love London though and am anxious to go back and see what it's like now that I'm not a teenager on a trip with my dad anymore. Should be a blast. This is probably the biggest vacation I've taken without my dad being around for it. Which really makes me excited. I feel all grown up and stuff! Anyway I'm taking off at the beginning of August, week after next! Whee!  In other news, Toby got sick AGAIN today. Yet another $100 plus vet visit. I gave him a greenie treat yesterday. Made out of chlorophyll and supposedly great for dogs. Well I gave him two big ones. Today he once again had an "accident", barfed and had the yucky runs. I rushed him to the vet because he was way worse than when he ate the cat food. They gave him subcutaneous fluids, so he had this big camel hump all day while he absorbed the fluids. I got more tummy meds for him and he didn't get to eat today, poor guy. Made me feel like I was abusing him even though the doc said no food. I have to feed him rice and cottage cheese or cooked chicken for the rest of the week starting tomorrow. The doc said I could give him small bits of greenies in the future but FORGET IT! I'm not EVEN risking it. Runny Dog is NO FUN.    I got my carpets steam cleaned last friday but I'm going to have the cleaning guy come back tomorrow to treat Toby's two accident spots because even using Nature's Miracle and using spot cleaner that I bought won't make the carpet stain come out. I don't get it!! Nature's Miracle used to always work and sometimes it still does but on one cat barf spot and these two spots ZIP ZILTCH! I'm confused. Probably the crappy carpet I have. Bleh.

      Thanks to  Edna Million  for sending me this link to an  Animal Abuse Petition  site. There are currently 22,937 signatures to date.   Here's the text of the petition letter:  Make Penalties for Animal Abuse More Severe!  Dear President Bush,  Animal Abuse must stop! Animal neglect cannot be allowed. Across the United States, thousands of animals are severely mistreated. Often this violence against animals goes unpunished. Animals have rights just like humans. They don't deserve to be tortured and abused. The people who commit these crimes are not getting enough time behind bars. Animal abuse crimes are often overlooked, despite the fact that statistics show that there is a strong correlation between violence against animals and violence against humans. These violent people must be severely punished for their crimes. An animal deserves the protection of the state. Are they not as important as a person. Are people somehow more valuable? No, we're not. The law must be more strict against animal abusers. Please take action to increase the penalties for animal abusers. You will be helping get criminals off the streets... perhaps before they take violent action against people as well!   Thank You, The Undersigned.  If this is something you believe in please take the time to go and sign this petition and hopefully make a difference in an issue like this. Also for more info/reading, here's a link to an article entitled " Animal Abuse as an Indicator of Violence ".  Good stuff to be aware of. Thanks Edna!

      So Tuesday AM I got a call from the foster mom. She said she had gotten my email that morning and was suprised to hear from me. She told me that it must be "Serendipitous" that I wanted him back because she called everyone on her list after me and no one wanted him! The family in Tahoe's mother got ill and went into the hospital so they couldn't do it. One family went to Spokane for a month. A third family didn't want to pay the adoption fee for him (can you believe that?? With all that humane societies do for animals??) and supposedly were acting like they were doing the society a FAVOR by taking him for free! Hrmph! So the woman said she called her mom and friends at the society and decided that yes I could have him back. To top it all off my old first grade best buddy from Flint, MI wrote me an email. She had come across my website after years of us being out of touch and saw my post about Toby. She wanted me to know how much her dog meant to her and how important he was in her life and that even though he was ill she would never give up the years she had with him.  Well that pretty much solidified what I already knew. It was fate. Tuesday evening my friend Dave and I drove all the way back to Murphys to pick him up. Yet another 2 1/2 plus hour drive (one way!) out past Stockton. When we got there the woman told me that the daughter of the elderly lady that had owned Toby stopped by with a big bag of his toys. She washed them all and gave them to me to take back with him which was great! Good timing! Anyway, I got Toby home and it was like he never left, except without all the previous anxiety. I had a little bit still, but with each day it gets easier and easier. Of course he ran in and for some odd reason ate a mouthful of cat food. He'd stayed away from it before but the drive musta pooped him out. Wednesday on the way to work he decided to hurl in the car and then spent the whole rest of the day having the runs... eww. He had an "accident" in my office and one late at night at home. I was trying to crate him at night when I first got him but I decided he was definitely trustworthy so I didn't crate. Which is probably just as well anyways so he didn't have the accident in his bed. Suffice to say it's been a tough couple of days.   I took him to the vet today and he weighed in at 18lbs, 1oz. and yes he's definitely a purebred Lhasa Apso. He's in good health and got some pills for his runs, which I have to say helped right away thank god. Got some advantage flea meds for the kitty and for the pup and a free visit for having adopted him. Even with the free ($50 value) visit the vaccine he got for kennel cough, the cat and dog flea meds and the pills still cost me $120 something! Yikes. Good thing I don't have to go to the vet that often! Advantage lasts the next 6 months anwyays. I am definitely getting vet insurance for him though. Dogs have a greater tendency to hurt themselves than cats do. I could insure my cat but even with her sensitive stomach its been cheaper to pay for the visits over the last 10 years.   My boyfriend doesn't seem to be too stoked by the dog. He hasn't warmed up to him at all really. But Toby's my dog so that's fine. I'm still happy with my choice cause I know it was the best one. Toby is wonderful and I'm really lucky to have such a perfect, wonderful, well behaved dog. I'm also very lucky to have the cat that I do. I have two wonderful animals and may be becoming an old maid before my time (spinster = owning lots of cats/dogs) but I'd rather be that and have the two pets that I do than go through life without them at this point. At least their love is unconditional. Life is funny. I never though at 32 I'd be getting a dog as an unmarried, no kid having woman. One day I'd like to be a married, kid having, pet having woman. Here's to hoping. Lastly I'd like to say thanks to Edna and Jenn who both posted comments about how I should get the dog back. Thanks for the support! And before I forget the last bit of my story, folks at work and friends all offered their help with Toby if I ever need it. Awww! Thanks guys! Warms the ole heart. I've even got my own list of dog sitters at work when I have to go to meetings and don't feel like leaving him alone. Toby's well loved now. :)

      This last week has been pretty emotional for me. Last Tuesday I went out to Murhpys which is way out in the middle of nowhere east of Stockton about 150 miles from Mountain View. My friend Dave drove and we got a lot of views of open country, two lane roads and cows with no civlization in sight for miles. It was actually a very nice drive. Anyway, I went out there to adopt a dog named Toby. Toby is the perfect dog. I mean the PERFECT dog. Totally trained, smart and cute as can be. I picked him up and took him home. Then Doggy ownership shock set in.   Boy was I a mess from Tuesday til Sunday. A mess! Basically I got Toby, started taking him to work. Freaked out at every little thing he did, not sure if I could deal. Generally speaking owning a dog is a HUGE lifestyle change and I was in shock at the fact that I was now responsible for this little guy for the next 15 years of his life. My cat wasn't super pleased either but she was adjusting. To top it all off my boyfriend who I spend weekends with at his home in Santa Cruz won't let me bring the dog with me to his home.  I got overwhelmed, I freaked, I called the woman back, (she was holding my check for a week) and told her due to the cat and dog relations I had to give him up. I drove out and met her in Tracy on Sunday and relinquished the dog. Now ever since I did that I totally regret it. I didn't give it enough of a chance and I completely regret the decision I made. Basically I gave him up thinking that I could one day be a bad dog owner that maybe one day I might not care of his needs when he needed it. Call it a fear of commitment if you will.  The stupid part of this whole thing is that I CAN do it. I just freaked. I mean I've had Olivia, my cat,  for 10 years and she's great. Anyway, to make this long story short I wrote a very heartfelt email back to the foster mom (who's out of town for two days) begging for a second chance. I told her the cat and dog relations situation could be worked out (add embelished story here) and that I'd do just about anything to have that little guy back. The truth of the matter is that I became utterly attached to him. I fell in love with him in 5 days and I feel like I just had a horrible breakup and I'm never going to see the other person again. It's just awful. I'm ashamed of myself for freaking like I did and I'm hoping I'll get that second chance. If I don't its my own darn fault and I'm sure he'll go to a great home anyways.  I'm an idiot though. I just have to get that all out.  So wish me luck and let's hope this all works out for the best and I don't wind up regretting my stupid stupid freak out mistake.

      Boy have I been lax on writing lately! I've been busy doing stuff around the house and bonding with my dog so I just haven't felt like taking the time to write.   So... the trip was.... HOT BURNING INFERNO OF HELL HOT. What a time to go, at the height of the heat wave. The day we arrived in London was the "hottest day in London history". A whopping 95.7 degrees and humid as well. France got well over 100 degrees. I recall it being about 104 at its worst. Very humid there as well. In fact, on the day it was 104 my friend Dave and I climbed 239 or so steps to the top of the Arc de Triomphe cause god forbid we didn't climb up there seeing as we were all the way over in Paris. In fact I'd have to say we really powered through that heat wave. We walked a min of 12 hours a day. We would go all day and into the evening at times. We even went clubbing in London during the horrific heat wave. Which was super fun! Music in London is SOOO much better than it is here. Oh and we saw everything famous there was to see in London and Paris, or just about everything.   I got a bit bored with London by day 4 and Paris was a bit... smelly and dirty but I'd definitely go back to both. In fact I saw my tattoo artist friend Sunny in Paris (her website is back up at  http://www.sunnybuick.com ). She's hoping to have an apartment IN Paris versus in the suburbs where she lives now by next year. I plan on going back next spring when it's not HOT to hang out again. Hopefully I won't catch it when it's pouring down rain either. I'll have to plan it just right. Paris is a beautiful city and I loved being there even though I wasn't terribly fond of some of the people. In fact I'm going to try and remember my high school and college french again by taking a french class that starts in two weeks. I figured now that I'm finally going to France I'll actually have a place to use the language versus learning it and forgetting it because I had no one to practice it with.  Tomorrow Toby goes to a one hour private training class with the dog trainer in Redwood City. She's going to try him out with various other breeds of dogs to try and figure out what his agression issues are. I can't seem to figure it out. Most of the time he just LOOOOVES other dogs. Then sometimes there are some dogs he wants to attack and I have no clue why at all. Really nice mellow dogs too! The trainer thought it might be a problem with "northern breed" dogs but I saw him be agressive towards two other types of dogs last week so who knows. What I do know is that it's $95 for a one hour session so he better not love every dog she brings in there! I'd like to figure out what his deal is for sure though. It's making it difficult to take him to the patio during lunch at work for fear he'll try to go after another dog while I'm eating. Also if he's going to be ornery like that I can't start him in the beginning dog training class next week. He'll have to go to the "Grumpy Pup" class instead, heh.   This week Cristy taught Toby how to sneeze on command. You sneeze, he sneezes. It's quite cute. I taught him how to do a double high five by putting both my hands up in the air and he does it too then puts his paws on mine. I also taught him how to growl for a treat. I'm working on "speak" as well. I got him to do that a couple of times today. He's so smart though! He picks stuff up right away. It's amazing. He's even really use to his crate now and if I say "Get in your bed" he gets right in. Same with his bed at work... just hops right in there. Such a change from having a cat that doesn't do anything I say. I still love my cat though. She has her own special good points too.

      I'm packing for my trip! My flight leaves Tuesday from SFO at 11:43am. We fly to Chicago then to London. We'll arrive in London at 10am on Wednesday morning. I'm going to keep a small written journal while I'm there and I have about 20 people to send postcards to. It would be cool if I could keep some sort of running online journal but I doubt I'll be around enough internet cafes to do that. Plus my digicam is still in the shop so its regular film all the way. Ah well.   I hear Paris has a lot of dog poo. Dog heaven there.  Should be beautiful nonetheless. Plus my tattoo artist has moved to Paris so I'll get to see her as well! She's requested that I bring Jolly Ranchers and Good and Plentys since there aren't any there. Here's a cute article about her on the cold steel website:  http://www.coldsteel.co.uk/articles/bayarea.html . Also if you do a search for "Sunny Buick" on Google you'll come up with quite a few pages on her artwork which is really great. I'm biased though, she's done 11 of my 12 tattoos.  Anyway just wanted to put a quick entry in here letting everyone know that I'll be back on the 18th! I'll try to post some of my adventures here. It's going to go quick but it will be a blast I'm sure. Can't wait!

      I heard a song called, "The New" by  Interpol  yesterday that I'm totally hooked on. It reminds me of moody 80's music, kinda Echo and the Bunnymen-ish. "Killing Moon" by Echo and the Bunnymen is still one of my favorite 80's songs to this day (There's a great scene in the movie  Gia  with that song playing). Anyway, if you can find yourself a copy of this song I think it's worth it.  I also heard a song called "Still in Love Song" by  The Stills , that I liked a lot as well. It was also reminiscent of old 80's New Wave tunes. I can't find the album on Amazon but you can listen to the song on their  website . Just click on Audio/Video and it'll take you there.

      I'm so very very bored and restless. I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop and I don't know why. I'm also moody too so that probably has something to do with it. I think the biggest problem I'm having is not really knowing what I'm doing with my life at this point other than having a career and pets. I feel like my life should be more fabulous than it is. I've got to start figuring out how to make that happen. Otherwise I'm going to go totally crazy. I'm also feeling old lately too which isn't helping my mindset.  My friend Kammie pops into town tomorrow for a night from Vermont. She has to go into the office at Sun in Menlo Park so she'll be staying over. It will be great to see her. Plus we can have girly chats and stuff which is probably what I need right now.   I have to head off to my dog training class soon. I'm not sure if I like it or not. Particularly since I can't trust Toby not to freak out on some other dog. I wish he'd just shut up and sit there like a good dog. Ugh. I figured out why he left me a present yesterday. While I was at my meeting some guys in my hall unleashed him and ran him up and down the hall which gets him all riled up. Then they leashed him back in my office... Of course he had to "go" at that point so he went. The last couple of days have been pretty trying dog owner days for me. I'm feeling worn out I guess.  I got my pictures back from Europe. My friend Dave swore up and down that he was an excellent photographer on our trip. What a liar! His thumb is in half the damn photos! I can't believe it. Since I know he'll be reading this I'd like to say, "Dave you're a big fat liar!". Hrmph.

      I had to go to a meeting this morning and I had no one to watch Toby. I've left him leashed in my office before but this time he was upset about it. He took a poo on my  Xootr ! Oh well, at least it wasn't on the floor. The Xootr was easy enough to clean off. Ugh. For someone who hates poo as much as I do I'm suprised I didn't hurl. I guess having a dog really toughens you up.   On another note, a girl found my blog entry from Sept. 11th re: Solitaire Showdown and asked if I would like to add her to my MSN Messenger list so we could play sometime. Apparently she's been looking for folks to play with since she's also just as addicted to it. I did a search on "Solitaire Showdown" via Google and found other Blog entries referring to it's addictive tendencies.   What really surprised me was how fast search engines find my blog entries! I guess my mindset never updated from five years ago when it took forever for search engines to find your pages. Now it's pretty quick! Which led me to do a search on "Santa Cruz Pet Resort". I found my blog entries on about page 5 of the search results. That's pretty cool.

      Before I forget... I dropped Toby off there yesterday and Kevin the owner was there. So he seems nice enough. Professional. He inputs the info into the computer about Toby. Then he comes out to get him. Gets down on one knee and starts petting Toby and saying "It's nice to see you again Toby! Great to have you back again!". Um. Okay....  Then I say thanks and as I'm leaving he says, "Is that a new tint in your hair?" And I say, "No it's always been this color" and he isn't sure what to say next so he's like, "Oh", smiling the whole time. I then get the hell out of there. Chris said I should have called him on it and said, "Did your wife talk to you?". Hehe. At least he's kissing my ass versus calling me a liar now.

      So when I first joined  Friendster  it seemed pretty novel and interesting. I wasn't into joining a meat market site like match.com becase I wasn't interested in meeting anyone but I thought it would be a cool way to keep in touch with friends.   Well  Friendster  got really popular and then it got to be a real pain to use. Slow, unreliable email, weird message boards. Some folks were inviting me to move over to  Tribe.net . Tribe works a lot better than Friendster does but since most people I know already joined Friendster it was going to be impossible to shift everyone over there. So I continued to use Friendster.  Anyway it's really paid off in the last few weeks. First I met a cool new friend on there who I seem to have commonality with. Then I get reunited with my old friends Bill and Shannon who I used to hang out with ten years ago. Plus I was also reunited with an old ex-boyfriend Jeff, who hung out with Bill and Shannon and I. It was nice to hear from him and I was happy to see that a) he didn't hate me still and b) he married a girl who he'd had a crush on since Junior High and they have now been married for ten years and have two kids and he's happy and doing well.   Sometimes I really wish I would have kept in touch with my friends but I seemed to float around so much and it's hard for me to manage my life, work and lots of friends. It's not really an excuse but I'm not sure why it is that happens. I'm hoping I get settled down more in my life at some point where I can sustain the same group of friends for a long period of time. Plus that makes me realize that I need to keep up on my friendships with some of my friends now and not wait around for them to completely die out.

      R.I.P - John Ritter and Johnny Cash. EVERYONE I know is sad that Johnny Cash died. Yes it's sad, he was very talented. But he was also old.   I'm not hearing too many R.I.P - John Ritter's though. John Ritter was also talented in his own way and was relatively young (54). He also left behind 4 kids including one 5 year old daughter.  So I just want to say R.I.P JOHN RITTER who you may also know as Jack Tripper from Three's Company. A show I watched ALL the time when I was a kid.  Thank you.

      I'm addicted! You can only play it with a friend via MSN Messenger 6. Sucks! I have to beg my friend Austin to play with me all the time. I'm a solitaire showdown fiend! If anyone has some time on their hands and would like to play, I'm available.

      I have a new  Santa Cruz Pet Resort  story. Last Saturday I took Toby in to drop him off. The girls there were nice as usual, no owner, all was well. As I'm getting him checked in I notice the reservation clipboard on the desk. It has the names of the dogs, breed and special instructions. I was the last person to check in so my lines weren't crossed out yet.  I see: Toby  - Lhasa Apso Special Instructions: CHARGE FOR EVERYTHING, LIAR!!  What the...?? I'm pretty disturbed at this point. I check Toby in and then walk out a bit dumbfounded. I call Chris and tell him the story. He said that he'd probably say something so I turn around and go back in there. I ask the girl why the sheet says that. She said she hadn't read it and had no idea. I explain to her that I got into it with Kevin the owner the previous weekend and why me might type such a rude thing into the computer. She suggested I talk to his wife, the co-owner when I pick Toby up. I say fine.  Today I pick up Toby. I talk to the wife. She looks in the computer and looks shocked. Whatever. She says that her husband and her are always having to deal with people dropping their pets off at all hours and expecting them to deal with it without it costing them. She explains this for awhile, apologizes profusely and says she'll speak to her husband. Okay I feel a TAD better. I did want SOMEONE to apologize that's for sure. The truth of the matter is I like this place. The girls who work here are nice. Toby seems to have a lot of fun there and they are the cheapest deal anywhere around. So I wasn't ready to run my business elsewhere if you know what I mean.  Mary at  Small Dog House Boarding  is my absolute fave though. She takes great care of the dogs and has a nice house in Belmont. The only problem for me is she's really out of the way and costs $25 a night versus the $18 a night I pay in Santa Cruz. Anyway, I guess I'm taking Toby back to Santa Cruz Pet Resort. What a hassle though. People make me nuts. Particularly the people in Santa Cruz. I'm not sure what it is but they tend to be ruder over there than most other places. I think it's the ME FIRST attitude there that makes me nuts.   On another note I saw " Le Divorce " this weekend with my friend Cristy. Nice film. I enjoyed it and would probably see it again on DVD. I liked the parisian scenery. It made me miss being in Paris. I can't wait to go back next year when the weather is cooler and I can stay a bit longer. Anyway, some of the jokes about the French were pretty right on. Go check it out at a matinee. I'ts fun.   Also, I'll be at  Fischerspooner  next Monday. That promises to be an excellent show. I'll be accompanied by my lovely friend  Amrah  who I haven't seen in awhile. I'm looking forward to it. Next week will be particularly busy for me since I'll be going to Fischerspooner on Monday, Beg. Dog Training on Tuesday, and French class on Wednesday. The week after I'll be starting Yoga on Mondays. I can't remember the last time I had a schedule like that. It's kinda nice!

      By the way... while I'm slamming places (or people) in the Santa Cruz area I have to mention "Scotts Valley Mini Storage". Whatever you do do NOT store your stuff there. Last week my friend Cristy went to go get a DVD out of her storage, she opens the lock up and notices that it seems a bit rattley. She gets into her 5x10 storage room and notices that half the stuff is missing if not more. All her DVD's, CD's, Mom's Jewelry, Mom's Crystal is GONE! She was in the midst of possibly moving so she had put all her stuff in her storage room. So everything of value she had is now GONE.   To make matters worse the Scotts Valley PD said there had been a few robberies at this place. The management hadn't even bothered to inform the tenants of this. What's even scarier is they picked the lock and put it back where they found it. No forced entry. Plus they seemed to know exactly what to take and what to leave. They'll probably never catch the guys but at least she had rental insurance that covered her storage room. It won't make up for the memorabilia and things she got from her mom though. If I believed in Karma then I would say those guys are going to get theirs! Alas I don't so what I will do is hope they get run over by a Mack truck instead. Jerks!  Hrmph. The Santa Cruz area used to be fulla nice folks! It's not like Scotts Valley is East Oakland or anything sheesh! Anyways, think bad thoughts towards those dang thieves and send happy thoughts towards my friend Cristy. Maybe... just MAYBE the cops can recover some of her stuff. I sure hope so.

      Last Sunday Toby went to his private training session. The verdict is that he's not an agressive dog. He did fine with all the dominant and submissive dogs they brought around him. They even brought in a wolf-hybrid dominant dog and he was fine with him. Although this dog was WAY bigger than Toby and pretty scary looking so I wouldn't wanna mess with him either! Toby does fine around socialized dogs, but not as well around non-socialized dogs which may be part of the problem with my co-workers dog at work that he gets into it with.   I also attended the first dog training session last night for an hour and a half. It was interesting, a bit hard to hear and lots of people there but good information and hand outs. Our next class is in two weeks, I get to bring Toby to that one. I'm already working on the commands with him and he's doing pretty well. The class focuses on positive reinforcement and lots of treats. Dogs are food motivated so special extra good treats motivate them to listen to you more. It seems to be pretty effective so far. I can't wait until he's jumping through flaming hoops and twirling batons. That's probably in the advanced class though, so a few more months to go.  Toby stayed at  Santa Cruz Pet Resort  last weekend while I was down in Santa Cruz. He seemed to love it. They let the dogs go out and roll in the dirt and jump on trampolines and do crazy stuff. I visited him on Labor Day and he could care less that I was there so that indicated to me that he was having fun. It's very nice there with a koi pond and everything. I like to think of it as doggy overnight/day spa. It was great... oh except for the owner who's a total jerk.   Last Thursday I call the place and I ask if I can bring Toby in on Sunday and pick him up on Tuesday AM. The girl says sure, but we're only open from 4-5pm on Sunday so you have to show up during that hour to drop him off. I say great see you Sunday. I take Toby in at about 4:15 and there's no one there. There's a big CLOSED sign on the gate and a sign that says "Labor Day Weekend: Closed Sunday". Okay so that's lame. I'm po'ed at this point. Great now what do I do? So I say screw it and go in the gate. I head through the place to the office which is wide open. No one in sight. I call out... no one there. I hang out for about 15 min talking to Chris on the phone trying to figure out what to do and a girl shows up. I tell her the story and she says, "Okay let me call the owner and see if we can take your dog". She calls Kevin the owner up and he says okay but it's "after hours" so there's a $25 charge for it. Then he hangs up. She relays the news to me. I get upset and explain to her how it's not my fault because I was told it was okay to come today. She says, "Well you don't have to pay today so talk to the owner when you pick your dog up on Tuesday. I'll try to talk to him about it too".   On Labor Day I come to visit Toby and the girl is there and she says it's fine, she never entered the fee into the computer. I thank her for being so nice. Tuesday. I go to pick up Toby. I get there and the owner asks me when I arrived. I say Sunday and he says, "Okay well we were closed that day and usually it's a $50 after hours drop off fee but I'm just going to charge you $25 this time". I tell him that's not okay with me because I was told it was okay to come in on Sunday and I came all the way down there with my dog. He says, "That's impossible, no one would have said Sunday because the computer couldn't take reservations for Sunday since we were closed". I say, "I didn't say I made a reservation I said I was told I could come in on Sunday". Again he says, "That's not possible". I then say, "Look... I'm not an idiot I know what I was told". At this point I'm starting to get really po'ed at the guy.  He then says, "When you got here wasn't there a sign on the gate that said CLOSED?? That's because we were CLOSED yet you still dropped your dog off so you have to pay the fee". I then reiterate to Kevin exactly how much business I'm going to be giving him in the future and how I don't feel that I was wrong in what I did since I was told it was okay to bring my dog in. Then Kevin says, "Well I can't take the fee out of the computer". OH BROTHER! Computers are scary! I don't understand their mystical ways! You got me there Kevin, you own the joint but you can't take a price out of the computer?? PLEASE! I say nothing and finally Kevin gives and says.... "Okay I'll let the fee go this time. I'll take it out of HER paycheck instead". I then said, "Whatever you have to do!". What a colossal jerk. He's going to take a measly $25 out of some poor college girl's paycheck. I assume he was trying to bluff me out so I wasn't gonna buy his crap but if he really does that then what a @#^$!  I wouldn't go back except for the fact that it's the only good place in Santa Cruz. It's actually a nice facility and the girls that work there are very very cool. It's just the owner that's bugs me. My friend Johnny said that maybe next time instead of taking the money out of some girl's check he could just go out back and beat one of the dogs to punish me for not paying my fee. Har har!

      Today I came home to find cat barf all over my new couch. Then as I was stripping off the couch covers to take them to the dry cleaner I came upon the dog who had just finished eating the large pile of cat barf on the floor. Ugh. I can't imagine how people are single parents. Being a single pet parent is hard enough sometimes.    I'm starting to plan my next trip to Paris. I was hesistant about going back to Paris versus going somewhere else but since I'm taking French and I'd like to relax a bit on my next big vacation it seems like the logical choice. I've already done most of the touristy stuff so this time around I can spend more time just hanging out in the city. It looks like two of my girl friends are going to be able to go next year (I hope!) so that will be really fun. We're planning on renting an apartment this time around which will save us a lot of money.  Other than that, nothing really new to report. I'm going to Chemical Brothers tomorrow night. That should be fun, even though I'm lazy and hate going out on a work night. I feel like so little of my time is my own so I relish the alone moments I get at home. Also I'm not sure when going to dinner and a movie became more fun then going out and party'ing all the time. The last time I went out and partied a bunch I thought I was going to die from alcohol poisoning the next day. I think I'm getting too old to party that hard. On that note, I should get my beauty rest.

      Tonight I had dinner in Berkeley with an old friend from sfnet. It was great to see him and reconnect with someone I'd know years ago. He'd just gotten back to town and had just been through a very traumatic breakup to someone he'd been engaged to. I can imagine how painful it must be but I can't say anything that bad has every happened to me. Don't get me wrong... PLENTY of bad relationships have happened to me and plenty of bad things have happened in them. But I can't say I was ever engaged to someone who left me. That's got to be the worst feeling in the world.   He seemed to be holding it together pretty well though and I have high hopes that he'll be doing just fine in the future. How long, I don't know.... and even though I don't believe in God or any of that type of stuff I still think things happen for a reason. What that reason is may not be evident at the time but there's a reason! Okay so that's probably a pretty silly thing to believe in but it gets me through the day and so far it hasn't been a bad theory. Works for me so I'm keeping it.   Halloween is coming up here pretty quick and I picked out a Costume I want to rent from the  Costume Bank . It's a little bo peep costume. I have to try and get there early on Friday to get it before someone else does since they don't start renting them until then. I'm not sure how I feel about dressing up this year, seems like a hassle. If I'm going to go as Bo Peep though I have to make Toby a sheep costume for our work costume party. That would be perfect. I doubt they'll let him into the cafeteria though since they don't let dogs in there.    I'm also not sure what I'm doing on Halloween. There's a lot to do though. I got invited to a party that's being held by someone I knew on sfnet. I might go to that since the friend I mentioned above will be going so I'll know someone else there at least. Also there's a play in Berkeley that my friend Amrah is inviting folks to go to that may be fun as well. I have some time to think about it at least.   This week another old friend that I've known for 13 years is coming up from SoCal for the weekend. She'll be arriving Thursday night so I'll be heading down to Santa Cruz to have dinner with her and then we'll both be staying over at Chris' house. Then on Friday I may hook up with another old friend from 12 years ago in SF. It will be great to see everyone! The key thing though is to try and maintain these friendships and not let years and years go by before I see people again. Its tough with people scattered all over the place but I know I've sure missed everyone.

      The other day I was on friendster and I saw a bulletin board message from my friend Theo. He wanted to know if anyone else was interested in going to New Orleans with him, his friends Shawn, Danae and Mark. The catch was though that you had to buy your plane ticket by Midnight that night to get the special $99 each way deal.   Year before last I was invited to go on this trip in May. I did the usual "Oh I dunno if I can afford it" thing and never went. This year has been my year of just going for it. For example I've been wanting to go back to London and to Paris for years and years and this year I finally did it. So... I got ahold of Theo, talked my friend Virginia into going with and sharing a room and we bought our tickets!  So I'll be heading to the Big Easy for the first time on November 12th for four days! I can't wait. This is going to be such a great trip. Along the lines of the group trips I used to take when I went to Viva Las Vegas all the times I did. Party! I've been wanting to go to New Orleans for the last ten plus years so I'm really excited. I'm glad my friend Virginia is going as well since she never really gets the chance to cut loose, so this will be good for her.   I have my home page on my browser set to My Yahoo. I have a weather module that's been on this page for a very long time. In this module I list the places I generally go to, like, Richmond, Virginia or Seattle, Washington. Then I list all the local cities and lastly I list places I want to go. Namely London, Paris and New Orleans. This has really been my year as far as realizing my travel dreams. The key thing though is to keep it up. Like next year, I'm going back to Paris. I still want to go to Italy at some point and back to New York as well. I'm dying to go on a lazy cruise to the bahamas or something. I wish I was rich. All I'd do is jet around the world.  I miss traveling sometimes. I grew up all over the world, so I miss seeing some of the exotic things I used to see day to day. I miss incredible sunsets and tropical beaches. I miss green rainforests and amazing waterfalls. I miss exotic animals and cultures. Hrm, I should to go Thailand one of these days too. So much to see!

Why doesn't this tour through here?   Visit  the Body Worlds site!   See   selected works from the exhibition!   Read  about the controversy over including an ape in the exhibition!  Oh and while you're at it, you might as well take a gander at this fun article: " Man Kills Friend, Drinks Blood ".  Enjoy!

As opposed to our amateur photos. Truly bums me out. Plus it wasn't hot as hades when they went. Some people are lucky. Things just go smoothly for them. Then you have people like me where some things seem to be a real uphill battle.

      Congratulations to my friend Amrah for winning First Place in the  September Photo Contest  at  nerve.com . A $500 prize to her and her friend Liz. Great photo too!  I'm in the midst of reading  Urban Tribes . So far so good. I'm hoping I find some kind of enlightenment from it or something. In the meantime I plan on renewing some old friendships and going that route for awhile. I miss my friends. Relationships tend to derail you a bit when it comes to hanging out with your friends on a regular basis. I found this  Q&A with the author Ethan Watters  on nerve.com. They even talk to him about  Friendster  in it.   About Friendster.... I'm so fed up with it. I'm hoping all my friends make the switch over to  tribe.net . At tribe the mail isn' t slow and the mail count isn't inaccurate. It doesn't lose the email you just wrote and show you bulletin board postings from people ONLY in your friend list. You get to see posts from people within different degrees of you as you choose. Which in my opinion is a better way to get to know your friends, friends and so on. Also you can join "tribes" or community groups of people with similar interests where you can exchange recipes or talk about music or whatever else floats your boat. It's worth checking out at least.   Anyway, I've been up many a late night the last couple of weeks. Bad. I also can't decide if I'm going to dress up for Halloween this year. I haven't in years and I feel like it would be fun if I did but I can't think of anything. I thought about going as one of the Slytherin Students from Harry Potter but thats been done a million times. Although what costume HASN'T been done a million times? I don't know, what do you think? Prom Queen? Slytherin? Disco Chick? Actually I'd like to do the disco thing but I can't seem to find a really cool dress. I saw one online but it was already sold.  Send me your suggestions  for costumes if you have any. Also send me your suggestions for places to get a cool costume besides ebay. Thanks!

      As my friend Dave said, "It's like watching a bad Saturday Night Live Skit". What's making me nuts right now is that none of my friends voted yes on the recall and none of them voted for Arnold, and none of their friends voted that way and so on... yet the recall and Arnold still won! UGH! Not that Gray Davis was a great Governor or anything but come on people! We now have an ACTOR as Governor of California! A Republican actor! (Anyone remember Ronald Reagan? HELLOOO?) A non gay marriage supporting ACTOR. A female groping, nazi supporting, AUSTRIAN ACTOR!  I'm so mad and bitter right now I can't stand it.

      As a follow up to my last entry I present to you my friend Amrah's " Dating Tips ". Bear in mind some of this is meant to be humorous but there's a basic underlying message here as well.   Also while you're there be sure to check out her rant about the response she got on her Dating Tips in  her confessional . Look for the 8/29/03 entry. Good stuff.

      So I have this friend, who's name I won't mention, who dates a lot of women in the bay area. So one time he was dating this woman for awhile who was okay but not really what he was looking for. They had fun together though I guess. I can't recall how long he said they dated but at some point he decided that he just wasn't really into her that much. This is of course after all the fooling around etc. So one day he stops returning her calls... and then she stops calling. He told me that it was cool of her to get the hint right away and not continue to push the envelope by calling.   I have another friend, a girl who's name I won't mention also, who dated a guy she met online for about 6 weeks, I believe. Then one day he stopped returning her calls. She kept trying to get ahold of him though and she eventually did. I think the gist of what he told her at that point was that he figured she would have gotten the message that he didn't want to see her anymore by the fact that he hadn't bothered to call her.  I think 9 out of 10 guys in the bay area want one thing, S-E-X. A girl friend of a friend has a rule where she won't go all the way with a guy until after 90 days. I think she has a 30 day and 60 day rule as well but I'm forgetting it right now. Now this is smart in my opinion. What better way to weed a player out then to make him wait 90 days for it. Of course in this day and age women are just as capable of loving and leaving as men are but I think it's a bit harder. I know I tend to get attached sometimes even when I don't want to or I know I shouldn't. Then again I've always loved a challenge.  What I don't get is why can't men just say, "look it was fun but I'm not interested" or just a plain old "hey, I'm not interested". I know men are afraid women are going to freak out on them but some contact would be nice, even a polite email would do. Although a brush off email, letter or phone call can suck too. Take the friend I mentioned in my first story... he went out with a girl for 6 months and fearing how much she would freak out on him proceeded to break up with her by mailing her a letter! He dropped her off with a bye see you later then went home, wrote a letter, mailed it to her and never talked to her again. I'm sure he's going to kill me for writing all this in my blog but hey, I didn't mention any names.  Another guy I knew that played women would excuse his behavior by saying that women in SF had "issues" so therefore they weren't worth having relationships with. My girl friend's retort to that was, "Who do you think caused us to have issues in the first place?!". I've had my own fair share of experiences with men like this. I liked a certain guy once a couple of years ago who stated often that he did not like to date and preferred to remain alone. Of course after we hooked up I found out he was dating up to two other women and none of them knew about each other. Ugh. I could go on forever with stories like this, but I think you get the point.   My friend Jenn recommended a book on  her blog  the other day that I've ordered from Amazon. It's called,  Urban Tribes . Here's a brief caption: "If you're between 25 and 39, single and a college-educated city dweller, you have been identified by the U.S. Census Bureau as one of the fastest-growing groups in America – the "never marrieds". Upon realizing he and his friends had been labeled, Watters set out to investigate, finding that to fill the gap of time young people spend in between families, they have created a new type of community: urban tribes."  I'll be sure to post my thoughts on it once I've read it. Of course I have to finish reading the latest  Harry Potter  first. :)

      I've been making a really horrifying discovery about myself over the last two months. I no longer like to shop in the Juniors section. Okay so I don't ALWAYS shop in the Juniors section but my staple clothes usually come from there. If I've had to pick up a nice dress I'd go splurge at  Betsey Johnson  or something.   I always looked at the nice pricey clothes online but I never seriously considered purchasing any of it. The closest I came to overspending was getting my jeans at  Lucky Brand  which isn't particularly cheap. Anyway I was at Nordstrom's and Macy's recently and I actually spent the whole time shopping on the "adult" floor. It was great too. I've realized over the years that you get what you pay for. Especially when it comes to clothes. You want something to fit well and make you look fabulous even when you're not so fabulous? You gotta pay for it. I just wish I had more money!  This brings me to another realization. It's time to clean out my closet. Sell those dresses I never wear. It's hard to sell clothes whether online on  ebay  or at a second hand shop. Just seems like no one's buying cause no one has a job. Recently I gave away an entire bag of clothes I had slated to sell at a thrift shop because I knew I couldn't get rid of it any other way and I was sick of it being in my car. Good sellable stuff too. It just wasn't worth going back to the thrift store again and again until they bought it all, or it was in season or whatever. Time is money and the money I'd have gotten from that was definitely not worth my time. My Betsey dresses and other such items should fetch a decent price I hope. Although you can get Betsey stuff pretty cheap on Ebay. Maybe if I had a big walk in closet this wouldn't be an issue. My closet space is very limited though.  So the biggest problem with adult shopping is finding places that carry enough of the brand name stuff you're looking for. Nordstrom's for example carries Paper, Denim and Cloth Jeans as well as  Seven for all Mankind  and  Miss Sixty . BUT, they don't carry a wide enough variety of these items. They carry all the light faded wash jeans but none of the dark jeans. What's up with people not wanting dark jeans? Anyway, that means probably having to go up to SF which is a pain in the ass.   I don't know if you can tell but I think I might be a bit depressed or bored or something hence the new fixation on image. Plus I've spent the last two years not really caring and not going out. It's time to get out more and start looking good. Oh and I saw some really cute dresses at  Bebe  yesterday. A store I usually never go to but they have some cute stylish dresses there. I was impressed. I think I need to make a lot more money than I'm making. No, I know I need to make more money. Or marry rich or something. Oh wait, I'm never getting married, I'm supposed to die alone with too many pets. That's right. Silly me.

      Well I should have posted my N'awlins report sooner but I've been lazy and burnt out from my trip. I left last Wednesday and got back Saturday night. I had a blast though!   Some highlights:   Cheap  hotel  in a historic old house right on the edge of the french quarter with a pool and a hot tub  Taking an evening  ghost/vampire tour  of the French Quarter with a funny/quirky british  tour guide named &quot;Wheezy&quot;  Taking a daytime cemetary/voodoo tour with the same funny/quirky tour guide (I HIGHLY recommend taking both of these tours, in particular you should ask for Wheezy aka Louise Johnson if you want to have a truly excellent experience) Royal Street.... so cute, lovely antique and art stores, wonderful architecture Eating tons of raw Oysters which cost hardly anything there Eating spicy crawfish Eating Alligator and Rabbit at  Coops,  which both, of course... tasted like chicken Cafe au Lait and Beignets at  Cafe du Monde  80's night at the 735 club on Bourbon Street Watching my straight friend Theo participate in a drag queen run beefcake contest at a gay club called Oz on Bourbon street Hanging out with a fun group of 6 other people, most of whom I hadn't met but once before this trip Taking a  Steamboat  ride on the Mississippi Being super drunk and winding up two nights in a row at  Lafitte's  sitting at the piano bar and singing along to classic tunes Touring the beautiful houses in the Garden District Playing blackjack at Harrah's and winning money! Eating home made Red Beans and Rice at Sheila's house  Some lowlights:   The smell, peeyew! The streets smelled bad there. Especially the closer to Bourbon street you got. Yuck! Fermented beer, garbage, you name it.... gross  Packing for warm tropical weather and having two decently warm days with two freezing cold days and no jacket Total lack of sleep Horrible hangover Bourbon Street is primarily UGLY, neon lights, strip clubs, people trying to entice you in for 3 for 1 drink nights, yucky smell... not unlike sodom and gomorrah Okay shoot me but a  Mufaletta  did NOT look appetizing to me whatsover even with the ambiance of a cute deli like Luigi's Too many bead, mask, t-shirt, plastic alligator shops all over the quarter  Overall I'd LOVE to go back. I was so glad to go with the group that I did. It was a great trip. I feel like I'm forgetting some more high/low points but I'll add them if I think of them. Here are a few photos from the trip. I had to include the photo of my friend Theo and I looking cool, windswept and evil on a balcony overlooking Bourbon Street. And no, I did not show my boobs for beads. I just made Theo go get them for me. :)   The other two photos are in front of the voodoo shop on Bourbon Street and in the Garden District in front of the largest mansion in the neighborhood. Seven of us went so we're only missing two folks from that bottom pic. We got a great pic of all of us at the steamboat that I'll post later.

         Here's some photos from Halloween for your amusement. On the left you have a pic of Toby taken by a co-worker. He's being held by my co-worker's wife. This is after I let him out of the very hot sheep costume he was in. On the right you have a photo of me as Little Bo Peep and there's Toby the sheep! Doesn't he look utterly humiliated? He was a real hit at work though! The high waistline on that dress made me look particularly fat I think. Next year I'm going as something more evil. This year was a little too cutsey for me. Oh that's right, next year I'm going as Princess Leia on Endor with her ewok. Toby will make the PERFECT ewok, considering he looks exactly like one.

      Well I just spent the last week and a half in Virginia for my annual Xmas trip to visit my Dad and Stepmom. I didn't see my Stepbrother since he was off in Egypt with his girlfriend this year. I got back Friday and spent the last couple of days in Santa Cruz. I can't believe it's almost New Years. I know it's cliche but time really does go faster and faster the older you get.   Virginia was the same as it always is, except this time around Richmond got two brand new outdoor malls. They actually have a Nordstrom in town as well as quite a few other major stores. It was definitely nice to see that the town is finally getting some decent shopping. I actually went out on the town this time around too. I went out with a neighbor son's who was in town from Orgeon and totally bored out of his mind. We went to a couple of bars downtown and hung out. The nightlife in Virignia is pretty slim pickings. We met some girls while we were out that pretty much said the same thing. I think if I lived in that town I would have to have a good social circle and take lots of trips to New York or something otherwise I'd go insane.  My dad keeps telling me that he wishes we lived closer together. Which means to me that it would be cool for him if I lived there. The only thing is I love living in California. I really do. Even the thought of moving to Seattle (potentially for job reasons, who knows) kind of freaks me out. I would probably only really consider moving to Europe or something. I love it here though, it's hard to imagine living anywhere else. Although there may come a time when I have to. It's impossible to own anything here without a dual income or a very large income. I can't see myself ever owning property here on my own and at this point I'm still on my own and my prospects of not being on my own are not looking great at this point in my life. Blah blah blah same old story!  Anyway, it's great to be back. Happy Holidays!

      So this a-hole on ebay scammed my dad. We complained he jerked us around and then finally we had to complain to ebay and paypal. We then left negative feedback and filed a fraud alert. What does this guy do? Leave fake negative feedback on my dad's account then sends me fake threatening emails. What a moron! Like he knows anything about me other than whats on this blog, whoopity doo! He wasn't even creative enough to create a fake email address somewhere other than on yahoo which is where he has his email address. Oh and he keeps spamming me on paypal with 1.00 payments in 3's... weirdo, psycho, freako!

      I've finally finished knitting my scarf and thought I'd share a couple of photos I took tonight. I used PolarSpun Yarn to get that fleecy fuzzy look. I was supposed to finish the cell phone cover first and I was pretty close to being done but I got sidetracked on wanting a long skinny scarf before the cold scarf wearing weather went away so a little over a week ago I went out and got yarn for this project and voila! New scarf!  I still haven't figured out how to get my camera to take photos that aren't so glaringly bright. So in the photo of Toby the scarf definitely looks day-glo but rest assured its only pink, white and hot pink... not too hot though. Shade your eyes, it hurts to look at it! (Any  Sex and the City  Fans reading this? Notice the bedspread in photo no. 2. That's the bedspread Carrie has in her apartment! It's called  Bamboo Flowers by Calvin Klein )            And here are the hammie pics I promised in an earlier post. The first one is of Chris and Lemmi when he first got them. Chris hates this picture of himself so I had to cut it in half. :P The next two are of the Hamster cage he put together for them and of one of the hamsters in his new bed.

      I first saw Lemmi and Winks at a Petco in Mountain View. Lemmi ran up to the window and put his little paw on the window as if to say Hello! I was smitten from there on out. Chris and I came back the next day and he adopted both of them. He built them a pretty spectacular space themed cage. They were little dwarf hamsters so they had some trouble climbing the tubes but overall they loved it.   Having the two of them was hours of entertainment, as they would do silly things to each other like sit on each others heads, bite each others tummys and squeek loudly as they got into little pissy fights. Chris even sang their own little hamster song to them. Lemmi passed away over Christmas, we still don't know why. He seemed so spunky and healthy and he was by far the nicest one. He never bit us and was always happy and bright eyed. He probably died from old age since they both seemed older when we got them and hamsters don't live long as it is.  Today Winks (the grumpy one) passed on... he was doing poorly... one eye was squinty, he had a bad case of mites, and one little paw had very long nails on it. He also drank too much water, much more than necessary for a hamster his size. I took him to the vet and learned that he had an upper respiratory infection and most likely kidney failure. We decided to have him put to sleep. I accompanied him to the "back room" where he was put in a little plastic box and they gassed him to sleep. They then took him out of the box and injected something into his heart. It killed him instantly. It was the saddest thing I've seen in a very long time. I still get choked up thinking about it.  RIP Little Guys!  (I'll post some pics later)

      I got a new digital camera finally. A Canon S400 4 megapixel jobbie. I like it a lot. I also got a Canon i900D Photo Printer but for some lame reason they don't include a USB cable! I was able to print a photo directly from the memory card to the printer but not from my PC. So I had to settle for taking a quick shot of the dog and printing it out. All I can say is I can't believe I never got a photo printer before now. Who needs film ever again!? The photo came out perfectly. PERFECTLY! I printed it on Glossy Photo Pro paper and it's amazing!  Okay enough of that. I've started my first knitting project and I took a photo of it. No flash in some weird lighting. I'm the worst photographer in the world so please don't blame the camera. It's not its fault.       Yes people, it's a cell phone cover. Well it's the beginnings of one. Small project so I hope I will be done sooner than later. I'm proud that I just learned how to knit with multiple colors but what a total nightmare it is. Ah well at least when I'm done my phone will have a nice new cover or else Chris' hamster will have a new sweater (he keeps saying I'm knitting a hamster sweater, heh).

      I'm addicted to  The Sims Online . That's all I do these evenings. It's not that exciting of a game per se, but it's fun! I have all the other regular sims games too. I guess I love building things. It's like playing house or grocery store owner when you were a kid. Same idea.  I picked up a new knitting book tonight. It's called  Stitch 'N Bitch: The Knitter's Handbook . I taught myself how to knit a few years back and I was making a scarf for an ex, then we split up and I kept knitting the scarf out of depression. The scarf is pretty long now but I don't want to finish it. Instead I'd like to do something cool I found in this book like make a cell phone cover or a nice keyhole scarf. The only problem is it all looks a lot harder than I remember it being. Heh. Plus, knitting isn't easy if you're not a seasoned pro, you wind up having to pull out stitches and redo them. It takes up a lot of your time when you're first getting the hang of it. Tomorrow I'll go pick up some new needles and some yarn and a few other needed supplies... Maybe I can knit AND play The Sims Online at the same time! :P  Did I mention by the way that I got a new  Slow Cooker  for Christmas? It's my new favorite thing. I've made a whole stewed chicken and pork chops with mushroom sauce so far. Tomorrow night I'll have Swiss Steak. It's so easy to use. I love it! Why doesn't everyone make food in slow cookers? What a time saver! I even wrote a glowing review about it on  Amazon . Just look for  Violet02's review  and give me a helpful vote if you're so inclined.

      Ahh the first post of the new year. I haven't even been blogging a whole year yet. New Year's eve was fun this year. My friend Shawn had a big party at his new loft/office space in SF. It went all night long and I had a great time!  One thing I'm going to do this new year is fix up my blog. Starting now. So from now on you can click on the thumbnails to view the photos, instead of me posting the whole photo on here thereby increasing people's load time.   Here's a photo of Libby, Shawn, Myself and Angela at the party:      Okay now for my New Year's Resolutions (drum roll please):  Go to the gym and do the  Power of 10 , and try to stick with it for as long as possible (at least 6 weeks to gauge results)  Lose 5-10lbs of fat  Save more, Spend Less  Clean up my credit report  Not owe the IRS 2004 taxes  Eat out less, Cook at home more  Take my dog for more/longer walks  Start knitting again and make myself a scarf  Fix up my website and blog  Meet new people  Read more, spend less time zoned out on the computer  Hang pictures in my apartment  Continue taking French and really apply myself  Travel, travel, travel  Stop sweating the small stuff  Find my work drive again  Try to cut out almost all sugar and eat less carbs (tough one)  Okay that's for starters. Let's see if I can do that much. I would say take Yoga and learn to sew but with that list above and the dog training classes I have to go to this year I doubt I'll pull it all off.  Let's just say those are my "stretch goals". I wish I was one of those driven go go go maniac types. I'm just way too lazy.

      It's my mission to move this sucker over to movable type. I just have to motivate myself to do it. MOTIVATE! I've been working mad, crazy hours at work the last week plus. I even had to come in on a Saturday, *gasp*! Okay honestly, this is NOTHING compared to when I worked at a startup so I can't really do the poor me thing here. At least I'm getting work done. This is a good thing. The more work I do the more accomplished I feel and the more deserving of a vacation I think am. Or so I say.  Anyways, nothing new on my front other than work, cleaning the heck out of my house and mourning the end of Sex and the City. I'm still planning on going to Paris in June. Looks like a friend is going to be able to meet me there which is fabulous. My insominia has been getting the better of me for months now so I finally called my doctor for another prescription of Ambien, which hasn't worked. They had to double my dose. If that doesn't work then who the heck knows what my problem is. I don't even drink caffeine!  Yes yes boring post. Just posting to let people know I'm still alive.

      I found  this link  via  Edna Million's Blog  and the  Mommy Blog . It's frickin' hiliarious! Just in case the the cragistlist post expires I'm copying and pasting it here for your reading enjoyment. I'll never look at a spatula the same again. :)   RAVE: The Spatula Saga has got to go on Best of...    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to: anon-23392921@craigslist.org Date: Thu Jan 29 17:01:05 2004    This Spatula Saga is the funniest thing ever... but how ever will we log it for posterity onto Best of Craigslist? I don't think anybody here wants to vote for every single entry.  Therefore, I present a 'highlights' reel of sorts... vote away!  It all started with this poor girl's story -- unfortunately, she's probably dead serious:   My Boyfriend is Really Mean to Me  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 9:50AM PST Whenever I make my boyfriend mad (which is a lot), he hits me. Specifically, he hits me on the nose. With a spatula. I don't know how it all started, but the first time I really remember it, we were hanging around the store his parents own, and he was staring at me angrily and then he said, "You know what really bugs me about you?" and I said, "No...what?" and he said "The way you chew your gum." I thought that was rude, so I told him so, and he got up and left. He came back a couple of minutes later and without any warning hit me in the nose with a spatula he got from the back of the store.  I was in shock, being that no boyfriend has ever hit me for any reason, much less for the way I chew gum. He eventually apologized and blamed it on the fact that he was tired. I let it go (I know, I shouldn't have). Ever since then, every time he is "tired" or "hungry" or "stressed", if I do any little thing, he gets pissed and hits me with the spatula. I don't know why he uses a spatula, but that's what he does. He always has it with him now. The littlest things piss him off - the way I chew, the way I laugh, if I ask for sex too much, if I don't let him take a nap... and every time he gets mad, it's the spatula for me. It makes me feel like a puppy getting hit in the nose with a newspaper.   He always apologizes and says he will stop and for me to please give him another chance, and he will do good for awhile and then he smacks me again. I'm not really looking for advice, I'm just wondering if any other guys smack their girfriends with spatulas. Or did I find the only freak in America? Thanks.     Of course, the clever Craigslist community just could not let this one go unnoticed:   re: My boyfriend is really mean to me  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 9:59AM PST Please tell me you aren't serious. Please tell me that you would never let a man disrespect you that way. He obviously looks at you like a pet. How could you let that happen? A spatula? My god. How old are you? What happened to you that you would tolerate this??? A fucking spatula. Holy shit.   your boyfriend isn't nice to you  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 10:24AM PST The only time being hit by a spatula is ok is when it's during sex and he's smacking your ass with it. Get a grip you dumb, dumb person.   My boyfriend is mean to me too!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 10:37AM PST Mine doesn't hit me with a spatula though. His choice of kitchen utensil is an immersion blender. When he is really pissed he will plug it in and poke me in the nose. Damn that smarts! After that I be good.   What is all this spatula nonsense??  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 1:23PM PST Don't women have an ounce of sense anymore?? Never will a spatula cross my nose. That is so ridiculous, I want to smack that girl with a spatula myself. Who allows someone to do that? You are just truly dumb. You'd think that spatula would have smacked some sense into you by now. WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE HIT WITH SPATULAS. Or anything for that matter. Geez people. I'm appalled.    And as the next posters prove, it isn't called RANTS and raves for nothing...    HEY SPATULA GIRL, i love you  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 10:52AM PST i have been searching my entire life for a girl that would LET me beat the shit outta her with anything, i personally have never hit a girl, or guy for that matter, but only because i find it senseless and morally wrong. but if i could find a girl that would not only tolerate it but enjoy it enough to brag about it to strangers, fuck me, i'm in love course dating me might be a little too much for your poor pathetic ass, cuz if i'm gonna hit anyone with anything it wouldnt be a little bitty wooden spoon, i'd break a fucking shovel over your head and bury your stupid ass with it  so do the world and favor, cut off his dick, force feed it to him with the spatula and promise us you will never ever breed.  thanks, call me   re: mean Spatula-wielding boyfriend  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 10:52AM PST I'm going to have to agree with all the guys on this one....your boyfriend is trying to help you, and you should thank him. Most men would have moved on after you started snapping your gum, but your man chose to stick it out and train you in the right ways. It's out of love that he is disciplining you. Women are like dogs, the quickest way for them to learn something is with a little swat. We aren't talking abuse here, just a smack to get their attention and wake them up to the correct behavior. A man that didn't really love you wouldn't take the time to use the spatula. He is showing you that he is in for the long haul. Go give him a thank you blow job right now and let him know how much you appreciate his teaching. I don't use a spatula, I use an electrical cord, but a spatula is a good idea. Thanks for the hint Spatula Guy.   RE: My boyfriend is really mean to me  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 10:56AM PST uhhmm...what store do his parents own? maybe I could meet you there some time. me and him could have a spatula fight. I'll have him wimpering and pissing the floor before you can say "honey pancakes are done".   Spare the Spatula...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 11:00AM PST and spoil the girlfriend, I say.    One brave poster claims to actually BE the spatula-wielding fiend...    RE: My boyfriend is so mean (I'M THE BOYFRIEND)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 11:30AM PST Okay honey, its on. When I get home, I'm going to empty the fucking utensil drawer. I cannot believe you told people about the spatula. I am so pissed.   I smack her with a spatula. It's funny. She "claims" she hates it, but she knows that is the only way to keep her in check. She smacks her gums like she's 80. So fucking annoying. I smack her, and it keeps her in check.   I kinda like it. Im not a control freak, but truly, she needs the help.   Besides I don't think people on Craig's List should even give a shit. If I want to smack her, I will. So, tough guys, come on, send me the hardass emails now. Fuck you. I will do what I want. And she will continue to stay with me. Spatula or not.     ... While others just get inspired    Spatulas - Cool! or not?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 12:39PM PST Thanks for the "spatula" tip! I went home and used this same technique on my wife. I just knew it was the thing to do! This is going to solve all my problems!   At least that's what I thought. However, I have a much different perspective now that I'm in the hospital having the spatula removed from my ass!!!!     Then, in a weird non-sequiter that can only be described as 'craigslist-ian,' someone entwines an entirely different thread to the discussion, bringing the overall commentary to dizzingly new and creative heights:    RE-Should I poo on my girlfriend?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 1:31PM PST Yes you should. Women love being pooped on. After you poop on her, flip the poop over with your spatula, then hit her on the nose with it. Then rub her nose in your poop. This is the true way to a woman's heart. Do this on Valentine's Day and you're guaranteed to get a blow job. Let us know how it all turns out!     And what kind of day would it be on craiglist if someone didn't throw the race card in?   Choke on this, Honkies  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 2:39PM PST Are you people for real? Should you poo on your girlfriend? Spatulas? Parking Nazis? You are a bunch of certified lunatics, every last one of you. This is my first time on here, and as a proud black woman, I can't  believe my eyes. You TRY to shit on me boy, your dick will be REMOVED. Hit me in the nose with a spatula? I will flip your stupid ass with the spatula and jam it down your throat. I know a bunch of crackas are  writing this ridiculous shit. Y'all are a bunch of zip damn fools.      And finally, after MANY, MANY comments on the 'zip damn fools' comment, one intelligent poster sums it up quite nicely:    Holding My Sides.............  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: 2004-01-29, 3:54PM PST For the love of God, people, STOP IT!!! I can't stop laughing at all this spatula/poo/zip damn fool nonsense............  This has to be one of the funniest days on R&R ever.     ... Yes, it was.

      Now  this  is an interesting website. I did a search for it after I read that  Madonna  is going to make a movie out of it. Definitely an interesting read. You'll unfortunately need  Real Player  to watch the movie clips. It might make a pretty cool movie. Sounded like a crappy experiment to be in for only $15 a day. Although that was probably good money in 1971. Check it out.  On another note, before I forget, I saw  Chris Isaak  yesterday (Sunday) on Haight Street. I was on my way to Cha Cha Cha to meet everyone on my way back from getting more shoes when I got stuck behind this slow guy and this tall girl. He turned and said something like, "You better watch it young lady or I'll slap the (something or another) right out of you!" Or something to that effect. I was like, "What the?" Then I saw who it was, and realized he was just trying to be amusing. He looked shorter in person, but he definitely has a really distinctive face and pretty eyes. Anyways it was a cool star sighting. Of course having rockabilly friends, I know people that know him or knew his ex or something so it's only a minor star encounter I guess. Still kinda cool! Something to mention.  I'm THIS close to finishing knitting my cat bed. I'll post photos tomorrow of where I'm at.

      Okay here's something personal. My boyfriend of 2 plus years and I broke up on Friday. I did the breaking up and now he never wants to talk to me again due to the way I did it. I can understand him being mad but I'm not sure why we can't still be friends. I guess it's too long and complicated to go into here but all I can say is that I'm really sorry that he feels like that and I hope that one day he'll want to try and work out the friend thing.  Suffice to say it's been a bit of a bummer of a weekend. Sucks to lose a friend, someone you've spent the last couple years talking to almost every day. I'm definitely sad about that. On the other hand I'm looking forward to the change and to moving on with my life in other ways. Another friend of mine got dumped by her boyfriend Saturday night. He was in love with her and she wasn't in love with him so he needed to move on. She's sad but it was for the best.   Today (Sunday) a bunch of us went to Golden Gate Park to try and have a picnic. I blame Theo for not checking the weather report first because it totally rained. We wound up reconvening on Haight Street though and I bought 2 pairs of boots and a cute pair of shoes. Yay shoes! We also all went and ate at Cha Cha Cha which was fabulous. I love that place! It was nice to hang out with a bunch of friends even if the weather was crappy. The only lame part was when I got home my tall boots had a weird wrinkle in the leather that I don't like. I'd live with it except when I looked at the other boots I got I realized that they put one type of textured leather in with another. So the style is the same but they don't match! This totally pisses me off because now I have to go all the way back to Haight St. to exchange them. They were the last size left too so they better have the right damn mates at the store!! UGH. I guess if that's the worst thing that could happen to me then I can't really complain too much. It's juts inconvenient and annoying. Particularly since stores on Haight tend to close early.  There's a big party coming up on March 5th that I'm looking forward to. It's a joint birthday party for about 3 people. Should be totally crazy. It's definitely going to be a BIG one. We're already getting ready for it and it's 3 weeks out! My friend Sabine is heading to NYC weekend after next. Turns out a newer friend Dave will be there the same weekend. They both told me to come along. I'm not sure if I want to buy a plane ticket and spend more money right now since I have some stuff I need to pay for. It's SO temping though! I'd LOVE to go.... I'll think about it I guess.  I have to work tomorrow. YUCK.

      I wish there was a local stitch n' bitch I could go to. I know there's one in Santa Cruz but it's a bit out of my way. I'd start one up but I'm flakey. I'm really getting interested in making things now though. It's so much fun.   Now that I'm done with my scarf I'm making the Princess Snowball Cat Bed from the Stitch n' Bitch book. I got some help reading the pattern from the  Rug and Yarn hut  message board on Yahoo groups. I think they're called  Knit n' Bitch . I find reading knitting patterns to be particularly hard. I'm glad I found some ladies to explain it to me.   There's a one day soap making class I'd like to go to as well. I used to make soap all the time but I encountered a few issues. 1) Why does the fragrance never last? 2) I suck at layering and embedding, very sloppy 3) Why does the color always fade out? I hope to take the class and find the answers to these questions myself! Making soap and fizzy bath balls is fun and easy though. The only problem is getting all the supplies and it can be a bit messy. I'm definitely enjoying knitting though.  I'm getting ready to get my plane ticket to Paris. I'm shooting for mid June this time. I'm not sure how long I'll be staying, probably 10-14 days. My friend/tattoo artist  Sunny  will be putting me up while I'm there which is so great. I'll save a lot of money doing that. More money to shop with! Theoretically. :) This time I'm taking my new digicam with me. Plus I can hopefully take a short course on how to take better photos.  You know it's amazing, my dad is a great photographer and can draw well. My mom could paint, sew, craft, sing, play guitar you name it. I can play piano and I suck at just about everything else artistic that there is. You'd think with that much artistic talent I could at least draw? Nope. Even my grandparents on BOTH sides were artistic! My dad's father tooled leather purses, paintings, belts etc. He played Steel Guitar and a bit of fiddle. My dad's mother paints, sews, quilts, knits, plays piano, organ etc. My mom's father was an amazing artist. My mom's mother was an amazing cook (okay I can't think of anything particularly artistic she did). My mom was an amazing cook for that matter.  Here's what I do besides play piano. Cook pretty well, not gourmet per se.  I can knit now, just okay though. Same goes for soap making, just okay. Um. I think I'm a left brainer. I work in a techie job and I'm not particularly creative unless it has to do with hair or makeup. Yup, all that creative talent and then there's me.  I'm the oddball.  Maybe I'm related to the mailman or something. heh. Oh wait, I can decorate funky. That needs work too. Maybe I need more "creative classes".

      I found this cool way to generate maps of places you've been from  Jenn's blog . I counted places I've only been in for hours or a day as well. Once I drove cross country from California to Michigan with my parens when I was very little. I don't remember the drive at all so who knows what states I was in then. I also drove from Michigan to Maine when I was a kid, which I also can't remember. I just included the states I could remember.      create your own visited country map  or  write about it on the open travel guide      create your own visited states map  or  write about it on the open travel guide

      So he used to be a big alcoholic lush. Who knew? Apparently it was a pretty well kept secret. While Rob Lowe was getting busted for videotaping sex with underage girls, Andrew was hiding his problem by being anonymous in New York City. I guess he started drinking when he was 12 years old and was hungover for most of his earlier movie career. Including being particularly hung over during Pretty in Pink. That explains the dark circles under his eyes throughout a lot of that film. Read the  recap of the show  on the 20/20 website. I have to add though that being an alcoholic lush isn't half as bad as what some of the other people from the Brat Pack did. Seriously.

      Okay, so I've been watching this "series long mini-series" (15 episodes) since the premiere a few weeks ago and it's pretty bad. Like hokey, corny bad (check out the  cast photo , egads). I like Stephen King... sometimes, except for when he does corny crap like this. Apparently this was a mini-series in Europe called  The Kingdom  by  Lars Von Trier .  I read the write up on the original and it sounds cool... although if they are using the exact storyline then I ruined it for myself but I doubt it since the new show has the hospital being built over a burned down mill which killed a bunch of children many years ago. Anyway, Stephen King decided to executive produce it and King-ify it. King-ify'ing is the corny trademarks he stamps all over his movies. Take The Stand for example. That was a pretty cool  book . The  mini-series  wasn't bad either except for the hokey show down in Vegas hand of God crapola. Whatever the hell that was. Plus the twangy guitar redneck thing it had going on. Oh... this sucker is set in some New England/Maine locale too. All his stuff is ALWAYS set in Maine.   Kingdom Hospital has an evil dead boy and a good dead girl with bad makeup jobs. A talking anteater with really sharp teeth. Some "writer" who got hit by a van and is messed up and in the hospital ( sound familiar?  ), the good doctors, the bad doctors, Diane Ladd as a psychic, a talking German Shephard, that has a German accent. Stop the hurting.   Two good things about the show:  1)  Andrew McCarthy , I can't believe I'm saying this. I hated him in  Pretty in Pink  and everything thereafter. I always thought there was something creepy and pre-pubescent about him. For some reason he seems to have "grown up" in his older age plus he looks pretty good and I like his character too. In fact I'll go so far as to say that I actually like him as an actor now.  2) The theme song is awesome. It's called  "Worry about you" by Ivy . Apparently it's a few years old but it's so cool. The only clip I could find of it was on the Tower Records site. I could only get the real audio clip to work.   My final verdict is check it out if you're desperate for tv entertainment and/or an Andrew McCarthy fan. At least watch the opening credits for the theme song, THEN change the channel. Also, read a  more descriptive review  on the show.  Hey I looked up  Andrew McCarthy  on IMDB and look what I read: "When the ending to Pretty in Pink (1986) was re-shot, all of the principal actors had to be called back. Andrew McCarthy had already lost a substantial amount of weight and shaved his head for a new role in a New York play called "The Boys of Winter." Although he wore an auburn wig, he's noticeably more gaunt in the reshot scenes."  Re-shot from what? Did Duckie get the girl in the original? Now I have to re-watch the ending.

      Day 5 of the evil cold. Day 4 of work missed. How much longer can this last??  Here's a report from a friend: "Mine started pretty much the same. Party at Twin Peaks was Friday night (likely exposure), Sunday Night sore throat/feeling blah... sinuses were fucked/tonsiles & throat sore thru the week, had a fever last a couple of days, phelgm-balls thru the week & weekend. Sinuses finally cleared up Sunday, worst of phlegm gone as well. Residual coughing for a few days afterwards.   It lasts for at least a week... residuals for a few days afterwards. At the tail end of the bug (day 6), my allergies were kicking in.   All that i was taking was a decongestant, drinking lots of green tea, ginger ale, and vitamins. I'm sure that some drugs to fight the sinus/throat infections might help. But its sounds like yours will last at least a few more days. My guess, by Tuesday you'll feel mostly normal. "  By next Tuesday?! AAAARRRGGGHH! I'm hoping the fact that I got antibiotics yesterday will push my recovery up a few days. I should have gotten them on Monday's doc visit but he seemed convinced it was just bad allergies/spring cold kinda thing. Dammit. That's what you get for going to the doctor too soon. Should have waited a day.  At this point it looks like I'm going to miss Day one of the  Horror Film Fest  in SF. I'm supposed to see  Undead  at 8:45pm tomorrow night. A zombie film too! Boo hoo. I doubt I'll be well enough by tomorrow. This sucks!

      Aren't I supposed to be getting better, not worse? Or do you have to get worse before you start feeling better? I'd like to be better by tomorrow or else I'll have to miss my second workout in a row and that will be so very wrong.  I got a new kind of cough drop tonight which has some sort of numbing agent and menthol in it. While it's not as bad as say, licking asphalt... it's still pretty bad.  Oh by the way, if you missed Ben Affleck and N.E.R.D. on SNL last Saturday night then so sorry for you! Yes yes, I know people think Ben Affleck sucks but goddamit he was extra funny! I watched his opening monologue more than once and laughed, a lot. That ones a keeper for sure.

      The doctor says it's allergies and some virus thing. Not strep. Nothing I can take for it but gargle with salt water etc. My throat feels like crap and my nose is runny. I got some horrible crappy orange flavored zinc lozenges. I can't stand lozenges. I hate menthol, lemon, cherry, powdery orange... all disgusting. You'd think in this day and age they'd have improved the taste of those things. I want them to taste like those chocolate  See's Candies Little Pops   (I ate two boxes of chocolate ones at xmas time) or how about  Jelly Belly  flavors (mmmm cotton candy)? How hard could it be!  My indoor thermometer is reading 79 degrees right now. It's probably because the dryer is running but nevertheless it's still damn hot in here! It was nice and hot out today too. A record high of 82 degrees. We're in the middle of a heat wave out here in sunny Northern California. Generally it's not nearly this hot in March. My cat was just sitting on my foot. I had to kick her off, it was so hot!  I'm excited that it's almost been a whole year since I started this blog and planted my garden. My pink azaleas are blooming and my fuschia azaleas are getting ready to bloom. My jasmine plant is also starting to bloom which is really cool. And the entry that started it all, my wilting lavendar, has recovered wonderfully. I'll post a photo of it soon.

      Sore throat... Swollen neck gland thinggies... I sure hope I'm not getting a cold! I don't have time for a cold right now! I don't have any herbal tea or zinc or anything either. Totally useless. I'll have to make a run to the store tomorrow. Hopefully it doesn't set in tomorrow and it's just a "you partied a little too much this weekend" sore throat. Ugh.   I did go out and get lots of gut stuffing (another ow) comfort food aka Ethiopian food at Zeni on Saratoga Ave. It's a bit of a drive but worth it! I've also learned that Toby goes crazy for Injera. He's actually stolen some right off my plate before. I've fed it to him last time I got take out and it doesn't upset his tummy at all. He'll even sit there and bark at the take out containers wanting more. What a kook. Dog after my own heart.  Also last Thursday Toby passed the  ten point  AKC  Canine Good Citizen  test and graduated from Intermediate Dog Training. He's going to get a gold embossed certificate from the AKC and I'm ordering him a special CGC tag for his collar. I'm so proud of him! He did such a great job. Yay! 3 out of 8 dogs failed the test. Toby's the best! Next up, Advanced Dog Training class.

      The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of it? A Death. What's that, a bonus?  I think the life cycle is all backwards. You should die first, get it out of the way. Then you live in an old age home. You get kicked out when you're too young, you get a gold watch and you go to work. You work forty years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. You do drugs, alcohol, you party, you get ready for high school.  You go to grade school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities.

      Check out the  100 Most Often Mispronounced Words  page. Did you know that the phrase "For all intensive purposes" is actually "For all intents and purposes"?? Or that "Chomp at the bit" is actually "Champ at the bit"?  I still can't pronounce barbiturate right.

      I like this photo of Livvy in her bed much better. The other photo makes her look much bigger than her bed. This one shows the actual size better.    urlLink     I've been trying to knit a Chenille scarf for my stepmom. I can't figure out the stupid beginner pattern!! I can knit a cat bed but I can't do a stupid scarf? Argh! I even called the  lion brand yarn  help line at one point for help on how to read what the heck K2B meant! Once I got that figured out it still didn't help me get past two rows on it. For some reason I either wind up with the wrong amount of stitches or big loops. Chenille is very hard to knit with. It's not stretchy at all and requires you to pull it tight to avoid causing loops. The worst part about this pattern is that it creates a kind of twisting pattern so I think I'm having trouble figuring out what to grab to knit the next row with. It's hard to explain. I'm not even sure if I'm knitting to the back and purling to the back of the stitches properly. If any knitters are out there reading this, help! I'm probably going to have to break down and take a knitting class at some point.  The pattern is called the One Skein Knitted Scarf. I can't get a direct link to it, but you can go to Free Knitting Patterns on the  lion brand yarn  website and navigate to Accesories > Chenille > One Skein Scarf.  Here's a copy of the pattern:  Skill Level:  Beginner   SIZE:  Approx 7" wide x 60" long.   Materials:  Lion Brand Chenille Thick and Quick, Art. #950 (100 yd. skeins): 1 skein in #108 Dusty Blue or the color of your choice. Knitting needles size 11 or size needed to obtain gauge.   Gauge:  2 sts = 1" in pat st. TO INSURE PROPER SIZE, BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR GAUGE.   Pattern Stitch:   Row 1 (WS):  K1b, p1b, *k1b, k 1, p1b, p 1*, rep from * to * once for scarf (or to last 4 sts for other widths), on last 4 sts, k1b, k 1, p1b, k1b.  Row 2 (RS):  K2b, p 1, p1B, *k 1, k1b,p 1, p1b*, rep from * to * once for scarf (or to last 2 sts for other widths), on last 2 sts, k2b.  Scarf:  Loosely cast on 14 sts. Work in pat st for 60". Bind off loosely in pat.  Here's a question, what does it mean to start on the WS vs. the RS first? I mean don't you always start with the RS? How do you start with the WS? Anyone?

      I list a few purses and I swear not moments after I listed this item the reserve was met and I was getting emails from interested buyers! It's definitely very very rare so I'm hoping to get a pretty penny for it. Particularly since I suck and let it sit in my closet for the last couple years never used. At least I left the dang tag on it!   Paul Frank "Missy and J" Purse   I listed another very cute Paul Frank purse and a pan am flight bag. I still have to list a PVC Ballgown and many pairs of jeans. Oh and a cute Bisou top. I'm so tired though... zzzzz. I'll get it to it in the next day or so!  Check out my auctions  if you're so inclined! I'm cleaning house this month! Time for the 5 million things I never do crap with to GO!

      Yes Sex and the City is over but the Sopranos are back! The season opener was so-so but check out the  cast photo  by Annie Leibovitz. It's really amazing. It reminds me of the Hell scenes in that crappy movie  What Dreams May Come  (The story was crappy but the movie had some great imagery in it). I'm looking forward to watching  Steve Buscemi  join the cast as Tony's fresh out of prison cousin. Last thing I saw him in was that Tim Burton film  Big Fish . There was one scene that made me laugh with him in it. Otherwise the movie as a whole was pretty slow.  On another note,  Dawn of the Dead  comes out this week. I love love love Zombie films. It'll probably suck but I'm trying to remain positive. The  original  is of course, the best zomie movie EVER. I'm kind of wondering how they're going to explain why the zombies in the new version can sprint while in the old version they could barely drag one leg. My friend Jeremy said this is terribly un-realistic since Zombie's OBVIOUSLY move slow since they're already dead, brainless and are falling apart. While I had to question the use of the world "realistic" in his statement I'd have to agree. Maybe we're becoming so de-sensitized to zombie movies that filmakers had to pick up the pace and make it even tougher for the non-zombie folk to survive. Although my other question would be if the zombies in this film are so agressive and quick, why can they still not break down the doors of the mall that the survivors take refuge in? I mean what's the deal there? As you can see I've put a lot of though into this. The things I do with my time.

      Tomorrow (Friday) I depart for Seattle. Leaving Olivia at home with the cat sitter and Toby at Johnny's house with him and his dog Luci. I'll be back next Wednesday and I might blog while I'm up there, we'll see. Depends on how badly I want to a) dial in and b) lug my laptop up there. I could use my Aunt's computer I guess. It's nice having your own with you though.   I leave with some uncertainty about where my feelings lay about two individuals right now. One person I didn't spend very much time with but I liked them very much, they are very similar to the kind of person I am. So the question I ponder is will I see this person or not. I'm not sure if I can or if I should because I'm afraid of the outcome. I'm afraid to press the issue really. So I leave that ball in their court.  The second person was a whirlwind of like and agressiveness, then awkward situations all in a day. Too much too soon. I'm not sure if I feel this person is rude, or misunderstood. I'm not sure if I was rude or misunderstood either. Very confused emotions. I think I might have like towards this person but I refuse to admit any like until I figure out where it lays, self preservation and all that. When I come back I will hopefully find resolution or closure on that issue. I'm confused about this person too because not sure what to think or feel, all I know is I feel that something needs to happen still. Other shoe has to drop, so to speak.  These people make me think. But I'm not sure what to think. I'm not sure if there is a person yet to come either. I don't think I'm going to worry about it anyway. Overthinking can make you crazy. So therefore I lay it out, then I move on to another topic.  This week's Love Horrorscope said: 4/25/2004 to 5/1/2004  Your hot, aggressive and can dazzle everyone with your sexual charisma. Don't wait for someone to pick you, if you feel an attraction towards someone let that person know exactly how you feel.   I'm not sure if that's good advice, some guys like agressive, some don't. Although agressive seemed to be a mix of good and bad for me this week. I am an agressive person though, not always but I can be when I am interested in someone and I would expect that whoever I wind up with will appreciate that quality in me.  I'm generally very discreet about my personal thoughts on things, but I like that I can post some thoughts about anonymous persons that most likely do not read my blog.

      (Sent by my friend Mark, enjoy!)  Stage #1 – Smart  This is when you suddenly become an expert on every subject.  You know all and greatly wish to express this knowledge to anyone who will listen.  At this stage you are also always right.  And of course the person you are talking with is very wrong.  You will talk for hours trying to convince someone that you are right.  This makes for an interesting argument when both parties are "smart".  Two people talking, in fact, arguing about a subject neither one really knows anything about, but are convinced that they are the complete authority on the subject which makes great entertainment for those who get the opportunity to listen in.  Stage #2 -- Handsome/Pretty  This is when you are convinced that you are the best looking person in the entire room and everyone is looking at you.  You begin to wink at strangers and ask them to dance because of course, they had been admiring you the whole evening.  You are the center of attention, and all eyes are directed at you because you are the most beautiful thing on the face of the earth.  Now keep in mind that you are still smart, so you can talk to this person who has been admiring you, about any and all subjects under the sun.  Stage #3—Rich  This is when you suddenly become the richest person in the world. You can buy drinks for the entire bar and put it on your bill because you surely have an armored truck full of your money parked behind the bar.  You can also make bets in this stage.  Now of course you still know all, so you will always win your bets.  You have no concern for how much money you bet because you have all the money in the world. You will begin to buy drinks for all the people in the bar who are admiring you because you are now the smartest, prettiest, and richest person in on the face of the earth.  Stage #4 – Bulletproof  You can now pick fights with the people you have been betting money with because you cannot be hurt by anything.  At this point you would go up to the boyfriend of the woman who had been admiring your beautiful self all evening and challenge him to a battle of wits for money.  You have no worry about loosing this battle of wits because you know all, have all the money to cover this bet, and you obviously win a fight that might erupt if he looses.  Stage #5  -- Invisible  This is the final stage of drunkenness.  At this point you can do absolutely anything because no one can see you.  You can get up and dance on the table, to impress people who have been admiring you all evening, because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you.  You are invisible to the person whom you have picked a fight with earlier in the evening.  You can walk through the streets singing at the top of your lungs (because of course you are still smart and know the tune perfectly) and no one will think anything of it because they cant see you.  All your social inhibitions are gone.  You can do anything, because no one will know, and you certainly won’t remember.

      What happens when you no longer believe in God, Religion, Angels, Spirits, Ghost, Heaven, Hell, Afterlife, Karma, Reincarnation, Fate or anything associated with these things? What do you do? You can't pray. You can't believe that what goes around comes around. You can't believe that things happen for a reason. You're definitely never going to kill yourself, because when you die, THAT'S IT. KAPUT!  A long time ago I used to belive in the whole wiccan positive/negative energy thing. That's about the only tidbit I belive in now. You put out negative energy towards folks you tend to get it back. But hey, that's common sense really. I believed in Psychics for a short period of time til I realized how nuts and what a huge money drain that was. But I do believe there are some folks out there that may be a tad bit more evolved and more sensitive to people than others. I mean why not, we're always evolving in some way, I hope. I still occasionaly like getting my tarot cards read for fun, but most readers suck and don't make it much fun. I had an astrologer for awhile, but it was information overload and I got bored by how long the and detailed the readings were. I was into therapy for awhile but I got tired of being asked "How does that make YOU feel?". Zzzzzz.  I used to believe in horrorscopes, but now that's just hooey. I like reading them though, they are amusing at least and  Linda Goodman's Love Signs  is always a fun read. I think now I just blog or write in my super secret hidden diary (!). That works. There really is no uplifting outlet when you're a disbeliever. I guess I have hope. Can get rid of the hope cause it's my middle name. No really... I have hope. For what I have no friggin clue.

      So I promised new photos of my car but I'm lame and haven't taken any good ones yet. So here's all I have to offer.  From the Ford Site: I got a 2003 roughly 8 month old  urlLink Ford Escape Limited . Pretty much what you'll see on the site, except the guy before me had almost every option possible, including parking sensors, a sunroof, heated seats and tow package. It's also a 4WD.  My new mid-size SUV is a  Dark Shadow Grey   (my absolute color of choice, I got lucky) with all black Leather interior, sweeeet. (Choose the second color option on the site)  I wish I would have saved the pic from the dealer's site but you get the idea. I swear I'll take some photos later.   Here's a tip if you plan on buying an Escape in the bay area. First off you want the XLT, forget the XLS, WEAK! Second, purchase a subscription to  CarFax , I looked up 20 cars on there. Here's what I learned, every single friggin 2003 ford escape except for one was previously a rental! I guess people don't sell their Escapes that soon. The one exception was the Limited one I got. It has one previous owner, and was traded in at a Porsche/Audi dealer. It was perfect and cost more but well worth it! One car out of 20! Sheesh. Plus the rentals looked pretty used, very annoying. Also that Ford Certified Pre-Owned warranty/inspection thing is a sham. Basically they're giving you the warranty that comes with the car already. No bonus there. They just say they did an inspection too, whoopity doo! If you buy from a reputable dealer it should be just fine. Bring a friend who knows something about cars too. That's if you're like me and only have a rudimentary knowledge of car guts.  Last general tip: Buy a subscription to  Consumer Reports . I love that site. Plus it has great car reviews on it and is reputable.  I really wanted a mid-size SUV, I love bigger cars. I got sucked in by the buy a beetle, by a mini, small car craze for awhile but I realized that a) beetles have horrible reviews and they suck and b) minis are generally too pricey, plus they're SMALL. I easily put two patio chairs in my cargo area tonight without having to lay any seats down or having to try to find a way for them to fit. My current car has a V6, 3.0L engine. The same as my Toyota Camry so I'm not burning anymore gas then I did before. I didn't get some horrible resource hog. Remember it's a mid-size SUV, not a 4Runner or a Pathfinder, or an Escalade.

      Your Tuesday horoscope, Marian!  You are impatient today. You have been left so far ahead of the pack that you will be quite restless at the slow pace of all the people behind you.   That sound pretty unpleasant. Stupid Horrorscope!   Yahoo Horrorscopes:   Quickie:  No matter how much you give, it's not enough. So why bother? Save your resources.   You're telling me sistah!   Overview:  Your always glib tongue will be even more witty and disarming, so if you need to do any negotiating, do it right now. There's no way anyone could ever refuse you before, much less now.   I'll have to try that one out!   Weekly Horrors (by Astrology.com)  The beginning of the week might find you cranky if you're not getting exactly what you want in matters of the heart -- but what do you want, exactly? If it's not too clear, make a list; this might sound stupid, but then you'll know it when you see it on Wednesday or Thursday. Engage in some witty repartee with your crush or your squeeze and see what it leads to. The end of the week might bring some third party into the picture; be sure to gently rebuff any busybodies. You'll want to be all about that one certain person when a very lazy but very romantic Sunday rolls around.   Cranky, yes. I agree. I already have a list, thank you very much. Men are pigs. No current squeezes, and see last comment in regards to how I feel about crushes. Rebuff, yes, that's an ongoing plan. On Sunday I'll be at my Grandmother's 80th Birthday Party Dinner, the least likely place for romance. Yuck.   Sometimes I wish hororrscopes really came true. I mean only the good ones of course, the rest is BS.  Sorry I'm a blogging fool tonight!

      Here are the few things that I learned when going to Paris last year.  1. Take a good guide book such as  Eyewitness Guide to Paris , it's a bit heavy though. I'm also going to try out  Let's Go Paris 2004 , since the reviews are good. Costco has a nice little discount on the Eyewitness Guides usually.  2. A good shopping guide would be helpful, just roaming around got me to all the major department stores but some boutiques would have been nice. I'm going to order  Where to Wear 2004: The Insider's Guide to Paris Shopping , and see how that one is.  3. A good map is very very helpful (of course). Don't buy the  Michelin Paris Pocket Atlas (by Arrondissements) Map No. 16  (which I couldn't figure out and was annoyingly too large and detailed, particularly since it didn't come in English and it's out of print now yay!), do try out  Streetwise Paris  or use the map in the back of the Eyewitness Guide. Or just pick up one of those freebie  Printemp  maps that they have around at hotels which also point out the major department stores etc. Paper and easy to tuck away. Although mine started falling apart from so much use. Plus Printemps is fun to shop, so at least check it out while you're there. They have maps on the ground floor as well and most of their maps have a discount coupon, which I happily used. My dad also bought me  Inside/Out Paris , which I'll probably use most of the time since its small, has a guide, map, compass and pen! So handy!  4. If you plan on using the metro (duh) or go to any Museums (this applies to London as well, in my experience) you absolutely MUST buy the  Museum and Metro Passes  . I like to buy them in advance, but you can buy the Museum pass at department stores such as  La Samaritaine . I prefer to get mine in advance, particularly since the first time I went I had no friggin clue how the metro machines worked, and still don't. I just the good ole passes! The benefits are that you not only save money on this and can get in almost anywhere by flashing your pass, you can also go to the front of the line (at D'Orsay) or go in a special entrance (at the Louvre) with NO waiting. This was particularly helpful when it was 100+ degress in paris last year during the August heatwave when we were there. The D'Orsay line went 3 blocks! In the direct sunlight! I would have passed out for sure.  5. You don't really need to know French in Paris, just basics like Merci, or Excusez-Moi was a personal favorite since people like to get in your way. Knowing decent pronunciation is nice and less touristy and knowing some basic words or even phrases may help when looking for the restroom (Ou sont les toilettes, s'il vous plait?) . I did need to know some French in Versailles, so knowing my numbers helped in particular. Not as many English speakers in the main town.  6. The last thing I picked up for this years trip was  Paris Revisited: The Guide for the Return Traveler . I haven't gotten it yet so I'll let you know if it sucks or not.  At the risk of pissing someone off who will not like that I'm going on a big trip right now, this years trip to Paris will be in June, (if all goes well). Two of my friends will be meeting me there, (if all goes well) and we will have a crazy good time! My immediate plan is to stay at my  tattoo artist/friend's  apartment for four days then stay in a hotel with my friends for the the remaining 5 days. I'm psyched and hope this all works out! I'll keep ya posted.  Can you offer anymore Paris tips? I know some people have been there (that's YOU Jenn!) and can probably offer some comments.

      Over the last two days I've been disrespected (weekend BS) and had at least one person take something out out on me, which was misdirected anger and really had nothing to do with me (at work no less, and a stranger to boot, ugh). I just want to say that there are 10 million other ways to say something in a polite way besides in a huff or in a rude, disrespectful manner.   It's like the old "You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar" schtick. I mean seriously, I find people really apalling lately. Do people really have so many issues that they have to be dickheads like that? Where's the consideration or the honesty? What ever happened to saying what you really mean or being straightforward? I'm sick of the stereotypes too. GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm so glad I'm heading out of town soon. I need a nice little drama free break.

      So sorry I haven't written anything decent in awhile. I still plan on posting pics from the wedding I went to last Friday and the highlights of the Bayou party I went to last Saturday plus Karaoke night at Shawn's art space last night. Phew! My latest cold kicked in full force by Monday and I've been hacking up large gobs of green goo and going into hacking coughing fits that won't stop as well as sneezing (thank you allergy season!) and the whole runny stuffy nose bit. Let's just say hot green tea is my best friend right now. So I've been sick since about 3/15 until a week ago Monday, I had about a 4 day break then the sore throat kicked in and now this bit of fun! Between viral and bacterial infections combined with horrible allergies I'm not sure how I'm surviving at this point.  It probably doesn't help that I've had major lack of sleep and went to a company offsite on Tuesday where I ate way too much Italian food and then bowled (very crappily I might add) on my decently healed but still sprained and wrapped ankle. Suffice to say I'm worn out. I took Wednesday as a sick day and slept all through most of it. I needed it!  Anyway, I'll be back in full swing soon enough and eager to report on the latest run of fun events!

             You're Thailand!     Calmer and more staunchly independent than almost all those around you, you have a long history of rising above adversity. &nbsp;Recent adversity has led to questions about your sexual promiscuity and the threat of disease, but you still manage to attract a number of tourists and admirers. &nbsp;And despite any setbacks, you can really cook a good meal whenever it's called for. &nbsp;Good enough to make people cry.   Take the  urlLink Country  Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid     I'm not that loose, thank you very much! The rest is pretty amusing though.

       Your Friday horoscope, Marian!  A quick change in your emotional situations is due to come today. All you have felt up to this point may push at the floodgates of feeling and challenge you to seek a serious commitment.  Well I am going to a wedding this evening. Don't weddings tend to make chicks mushy about this kind of stuff? Horoscopes are funny.  Check out my  Yahoo Horrorscope : A coworker or authority figure is about to let you know they're interested in far more than your professional performance. If you're interested, great -- but be sure you can still work together if things don't go as planned.  Coworker, yes yes.... but authority figure? Hrmmm!   I'm procrastinating going to work right now, can you tell?

      There's a song on the latest  Lamb  album called Angelica which I love. I get a little thrill when I hear it because it contains a bit of  classical music called  Clair de lune by Claude Debussy  that I happen to LOVE. I really only truly love it on Piano too, so I'm glad they included it in that form. The part that really thrills me though is the fact that they use the bit of the song that I happen to love the most. Excuse me while I listen to it ten times in a row. Oh, the rest of the Lamb album is good too by the way.  Raul's wedding is coming up quick! I got some shoes (yes they have a heel) that slip on versus strap on so I can at least get my bandage in it. My ankle doesn't hurt so much now though even though it looks terrible. I keep it well strapped up so it doesn't get too much movement. Now my other ankle and leg hurts. Probably because it's getting so much of the walking burden. At least I'm not hobbling around as much. I haven't been to many weddings but the last one I went to I enjoyed a lot. I'm sure this one will be just as wonderful. Plus I love the feeling you get at a particularly sweet wedding. That warm fuzzy thing. Aww.   And ohmygod Luke moved out of Newport Beach to Portland! No more Luke on  The O.C.  WTF! The tragedy... I'm sure he'll be back for "specials".   I love how some of the people I work with pop up online about this time of night. Seems like we're all a bunch of night owl insomniac geeks. Hee.

      What a weekend! I stayed in Friday and Saturday night which was okay. I was a bit stir crazy after working so much the last couple of weeks and then not going out this weekend but it turned out okay. I was seriously sleep deprived. Anyway, Sunday I finally got another car. I'll post photos and details later. Woo! I'm excited!  Sunday night I went to see  The Vines  and  Jet  at the Warfield with Jeremy. That was actually a damn fun show! We had a good time, and the crowd was decent. Not as young as I thought it would be but there were still a few kids there. Jet sounded very AC-DC'ish at times, it was a good live show. The Vines were a little bit of a let down after seeing Jet but they were still good. They all had that shaggy not short, not long dirty 70's type hair thing going on with the weird band t-shirts and one guy had some pretty fruity looking tank top on. I guess that's the thing these days.  On the way out of the show via the backdoor, I twisted my ankle sideways on a metal plate on the sidewalk and fell over. I was wearing my big boots which have 4 1/2 inch heels on them! I got a nice purple bruise on one knee and sprained my ankle. It was rough making it back to the car and driving home was a bit of a pain but I made it! Went to urgent care Monday morning in Sunnyvale and found out that I have a level 2 sprain on my ankle. The doc said I probably tore some of the ligaments a bit. I'll be in a stupid bandage and air cast for the next 10-14 days until it heals. So I have to hobble around everywhere I go and endure the constant mocking of my co-workers. Oh....  it's all in good fun! Wait until they hurt themselves, then it's open season! I think the real pain in the neck (pain in the ankle?) of this whole thing will be the fact that I have to wear a nice dress and go to a wedding on Friday wearing some sort of shoes that accomodate an aircast. So I won't be wearing my nice black strappy heels dammit. Instead I'll be wearing something with short heels that slip on, even though I'm supposed to be in tennis shoes, or regular shoes for the next two weeks. I'll just stay off it on Friday. I promise. And I can't party TOO hard this weekend or else I'll make it worse. I have a huge lump on the side of my ankle and it's starting to turn a nice dark purple. Very attractive.    Today's Horrorscope:  Take care of business, and do it diligently. The good news is that once you're finished and free to do as you like, the universe will be only too happy to provide you with a wonderful distraction.  Okay I just finished working my ass off for the last two weeks. Gimme!

      There's actually a  Todd Gaines Fanlisting ! That's hilarious. In case you don't know who this is, it's the drug dealer character that  Timothy Olyphant   played in  Go .  On another note, Shawn's Karaoke night was fun. There was a much bigger turnout this time. Jackie, Jeremy, Johnny and I had a ping pong rematch. It was Johnny and I versus Jackie and Jeremy again. I'm pretty sure we owned them this time around.  Hellboy  was okay. I don't think I'd see it again in the theater. There were some suspenseful moments and some pretty amusing bits. I liked the weird fish man character Abe a lot. I thought the creepy guy with the knives and the gas mask was pretty cool too. The only problem was not really knowing a lot of the back story and the slow plot points. It was a bit hokey in parts too and seemed really long. I'd like to actually read all the comic books now to find out what's so cool about it. My friends seem to really like them.  Anyway, I'm definitely seeing   Dawn of the Dead  again in the theater! A couple guys in the ticket line in front of me were asking the ticket salesgirl what she thought of Dawn of the Dead. She said it was just okay. They bought their tickets anyway and I told them that it kicked ass! (silly ticket girl!) They asked me if I was a horror afficionado and I said definitely! I knew my zombie films and that was a damn good zombie film! Well worth seeing. They told me that Hellboy was slow and mediocre and that it took a long time to really get into the plot, but the effects were good and then they told me I should go see Dawn of the Dead with them. Hee. :)  My goal is to go to bed right after I post this. Last night I was up WAAAAAY too late. I felt like crap today and barely made it through my workout. Insomnia sucks. More Ambien please Mr. Physician! I predict I have to work late tomorrow and Friday night and that I might even have to come in Saturday afternoon. Stop the hurting.  Oh the  Anon Salon  party Saturday night was SO MUCH FUN. I can't wait to go to the next one. I've been to some good parties, but I haven't had that much fun in a long time! We even had some shots of  Absinthe  on the rooftop when we were there. It was vodka based but still had the green color and the crappy tasting herbs. It was poured over sugar for us so it wasn't too gross tasting. Didn't feel any effects from it though, if you know what I mean. The Absinthe I got in Paris tasted like licorice as it should but when my friend drank it he was a) grossed out by the taste and b) felt no effects from that either. Next party I should dress up, or so says Shawn. I don't think I'm creative enough for that. I'll try to think of something though just in case I have some inspiration.

       Pants!  What's  yours ? Sunday's episode of the Sopranos was the best one of this season so far. I loved it. Definitely one of my favorite shows. If you missed it, catch the reruns on HBO this week or read all about it on the  Sopranos HBO site . My next new TV show addiction is probably going to be  Deadwood  which is also an HBO show. I missed the first one so I'm waiting til it re-airs before I watch all 3 of the episodes that have already aired. I think I'm obligated to watch it since  Timothy Olyphant  is so hot. Did you see him in  Go ? Damn!  Worked til midnight last night. Now I'm up way too late as a result. I'm really going to be feeling it during work today. Particularly since I have to go work out today AND go to Karaoke night at Shawn's AND go see  Hellboy  with everyone. I'll be drooling on myself by Thursday. There just aren't enough hours in the day to do all that I wanna do.   Today will be a heavy tea today for me to keep me going. Is there a 12 step group for Pearl Tea Addicts? I think I have a problem. Maybe my friends need to do an intervention. I'd go down fighting for sure. It's my favorite thing these days and I would like a pearl tea/knitting shop. Anyone wanna invest in one with me?  And just when you think life wasn't fair enough,  J.Lo's mom wins a 2.4 million dollar jackpot in Atlantic City . How the hell did that happen? The mother of a multi millionaire diva wins a multi million dollar jackpot?! There is no God. Apparently she plans on putting a college fund together for her grandchildren with the money. Why would she need to do that? Is J.Lo really that greedy that with all her fortunes she wouldn't put some nieces and nephews through college? Ick!  Lastly if you're looking for a good laugh, check out  thesneeze.com . I got the link  from  Edna Million's blog . I laughed out loud reading the March 27th "ABCs & LSD" entry. The "Steve, Don't Eat It!" food reviews are HILARIOUS too!

      Is it still Bill Gates?   Here's an interesting excerpt: "When Microsoft stock peaked in 1999, Gates had assets of more than $90 billion. That means he has lost about $45 billion, more money than anyone in history."

        Secretary :  Before I forget to mention this. I really really liked this movie. It was twisted and bizzare but I loved  James Spader  (another Pretty in Pink alum!) in it and their relationship was actually pretty romantic.   Plot Outline (via  imdb.com ): A young woman, recently released from a mental hospital, gets a job as a secretary to a demanding lawyer, where their employer-employee relationship turns into a sexual, sadomasochistic one.    Dawn of the Dead (the new version) :  This movie was the best! I LOVED IT! It was scary, fast paced, the characters were fun and there were a lot of funny jokes in it. I laughed a bunch and was on the edge of my seat. FANTASTIC! This one's a MUST MUST SEE! Hey  Entertainment Weekly  gave it an A. Can't argue with that!  Plot Outline  (via  imdb.com ):  The survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing the flesh-hungry undead, take refuge in a mega shopping mall.   The tag line from this movie, "When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth." was originally uttered by Stephen the tall black policeman from the  original film . He also uttered it in the new film as the televangelist. See below.  Notable cameos in this movie include:   Tom Savini  as the Sherrif. Tom Savini is best known for doing horror movie special effects. He was also not only in the original movie but did all the makeup for it.  Ken Foree  as the Televangelist. He was best known as Peter the cop from the original and Leroy 'Bubba' Brown in  From Beyond , another favorite of mine.  Scot Reiniger  as the National Guard General. He was also in the original as Roger the other cop that eventually turns into a zombie. He looked so different in the new film. I didn't even recognize him until I read that he was in it after the fact. He didn't age as well as the other guys did.  Gaylen Ross , who was Francine in the original, didn't appear in the film but one of the stores in the mall was named 'Gaylen Ross'. She would have been a great cameo! I'd love to see what she looks like now. I guess  David Emge  who was Stephen in the original didn't warrant anything? No info on that.  I have other fun Zombie movie factoids I'll put in a later post when it's not so late. Zombies are, of course, my most favorite horror movie baddie of all time.

       Your Friday horoscope, Marian!  You have a tough choice today. You could have a pleasant time with friends or finish up a long overdue project. The Moon in Virgo would make either of these pleasant and productive, so the choice is yours.   Yeah so I'm going to stay late at work vs go out, as I have for the entire week! UGH! Next week will hopefully not be more of the same.   Hey it's all about S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y NIGHT! I'm saving it up! I'll be heading to an  Anon Salon  party with Shawn and then maybe visiting a cute little Chinchilla later on.

      Okay I love  that show . Sue me! Mock away, I don't care! But just in case you're interested, check out the  tv show/soundtrack clips . It's one of the extras you get on  the cd ... the link to the page. Basically it's profiling the new soundtrack album that's out by showing clips of which scene the song was first played in. Maybe it's a guilty pleasure who knows, but it's a pretty popular show. It doesn't hurt that it has hot boys on it either!  ** Okay, the stupid site won't load unless you launch it directly from the CD. BOOOO! BOOOO! **

      Well last night was 1984's Prom Night at the Cat Club. I haven't been to '84 since I went last Thanksgiving and it's funny to know that no matter how long it's been you still see some of the same people there you saw last time around. Jeremy and I didn't dress up, of course, but a bunch of our friends did. We're talking tuxes, prom dresses, corsages you name it! They all looked fabulous! I at least finally got to wear my cool colorfully striped Miss Sixty halter with my fabulous matching hot pink leather belt and pointy hot pink heels! I also got a nice buzz on and had a pretty darn good time actually. I definitely won't frequent '84 like some of my other friends do but these special occasion outings are always a good time. I'd like to give a shout out to all the bad ass prom peeps aka Shawn, Libby, Mark, Danae, Greg, Raquel, Dave, Ken and the rest of the group that was there.  So as far as the running into of people I knew, last night was a bigger turnout than usual. I of course saw my ex-boyfriend Sam there. I saw him there last time too. We don't talk ever. We had a really bad breakup, mostly due to my really bad behavior at the time. So I take a lot of the blame on that one. Anyways we're at least able to co-exist in the same club and within the fringes of the same circles without awkwardness which is good. And Sam if you ever read this, I'm sorry I was such an ass (understatement of the century) to you when we broke up and I hope one day you can accept my profound apologies on the matter. I can only excuse my bad behavior by saying that I really loved you at the time and didn't want it to end. But so it goes.... I digress.  I ran into Gina, my hairdresser and her fabulous gay boy friends. They were all a total blast! She was drunk off her ass and still drank a ton more. Man can that woman hold her alcohol! I would have been passed out on the floor had I had that much to drink. They were so fun though and they all kept going off about how totally hot I was which was really great for the ego. Thanks! I saw and talked to Akemi a girl I knew from the Rockabilly scene who's still going out with Barry after 5 years! Wow, that's a long time! For me at least.   There were also some sfnetter folks there like Shadow Phredd aka Marissa who I didn't talk to but I saw her there. Rob as in Asia/Rob from back in the day. He was working there. I did manage at one point to talk to him for a bit which was fun. He was surprised to see me since it had been years and years since I'd last seen him. I'm sure he didn't even recognize me. I wouldn't have recognized him if Ben hadn't of pointed him out. Oh yes, I ran into Ben. What a trip that was! If you recall I wrote about Ben in  April of last year . He's my old friend who I had fallen out of touch with that I saw on 20/20 being reunited with his birth mom due to some crazy unusual circumstances which you can  read all about  yourself!  It was so nice to see Ben. I spent most of the evening hanging out with him just talking about whatever and reminiscing a bit. The first time I ever went to the Cat Club Ben took me there. We're talking 1996 here. Ben and Sam are friends and they hang out in the same social circle basically but it was a trip for me to see them both in the same place at the same time since Ben was my closest friend while I was going out with Sam. If I wasn't with Sam I was primarily with Ben. We worked together and hung out together all the time. I miss having friends like that. I have a few, but not at the level of friendship I had with Ben. Anyway, after most likely driving Ben crazy from hanging around him too much I then I took off, went to eat with super drunken funny Ken (no not Ben, KEN) at Sparky's, dropped him off at home then headed home myself. You know, while it was great seeing Ben our lives are so different from each other's now it's not like we could just hang out again. I mean I wish we could but I don't see how it would work like it used to. Back then sfnet was our social circle and now we've evolved into new circles. I'm too much of a drifter I guess. I float through circles a lot.  It's nice to know you can still have fun when you see some people though. I'm sure if I go back to 1984 in five years I'll run into some of the same people all over again. I used to think SF was a big place but really it's not. I always run into people that I used to know. Well that's also probably because tastes my change somewhat but there are only so many clubs you can go to that have the type of music or scene that you want to hang out in. It's still weird though. I went out with Sam from 1995-1996. That's EIGHT years ago! Damn! Ben and I haven't hung out 6 or 7 years probably. That seems like an eternity. It's like when I saw Shannon a couple months ago. I hadn't see her in ten years. The years seem to drop away though like it's only been 6 months or something. It nowhere near feels like that many years have passed already. I'm happy that Shannon is back in my life too and I definitely wouldn't mind running into Ben again. Good times, good memories.  You know I still have my prom dress from my 1988 Junior Prom. It's white and lacey. It's times like this I wish I had a scanner. My prom pics are totally good for a laugh. I had some big hair in those photos too. Dave my old friend was my boyfriend and prom date at the time. What a raucous night that was. I seem to recall getting into some rip roaring fights and ashing in his lap in Lyon's. Back when you could smoke in restaurants. We did have some fun times though, like going to the Hyatt Regency for dinner with our friends in that rotating restaurant. We felt like such adults. And singing along in the car to Fishbone while Chris Stelz chauffeured us because his girlfriend Marisa had already promised to go to the prom with this other guy Chris before they started going out. Wow, what drama that was! I have the crappiest memory though, who was the other couple we were with... Dave? Help me out here! Ah well, crazy prom night, crazy memories. At least it was interesting! I can never complain that I haven't had an interesting life.

      And no I don't mean that kick ass band from Sweden.  Yes that's right, I broke out in a mighty case of hives this week! I've had itchy skin conditions before in my life but not in many many years, so I figured I was having a rash or something. It started out as welts on my legs and by last night anything I rubbed or itched broke out in welts, including my forehead and all over my neck! This started slowly on Tuesday and escalated into welt hell by last night. Plus I'd been having some strange chest pains and by last night I was starting to lose my voice.  I saw an allergist this morning and he was able to narrow down what the problem with me was. Apparently if you recall from previous blog posts, all that respiratory illness that I had on/off three times in March never quite went away. He called it a case of not sufficiently being healed from my original illnesses. I was also previously on two different types of antibiotics which he said weren't taken long enough to kill off whatever this is that's out to get me. The hives and other ensuing problems were apparently my body's way of freaking out and letting me know, HELLO! I'm still sick! FIX ME PLEASE! So it wasn't something touching my skin causing the problem but the illness inside coming out. Lovely!  So my very nice doctor gave me a dose of Zyrtec, the new allergy med I'm going to be taking instead of Clarinex and he put me on a steroid called Prednasone for 9 days. He gave me my first dose this morning and let me tell you... within one hour every single hive all over my body, and there were a bunch, completely disappeared. Voila! Gone! Like they never existed. Yes prednasone has some bad side effects but man what a relief! No more itching, no more welts, I felt brand new! Yay! I'm on it for 9 days only though thank god. I have to watch out for side effects like being "bitchy", as my doc put it... oh the jokes I got about that from co-workers today.... or just being depressed for a couple of days. Right now I feel fine, as you do in the beginning, we'll see how the rest of the next week goes. If it gets bad he'll pull me off it right away.  I'm also now on a NEW antibiotic for two whole weeks this time to really kill whatever the heck it is that's gunning for me as well as Cortizone cream in case I itch and Acidophilus to combat any infections from too many antibiotics. Also while I was at the store I picked up a nice multi-vitamin. What the hell. Might as well take something else on top of it. OH... and I have to take a teaspoon of benadryl before bed each night, to help the allergies and to help me sleep since everything else I'm taking promotes insomnia. As if I'm not already an insomniac. It's like some kind of crazy drug store over here! Well I was always one to take some sort of medication so what else is new. It's not like I'll ever quite be pill free.  So on top of all this other junk I have to take I also have my normal meds to take such as Buspar, which is good for being mellow, Flonase spray, which is good for preventing allergy attacks and microgestrin, which is good for not having kids. I don't have to take Zoloft anymore and I haven't since last February or thereabouts. My doctor felt that I didn't need it anymore since I was down to such a small dose and he was right. I haven't felt down or bummed or super mad or OCD or anything since I got off of it. I feel really great actually, oh except I have HIVES! Damn youuuu hives! All I have to say is I'm super glad this happened this week and not next week when my birthday shindig is. How much would that have sucked? (Knock on Wood and all that mumbo jumbo)

      **Warning: Strong Language with lots of the C word**  Leave it to HBO to come out with yet another engrossing drama series. Other than Oz I've been hooked on just about every one of them. Sopranos, Sex and the City, Six Feet Under, Carnivale... Deadwood is up to episode ten at this point. I finally got around to watching the ones I have saved up on my UltimateTV box. I haven't caught up quite yet but I've made it through 5 episodes so far.   Yes I like the series, yes it's definitely one I'm going to keep watching. Is it one of my favorites? Probably not but it's entertaining.  Timothy Olyphant  is always fun to watch because he's hot and all.  Keith Carradine  is great as Wild Bill Hickock, he's definitely one of my favorites characters for as long as he's on there. I even like the evil nasty saloon owner  Al Swearengen . He's like the Michael Corleone of the Old West. There's actually quite a few good actors on the show. The old west backdrop and nasty town politics make for some interesting storylines.   The biggest problems I have with the show are the dirt and the language. Not that I'm not one to swear up a storm from time to time but the dialogue is just over the top. "Cocksucker" and "Fuck" or "Fucker" are by far the most used words on the show, closely followed by "Cunt". If you have sensitive ears then by no means watch this show. It even makes me a bit uncomfortable. I think it actually takes away from the story a bit to have every other word be "cocksucker". From the bad guys maybe, but even the good guys are throwing out the C word liberally left and right. Yeesh. Did people in the old west really talk like that? They don't even swear half that much on the Sopranos. **Note: I just read an article by Old West Historians on the use of language in this show and how accurate it is. Apparently yes, it is indeed accurate. Okay. Fine. Accepted, but still a bit much for me.  The dirt and grit are good and bad. It's realistic to see a dirty dusty western gold mining town. Lots of mud and filth. Probably not many baths. But why are the miners all always streaked in dark brown dirt? The makeup department must have a lot of work on their hands every week with the streaky sweaty look everyone seems to have. That and bruised beaten up whores. That's another nice look. I'm not saying everyone should be squeeky clean but on one episode it looked like they walked through some kind of streaky, dirty assembly line before they started shooting that day. Little over the top. **Note: This show HAS been praised for its gritty accurate and realistic portrayal of life in the Old West.  I don't really have a problem with nudity on shows like this except for the scene with the nasty sweaty brown dirt streaked, gap toothed, pot bellied miner guy holding his dick with his pants around his ankles, naked whore in the background yelling out some unintelligible crap. Was that *really* necessary? It's gonna be awhile before I can get that gross image out of my head. And before I forget I have to mention  Calamity Jane . Great acting job, horrible character. The first few episodes showed her as nothing but a manly, surly, overly angry character prone to screaming outbursts at just about everything. It was painful to watch. I had to cringe every time she was on screen cause she'd burst out screaming as if she had tourettes or something. Ow, my eardrums. She's getting a little less annoying as the show goes on but she's definitely one of my least favorite characters to watch.  So would I recommend Deadwood? Only if you're a big fan of HBO dramas or a fan of the Old West. This will be right up your alley. Otherwise I wouldn't tell you to go out of your way to try and catch it like I would the Sopranos or Sex and the City when it was on. My friend Dave loves the show though. He's into history so this is right up his alley. Oh and yes, the show characters are real, with real storylines. It's not all made up.

      You know my birthday is coming up. June 5th to be exact. Not many shopping days left if you feel like picking up a little something something for me! :P I added a few affordable items to my girlshop registry, hint hint! ---->   I'm going to be friggin 33 this year! I don't feel 33. I don't think I look 33. I'm not sure what 33 is supposed to look and feel like for me anyways. I thought I found a gray hair on my head today and I was totally suprised until I realized that it was actually a piece of bleached hair that was showing white again since parts of my purple hair are so faded right now. You know, 10 years ago I figured I'd be married by now. While I'm not married, I do have a pretty good job and a good life so I can't complain too much. I would have liked to own a house by now though and I'm happy that I don't have any children yet. Not ready for that kind of responsiblity just yet, thanks!   Every new year and every birthday I think, "Oh this year's going to be THE year". What I mean by that I'm not exactly sure but it definitely hasn't been THE year yet. I'm not going to be negative and think that THE year might never happen dammit. But I'm still waiting!   My birthday this year falls on a Saturday. I'll be going to dinner with what started out as a small group of friends and turned into a very LARGE group of friends. Then we'll be going to a party afterwards. I hope it's as fun as it sounds on paper! I hate planning birthday parties and get togethers. I used to try and plan big ones but it got to be too stressful. This year I opted for the most low maintenance event I could. The most I had to do was make the reservation and send out the evite. Everything else is already available, including the party. I'll be sure to post debaucherous details and photos after the fact.  So here's to hoping that a) my birthday dinner/party night is THE night and b) that this is THE year for me.

      So my friends have started putting up their own blogs. It's fun to read what other people have to write especially people I know. Some are anonymous while others have no problem letting the world know who they are. Sometimes I wonder if I should have kept mine anonymous. I think my writings might have been a bit more in depth and interesting had I done so.  I started reading the blog of a new blog friend recently. The best part about her blog is that it's completely anonymous. No one in her life knows she writes it and she changes peoples names in it. That gives her the freedom to post every little thing about something that happens to her. What I mean by that is she can talk shit and no one will be the wiser. I don't mean just trash talking but talking about things that may not always be pleasant for the people involved to hear. Real things though and real happenings. Or things about herself that she may not want to share with people she knows (I hope I'm stating this right   I can't post as much detail on my blog because too many people I know read it. Sure I have a lot of feelings and thoughts about life and love and happiness and sadness and the day to day. But what's okay to say? Not much without pissing someone off, or peaking someone's interest about something that's probably none of their business, or getting in trouble for saying the wrong thing. But then again, blogs are public things, and why do we all blog anyways? Random strangers come and read about our days and the things we do, and why do we want this kind of attention? I guess it's a way to be heard. I like to think of it as an excercise in learning how to write in a way that will make people want to read it. That's why I started it at least.   Now it's more of a way to express myself and communicate. It's like talking to a friend and rambling without having to call them up and drive them crazy. Some people blog aboutinteresting movies, or events or reviews and some people blog the day to day. To each their own. I like a bit of both myself. I'll continue to weigh out how much I will and won't post on here in the future. So far the most reaction I've gotten is a phone call questioning why I would post certain feelings about a situation and a nasty comment about another "sharing" post. Not everyone's going to be happy all of the time. That's human beings for ya.

       urlLink    This is my attempt at using BloggerBot for the first time. I want to see if it works better than the manual way I edit and post pics, which is a pain in the ass. Here's a lovely photo of some cookies and candy my co-worker Hiromi brought back for me from Japan. Yes I ate it all.  Which do you like better? The pop up windows or this? This ones easier to use but the little java popups are really cool too. It's much more tedious to the java popups... I wonder if this little widget will start doing that eventually... Comments? Suggestions? &nbsp; urlLink

      Okay my last poll was too morbid even for me, so I deleted and started over. This one has to do with where you'd live if you had to move and why. I ask this because I don't think I want to be in the bay area forever. I like it here but at some point I'm need to branch out and live in another area. Somewhere more affordable. I definitely want to own a house one day still.  I think part of the reason I cling to this area so much is that I spent my whole life moving around the world with my dad who was a civil engineer. I lived in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia. I've also visited many countries. While I wouldn't trade it for anything in the whole world, there's something nice about having a place you can call home. A place that you can say you're from. California is the closest thing I've got to that. I moved here when I was 15 and this is the longest place I've ever lived. I love the ocean though and want to be somewhere close to the water. I can't imagine living in the middle of the country where the ocean wasn't close enough to drive to (and I don't mean drive to in 5 days). There's just something beautiful and calming about the water. I probably picked that up from living on an island for 2 years when I was a kid.  I still have the travel bug in me and the itch to do new things. Which is also probably why I have a hard time "settling" down. I don't want to just settle. If you know what I mean. So for now, I stay here and ponder other possiblities.  Don't forget to take the poll. I only had ten spaces for options to I picked the first ten cities that came to mind. You can always do a write in!

      So a friend of mine went to see  Troy  today and he said it sucked pretty badly. This of course is coming from my friend who loves to see movies like this, even if they do stink a bit. He loves the special effects and the action. So for him to say it sucked, it probably really really sucked. So instead of seeing that tonight I wound up seeing  Shrek 2  instead.   It started out kind of slow and I was a bit skeptical as to how funny it would be. Entertainment Weekly gave it an A- and the viewer reviews I read were great. So yes, while it started out slow it sure picked itself up later on! I had quite a few laugh out loud moments while watching it. Puss in Boots was by far my most favorite character in the movie. Antonio Banderas does the voice for him and he's really really good. I laughed the most at the Puss in Boots parts. Hilarious! I had to wipe a tear away at one point from the laughter. It wasn't side splitting per se but it was damn funny. There were lots of pop culture references in the film too which were amusing. The voices in the film were great too. Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett, Jennifer Saunders. I don't really want to give away any little fun details of this movie because it would ruin it, so I'll refrain.  For some light hearted fun with some good laughs in it go see Shrek 2. A lot of people have written that they like it better than the first one. I haven't seen the first one in forever so I can't say that for sure. But it was definitely very good. Yay, finally a good movie comes out! What a relief. There have been a crop of bad ones out lately. Yucko.  Harry Potter  comes out June 4th. Can't wait to see that one either!

      there was nothing going on this week. BLAMMO! You get 2 new evites in your inbox today. I actually had to cancel dinner plans tonight in order to have a night to myself this week. I got an invite to something last night but I wanted to chill out so I reclaimed Monday night for myself as well.  Tomorrow night is 049 Karaoke Night #5 at Shawn's art/loft space in the SOMA. It's a great space and he has a pretty kick ass monthly party there. Karaoke is a bi-weekly event. I've yet to miss one! The Karaoke nights started out pretty small, maybe 10-12 people or so. The last one was surprisingly big. Ton of people showed up. Tomorrow night's promises to be another big one considering the number of people that have RSVP'ed on  evite . It's good fun though. There's a bar, a pole for all those wanna be strippers out there, plenty of songs to sing to, doggies, ping pong and swing dancing!   Mark took some photos from 049 Karaoke Night #3. I brought Toby that night. The pics are a bit hard to see since copying photos down from the printroom site doesn't get you the best quality photos.   Here's a photo of a group of us singing "Happy Trails" at the end of the night (note little Toby up on stage with us in the bottom left):  urlLink     A nice crowd shot of people dancing and carrying on:  urlLink     Me, in between Randall and Andy on the couch:  urlLink     Bridget brought her sweet little pooch Jewel to the last one. We both agreed to bring both our pups tomorrow night. Should be intersting! At least they're both great around big crowds. Just let them roam around, no worries!  So that covers Wed night! Thursday some friends and I may go see  Troy . Yes I know the reviews sucked but it's got Orlando Bloom in it, super hottie. Oh wait, there's also Brad Pitt and Eric Bana... triple the hotties! Yup, worth seeing. Friday, the band Theo's in this week is playing a show at the  Starry Plough  in Berkeley. They're called  The Teenage Harlets  and have been around for a bit. Should be fun. After we catch them we're jetting back to the city to head to Jackie's friend Joy's mega 80's party on Fillmore. Gotta figure out what to wear for that one! Can't beat the 80's though, best decade ever! Saturday Erin is DJ'ing a night called "Death before Disco". I will hopefully be able to catch that one.  Hey at least it's better than having nothing going on, right? Like last weekend was pretty quiet. Of course we all found things to do anyway, which included starting out party'ing in Santa Cruz sat. night... winding up in SF with the santa cruz folks later that night and getting trapped in SF Sunday morning due to the Bay to Breakers. That sucked! Had to wait til 10am when the embarcadero streets opened up in order to get home. That was a LONG saturday night to say the least. I met a whole bunch of new Santa Cruz folks though since I was there visiting my old friend Jack who was staying at some surfer buddies house down there. Nice group!  I guess this much activity makes those alone nights that much more wonderful. And at least I don't have to worry about being alone or not having anything to do. There's always something going on somewhere! :)

      Hahaha, I got this one off of  Dooce.com . Pretty amusing, considering I'm 32. Although I'll be turning 33 next month. I have had quite a few people guess my age at 26 though! And they weren't even trying to be flattering! Or at least I don't think they were... Nevertheless, this article could be about me! :P  **My new blog allows me to add links to the titles, so I guess I'll be posting this "Please click on the link in the title" note, until people figure it out.**

      The latest and greatest poll was "Men are Pigs, What say you?". The results are in!  Votes: Yes - 10 No - 4 Other - 10  Comments: - im a man  - Based upon personal experience as a male, I am forced to state that they are indeed not. :-P  - yes pigs we are - you came across wrong men:)  - only because women are psycho - yeah, we are pigs.  - in general, i agree. but will vary on an individual basis. - if men are pigs then wemon are the slop that they feed on. *kiss*   - women aren't pigs we're um, piglets  - no more so than women.  - Generally men are men and pigs are pigs, except in the case of Rodney Smith, who had a pig tail.  - Don't give men the benefit of the doubt, they really are all pigs, whether conciously or not.  - pigs, yes, but maybe worse. pigs do not have the mental capabilities to overcome their natural instincts while men do, and chose not to use it.  - Okay maybe not all men are pigs, but this is this weeks theme for me.   This poll was much more sucessul than my last poll "UGG boots, fashion or FUGLY?". I like the comments, so keep 'em comin' people! Men are pigs is apparently a hot topic. :) I'll be posting a bit more controversial poll next. Be sure to take it, it's anonymous!

      Okay so I rebuilt the blog from the last disaster and re-added the new Blogger comment functionality. What this means is that I had to "recap" some of the comments made on posts earlier this week by reposting them. Blogger got rid of the old format I used so those comments won't show up now. I had to disable comments on a couple of posts due to the mess that was caused when I first tried learning how the comment feature worked.  My biggest gripe about the new comment feature is that if I don't like a comment I can erase it, but that doesn't mean the slate is clean. The comment counter will still indicate that there is a comment but instead of there being a comment you'll see a notice that the post has been deleted by the administrator. So it still junks up the post! LAME! Blogger please fix this! Thanks!  I'm trying out one of the new templates. It looks nice and all but since it's a template that many others will use I will most likely customize it to my liking. Not tonight of course since doing all that other crap sucked up my entire freakin' evening! Eh I enjoy tinkering with webpages. That was the best job ever, being a web developer... building stuff, being creative... but I digress.  Please leave me some feedback about this new blog compared to the old one. Does it suck? Do you like it? If you need something to compare against, please feel free to review the archives on to your right.

      This is a Fish Sticks Public Service Announcement: This concerns some changes to the Comments portion of my Blog, New Titles, and Linking Functionality.  For awhile tonight I decided to try and take advantage of the new Comment functionality that Blogger now offers. Of course by doing so it obliterated my old comments which I would like to have a record of. A work around for this problem was to not republish my entire blog but to instead only republish the index. This is of course until I accidentally republished the entire blog. Why can't blogger make this easy ferchrisakes?? Anyway, I still plan on moving over to the new Comment function. I just have to figure out the best way to do it. It made a horrendous mess tonight when I tried it so I plan on waiting a bit before I attempt it again to allow things to clear out.  I am also now taking advantage of the new Title function. So my title's will be spiffer and nicer to read now. I will no longer have to paste them and add     tags around my little headers again. Also I can add relevant Links to my titles! Of course no matter how much automated functionality Blogger now offers, I still had to edit the template to get my titles to link and edit the template to make the links a) not have underlines and b) launch in a new window.   If I get really ambitious tonight I will use the new template that I happen to like as well.  Wish me luck I think it will be messy.

      Phew, a night to myself. Oh happy day. Not that I mind having friends and family visit. I love seeing everyone I have in the last couple of weeks. It's just great to have my place to myself on such a lovely evening. It's also great to spend an evening at home without feeling rushed to go out just because it's Friday. I have lots of other stuff planned for the rest of the weekend so why not just enjoy my Friday for me? That's right! Me Time!  Speaking of me time. Here's some thoughts I have on life now as who I am today, at this moment, a single person living life. It's interesting. The whole grass is always greener thing. When you're single you don't want to be, and when you're not single you miss the good single times. At least some people feel that way. I know I have in the past. There are so many things I love about being single that it makes it difficult sometimes to imagine having to give those things up. The one thing I know I love the most is having time to myself. I can have a whole weekend to myself if I want it. Pretty much when I want it! I know when I've lived with people it's been tough to get time to myself and being single really makes me appreciate these moments.  I've had a lot of ups and downs in my dating life. Lots of highs and lows and while I'd definitely trade in some of them not all of my experiences were bad. What I take away from my life's experience up to this point is the knowledge that I'm just THAT much closer to what it is I'm looking for in my life. That thing I've always known I've wanted but haven't quite found yet. Sure I've wasted time doing other things which were just pointless, but it's all part of learning about who I am as a person. I've been on this road a long time and sure I've made mistakes but I'm happy with the person I'm still evolving to be. The person I was say 5 years ago or even 10 years ago is a complete stranger to the person I've become today.   I've been out there in the thick of things, fighting the good fight! Trying to experience life and find what I want. Trying this type of person, or that type of place to live. This type of friend, that type of social scene and so on and so forth. I'm not a perfect person and heck I may not even be a great person to some but this is who I am and this is who I have to work with. All I can do is strive to find happiness in my own life and hope to make others happy around me (at least some of the time). I can't justify who I am to people. All I can do is hope that people can understand and accept who I am if they so choose to. I'm not such a bad person. ;) Try me, you may like me!   Life's pretty nice. I've got a good group of friends that are pretty supportive of me. Amazing friends that bring a lot of joy and fun to my life. I could fill every night of the week spending time with a different friend and that thought makes me happy. It makes me happy to know that there are so many great people around me. Friends really are one of the most important things you can have in your life.   And hey not that I'm trying to redeem any brownie points but I've paid some dues and I'm thinking that maybe something extra special is just around the corner for me. You never know. Whether it is or not, it's just like that crappy song "Don't worry, Be Happy". Yeah the song stinks but it's spot on to how I'm feeling right about now.

      You ever know anyone who liked to piss on your parade? You say you like Chocolate and they say Chocolate sucks ass! Who the F*** would ever eat Chocolate?! Then a week later they're eating Chocolate and telling everyone it's cool? I know people like that. They make me nuts. I know there's a name for that kind of person/behavior (other than poser) but I can't remember what that is right now. What I do know is that people like that must be really unhappy because they feel the need to make other people unhappy with them. It's not that they don't like what you like, it's that you like it and they just don't want you to be happy. Even if it's Chocolate and Choclate rocks! Well piss on them!

      CBS is giving a million bucks away to one of the 18 All Star Survivors of YOUR choice!  Cast your vote  BEFORE Thursday for who should get the million bucks!  I voted for (Boston) Rob Mariano. Multiple times! He got robbed Sunday night. He should have won that million bucks. That was the whiniest most pathetic jury I've ever seen. Rob was absolutely the best player that game has ever seen and he totally deserves to walk away with the cash. I was almost completely pleased by the ending to this seasons survivor. I just think Rob and Amber should have switched places but otherwise it ROCKED!  Hate Rob and Amber all you want but I love 'em! Vote ROB! VOTE NOW! Even if you don't watch, go there and vote for Rob to win. You can vote as many times as you want .Come on! I'll give ya a dollar!   People are going to hate me. :P  VOTE ROB M.!

      So the power went out at work today as I was on my way out. No biggie for me. But man, I could have left a MINUTE sooner as the parking lot and surrounding streets were full of cars as everyone stampeded out of the buildings like rats from a sinking ship. The body wasn't even cold, damn! I wonder if the power is back on yet? I hope it stays out for a day or two and we don't have to go to work like when we were kids and school was snowed in. Well at least when I was a kid in elementary school in Michigan. Ohmygosh, that would rock! Of course I'm sure that won't be the case. Work sucks like that.  I saw  Kill Bill Vol 2.  tonight finally. Um. I liked it, but man was I tired afterwards. It sure was "wordy". Tarantino really likes his long drawn out character monologues. Like Bill's whole comic book hero analogy. Zzzzz. Get to the point already! I felt like that a few times during that movie. It was still a good movie nevertheless. They pretty much explained just about everything you might have wondered about the story line. As Johnny said, there really wasn't much to discuss afterwards. I'm interested to see how the whole thing flows as one movie when it finally comes out altogether on DVD.  Tomorrow is Toby's first day at  Dog's Life  Day Care. I took a little tour today and Toby got to run around with some of the dogs. He really loved it and I thought the facility was adorable. They're very new and just getting their clientele built up. I hope they're successful! We'll see how Toby likes it over the long run but it looks great. Now that dogs have been banned on campus I'm not the only msft dog owner that will be leaving their dog there during the day. Toby will only be going about once a week since he spends Mondays and Fridays at the house with Johnny's dog Luci and they get to go to the park during lunch and after work on those days. Duh me but there's a friggin' huge park including an off leash area for dogs a block from here. I guess I never walked him THAT direction. Silly.   Tonight I will attempt to go to bed early since I have to be up early to get Toby to day care. I want him to get his full day there! Plus Kammie's coming into town tomorrow evening and I want to be able to jet out of work at a decent time to see her. She'll be visiting at my place for two days then heading down to Santa Cruz this weekend. I always LOVE her visits. It's nice to see a good friend that you've known for years and can trust. Sometimes I feel that I just don't get to see enough of my really close friends. Having Cristy in Seattle and Kammie in Vermont makes things tough sometimes. Anyway, it will be great to see her.   Okay time to clean up the place, then get ready for bed. Or force myself to at least. I've been having some freaky messed up dreams again. Maybe it's too many horror films. I'm not sure how to "improve" the quality of my dreams. I'll take any suggestions anyone might have though!

      Wow the blogger dashboard interface thing has totally changed. For the better I think! Look at all that technology go! I like it so much now I may not move to movable type yet! I say that as if I was steadily working on this so called move to movable type and have now decided to stop. As opposed to doing nothing about it, which I was doing... which was nothing.  In another news, I am delaying my trip to Paris next month. Planning a trip with such short advance notice is a) costly and b) stressful. Plus  Sunny  needs to find a new apartment since she has since moved from her apartment and currently has no place to live until further notice. So I may go in September instead. I have a tattoo I'd like so she's already going to start working on a drawing for me. It's one I've wanted for a long long time and I think I'll just take the plunge and get it finally. Sure would be easier if she lived nearby! I'm okay with it all though. Monetarily it's the best decision.  My dad and stepmom were just in town for a few days. They had a nice time. We ate lots of great ethnic foods (since Virginia seems to have a shortage of good ethnic food)and did some sightseeing. I went on my first wine tasting trip ever to  Bonnie Doon Winery  with them. That place is in such a beautiful location and they have some of the coolest, wackiest, arty wine labels I've ever seen. I picked up a poster of this one. The wine is called "Il Circo-Uva di Troia "La Violetta" 2001". I wasn't a fan of how it tasted but the label is right up my alley. Plus the name too of course.   urlLink     I'm still thinking about the implications of moving to Seattle but not in any immediate sense. It's just a thought I'm toying around with along with the many other thoughts I toy around with all the time. I know I'm not ready to move just yet though. I *heart* California. I definitely do. I just don't *heart* the cost of living here. Not one bit. I'm just not ready to commit to any big decisions like that yet! Typical.  De La Soul was a fun show last night... except all the audience was white, or asian. Where were all the bruthas and/or sistahs? Seriously! It was a hip hop show ferchrissakes! Sigh. It was fun anyway! I was representin' and sheeit.  I got a fabulous hour long "Oxygen Luxury" facial today at  Beauty Clinica  which I enjoyed. I had to lay there with a mask on my face a bit too long but otherwise my skin feels fabulous now. The beauty regime they recommend you do for your skin is crazy though. You need like 6 bottles of crap to do a morning/evening thing. They were nice enough to give me samples to get me hooked on a bunch of stuff they'd like me to pay for. Maybe when I'm rich. No wonder why rich people look so good. If I was rich I'd get skin treatments and massages and crap all the time. I'd be fabulous seven days a week!   Next time I'm going to try the spa in Sunnyvale. It's my goal to find the perfect spa in this area, so I'll have to slowly try them all out. I say slowly cause getting a facial ain't cheap. It's not something I'm going to be doing that often. I need a massage next I think. I have to find a good place for that too.   I found two kick ass pictures at Goodwill that match my room perfectly. They are big framed prints. I'll take photos later. It's late now and I have to bathe the dog still. He rolled in dead bird today. Yummy.

      Reasons to move to Seattle: - Nice friendly people - Nice city with a good music scene - The ability to purchase a 3 plus bedroom home (with a friend) in the actual city - New friends - Family lives up there - New places to see and things to do - More job opps at Msft, more divisions  Reasons to stay in California: - The weather! - My job (I like my particular job, I love my boss) - My friends! ALL of my friends! So many friends! :'( - The food! So many varieties. - Tapioca Tea and Squid, I'm not sure if I can live without my fix. - The shopping!  - Proximity to LA, Tahoe and Las Vegas  I landed today and the weather was GORGEOUS and WARM. AHHH. Makes it hard to think about moving. It would be weird to leave SF. I love it here. We'll see I guess!

      Okay I'm still in Seattle, having a good time. It was supposed to rain yesterday and today. Yesterday it sorta sprinkled a tiny bit and today it's a bit windy and cold, but it's all good. Anyway, I read my yahoo horrorscopes today and I had to post them because for once they're pretty right on. Cristy and I got a good laugh out of them!  Daily Horrorscope from Astrology.com: This morning could be a bit tricky, mostly because you probably stayed up way too late last night -- but for wonderful reasons. Hang tough, though. By tonight, it will all be a distant memory, and you'll have your second wind.   Weekly Horrorscope from Astrology.com: You're feeling weirdly good for a Monday this week; take your fine self out on the town, even if it's just to a movie or a cafe. The person lucky enough to be with you or meet you there will be happy indeed. Midweek's all about getting better insight on romance, so look for it in unexpected places, and remember that the best way to get answers is to ask questions. Thursday and Friday both offer up possibilities for good times -- ones where the outcome is up to you. Things won't be so clear on the weekend; uncover a romantic hidden agenda (it could be your own!).   Yup Monday night was a good time out.... ahem. And I'm only a little hungover today. ;)

      This has to be the most special birthday gift I've gotten from anyone EVER. I got this quilt in the mail today that my grandmother made me for my birthday this year. She took family photos and pet photos and printed them onto material and then added them on to the quilt. It's so great! I'm in love with it and plan on running out tomorrow to get a rod to hang it on the wall.   Now that I've started knitting and crafting my own things, I realize how much time and care goes into making something. It makes me appreciate it that much the more. I even got a bit choked up seeing this. In particular she put a nice sewn message on the back of the quilt, with a picture of herself taken in the rose gardens in Seattle and the best part... a poem that I handwrote to her and my Grandpa when I was a little girl. Incredibly touching and sweet. That's my Grandma for you though... and my Grandpa for that matter. Both talented artistic, musical folks. I got my piano playing talent from my Grandmother for sure. In fact I think some of my personality definitely takes after my Grandma more than my dad or my mom for some reason. I relate more to her in a lot of ways, suprisingly.  I'll be up in Seattle this weekend visiting Cristy and friends, and hopefully she'll be around to spend an afternoon with. I LOVE YOU GRANDMA! THANKS FOR BEING YOU!   urlLink    Full Front View  urlLink    Top Section   urlLink    Bottom Section   urlLink    Full Back View   urlLink    Back Close Up

      Today Johnny and I head out to Pleasanton to check out the  Alameda County Fair . I hadn't been to it since High School back when I was living out in Livermore so I thought it might be fun to check it out again and see if it was any good. When we first got there we met a couple of weirdos... the guy who we paid for parking, rambling weirdo... and the guy who directed us to a parking space, jump in front of the car, flag waving weirdo... I was apprehensive about how the rest of the fair experience was going to go after those two.  Anyway, we headed into the fair and found that it was actually a pretty fun place to go. I particularly liked the fact that it wasn't very crowded. Probably bad for business but nice for us. We did arrive between 5:30 and 6pm but since it stays light out for so long it seemed like we got there much earlier. The fair stays open pretty late, up until 10pm for the exhibits/booths and midnight for the Carnival. Pretty cool!   There were lots of cool booths with goofy things for sale, both inside the buildings and outside on the walkways. I bought some pretty darn good beef jerky at one of the booths that I promptly inhaled. I had to go back and buy another piece of a different flavor because it was so tasty! There were lots of cooking demonstration booths and gadgetry booths. People were very nice and small town-like at the booths too. I liked the atmosphere a lot. There were also lots of exhibits for different types of things like hobbies, gardens, minerals, bees, art, etc. There was judging on the exhibits and we could see who won 1st prize or got honorable mention and so on. And don't forget the animals! Camel rides, petting zoo, animal exhibits... We saw lots of cute bunnies. They were selling animals too. $30 for your very own peacock! $6 for baby chicks! $6 for a baby duck! Great deals. I like the black tailed japanese hens, they were super pretty. I think those chicks were like $8 each.  As far as the actual carnival part went we rode two rides there. One was a mini rollcoaster which was fun but I had visions of our car jumping the track and us splatting on the pavement. We went on this other ride... Can't recall the name. I like to call it "ohmygod we're going to die!". I was super scared on that one. I'm just not as brave as I used to be I guess. Plus I have a distinct fear of Carnival Rides. They just don't seem that safe to me. I'll happily ride a coaster at a big park though where more deaths have probably occured, but that's beside the point!   Back to the ride... It looked like a big arm type thing with a round wheel bit at the bottom. Basically you go into the round wheel part and boost yourself up into your seat so your feet are dangling. A restraint, is lowered down over your head that holds you into the seat. The thing then starts to spin... Then the thing starts to swing to the left and to the right... and then the thing starts to swing higher, and higher and higher, so that at some point you're looking straight down at the pavement on the side of the ride way the heck up in the air, because you've swung completely up to one side or the other. It was never ending. I had to shut my eyes at one point because I had visions of the arm breaking and us splatting on the pavement. Or my restraint releasing and me falling out and splatting on the parking lot. Yeah, good times! I'd probably go on it again though. It was pretty thrilling. Heh.  The Carnival also contained lots of games for dumb stuffed prizes or goldfish. All your typical carnival games. Johnny tried to shoot a basket. 1 ball for $2 or 3 balls for $5. I played the water racing game where you shoot the water in the hole and try to be the first to get your bear to the top. $3 a play. Other games, like darts games were $5 for 3 darts. That's a lot of dough for a crappy stuffed toy. Suffice to say we didn't play more than one game and we didn't win crap.   The best part of the thing? The food! Oh if I wasn't on a diet, I would have gone nuts! As it was I bought a passion fruit and blue raspberry hawaiian shaved ice, beef on a stick, jerky and a soft pretzel. What I really wanted was fried calamari, fried mushrooms, bbq and so much more. Johnny ate a jumbo corn dog. That sucker was huge! Heck I would have eaten that too, even though I'm not a huge corn dog fan. I'm just craving the fried foods on this diet since I can barely have any.  So yes it was a good trip to the fair. We even got to see some National Guard Recruiters. See the photos below! After seeing  Farenheit 9/11  that was particularly amusing.   Oh and while I was writing this post I happened to find the website for  Butler Amusements . They're the folks that put on the Carnival. I discovered that the scary ride I was on is called, appropriately enough, "The Freakout". Which is described as follows: "This 16 seat carrousel that lifts its riders 22 meters in the air as they sit around a rotating 360-degree circle. This is a ride for the most daring teens and adults." No kidding.  See photo below. This sucker is a lot bigger looking in person. A LOT.   urlLink    The Freakout  If you're really bored you might want to check out the History of  Butler Amusements . It's actually kinda interesting. I find the whole Carnie thing interesting. Books make the old time carnivals out to sound like fun fascinating places to work and live. I'm sure modern day ones are much different now but it's still really interesting. I wonder if they all live in trailers still and have a strange community of carnies. It's different now though because there aren't freakshows and strange attractions anymore. It's just rides, food and games. I did feel a bit sorry for the carnies operating the games. They really have to hawk those games pretty hard. When the crowd is kind of sparse it's probably hard to earn a living. I'm sure they rake it in on other days too, so it evens out I guess.  So if you're in the bay area you should take some time and check out the  fair . It's a nice day out of the house and if you go July 9th you can catch the musical stylings of  Night Ranger ! Can't beat that! Admission is $9 to get in and $8 to park your car. Johnny and I were saying it should be free since the Fair is one big buy stuff event. Buy buy buy! Oh whatever, I had a good time! I only wish I could have bought a baby chick. So cute!   Photos by  Johnny .  Except the one I took of him, obviously.   urlLink    Heading in to the Fair   urlLink    Recruiters at the Fair!

      Tonight I met up with a group of folks, 8 of us in all, to have dinner then see Farenheit 9/11. For those of you out there that haven't heard of this, it's Michael Moore's documentary about Bush, the war on Iraq, Terrorism and much much more. I added a handy link in the title to the movie's website if you'd like to see a trailer or find out more about it. I also just read some news blurbs on  Michael Moore's website  about how the demand for the film was so high opening night in NYC that they decided to show the film all night long! As it was they were showing it every 45 min.   I loved this film for so many reasons. It touched me, made me laugh out loud, shocked me at times, and made me understand some things so much more than I had before. It's hard to describe everything that happened in this movie since there was so many points made, and I really think people need to see it for themselves and take away what they will from it.   A few movie points:  - The Bush Family's connection to the Bin Laden Family - The Bush Family's connection to Saudi Arabia - The senseless and needless killing of Iragi Civillians (very emotional) - Poor families being pushed into enlisting since there are no other jobs for them - The manipulation of the last election, and why Gore should have won - Families who lose children over in Iraq - Haliburton, Enron, The Carlyle Group and so many other companies in this war for profit  I could go on all night! Just take some time and go see it. Some of my friends wondered what it would be like to see this film in an area or with a crowd that isn't particularly pro-democrat or liberal. I'm not sure that anyone who wasn't that would go see the movie in the first place. There was definitely moments of applause and cheers during the film that made you realize exactly where most of the people in that theater stood.   I didn't vote for Bush in the last election and I sure as heck am not going to vote for him in the next election. I voted for Gore, not Nader or any other candidate. While I understand the points of view of folks voting for people like Nader or other candidates, I want Bush out of the white house so badly that I can only vote for Kerry in the next election. Absolutely.  Also, another point brought up tonight. Why does this film have an R rating? It totally didn't deserve it. There was nothing in that film that we hadn't already seen on the internet or on the news. Oh and remind me never to watch Fox News again, amongst other things. Yeeesh. Watching that film made me afraid for America. Afraid about who controls this country and how much money is changing hands at that level. Very afraid. If this film isn't showing in your area it will come out on DVD in September. If it is showing, get off your butt and go see it! Sorry for the sparse commentary. Tomorrow's an early morning, and I'm not one to argue politics, particularly at 1 something AM...  Synopsis of the movie from the  Farenheit 9/11 website :  "One of the most controversial and provocative films of the year, Fahrenheit 9/11 is Academy Award-winning filmmaker Michael Moore's searing examination of the Bush administration's actions in the wake of the tragic events of 9/11.   With his characteristic humor and dogged commitment to uncovering the facts, Moore considers the presidency of George W. Bush and where it has led us. He looks at how - and why - Bush and his inner circle avoided pursuing the Saudi connection to 9/11, despite the fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis and Saudi money had funded Al Qaeda. Fahrenheit 9/11 shows us a nation kept in constant fear by FBI alerts and lulled into accepting a piece of legislation, the USA Patriot Act, that infringes on basic civil rights. It is in this atmosphere of confusion, suspicion and dread that the Bush Administration makes its headlong rush towards war in Iraq ?and Fahrenheit 9/11 takes us inside that war to tell the stories we haven't heard, illustrating the awful human cost to U.S. soldiers and their families."  I spent about 5 years living in Flint, Michigan when I was in elementary school. I can't believe how much its changed since I was there, when it was a thriving community with jobs. It's povery stricken now with an official unemployment rate of 17% and as one woman in the film stated, a rate that's actually closer to 50%. Unreal. Most of the kids in that town wind up enlisting as a means to get to school or a better life. Now those kids are over in Iraq being killed for no reason. That's something everyone should think about and be aware about.   Be sure to visit the  website  for the film. It has some great resources on there.

      I know nothing about buying BBQ stuff. Yes I understand the basic concept of it and I've BBQ'ed before, many years ago. But overall I'm not as up on this as I could be. For my birthday Jeremy, Sabine and Theo got me a gift certificate to  Amazon . I decided after much deliberation to get a mini Weber BBQ. To go along with it I also ordered an 18" BBQ grill brush, a Weber BBQ Mitt, A BBQ tool set with case and a Weber Chimney Starter for the coals.  So far I've received the bbq, brush and chimney starter. I canceled the mitt since I figured it was overkill and the shipping was delayed. I'm still waiting for the bbq tools. Anyways, I thought I'd put up a little photo of what my three items look like. As you may or may not be able to tell from the shot, I ordered a little weenie bbq and giant accessories. That chimney starter is huge! I could bbq out of that thing alone! I need like 4 coals to heat my bbq and that thing holds 500. Seriously. It's as heavy as the damn bbq.   I feel stuck with it though since with shipping it cost $18.00 and if I send it back it will cost $5 for shipping plus a 15% restocking fee since it was from a company that sells through Amazon. (Note: You can only use a gift certificate on "Amazon" items, no subsidiaries, such as any of the apparel companies, what a joke) So if anyone out there needs a chimney starter I have one for sale real cheap! I can make do with the gi-normous grill brush because those 4 coals can get darn hot and you'll want to keep your arm away when scrubbing the crap off the grill. Yes indeedy. I can't wait for the tools to get here either, I can probably stand a good 3-4 feet away with those when flipping a burger. Nice!  By the way, the blogger spell checker doesn't like the word "BBQ". Apparently this should be replaced with BBC. I'm a posting maniac tonight!   urlLink    My new Smokey Joe "Gold" Weber BBQ

      Brody is a little boy kitty that lives in the building next to mine. I first met him a couple of months back when he used to run out to hang out with Toby in the mornings when he was out back doing his morning you know what. Toby and Brody get along great. Brody lets Toby chase him and he puts up with him sniffing his butt all the time. That's some love for ya. Brody is the friendliest cat you could ever meet. I'm suprised someone hasn't run off with him! For a long time there I wasn't sure he had a home since he doesn't wear a collar. One day when Johnny was over walking the dogs he met Brody's owner. Brody's owner has a dog so it makes sense why he has no fear of them at all.   I'm not a big cat fan, I've said this before. Even though I do own a cat. But seeing Brody and Toby play together makes me wish I had a cat like him. My cat Olivia, HATES Toby with a passion. In fact they hate each other. Toby used to be afraid of her but now he just chases her if she's bitchy to him. I guess she deserves it sometimes so there you go. Either way, it would be nice if they got along better. Olivia loves to drive me crazy too. She's a smart cat but she does things for attention that makes me nuts.   Case in point, just now she tried to jump up on me while I'm in my leather chair. She of course can't make it since she's aimed at the skinny little armrest. So instead she hangs there by her claws on the arm, waving the other arm in the air, finally catching MY arm with it. She then falls backwards putting a HUGE scratch in the arm of the chair and a one on MY arm as well. Ouch! Bad bad kitty! Sigh. Don't even get me started on the five tons of cat hair that sits on everything around my house like a layer of dust. Toby doesn't shed!

There were lots of good photos to be had too. I was obsessed with the fact that I'd lost my lovely white flower that went with my shirt. So I spent a bunch of time wandering around looking for it and asking about it and getting lots of deflowered jokes as a result.

      My first week of  Weight Watchers  I went over my 20 pts a day, 35 flext pts a week limit by a whopping 46 points! It doesn't help that I had fried food twice in one day which totally tipped it over the edge. There's a nice fat - 46 in red on my chart for that week, ouch. I still weighed in at 2lbs less than I put my starting weight at. I calculated that starting weight by what I weighed at the doctor's office, since I'd been so many times in the past couple of weeks. I'd been at that weight steadily for months. So that first week of 2lb weight loss is questionable.  Week 2 just ended yesterday and had 1 pt left to spend! Yay me! No red marks, no overspending. This morning I weighed in at 2lbs less than the week before! That's 4lbs total (ahem) weight loss since I started. I don't feel any thinner, but yesterday at the fitness place my trainer asked me if I'd lost some weight so that made me feel good. I'm still not really drinking water, except a glass a night which is bad. So that needs to change at some point. I know it will help but I hate drinking water. I know I'm sooo unhealthy. I love doing this Weight Watchers thing though. I love being able to eat what I want (pretty much)as long as I eat only what points I'm alloted for the day. So today for example I ate a very small bit of frosted chocolate cake at a baby shower and it only cost me 3 pts. Yay! Of course I went over by 8 pts today because I snacked a bit too much but I still have 27 out of 35 flex points left for the week.   Lately I find myself filling up my smaller portioned dinners by eating more steamed veggies. Veggies are a zero point food, if you eat it moderately. If you eat a ton of it eventually it will cost you. After all Weight Watchers is all about portion control. That first week I was sure I wasn't going to make it. Now I feel a lot better about my chances for success. The key to this, for someone like me who eats out a lot, is to plan ahead. So Monday for example I knew I was going to be out for dinner, so I looked up some food choices and picked what I knew I could wind up having that evening. If you go out not knowing how many points something's going to cost you, it's very easy to use up all your points quickly.   For example, I love fried calamari. It's called Squid Tubes at Tapioca Express, my favorite local tapioca tea shop. This has got to be my most favorite snack of all time. I get 20 points a day to spend, that's it. If I go over it eats into my flex points. 1 cup of fried calamari, which is about what's in a bag there, costs a whopping 21 pts! That's more than a whole days worth of points! So as you can see, I have to save up for stuff like that, and it can maybe only happen once a week.   Anyway, I am surviving and liking it. Thanks to C for suggesting Weight Watchers to me! She definitely inspired me and I'm grateful. I need to lose 12lbs. 4 down, 8 to go. I have a feeling that when I get down 12 lbs I may need to lose a few more, but let's start out with a small goal and see how that goes. ;)

      Finally I figured out how I would reconcile having Snor comments and Blogger comments. Since I'd started out with Snor comments I didn't want to republish my entire blog thereby losing those old comments. Reading C's blog gave me the answer. Why not just publish two means of commenting? Snor or Blogger? So when I republished my entire blog with the Snor snippet in the template the old comments would still remain. So now you have a choice to post blogger comments or Snor comments. I know  Jenn  prefers Snor comments since she won't have to register to use blogger to post non-anonymous comments. She can just use the Snor form. So where it says "other comments", those are also known as Snor Comments. Snor being the name of the script I used to put them together. I'm just happy I don't have to delicately republish only the index page, and I can now have all my pages looks the same. I'm sure you don't care but it makes a world of difference to me!

      Sure knitting's cool and all but I can't find a cool poncho/shawl knitting pattern ANYWHERE. Then I realized that's because most of them are crocheted, not knitted. So I've decided to take up crocheting now for awhile. My grandma taught me how to do these years ago and honestly I think crocheting is much easier than knitting, so hopefully I'll be able to whip out some cute ponchos in no time. I just can't find the one I want in stores and the ones that are somewhat nice cost an arm and a leg.   So after an extensive search online I found  Becka's Boutique  on ebay. She creates and sells really cute crochet patterns which she auctions off or sells in her ebay store. I bought 4 of her patterns. They're very cheap and she emails them to you once you've paid for them, so no shipping costs or waiting around for the pattern to show up in the mail. I'm excited to get started on something new other than making wristbands or scarves for a change. What's particularly nice about these patterns is how little yarn they take to make. Plus they're supposed to be quick and easy to make.   I'd like to get started on one this weekend. It looks to be a low key weekend since I have to go into work for a bit on Saturday. Friday I'll see  Farenheit 9/11  with a group of friends. Saturday night... who knows. Maybe nothing for a change! I'll have my new mini weber by then so maybe I'll have a mini bbq.   I've been reading  Middlesex  by Jeffery Eugenides. So far it's interesting. I'm not sure I'm loving it yet, but it's different than my usual read. I'll post more about it when I'm done with it. Oh, Dave and I saw  The Stepford Wives  last week. I'm not even going to go into a whole explanation of why it was bad. Let's just say it was really bad.... so bad I didn't get it in the end, if you can believe that. As in, what just happened here? Huh, wha? Eh. Poor Matthew Broderick. Please, whatever you do, go rent the  original , read the  book , just don't see the new one. Dave and I always go see the dumbest movies. But I like that about him. I can go see all the big budget hollywood movies with him whereas my friends generally like to see more serious or indie stuff. We're going to go see  Dodgeball  together possibly. Heh.  And last but not least, Dave announced his engagement (during a friends bday party I might add, tsk tsk) on Saturday night. So congrats Dave! It's not a shocker in the least, since this has been in the works from the first date practically... but now it's official, ring and all. Another one bites the dust! That leaves Becky and myself, out of the original gang, as the remaining unmarried ones. Typical. I'm not gonna get started on that topic though. Let's just end things on a nice happy note. :)

      So maybe I shouldn't have watched The Ashlee Simpson show on MTV after that last post. Holy crap she's just as vapid as her sister Jessica. Plus she doesn't even know how to clean. I mean who the hell grows up not knowing how to sweep a floor? It's not like she's Paris Hilton or anything. Oh to live the life of a totally spoiled brainless 19 year old. Yuck! The Simple Life 2 was pretty bad as well. The only redeeming moment was watching Paris Hilton get thrown off a horse and stepped on. What was even better was watching the ranch owner pick a big clod of dried up poo or as he called it an "organic" out of her hair. Hah!  Last Comic Standing on the other hand is great. The comics are funny and fun to watch. I'm watching the second half of the Las Vegas finals where they pick the remaining five comics to live in a house of ten comics, until they are all eliminated down to one. I'm also really enjoying Celebrity Poker Showdown this season. It's fun to watch people play Texas Hold 'Em. Particularly amusing celebrities. Makes me wanna start up a poker game!   And yes, I have a pain in my neck. Another pinched nerve I think. I can't even turn to the right at all without moving my whole body. I made an appointment to see my Chriopractor aka Magic Healing Fingers Lady tomorrow. I've had some weird issues with my back and pinched nerves in the past that she's always been able to work out for me. She's more of a muscle worker/back doctor then just the crappy sports doctors you go to that crack your back and kick you out. She's truly a magic worker. I'm taking the morning off work and heading to the city to get this thing fixed. I was going to make some low fat brownies tonight but considering I can't even bend down to pick something up I may have to put that off until tomorrow.   On other fronts I met with a therpaist on Wednesday who was nice. She's probably going to wind up referring me to someone else, but we had a good talk nevertheless. Basically after I filled her in on everything she told me at the end that I was very insightful and knowledgeable about my own life. She commended me on coming to see a therapist to have someone to talk to even though I already pretty much knew what to do and how to do it. She said it's good to have support rather than "white knuckling" your way through issues. I agree and will go back next week to meet with her again. Meeting with her gave me strength and resolve about some issues that I'd been wavering on. I'm hoping to find a therapist that my medical plan covers so it doesn't break the bank so to speak. For now I have my three free visits.  Karoke night was nice last night as well since my friend Shannon came for the first time. It was mellow and we didn't stay too long. Toby was a bit of a terror, which is unusual since usually he's pretty well behaved there. He kept chasing people around barking at them. Everyone's so sweet to him though. I don't bring him everytime but once in awhile it's nice to tote him along. Next Karaoke night is Shawn's birthday. Shawn is one my generous friends and he's the organizer of these nights every other Wednesday at his 049 Lounge Space in SOMA. He also throws a great monthly party there as well. This month's party is Mark's birthday which is happening this Saturday. It promises to be a big one since there's already over 70 Yes RSVPs and counting. Happy Birthday Mark!  Have I mentioned yet how much I love summer? I love it! Warm sunny days are great. I am particularly loving having my patio right now and the ability to actually plant things and watch them grow. I've decided to be frugal and use part of my birthday gift certificate to buy a mini charcoal weber vs a gas grill for my patio. It's just a small table top weber but I'm starting to get tired of smelling my neighbors bbq'ing just about every night and want to do my own bbq'ing! Plus I can have some folks over at some point or we can tote the thing to the park (unlike last time where we had no bbq!). Sure it would be great to live in the city one day but I look around me at the place that I have, the cheap rent I pay, and the great sunny/non-foggy warm days I have here, with no work commute, and I think, damn I can't beat it! Sure I'll move at some point but for now, things are good. I can go outside and hear quiet. No cars roaring by, no pollution or crime in front of my door. I'm content.  Okay back to watching the rest of Last Comic Standing. Then I might have to lay down or something to get my neck in a good position. Oh btw, I'm reading  Digital Fortress  by Dan Brown. It's his first book I believe. A bit corny in some parts but a fun read. Defintely not as good as his later works, ie The Da Vinci Code but if you're a fan like I am then you'll enjoy it. I recommend it for good pool side, beach laying, patio sitting reading. Now if only he had some more books out. I'm going to have to dig back through the giant box of Dean Koontz books I bought off ebay for more reading material once this one's done. Which will probably be tonight.

      The other day this friend of mine was telling me that just about all of her friends were from work/people that she'd met at work. I said wow, next to none of my friends were from work. I mean honestly, I couldn't imagine only have friends from work! That would be really weird. I mean can you imagine if everyone you hung out with did the same type of job you did or worked on the same type of things? I get sick enough of dealing with work when I'm there much less hanging out with everyone from there as well. Don't get me wrong, I work with some cool folks but that doesn't mean on the weekend I want to party down with all of them either.   Where I work a lot of folks are married or not into what I'm into per se. Some of the people there are kind of pretentious too. Not so much in my group but there are people like that. In the tech industry people make a decent wage so you tend to get folks, those that are not supporting a family with kids I mean, throwing a lot of money around. It's a little nauseating at times. Like oh, look at my new fancy car, or my new fancy apartment, or this condo I plunked 600K plus down. It can be pretty materialistic. I guess I say this because not all my friends are made of money and are about money. I have friends that are students, artists, musicians, unemployed, techies, writers, etc. I think my life is that much richer for having such a diverse group of friends. I get exposed to so much more than I would if I had a limited group of friends.  When I was not hanging out so much and just hanging out with my last boyfriend, who worked where I work, things were much more materialistic. More about having stuff, and buying stuff and getting the best stuff. Now that I'm with everyone again, it's not about stuff so much. Sure I still shop and buy stuff, but not like I used to. Plus I have to be more conscious about money when I'm with friends who can't just throw money at everything. It's not so bad because I find myself being more frugal which is always a plus. I do still have friends that make a lot of money, but those friends can be generous with our friends that don't make a ton. It's nice though, I can buy a friend a gift that they really need because hey, they don't make tons of money so they don't own everything under the sun! There's actually things they may want or need that they just don't run right out and buy. Things that they appreciate.  Honestly I find it a bit disgusting when people just throw money at stuff. You know there are many many people out there that can't do that. They can't say, oh ho hum, I don't like *this* let me toss some money at it so I can feel better. What an empty existence that is! Money doesn't make the world go 'round. It may make you more comfortable but you can't buy friendships with it. Not real ones at least. Plus it's wasteful. I know some folks that just waste money like it's nothing. Even though I may have some money it doesn't mean I'm just going to toss it at anything I want whenever I want. I actually consider costs before I just buy something these days. Sure it's nice to have whatever you want and the best of the best but that doesn't mean you have to waste your money. Frugality is a good thing. Besides who are you showing off to anyways? I mean if you want to attract materialistic folks, then be a materialistic person. If you want to attract real people, be yourself, and they'll love you now matter what you have, how big or small, how good or bad. Trust me, I know! :)

      Have you heard about this new show? (Link in title!) It seems just SLIGHTLY over the top! It actually seems rather creepy to me. Particularly considering how Michael Hutchence died. I wonder if they'll get some look alike or sound alike. Yup creepy!

      Okay the initial shame of the weekend has burned away since I spoke to many many folks who were there who all reassured me that I didn't do anything dumb or say anything particularly stupid. I was just wasted. So that's cool. I guess as everyone said it's not like I do this all the time so best to not repeat the scenario. That way I won't get the reputation of being the lushy girl at the party, unlike other folks I know! Heh.   My mood's improving too. I called this program at work to make a therapy appt for myself. I'm in the mood to re-evaulate my life right now and I think this is a good step to take. I still think on and off about moving up to the city and how much easier that would make things for me socially since I'd be close to home when I go out and have crazy nights. Having to get home that night or the next day is hard to impossible at times. It would make life easier in that sense but I do love where I live, its so nice and convenient. I also save a lot of money living here in rent/gas etc. In fact I think if I lived in the city I'd be out almost every night since it would be easier for me to get out and about with friends. I definitely don't think that would be a plus considering.  I'm still feeling a little under the weather from the weekend but I'm rapidly improving. My high school buddy Dave's over and we're going to go see the Stepford Wives and eat popcorn. I started Weight Watchers last week and so far it's been good, except I used up 8.5 points on White Wine this weekend then blew 21.5 points on my most favorite snack of all, Squid Tubes from Tapioca Express. Man I love that stuff! It was my hangover food yesterday. I am down a little bit in weight already and my goal is to lose 12 lbs. I only get 20 pts a day to spend on food so suffice to say the first two days were pretty painful to adjust to. I get 35 flex points a week to spend and with my squid, wine and the bad stuff I ate at BFD I'm down to only 5 pts left to spend until Thursday when they reset. I think I can make it!  Anyway, just a quick post to say I'm Okay. And thanks to C, for posting the spa suggestion. I'm going to go get another facial this week, that will definitely make me feel better! I like how my funks only last hours now instead of days. Such a vast improvement from earlier times in my life. It shows progress I guess. Oh and Dave said while the photos weren't the most flattering of me, I didn't look like a fat slob. Thanks Dave!

      Okay I've had it. Party party party is getting old old old. I had fun at Sabine's Birthday party Saturday night but I got WAY too drunk. I hate getting that drunk. You get sloppy and silly and do dumb things. Everyone keeps telling me that yes while I was completely drunk I didn't do anything too stupid. Sure sure, that's all well and good but it would be nice if I could actually remember those details. In fact I can't remember a lot of things that happened which really bothers me. I can't remember the last time I was THAT drunk. There was a party awhile back where I got pretty crazy drunk but not like this. This was just completely over the top. At least I didn't get sick or pass out. Amazing really.   Anyways, I'm embarassed. These photos of me that people took are horrendous! I look fat and sloppy in them. My gut is hanging out of my pants and I look ridiculous. I know I'm being harsh right now but it's what's necessary for me to address the fact that I did a stupid thing. I was talking to Jackie today about how every weekend is just one party after another. This next weekend will be Mark's birthday party. It's overwhelming and getting tiring at this point to spend every weekend party'ing. This is part of the reason I don't live in the city. I like having my distance, my sanctuary to get away from the whole scene. My apartment is my oasis away from all the craziness.   To be honest, while I enjoy being social and having fun, I really want to "settle" down at some point. I want to ocassionally go do these things, but not all the time. I want to have a normal life where things are done in moderation. I want to find that right person and have someone to share things with. It's not much to ask for really, people do it all the time. I'm just stuck in this cycle that I can't seem to get out of. It's always one extreme or another but never that happy medium. I either stay in all the time or go out all the time. I hate it really. I try very hard to not let things like this get me down but this weekend took it's toll on me. What I've never understood is how some of the people I know can live like this ALL the time. It's just too much for me.  Anyways, I'm sure tomorrow I'll be chipper again but tonight I'm just feeling in a down mood. Honestly I'm feeling fat, unattractive and very alone. I hate that. Tomorrow will be a better day.

      Quick post before bed!  I took Friday off of work to go to Live 105's annual BFD show. This entails a long lineup of bands playing at the Shoreline Ampitheater over an 11 hour period. Seeing as how I'm inherently lazy I wasn't about to go for all of it. Jeremy came by earlier in the day and we went shopping for Sabine's birthday present. We found something nice for her at Crate and Barrel, can't say what yet since we haven't given it to her. The present is from Theo, Jeremy and I though. Which is kinda cool since my birthday present was from all three of them. Joint gifts are always nice and easy to do.   Anyway, J and I headed over to the show a little after 4pm and met up with Katherine and Kevin. While we were waiting for them we got to hear The Rapture playing in the sub sonice tent. They didn't sound very good at all, so I'm glad I wasn't actually watching them. The Shoreline Ampitheather was completely crowded. It took us a little while to get our bearings and even longer to find the beer ID booth. This year's BFD theme was comic books. The program was done as a comic book and the logo had that POW! look to it.   We missed all the bands earlier in the day such as The Stills, The Von Bondies and Death Cab for Cutie.We also unfortunately missed the local band stage. A band called Communique from Oakland were playing and I would have liked to catch them. Jeremy is friends with the band and their single "Perfect Weapon" has been getting a lot of airplay on Live 105. If you haven't heard them before you should  head over to their website  and check them out. They're kind of an 80's throwback band. You'll know what I mean when you hear their single. They sound so good though, not like just any local band. They're album is actually very well produced. I met Rory and Corey from the band last week after Zero 7. I had missed their show that night since I was at the other show but still stopped by 330 Ritch afterwards to see everyone. They were really nice guys and I look forward to seeing them when they play again.   Okay so back to BFD. So while waiting for The Streets to start we unforuntately had to listen to New Found Glory playing on the next stage. Yuck! Pass! Luckily we got out of that area fast enough and after a long wait we caught The Streets in the Sub Sonic tent after catching the end of Dizzee Rascal, who I didn't really warm up to. I happen to really like The Streets and no one else had really heard them before. Their show was okay but the sound in the tent really sucked so I had a hard time really getting into the show and into the music. We only stayed for a few songs before we jumped over to the next stage, which was RIGHT NEXT to the tent. No clue why they did that, probably a space issue. It sucked though since the sounds kind of overlapped. Anyway, we caught Bad Religion on that stage, who are always pretty good. Boy are those guys getting old! They still sound strong though. We caught most of that show before heading out to get garlic fries and cheesesteaks. Ohmygoodness Garlic Fries are the greatest thing ever! That is of course until you get towards the bottom of the container and start feeling grossed out from all the garlic and grease, but those first few bites are heaven!   The food line was horrendous so we wound up missing a lot of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs on the main stage. We had lawn seats (bad idea!) and parked ourselves up their to catch the last couple of songs. After that set we caught The Violent Femmes who were really great. It's funny that after all these years of going to shows I've never seen them play. It wasn't a visually exciting show per se, but they sounded great as well. Just like Bad Religion, the Femmes have been around FOREVER and are getting up their in age. It was fun (weird?) to see these little 12 year olds going crazy during the songs. Their music never gets old I guess!  After the Violent Femmes was the highlight of the evening. The "Special Guest Appearance" by the Beastie Boys. Calling it a "Special Guest Appearance" seems to imply that it's barely a set or only a few songs. But they played a pretty full set. Kevin said it was about 12 songs. They also came out for an encore. Katherine commented that it was a much better performance then when we saw them at Coachella and I'd have to agree. They played some new material as well as the old stand bys like Root Down, Body Movin', Three MCs and One DJ, Intergalactic, So What'cha Want and more. Their encore song was their new single, Ch-Check It Out. I'll probably pick up their new album. I always love seeing Mixmaster Mike do his thing. He's only one of the greatest scratch DJs ever!  The show headliner/ender was The Strokes. I really like The Strokes and this was my first time seeing them live. They sounded pretty good except I'm pretty sure the lead singer was either very drunk, a total freak or both tonight. He spent a lot of time jumping off the stage and wandering the crowd, pushing or trying to push speakers off the stage. Falling down on his face, falling down on his back, slurring, stumbling and much more. It was amsuing yet bizzare and almost distracting. I think he must have been drunk, he was just too freaky and sloppy to be anything but that. They mainly played material off their last album and never played Last Nite, which I"m sure they're sick of but I still love it! We jetted out of their during their last song to beat the rush of the crowd.  All in all BFD was okay. I think if I were to go again I'd for sure get seats. The lawn was way too crowded, covered in garbage and just all around disgusting. Seats are the way to go even if they are all the way in the back. I got really sick and tired of people cutting through our area where our blanket was, and stepping on everything as well as kicking garbage on us. Gross. Oh I saw someone I hadn't seen in years today too from the Rockabilly days in Santa Cruz. Dina! It was nice to see her, and she caught me up on some bits and pieces of news from some folks we used to know. She looked great too. Other than her though I didn't run into anyone else which was amazing. Usually you ALWAYS see someone you know, I guess Dina counts for today.  So while I'm not a fan of festival type shows anymore I had a pretty good time regardless and it was totally worth it to see the Beastie Boys. Definitely great! On the way out of the show tonight I got a coupon good for a week to get half off tickets for Lollapalooza. I went the first two years of Lollapalooza but I haven't been since then. It's been many years. Katherine, J and I decided that we should go to Day 1 since its half off in order to catch Morrissey. Modest Mouse is also playing and I'd love to see them. So it looks like we'll be heading back to the Shoreline again next month for yet another festival show! This time we're getting seats!  Okay so this wasn't a quick post... Tomorrow is Sabine's birthday party. J and I picked up ingredients tonight to make Sangria to go with her gift. This will be my first time making Sangria. I don't even like the stuff so hopefully it turns out okay. Boy am I tired and garlicky! Time to pass out.

      So V and I checked out the re-Invetion tour at the HP Pavillion tonight. I've never seen Madonna once in the 20 years that I've been a fan of her music so what the hell why not now? We paid less than face value for our tickets, which was a bonus! Seems that people overbuy and then have a hard time getting rid of them at the last minute so their loss is our gain. Our seats were in the upper level but we could still see the lay of the stage pretty well. The big screen monitors helped too of course.   It took me awhile to really get into the show since the first half of it was so darn political. Madonna really likes the in your face disturbing imagery schtick. Lots of emaciated children and war torn countries. She had a whole bit where everyone wore army outfits and had rifles. She also re-mixed all of her songs, so some upbeat songs became ballads, and some more electronically enhanced then others. I got into the show more when she played songs that were a) more popular and b) more easily recognizable. Overall it was an entertaining show but I'm not sure if I'm getting too old for big arena concerts or if I thought she was just a bit too weird at times. At one point she and her dancers came out wearing shirts emblazoned with "Kaballists Do It Better". Which she eventually stripped off after singing a great version of "Crazy For You" (for the fans that have been around for 20 years!) and threw into the audience (she had her white tank top underneath). There was definitely a lot of Hebrew writing and influence in the show. She also did a few songs playing electric and acoustic guitar which was okay. She's definitely a strummer, not a picker.  My favorite bit was the filler circus themed act. They had a guy skating a half pipe and a pretty darn kick ass break dancer doing his thing on the stage. There was also a pretty cool tap dancer during that bit as well. This intro led into Madonna coming out in a 20's type outfit and singing "Hanky Panky", which was never a song I would have considered a huge hit. It's also a song that's a million years old, but whatever, this is a greatest hits show. I also really liked her version of "Don't Tell Me" but instead of Cowboys, everyone had berets with a cool old black and white scene of Paris in the background. They still broke out some of the cool two step from the video. I love that video! Madonna also did an emotional version of Imagine by John Lennon which showed lots of scenes of children and signs of Peace all over the world. She's definitely changed a lot over the years, it's kind of cool that she's still around and still actually pretty good. I mean her voice was great! She didn't dance during this show as much as I'd like to have seen but overall as I said earlier, it was entertaining.   Couple of other interesting points. T-shirts were selling from $50-$65 apiece and programs were $30 each. Ouch. There were NO encores.  Here's the set list: 01. The Beast Within 02. Vogue 03. Nobody Knows Me 04. Frozen 05. American Life 06. Express Yourself 07. Burning Up 08. Material Girl 09. Hollywood 10. Hanky Panky 11. Deeper and Deeper 12. Die Another Day 13. Lament 14. Bedtime Story 15. Nothing Fails 16. Don't Tell Me 17. Like A Prayer 18. Mother And Father 19. Imagine 20. Into The Groove 21. Papa Don't Preach 22. Crazy For You 23. Music 24. Holiday   If you're not an  entertainment weekly  subscriber than you won't be able to view all the photos they have of her opening night. So just for you guys I've copied them and posted them right here!    urlLink    Singing Lament from Evita in an Electric Chair   urlLink    Doing a pretty cool version of Vogue   urlLink    Wearing a Burka during American Life (she didn't do this for our show, but a dancer did)   urlLink    Playing the Soldier during American Life    urlLink    Singing Hanky Panky in the Circus act   urlLink    Getting a little more upbeat during a pretty cool segment with a Scottish bagpiper and Scottish drummers   urlLink    Helping to spell out FREEDOM with her butt

      Just finished this scarf for my stepmom last night. I wanted to get it done before I got too busy this week. Plus last night was my only free night for the week. Tonight I go see Madonna (woo!) at the HP Pavillion in San Jose. I'll post reviews on that show later. I still need to post Birthday pics as well which I will try and take care of this week. I promise!   urlLink    Berry Parfait Deco Ribbon and Splash Yarn Scarf   urlLink    Close up view - Scarf is unstretched

      Thanks for all the well wishes I've recieved from friends and blogger friends alike. You guys are the best! I'm fighting the good fight right now and keeping cool in order to keep the hives at bay. They're right there on the surface ready to bust a move. I'm taking another dose of allergy meds before I go out tonight. I had a nice long chat with my allergist today who told me to get off the antibiotics and take some more allergy meds to see how that works. Oh and all my blood and urine work came back fine. No weird diseases. Yay!  So far I've gotten a couple of nice cards, some really nice gifts and phone calls from friends and family. Everyone's been so sweet. I'm really looking forward to seeing everybody tonight as well. The dinner reservation has jumped up to 23 people at this point due to a couple of last minute RSVPs. So it promises to be a big turnout. I still can't believe I'm in my 30's sometimes. My 21 year old fitness trainer today was saying it was weird for him to call me a lady versus a girl cause I don't seem as old as I am at all. I definitely don't feel like I'm in my 30's most of the time, unless I'm talking to some 19 year old then I REALLY feel older. But otherwise I'm still pretty young at heart.  So another year has come and gone. Here's to being 33!

      Okay, September must be a popular month to get your freak on because good lord! There are a ton of birthdays this month! There are THREE birthday parties this weekend including my own. Sabine's birthday party is next weekend and Mark and his friend Chris are having their birthday shindig the weekend after that. My Aunt Bonnie's birthday was today, Mine tomorrow, My Cousin Larry's on the 6th, My Aunt Brenda's on the 10th.... not including all the other people I know of who are having birthdays really soon as well. It's crazy! Maybe it's the June wedding thing then you get pregnant 3 months later or something like that. Anyway... it's an epidemic!  Today my hives came back again. Not in full force thank goodness but rashy and ugly nonetheless. I had a nice fat upper lip too, yuck. I even took my prednasone today. I went back to see my allergist and he gave me some more prednasone. He's going to taper me off it for one additional week. I also did some blood work to rule out any possibility of anything major like diabetes, thyroid etc. Although I did go out to see Zero7 last night and proceeded to show hop and hang out til 4am. Which might have not been good for the immune system but my doctor said that was irrelevant. He's looking for a more long term cause he says. I'm hoping this just goes away once I'm done with the antibiotics etc. If it doesn't then I'll have to take a new allergy test, possible nasal cavity xrays etc. Let's just be positive at this point though and say it will go away. Particularly since my party is tomorrow night and god forbid I'm some rashy mess! I look better now and I'm going to bed soon to get lots of rest so there better not be any hives raining on my parade!  Oh and yes,  Zero7  was fabulous. i've been a fan for awhile though, ever since Raul turned me on to them a few of years back. In fact everytime I hear them I have to lend a little thought to Raul. He has the best taste in chill music sometimes. It's great. He also turned me on to Buddha Bar, Goldfrapp and others. Thanks Raul! Zero7 reminds me of pink and blue sunsets over beautful blue oceans. Dusky twilights and warm desert nights. I was saying to my friend Katherine that it reminds me of being some place like Palm Springs. I totally want to go back there on another vacation. I love that place. I used to love to listen to "mood" music when I lived in Dominica, this tiny island in the West Indies. The sunsets were amazing, breathtaking, awe inspiring. I still remember the feeling of standing out on the front porch of the house on the hill I lived in when I was 12 and 13. Except instead of listening to Zero7 I listened to Melissa Manchester for weepy songs. Haha! Hearing Diana DeGarmo sing Don't Cry Out Loud on American Idol sure brought back some memories!  I saw my ex-boyfriend at the show but we didn't speak. I seem to recall the first time I ever played Zero7 for him, he said they sucked. I guess going to shows like that and liking that music now comes with the "new" him. Its so typical though. I mean how many times have you gone out with a guy who's said, oh that sucks, or yuck when you like something but the minute their friends or someone else or whatever brings it into their radar suddenly it's cool! Like I said, TYPICAL. Not unlike when I first started blogging and he said I was gay for doing it and now he blogs. And so it goes.  I saw  urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  today. It was great! I loved the first one and wasn't too jazzed on the second Harry Potter movie. This one has a whole new director. Instead of Chris Columbus aka I directed Mrs. Doubtfire, they decided to go a whole new route by picking Alfonso Cuarón aka I directed Y tu mamá también, which I still haven't seen. Although Alfonso did direct A Little Princess which I really liked.  Okay so the story, yes of course it's great. I've read all the books so far and this book is one of my favorites. I was a bit thrown off by some slight changes they did in the plot line but I was able to get beyond that and still get into the plot. I was also expecting a bit more polished hollywood looking film and the opening sequence alone, with the slightly shaky handheld camera really threw me off. The film as a whole had a totally different lighting to it then I was used to. More natural light in some scenes, more gritty in others. I love the transitioning of the seasons and the focus on scenes in nature. It had such a different vibe to it and it made me enjoy it for more than just a blockbuster hollywood film. It came across as more original to me, more unique.   The casting was good overall too. Emma Thompson was okay as Professor Trelawney, amusing but irrelevant. David Thewlis as Professor Lupin, the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher was great! I've never been a big fan of his work and more often than not saw him in bad guy roles, but he was very endearing in this film. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was good albeit small. We'll be seeing him again though. No, I'm not giving anything away. Just go read the plot synopsis for any of the subsequent books. Anyway, I've always dug Gary Oldman and I still do. The new Dumbledore was blah. It's weird not having Richard Harris around anymore. He brought a kind of quiet grace to Dumbledore. I found that the new actor spoke faster, was a bit more intense and not as dynamic of an actor. Which is a bummer since Dumbledore is such an important character in the series. I guess I'll get used to him.   The kid actors were fine as well. I hope they don't ever plan on replacing them no matter how quickly they seem to be growing up. And Fred and George aka the Phelps twins sure grew UP! They're cute for beanstalk redheads but hey I'm not one to discriminate on cute. I've always thought they were kinda of cute in a gangly geeky kinda way. Heh. I like young boyish types. Not young like in high school, just young-er. Anyway! Go see the movie. I'm not the best movie reviewer, and I'm still working on articulating my thoughts down better but that's what you get. If you want better go pick up  Entertainment Weekly !  Okay I have to at least get into bed now whether I'm going to fall asleep right away or not. I've got my usual morning workout appt with my trainer tomorrow that I don't want to be tired or hive-y for. No more Hives! Down with Hives! Hive Free Birthday!

      I had an opportunity to jet off to NYC this weekend. Basically I would go there and be put up in a nice hotel anywhere from Saturday to Tuesday or Thursday of next week. My job would be to support our new product and make sure that it was up and running for the demonstrations. Some sort of tech preview show or something or rather.   Alas I had to say no. It was kind of a tradeoff. I could go to New York, probably see my old boss Paola (who now lives in Brooklyn) for a bit, then hang out by myself most of the time. I'd be on call during the day and who knows how much free time I'd actually have to wander around. PLUS, I'd be missing my birthday! If it had been any other weekend I would have totally went for it. But it had to be THIS weekend. What a bummer! Jackie has said she wants to go later this year for a quick trip. I'll try to tag along then I guess. Seemed like such a cool thing to be able to do though. Seeing all my friends on my birthday will be way more fun.   Speaking of Jackie, she's in some crazy magazine spread for getting your own gansta gold teeth. You can see the photo and read the article at the  Mass Appeal Magazine  site or view the photo below. And no she doesn't have a gold tooth in real life.    urlLink     And while I brought up the topic of my birthday I'd like to pose the question of What is the Best Way to Split a Large Bill? There are two schools of thought here. 1) Everyone does an even split or 2) everyone calculates and pays what they owe. In theory option 2 is the ideal except the bigger the group the harder it is to actually collect enough money to pay the bill. To make matters more complicated we're having Tapas which means that people will be sharing small plates and who knows who's eating how much. There's also the issue of people's incomes. When people are going that aren't all in the same income bracket and not all employed it makes it tough to do an even split, particularly when people are trying to be extra frugal. We're going to have to go with option 2 on saturday and just hope that everyone pays what they owe!   I'm doing my best here to make this as low stress and low maintenance for myself as possible. I hate having to plan parties and make sure everyone's having fun and that it's well organized. Years ago I threw a huge birthday party for my ex at Kimo's on Polk. I basically rented the place (owner expected a certain amount in bar money to cover the rental), hired the Demonics to play, decorated it all jungle/tiki themed, had my friends Amrah and Angel strip, and Amrah's friend's band play as an opener. It was an awesome party and everyone had a great time, but man what a pain in the ass that was to plan. We even had custom invitations.   I had a BIG birthday dinner at an Italian place years ago with a price fixed menu. There were probably over 30 people there. We all headed over to the Wanda Jackson show at Bimbo's afterwards for a nice combined evening event. The dinner was pretty high maintenance in itself. First the plates were all too small, and the food wasn't as good as it could have been. Lot's of people ate and drank though and when the bill came and the money was collected we were short in the 100-200 dollar range. Which is a pretty significant shortage. A group of us wound up putting in a LOT more money than we'd planned to, which was fine but it was a big defecit. I'm hoping that doesn't happen again this time around. I think it should be okay though. It's tough when you have over 20 people going though.. it can get a bit out of hand.   I don't have super duper high expectations for my birthday. I just want to have a nice time at dinner and a nice time afterwards at  Anon Salon . Which is a whole other issue in itself. Some people are put off by the cover charge to get in there. But hey you don't have to go! It's not a club with a meat market atmosphere that sells you expensive drinks. Instead it's a privately run party. Not unlike the ones that Shawn throws at his 049 Lounge Space. The drinks are really cheap too. Apparently not everyone loves Anon Salon either. I personally had a great time last time and look forward to going again. Others hate it. Shawn says he's always suprised by who loves it and who hates it. He took me for someone who would have hated it but hey I'm a fan now. Unless of course this time it sucks! Heh.   There were also a couple of things I would have liked this birthday that don't look like they're going to come through... but that's okay. It may be my birthday but it is also just another Saturday night. It's best not to put to much on it. That's how people wind up party'ing their asses off and passing out in the gutter. Too much, "Hey it's my birthday! An excuse for me to completely go off my rocker for an evening!". Nope, not me. Not this time!

      I started this scarf Friday night and finished it Sunday morning. It's not complicated per se, but the deco ribbon isn't much fun to knit with. It likes to get twisted so a lot of my time was spent flattening the ribbon out and rolling the ball to keep the twist out of it each time I knit a stitch. I'm quite proud of it though and it turned out like it was supposed to which is always a plus! I have to say that when you view the picture of the scarf on the pattern site, you'll notice how nice and flat all their ribbon in the scarf is. I found it completely impossible to knit it that flat. No matter how hard I tried and how long I straightened the deco ribbon out, so phooey on that! It still looks good. I knit the wristband(s) last week. The star doesn't look as well as I thought it would and it took me awhile to figure out how to knit the thing properly but I think it turned out well also. The only problem with it is that I didn't bind off knit 2, purl 2 like I should have. I plan on making more "perfect" ones later.   Right now I'm working on the Berry/Purple/Blue version of the scarf I just finished for my stepmom. I'm already 4 rows into it so I should be done soon-ish! 4 rows doesn't seem like much except this scarf is knit lengthwise on circular needles. So instead of casting on say, 10 stitches I have to cast on 115 stitches. So each row takes awhile to get through. The muscle in my hand below my thumb has been sore all day. It felt like I'd bruised my hand when I woke up then I realized it was a knitting injury, haha. It's less sore when I knit at least. I think moving it around a lot works out the pain.     urlLink    Picnic Deco Ribbon and Strawberry Lemonade Splash Yarn Scarf   urlLink    Close up view of detail - Scarf is unstretched   urlLink    Navy and Mint Green Cotton Yarn Wristband (quick to knit, made two last week!)&nbsp; urlLink     If you like the wristbands pick up a copy of  Stitch 'N Bitch  for the pattern. The  scarf pattern  is located on the straw.com website. The best site to view the pattern photos with links is on the  Knitting Garden  website. The best place to order Crystal Palace yarn is not from the Knitting Garden because they were backordered on half my order. Instead you can order from the  Yarn Market . They were pretty quick about the order and had everything in stock.  Why am I posting so late? Well I stayed up really late to start the next scarf. I was motivated! And then I really wanted to put these photos up online. Not as much fun if I can't share what I've accomplished.

      I just took the  quiz .   I'm only 25% picky.    Your willingness to look beyond the surface for other qualities shows that you are grounded in reality when looking for a relationship. Just beware of going with the flow too much and settling for 'OK' instead of 'fantastic'.    Ouch. I thought I was really picky. Actually that's not true... I think lately I haven't been picky enough. Live and learn!

      Yes I know! People love to give me crap about this but I love reality TV. I watch shows like Survivor, Big Brother, Amazing Race and so on. I'm also a fan of a little show on NBC called  Last Comic Standing .   Last night's show was tense, three comics had to compete head to head to see which one comic would be eliminated. Would it be Corey, Alonzo or John?! Who was going to be in the FINAL FIVE?!&nbsp;I've always been a big fan of  John Heffron  so I didn't want to see him go. Of course I'd already hung out with him throughout most of&nbsp;Saturday evening/Sunday&nbsp;morning&nbsp;so I already knew he was in the final five.   Although I was kicking myself for not asking him who was in the final two... but then I realized that he wouldn't have known that. The only real tip was that he made it to the final five. Its at the point in the show now that people can phone in after each episode and vote the comics through to the end. So it's all up in the air still. I say vote for John! :)   Okay so here's my story. Saturday night I headed out to dinner with my friend Johnny, then we went to Toranado on Haight, then The Top. Around&nbsp;midnight I headed over to my friend Shawn's birthday bash at his loft space. The party was already winding down by then so I wasn't there long. Another friend showed up and we took off. Then I got a call from yet another friend who suggested we head over to this all night "speakeasy" type place. Basically it was an after hours club that served alcohol all night and had a dj etc. Members only. Since my friend was a member we got in.   The crowd was semi yuppie-ish but okay overall. It got more crowded as the bars let out and overall it was a nice setting. A basement club type place. Anyway, I was sitting around and saw this guy from across the room by the entrance. I pegged him almost immediately. John Heffron! My friend went over and asked him at my bequest what his name was. Yup it was him! He came on over and was apparently very drunk but I couldn't really tell. He was very nice and very cute in person. He was also pretty chatty so it was cool hanging out with him. I won't go into to much detail other than to say that he's getting married this coming weekend, so congrats to him! Although now that he's a semi-famous comedian tv show guy he's probably getting lots of hot chicks coming up to him all the time for... oh you know.   Darnit!&nbsp;All the super cute, nice, job having, career having, sucessful guys are taken.&nbsp; Okay not all, just the ones I happen to maybe spark an interest for. And knowing me that's like two maybe. I'm generally attracted to commitment-phobic, emotionally unavailable, &nbsp;jobless, no career future type guys that are out dating multiple women at the same time (at least one, some or all of the former). I'm going to die alone with 6 cats and 5 dogs. Being that I'm a knitter I'll sit around and knit little scarves for all of them while listening to "All By Myself" by Shelby Lynne. It's good to have goals.

      Woah. Blogger got cooler looking.&nbsp; The posting mechanism did I mean. Wow. Neato! Lookin good! Okay enough of that.... Sorry I haven't been posting in awhile. Between crunch time at work, appointments, updating my very old ipod with new firmware (holy&nbsp;crap did that suck)&nbsp;and my new hobby (more on that shortly) I've been busy!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So I'm officially a gym junkie. Laugh now,&nbsp;get it all out. My friend Kymm goes everday and I never understood how the heck she did it. I've been the last 6 days and I'm not stopping anytime soon! 2 of those days every week are with my personal trainer at a private gym. That's where I do my super slow weight lifting which involves a lot of weight for a short amount of time in very slow reps. Pretty excruciating but I've gotten very strong since I started last February. I had about month off in there on and off&nbsp;due to being sick but I've kept up with it. I even see a bit of muscle definition here and there.&nbsp;   The other 4 days have been spent at 24 hour fitness on the elliptical. I started out at about 30 minutes.&nbsp;It&nbsp;was such a rush to finish that. I felt so accomplished. Then I went up to 35 min and up a higher level as well. Now I've gone up another level and I'm up to 40 min. I have to find my groove I guess. I have about ten times more stamina then I did 6 months ago, so yay me! Woo! Oh also, I've been a bit on and off about the Weight Watchers thing due to my vacation recently but I'm definitely back on again. When I weighed myself for my weekly weigh in this morning I got my first 5lb milestone star. Yup I've lost a whopping 5lbs since I started.  &nbsp;  I owe a lot of this to&nbsp;C by the way. She's done more for me mentally and physically in such a short period of time then anyone else I know. Funny how that is. She's so modest about what an influence she has on me but take some credit! You rock! I'm not sure when she started being my "role model" but she's influenced me so much that I even have a regular therapist now. I feel great about the path my health is taking too.  &nbsp;  I've had some angst lately that helped propell me to the gym. I've been working that out in other more private outlets rather than on my very public blog. Hopefully I'll be better soon and back to regular postings here. In the meantime, I'll just keep working out.&nbsp;

      I hate going to gyms. I hate working out with a bunch of people you don't know. It's weird. I''m kind of self concious sometimes so that doesn't help much either. I've had a gym membership the entire 3 and a half years I've been at my job. My first membership was to Club One, which I went to about 4 times total. No motiviation at all, even though I went with a co-worker. My current gym is with 24 hour fitness. This is better because there is one closer to my home and work now than there is a Club One. Had I used it at all? No.   Today I went to my local 24 Hour Fitness. I was determined to break the gym barrier and actually go use it. I walk in and check in, so far so good. The desk guy is pretty nice and lets me know I have the Ultra membership which entitles me to not only use any gym I want but I can use the ultra sports clubs which have day spas and juice bars and stuff. Neat. Okay I did a lap around the gym to check out what was available. It wasn't too crowded which was nice. There's a pool in the back which is pretty cool. It seemed nice overall. I felt pretty comfortable.  I decided to use the elliptical today. Which is funny because I actually owned an elliptical which I got rid of from non use. Of course mine wasn't nearly as good as these were. I wasn't sure how long I'd last on it because usually I go about 10 min and want to pass out. Today I went a whole 30 min plus. 2 and a half miles, 300 calories burned. It seemed so easy too. I think all the strength training I'm doing is paying off. You see, even though I seem lazy (and generally am lazy) by not going to the gym I do go to a personal trainer two days a week to do super slow weight lifting. It's pretty gruelling but I keep increasing the amount of weight I am using so I know I'm getting stronger. Anyways, long story short, I loved the gym and plan on going back again tomorrow.  In fact I realized something about myself today. Something that I'd read in C's blog about why she goes to the gym. Going to the gym with a lot on your mind (among other things) can really help push you through the workout. I've been a bit heavy hearted the last few days. Not caused by anything bad, but more likely caused by a longing or a hope. Rather than dwell on what if's I decided to go work it out at the gym and that was the formula I needed to motivate me to succeed. I look forward to working all this out at the gym everday if I can! I'm actually pretty excited by the whole gym thing and am happy about that. Life's not so bad.

      I have been so very very busy since I've gotten back. Busy being tired, busy trying to clean my house, busy writing my review at work, busy doing work, busy running errands and so on and so forth. Usually I'm quite good at throwing a post out there the second I've arrived back from an event or a trip but this time I've been a tad slow. So slow in fact that as I write this I know I'm going to save it as a draft and continue it another day. This will be the post that took me days to write versus minutes. Luckily Blogger is very nice and will "backdate" it for me... ie, it will post it with the date and time on it that I started it. So you might think i was quick, but now you know the real truth!  Friday I took off for a long weekend in Seattle. I arrive mid-afternoon and picked up my kick butt  Pontiac Grand Prix . Who knew it was a sporty full sized car thing? It only had 900 miles on it too and upgrading to it cost me an extra $3 a day. Thanks nice Avis lady for the killer recommendation! I drove into Seattle and met up with my friend Cristy at her house. I cleaned up and we went out to dinner at some Sushi restaurant in some part of town that I don't recall. It was quite good though, albeit slow service-wise. Poppy headed off to see Calexico at the Showbox and Cristy and I headed over to the Lobo Saloon to catch my friend Theo's band, The Teenage Harlets, play with 3 other bands.  I won't go into long boring detail since there's a nice pictoral. I'll just say that the crowd was great, I met some new folks and met up with some folks I'd met before. It was a ton of fun and everyone was crazy! Whee! Poppy came and met us later on in time to catch the Hot Rollers, a local Seattle band. We ended up that evening by heading to a party around the corner for an hour or so then moving on to another party in Ballard. I had such an amazingly fun time, I mean it. The best thing in the world is going out and meeting a ton of cool new people you can hang with. Plus hanging with my friend Theo and co. is always a blast.   Day 2 had us sleeping in late since we didn't get in until 5am. We managed to drag ourselves out to Capital Hill for some food at  Cafe Septeime . Another slow service experience but I was so hungry and my food tasted really good so I didn't care once my food showed up. Afterwards we caught a matinee of Spiderman 2 downtown at that fancy mall on 6th and Pine. Greatest movie ever! Loved it! I want to take Toby Maguire home and feed him some warm soup and give him some socks and jammies and tuck him into bed. What a sad sack. I was wondering where the part of the film was where his puppy gets run over. The movie had amazing character development. I loved it saw much I saw it again once I got back in town. That's right, TWO TIMES!   Anyways, after the movie we headed home to take care of a few things then headed over to the U District to meet up with Paul and his friends Neal and Deb. Neal was a former WebTV guy who still works for Microsoft except he's up in Seattle now... Ballard to be exact. We met at a restaurant called  Flowers  which I really liked. I had a Thai Seafood Bouillabaise which was really delicious. Poppy, Cristy and I were still burnt out from the night before so we weren't the liveliest of groups but it was still a nice dinner nevertheless. Afterwards we raided QFC for ice cream and cones then headed home to veg in front of the TV and eat our ice cream. It was already pretty late at this point and we need the rest.  Day 3 required me to get up early and get out of the house to head over to my Grandma's for lunch. My Aunt Brenda, Uncle Richard and Cousin Rebeccah were kind enough to have us up to their house to eat BBQ. Yay! I'd been jones'ing for BBQ for awhile, if you couldn't tell from my recent  BBQ purchase . Anyway, we had a nice visit then I headed off back to Seattle. Poppy wanted to try and leave the city and get some fireworks from an Indian Reservation or something. Luckily on the way back I found a roadside fireworks stand where I was able to pick up a bunch of cool fireworks that shot off fireballs high into the air and sprayed fountains of sparks. Saved us a trip and some time. I also got some magic sticks, sparklers, blossoms and snakes. A pretty nice assortment. My favorites were of course the fireball ones. I don't recall every buying fireworks that shot things that high in the air. It was like our own mini display!   Once I got back we all cleaned up then headed over to Poppy's friend's house for another bbq. We got fried chicken for ourselves and we got there late anyways so we missed the eating part. Which was fine by me. I'd already done my BBQ at lunch. I met a nice group of folks there. When it got to be around 9pm we decided to hike about 20 blocks to somewhere around Capital Hill to watch the displays. We got a pretty nice spot on a hill type area, overlooking where the REI is, which is right up the street from the Lobo Saloon. Pretty cool! There were a lot of fun people out and about and about 9 of us headed down there. We lost a few on the way but we started out as a pretty big group. After the displays we hit some bar called Linda's I think and had a few there. At this point after having a few on the way then at the bar we were way too tired to walk all the way back so we took a cab. We got back at 12 or 1 something and then lit off all our fireworks. The guy down the street came out with all his rockets and fireballs, and basically outdid us. His fireworks were WAY bigger than ours! I guess he went to the reservation for those.   Next year I'd love to drive up and load my car full of them then come back down here. Hehe. Although I'm not sure what the regulations are on that in my county. Probably have to check first. So after shooting off all our fireworks we decided to head home and pass out. We got back and in to bed by 3am. Which really sucked because I had to get up at 7am to finish packing then get to the airport for a 10am flight. This included dropping the rental off as well. Luckily that was all a fast process since I made it to the gate about 30 min before boarding... tops.  So I got home fine, had a fabulous weekend. There are of course other fun details which I won't share here. :) I'll leave that up to the imagination. And get your minds out of the gutter!  Here are some movies of the fireworks display I took with my camera. They're not great by any means but if you want a small taste, there you go. I'd include the movie of us lighting the "big one" and shooting it off in the street but it's big and unedited. Maybe once it's edited I'll post it for awhile. I doubt I'll keep these movies posted long since they are a space suck. So watch 'em while you can, if you wanna. I also posted a few highlight photos. I don't wanna bore you with ALL the pics taken. I saved those for my friends to suffer through!

      I'm off again to Seattle for a fun filled weekend with friends. Hopefully I'll have some good details to report when I get back.  In the meantime, here's a photo of Toby and I. It was taken on Memorial Day this year. We were at some strange hay filled park in Menlo Park in a relatively nice neighborhood. Johnny and Luci came along as well. All in all a nice day out.   urlLink

      Sorry for the lack of posts. Been pretty busy being out and about.  I saw some live shows: The Crystal Method and Paul Oakenfold (weekend before last) - Overpriced and Zzzzzz. The Hives (on Sunday) - Wow. Fantastic live band! I must go buy their new album immediately!  I saw some movies: I, Robot - Entertaining The Village - Disappointing Dodgeball - Pretty funny  I looked at some apartments in San Francisco: Lofts in Potrero Hill - Nice but not quite right Apartment in Potrero Hill - Nice, wrong location Lofts in SOMA - Eh Mission Place in SOMA - Very very nice, very pricey  Went to the annual company picnic at the Beach Boardwalk last Saturday in Santa Cruz. What a beautiful day! Rode some rides, ate some food, had some fun.  I'm headed to Las Vegas on Thursday and I can't wait! I'm dying for a nice mini vacation. There will be about ten or more people in the two groups I'm going with. Should be a blast. I'll have more to report when I get back!  Sorry to post and run but it's late and I'm beat. Had a late workout tonight. I promise more exciting posts next week.
