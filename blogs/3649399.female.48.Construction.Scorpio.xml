      Well I just finished "The Lovely Bones" by Alice Sebold = I started it yesterday morning and finished it this morning.  I could not put the book down but I can't for the life of me explain why I couldn't stop reading it.  It is a narrative from the point of view of a 14 year old girl who is murdered.  She watches her family and her murder from heaven while trying to understand why she died.   It is mesmerizing.  The last book to do this to me was called "The Living Blood" by Tananarvie Due.  Totally different stories but both caught my attention and never let go.  I got the book at my best friends suggestion = thanks!  I have finally had a summer where I could read but this was by far my favorite book this summer.  I have also read "The Cabinet of Curiosities" and "Still Life With Crows" by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child = they also wrote "The Relic" = BOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THE MOVIE.  Now I need to find at least 3 other books that I started months ago but lost the book and where I was in them.   Well it's late and I am tired = so more later.

      well hubbie made it home okay - we played phone tag all weekend. when he called i was outside feeding and medicating animals. everything went okay but friday messed up the rest of the schedule. friday went to docotor to get rights to refill for one medicine and of course that took an hour or more.  Nessa (10 year old chow) is scheduled for surgery for tomorrow to have a tumor removed.  spent weekend playing diablo online with brother = really enjoyed that = hope i can find time to do it again.  need to try and get serious about doing some work before school starts - so much to do and so little interest in it = i want to retire now!  more later.

      I am so tired of being allergic to stuff - something bit me on my hands, one foot, and my inner thighs.&nbsp; I can't stop itching - I have tried everything and nothing is working - Ihave blisters on my hand.&nbsp; The only thing that works is Rubbing alcohol and I can't figure out how to keep it on the skin til the&nbsp; pain goes away.  Very ANNOYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        Finally got to see the movie Spiderman 2 - LOVED it.&nbsp; I cried, of course, at the sappy parts.       &nbsp;   Also put one of the 3 shelves together.&nbsp; Will try to put the other 2 together tomorrow.       &nbsp;   Went to Olive Garden for dinner after the movie with my hubbie.&nbsp; Good meal even though the waiters got a lot of stuff wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; They put dressing on the salad after I specifically asked them not to.&nbsp; One of them took Joe's drink and never came back and we never got the extra bread we asked for.&nbsp; I could understand all of that but we were there earlier than the dinner crowd and there were plenty of waiters in the area.        &nbsp;   Oh well - I am hoping to go see a movie this weekend or to see one when I get back.&nbsp; I am still planning on visiting my brother and sister in law.&nbsp; Hopefully I will get to see one of the kiddos also.&nbsp; It will be a nice break from doing nothing.       &nbsp;   I have been soooooooooooooooo lazy.&nbsp; It I get one thing done in a day it's a miracle.&nbsp; And I still have 3 or 4 major things I want done before the end of August - oh well - we shall see we shall see - bye for now

        Well - that cinches it - the world is coming to an end.&nbsp; Here I am writing on this blog two days in a row.        &nbsp;    I am suppose to be putting together three shelves but I am being a bum - besides I have to keep an eye out for the kittens.&nbsp; We are letting them outside with the new puppies and anyone who has ever had this many animals ( 7 dogs and 15 cats)knows things don't go smoothly.&nbsp; My little (LEO) - who has been one sick kitty since April = caught a baby bird this morning - needless to say the mocking birds are pissed - so was I.&nbsp; The last thing I need is for him to eat some raw bird and get sick again.&nbsp; I tried to rescue the bird but I don't know if it worked and I know NOTHING about Birds.&nbsp; So I set it free once I got&nbsp;it out of his mouth and I went to check on it and it wasn't where I left it so MAYBE it's okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the only thing that has gone right this morning is my internet connection miraculously got better.

        Well the phone line has been repaired but the internet connection is suckie.&nbsp; Anyhow I am really enjoying not working for the second half of the summer.&nbsp; Spent yesterday shopping with P.C. = bought myself 5 shirts and 3 pants for about $150 or less.&nbsp; Caught some good sales and was in the right mood.&nbsp; That rarely happens at the same time.&nbsp; I was even in the mood to try clothes on - people might want to take refuge somewhere = the sky will probably come falling down around me.&nbsp; After about 6 hours of shopping however I could not handle people anymore so we went back to my place and had our Sci Fi night.&nbsp; Dinner with my hubbie and watched stuff we have taped for the week.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   Hubbie and I were suppose to be in Austin but postponed til August - however I am going to go see my brother and his wife next weekend in that area just for fun.&nbsp; Gotta spend the rest of my money from my share of the summer checks.&nbsp; Still looking for homes for the kitty cats but we are letting them outside for a little while each day and trying to teach the puppies to leave them alone.&nbsp;        &nbsp;   Goats are doing good but one of them did almost brake her foot by getting it caught in a tree&nbsp; branch the other day.&nbsp; She has recovered mostly but still a little tender on the leg.       &nbsp;   I am looking forward to having some down time with myself when I get back from my brothers.&nbsp; I have several meetings in August but they should be laid back meetings mostly.&nbsp;       Anyhow more later.

      Okay my house phone is dead again for the umpteenth time this year and so I can't get online except at work. Also I called the phone company and told them my husband would be home and they are suppose to send someone out between 1 p.m. and 7 p.m.&nbsp; -&nbsp; only I forgot to tell my husband to leave his cell phone on just in case they call and the last time I called the house and his cell - neither was working or on.&nbsp; SO we will see how long it takes them to fix it this time.&nbsp; It dies when it rains (no rain lately).&nbsp; It dies when the mowers go through and run over the phone cover thingy sticking out of the ground (we painted it bright red and they stopped running it over).&nbsp; It dies when the ants get into the mechanisms outside (so far no signs of ants in the pants).&nbsp; Oh well - guess I will have to wait for it to get fixed.   Spent part of the day trying to help out a friend with her house cleaning and sorting.&nbsp; She is older and has lost control of the entire house and boy can I sympathize with that.&nbsp; Only difference is my house is smaller and hers is more interesting to sort.&nbsp; More later.
