      So i went to this japanese restaurant yesterday. There was this chinese or what ever the fuck sushi chef standing behind the counter. I asked for the price list for the nigiri sushi that they have. He told me that they don't make nigiri sushi.  (for all of you who don't know what nigiri sushi is it's rice with a slab of dead fish on top of it. still confused? see my other site)  He has the audacity to tell me that he doesn't make that "type of stuff" at the restaurant. There was an illustrated menue sitting right in front of him. He had this attitude that he was so much better than I was. I mean come on there are many different types of sushi. Maki, and nigiri are the two major ones. If you can't understand what I am trying to tell you first take some more english lessons you fuckin fob, then learn what the japanese words are for the food that you supposedly sell. God damn immigrants. Something has to be done about them.  Or at the very latest that moron.

      So where does everyting leave me? Not quite sure right now. I went back and found a girl that I once knew. I'm not expecting any response, there isn't even any guarentee that she's going to read what I sent. I only hope the best for her and wish her well. I...I'm going to shut up now.

      Hello everyone this is where i would have told you another interesting story about my life but I have no time. You see I just got off of work and have to go back again in 4 hours. I need sleep, or the semblence of, or else I'm going to go nuts.  Already a bannaba chocolate chip muffin told me to jump off of the roof because my lawn was a pool of emrald green jello which held the key for all knowledge in the sun soaked quandries that we may/may not see from far away landscapes and short towers of infentecimal height.  3 days no sleep my mind is turning into mush which means i should reach full lucidity, or fall into a full blown psychosis in the next 3 days.  have fun and thank you for shopping at Wall-Mart

      looking back at what once was and sometimes still tries to be.    "A Ravers Manifesto..."  Our emotional state of choice is Ecstasy. Our nourishment of choice is Love. Our addiction of choice is technology. Our religion of choice is music. Our currency of choice is knowledge. Our politics of choice is none. Our society of choice is utopian though we know it will never be.  You may hate us. You may dismiss us. You may misunderstand us. You may be unaware of our existence. We can only hope you do not care to judge us, because we would never judge you. We are not criminals. We are not disillusioned. We are not drug addicts. We are not naive children. We are one massive, global, tribal village that transcends man-made law, physical geography, and time itself. We are The Massive. One Massive.   We were first drawn by the sound. From far away, the thunderous, muffled, echoing beat was comparable to a mother's heart soothing a child in her womb of concrete, steel, and electrical wiring. We were drawn back into this womb, and there, in the heat, dampness, and darkness of it, we came to accept that we are all the same. We came to accept that we are all equal. Not only to the darkness, and to ourselves, but to the very music slamming into us and passing through our souls; We are all equal - and somewhere around 35Hz we could feel the hand of God at our backs, pushing us forward, pushing us to push ourselves to strengthen our minds, our bodies, and our spirits. Pushing us to turn to the person beside us to join hands and uplift them by sharing the uncontrollable joy we felt from creating this magical bubble that can, for one evening, protect us from the horrors, atrocities, and pollution of the outside world. It is in that very instant, with these very realizations that each of was truly born.  We continue to pack our bodies into clubs, or warehouses, or buildings you've abandoned and left for naught, and we bring life to them for one night. Strong, throbbing, vibrant life in it's purest, most intense, most hedonistic form. In these makeshift spaces, we seek to shed ourselves of the burden of uncertainty for a future you have been unable to stabilize and secure for us. We seek to relinquish our inhibitions, and free ourselves from the shackles and restraints you've put on us for your own peace of mind.  We seek to re-write the programming that you have tried to indoctrinate us with since the moment we were born. Programming that tells us to hate, that tells us to judge, that tells us to stuff ourselves into the nearest and most convenient pigeon hole possible. Programming that even tells us to climb ladders for you, jump through hoops, and run through mazes and on hamster wheels. Programming that tells us to eat from the shiny silver spoon you are trying to feed us with, instead of nourish ourselves with our own capable hands. Programming that tells us to close our minds, instead of open them.   Until the sun rises to burn our eyes by revealing the distopian reality of the world you've created for us, we dance fiercely with our brothers and sisters in celebration of our life, of our culture, and of the values we believe in: Peace, Love, Unity, Respect, Responsibility, Freedom, Tolerance, Harmony and Expression.  Our enemy of choice is ignorance. Our weapon of choice is information. Our crime of choice is breaking and challenging whatever laws you feel you need to put in place to stop us from celebrating our existence. But know that while you may shut down any given party, on any given night, in any given city, in any given country or continent on this beautiful planet, you can never shut down the entire party. You don't have access to that switch, no matter what you may think. The music will never stop. The heartbeat will never fade. The party will never end.  I am a raver, and this is my manifesto.   at one point in my life i believed that this encapsulated the essence of who i was. it wasn't me. like many others it was an excuse to get high and escape from my so called sea of oppression.   it wasn't until i disappeared that things to changed...

      Welcome to the mediocre life of someone who is dead.   Took some time to look back at all of the shit that i call my life and realized that i never lived it. Not this crap about Carpe Diem, i was simply never there. Spent my life as everyman, but never able to see.   Where am I going I don't quite know, what does it matter where I go? Anywhere, anywhere I don't know.

      Hello Dear Simon,  so heres that post I promised you, I've been  waffling on wich one to pass along.. I should point out that it has no relevance to anything or anyone now; as i wrote it almost 2 years ago!                           How could such a simple gesture                          lead to something grand?                          I lost my heart, I fell for you                          Before you took my hand.                          I know youre hurt, I know youre scared,                          But let me show you how                          by clinging to the love you've lost,                          Youre losing out on here and now  Its the beginnings of song lyrics... No tune yet, just rediscovered them while looking through some old papers.   ah yess, and you can also checkout my blog at  urlLink  http://www.taybird.blogspot.com   There are more current entries there, but i promise theyre not all poetry.  Cheers, Tay

      yesterday afternoon i found out that one of my grand-aunts passed away. She was one of the sweetest, nicest, most kind and considerate women that you would ever meet. my dad's aunt. She would treat us like family everytime we visited her. i would look forward to being able to see her when we would go to japan. 97 this year, but she was in a comma for the last three years.   my cousins were over from mid may till the 12th of july. it was in the hopes that the younger of my cousins would get better. he was and currently is having some difficulties on grasping reality and living in the world with the people around him.     more to come

      It's a sad thing to be alone in the world. And this is where I am. I'm not talking about the, "oh I wish I had a girlfriend so I can have sex" type loneliness. This is the much deeper and sentimental bullshit kind. It's not that I expect people to drop their own lives and pay attention to everyone of my petty needs, it's just that there is not any single individual that is willing to spend the time with me.   where is this comming from?  After classes today I was with a friend working on some project. So we'd  be walking down the halls and I would keep on running into a bunch of girls that I knew. He told me that he was amazed at the people who knew me and said that I must be real popular or something. I laughed. I couldn't stop thinking about it though. Why is it that if I appear to be extremely popular to other people, I'm always finding myself sitting alone at this computer?  "Wayne, you're such a nice guy. You're a lot of fun. You're so outgoing. Fun to be with. You're so great." Why do people say this about me? If it's true, why do I spend so much time at this computer?   I'm just rambling about stuff. I'll shut up about it. It's just something that's bothering me right now.  I'm gonna go away. My feet are trying to tell me to start walking again.

      good morning. it's 4:49 am and i just got back from work. fate does soem pretty weird things to you. take myself for example because of an oversight i was still able to work a security shift. a security shift where i got to meet an amazing girl named Brittney. talked for the longest time outside of essies. she was going to go out and sit by herself which, if you know lethbridge and the people that go to that bar, isn't the smartest thing in the world to do.  so i asked if i could keep her company and was able to keep the real horrible creeps away from her. told me she was real close to go to japan as a model, but changed her mind once she read that her contract wanted her to do porn. smart girl not to take it, those japanese are really fucked up. first it's pictures, then movies, before you know it you're a prostitute with some 90 year old asian with a tiny shrivled dick trying to keep it hard enough to get it in your ass. it's not a good thing. now she's going to be going to the u of c taking some courses which have something to do with being on television...i can't really remember. there's a chance that she might come down to the u of l though, that i think would be awesome. at the least it looks like i made a new friend. makes me happy.  sf

      So I think it's happened, and now I find myself in a position that I have to admit what I've been trying to deny. Before I was able to deny everything. I ignored the evidence, created fictitious stories to cover the truth, I even went so far as to bend reality so as to support my assertions. I cannot continue to do this. It has gone on far too long. My sisters have told me, my friends have told me, my parents have told me, strangers on the street that i don't know see it. I, wayne, am fat.  I'm not big boned, or husky, or just pudgy. I am a fuckin whale. Something has to be done about this and I am going to start today.

      i'm going to tell you about my recent foray in the dating world.   It started out a few weeks ago when i was tired, bored, and had nothing else to do than surf the net. i went to the lavalife site and created a few false profiles, girls named hidi, that sort of thing.  For the sake of cutting therough the tedium i'll jump ahead. So we decided to go and meet on this lunch-type date, went to or-kids had a lunch, went on a short walk. i think the dissappointment was mutual. It's funny, the fact that i went out and tried to meet someone over the net. It started out as a joke. 18yr old girl neamed Hidi got more messages than you would ever believe.  So i put one out of myself go figure. Anyhow, too tired to write anymore.  later

      I am one step closer to getting the song I've been trying to get my hands on for the last year. This is a real exciting moment for me.  Anyhow here are the lyrics. It's a lot better with the music.    THC - Overfire  I'll take you up above ground Over filth, over fire Newly emerged from damp rich earth Every inch a new sensation Stretches me out of my head Out of my head into his To taste and smell myself  I'll take you up above ground Over filth, over fire Beyond everyday more than life Over filth, over fire  More flesh wrapped around me More weight on my limbs More teeth, more hands, more heat More breath down my throat  More flesh wrapped around me More weight on my limbs More teeth, more hands, more heat More breath down my throat More teeth, more hands, more heat More breath down my throat  I'll take you up above the ground Over filth, over fire Out of my head into yours To taste and smell myself  Over filth, over fire  ｩ THC - Adagio

      here is an excerpt from a play that I will one day get around to writing.  I call it    "Hard Boiled Eggs on a Scrambled Piece of Toast"   dick-was anything that happened between us, that we had together, real?  jane-of course. everything, except for the parts where I expressed affection.  dick-oh...  jane-don't feel bad, think of it more like a business transaction.  dick-how much does a broken heart go for these days?  jane-15%, plus expenses.  dick-that's all? thought I could do better on the open market.

      it's too hard.  just when i start to think that things from my past won't haunt me anymore...certain things i've taken for granted as being over and done with, things that i figured that i was away form and wouldn't affect me anymore. shoulda just stayed fuckin ignorant about things outside my own bubble. sometimes i think that i could have been happier that way.  a friend of mine lisa, one of her friends went and killed himself. she told me that she knew this guy from like elementary, never was too stable, but was allright.  anyhow it seems like his girlfriend had a fight or something, told him that she was leaving him. the guy couldn't take it. got coked up and hung himself in her front yard.  fuck. it's messed up. lisa sayz she's ok but i don't know. didn't get time to talk to her about things. it makes things harder because it made me remember things from my past. i don't want to live through it agian, but it's been all i can think of since i've heard.

      I was stuck in the elevators at the university today. For 40 minutes I was stuck in a little box with no way out. The plus side was that I had an extreamly beautiful blond to keep company. Caillie, beautiful laugh, wonderful sense of humour, we were able to really connect. She told me that it was the best and worst day she's had at the university. Too bad she's only 7 years old.  got ya. No I'm not sick. it's Shanny's youngest sister. come on, really. just who do you think I am?  The story is; I went to pick her up from art camp. Shanny asked me that favour because she was busy with the drama camp performances for the parents. Well I ran up and met up with her. We decided that the elevator would be fun for the way down. It was fun all right. got stuck just after it passed the 6th floor. It looked like she was going to start freaking out so I turned into "cool me," and kept her from getting too scared. Sang songs, told stories, stuff like that while we were waiting for security to get us out of our little trap. I'm just real glad that she didn't have to go to the bathroom. So yea! I got to be a little girls hero for the day. Gave me a warm fuzzy feeling inside.   I'm tired, later.

      Why is it that I always find myself stuck in these positions? I'm in these class right now called Directing in the Schools, and the Ethics of Teaching.  Summer classes here over at the university.   Idea is people will be able to complete a 4 month story in the span of 3 weeks. good idea if your interested in finishing off a class in a really short time. Bad thing because you have a lot of assignments and projects due in a real short time. Kinda like passing a gall stone. It's painful as hell, feels like an eternity, but it's short and one hell of a relief when it's passed.   So I'm taking two of these classes. Stupid me. The Ethics class teaches us things like don't sleep with your students if you don't want to go to jail and become someone's girlfriend. Or at least if you're going to sleep with them, don't get caught. Directing in schools is like a three week camp on learning some basic directing techniques. Such things like, if you have sex with your actors don't get caught or the men in your class might beat you up, or try to sleep with you. Interesting, similarities in my classes. Hmmmmmm...It's almost as if there's a universal sort of message that someone's trying to tell me. Don't get caught.  So this Ethics class I'm in we have papers and presentations that we have to do in order to pass. Eight papers and one presentation in 3 weeks. That's allright. nothing big. But this directing class  that I'm in. We're working to doing 17 plays for our final performance.  Allright so far. Here's the thing. Out of the class there were only 4 of us hanging and focusing lights. If there are any non theatre people reading this it means that we spent 4 hours this evening, crawling around on a very hot grid doing the bitchwork that noone else wanted to do. For what? All in the hopes that when we do our final performances on the 22nd they won't look like complete pieces of shit. Pisses me off.  So here I am 2:00 am just finished my presentation put up a post, and get ready to do it all again.   I must be nuts.

      Insomnia is a great thing. It enables us to write inane bloggings where people can pick at my tiny little brain.  Well Sarah, here's part two of my contest.  (part 1 was July 8) it's a little harder to find then the first question, but it's familiar.  Question 2. Which book and author are the following excerpts from?   They're all dead now. Here's a picture of the town where they lived. New Waterford. It's a night bright with the moon. Imagine you are looking down from the height of a church steeple, onto the vivid gradations of light and shadow that make the picture. A small mining town near cutaway cliffs that curve over narrow rock beaches below, where the silver sea rolls and rolls, flattering the moon. Not many trees, thin grass. The silhouette of a colliery, iron tower against a slim pewter sky with cables and supports sloping at forty-five degree angles to the ground.   Mrs Luvovitz had seen the pregnant woman sitting on the cliff's edge. Like a fixture warning ships, or luring them. People around here believed in kelpies. Mrs Luvovitz's imagination had been infected. What could you expect with so many Catholics? They saw omens in everything. Where Mrs Luvovitz came from they called  them golems.  Mervedes snaps to the banister and calls down, "Nothing, Daddy, we're coming." She hurries down the stairs, heading him off, "Suppers ready when you are, Daddy," while Frances undoes the leather straps of the heavy steel brace and gives it back to Lily.   "Here, dear," says Lily, "sit down and have a cuppa tea till I tell you about your mother."   Good luck.

      I figure that I could talk a little bit about Raymi.  She's an interesting story , I like her. She's a girl that I got exposed to through dealings with my subversive friend   urlLink Gavin.  So me wanting to see Gavin sweat, thought it would be fun if I call on this girl  urlLink Raymi  to come down to Lethbridge and crash with us. We talked about stuff for a bit but nothing ever happened. That's a sample of the stuff that she did, or used to do and talk about. She's gotten way mellow in the last little bit. I'm glad she did...you read about it. Opens to the strange, or the real. you decide  Back to talking about me.    Sheep 6   wayne 2

      I just came back from  urlLink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.  I was pleasantly supprised at how much I enjoyed the movie. I did it for Alina's birthday present. True I gave her my guitar case, some strings and a bunch of pics...but I thought it would be cool for a friend to do somehing with her seeing as she has to be at a wedding rehersal (not hers) all day today during her birthday. She had a lot of fun. I'm also really glad that she's happy with the boyfriend that she has now. The prior one treated her like a non-person. Didn't seem to care about anything that had to do with her. That bastard! This one seems like he's good for her. Let's her make decisions, understands that she has friends other than his and that she still would like to spend time with them, and I can get along with him. This only means that he agrees with a lot of what I say and think. Ponder that one, how many people do you like that are complete contradictions to how you do things, think about things, and have ideas about stuff. Not too many, if any at all. On the whole we usually call a lot of those people that have completely conflicting personalities morons. I digress.  Do I want to write down what this movie got me to thinking...maybe some other time. I have to pretend that I am getting some sleep so I can go to classes in the morning.   sf

The plan in it's early stages, but here's what I've got so far:  Step 1: ????? Step 2: Happyness  I can't wait for step two.

      Sarah, this is for you. Think of it as a contest.  If you can tell me the specifics, author and title, you'll win a prize. No details on the prize, but it is an interesting one. If you win, you can collect when you get back, or carry it over for a possibility to win part 2.  Contest closes July 24th.  More details avaliable if you contact Wayne.   When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up rememberances of things past, I sigh the lack of many a thing i sought, And with old woes new wail my dear times' waste:  Then can i drown an eye, unus'd to flow, For prescious friends hid in deaths dateless night. And weep afresh love's long-since cancell'd woe, And morn the expense of many a vanish'd sight. Then can I grieve at grievances foregone, And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er The sad account of fore-bemoned moan, Which I new pay as if not paid before. But if the while I think on thee, dear friend, All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end.

      *sigh* listening to very mellow music. my parent's are comming home later today. i guess that means that I'll have to go to the airport and pick them up. Huh, good thing I remembered.   Just came back from having coffee with Sarah. (different Sarah) We were talking about our various life experiences and how they served to shape what we have become today. Stuff like that. It's interesting really, for the most part of my life I have always been extreamly weary of organized religion, for various reasons we won't get into, but it was great to see someone who has directly benifited from it. It was interesting to see how much of our early lives were so similar. Living in places where you don't feel as if you belong, surrounded by people who didn't really seem as if they liked you. It was interesting to see how, through different choices, our lives took a different shape. Kinda weird to see a what could-of-been. This isn't to say that one is better than the other, just that they are different sides of a similar story.   I hope for the continuation of all the support that she is recieving. Seems to have a preoccupation with talking about finding herslef a husband though...ah, from what we talked about I can see and understand where she's comming from. The fear is that she'll grab onto the first guy that has an interest in her. She has a good head on her shoulders so I don't think that it will be a worry...at least I hope not. She's had enough bad experiances to last several people many lifetimes. May she be granted continual strength and support.   Nyhoo, Alison Krauss is singing right now. It's a real up-and-at-'em type energy filled happy-dance song. Title's "It Doesn't' Matter" Here's an excerpt:   it doesn't matter what i want, it doesn't matter what i need. it doesn't matter if i cry, don't matter if i bleed.  you've been on a road don't know where it goes or where it leads.  it doesn't matter what i want, it doesn't matter what i need.  if you've made up your mind to go,  i won't beg you to stay. you've been in a cage,  throw you to the wind you fly away.    Isn't it pretty?

      I have to say I also done something stupid. I told the story in an email to a mutual friend of ours. Very very dumb mistake.  It's one of those things that after you do it you kick yourself in the head. Hard. If anything I've just made a non-situation very ucomfortable. Why? I think it has something to do with the fact that I still don't have any really refined social skills when it comes to dealing with anything.   I'm really sorry if I've made things ackward. It wasn't my intention.   I've also had a lot of time to think, that and I had some coffee with my friend Alina. She always helps me put things into perspective. It's her I go to when I need my head examined, or just an update on the latest in Clone High. So we talked about life, love, and what exactally goes into invisible ink. I think it's the perfect scam. You tell people that you have an ink that's invisible and they buy it. And people do, that's what gets me. But anyway,  I was dumb. I got too excited about for the first time meeting someone that I had much in common with, and that seemed there was a connection. I got stupid, and put a friend in a weird position. There was no excuse for that, and I am sorry. I made a mistake. At the end of today I found my answer though. I hope that you can see through my stupidity.  Sarah, I want to be your friend.  No conditions, no questions. I will wait.  Will you still let me?

      Once upon a time there was a man and a wife. There was something special with this man and wife, they were going to have their first born in a foreign country. That country was Canada and that boy was called Enyaw.           "Oh happy day when I was born,           long ago one sunny morn.          The world rejoiced,          the doctor said,          WHOOPSE! I dropped it on it's head!"  And so Enyaw was born kicking and screaming into the world. I think that it was forshadowing what was to come. It appeared that the boy really didn't want to live as it was only after a c-section and 20 hours of labour that he was finally dragged out. Even then he decided to place himself in the hospital every week until the great age of 1. I guess it was then that he realised that, for all ill, he was to be stuck in this god-forsaken world.  To make a rather long and most often tedious story short, I'll jump ahead a few years and details. Growing up he was isolated by language, then by death. Once I got into grade one my life became one long funeral. Relatives, friends, they all left me. He gradually saw everything as a muted shade of gray. It was safer then.   Safer.  Things got exceedingly dark for the longest time. The details aren't important right now. Relationships failed because of a very destructive and closed Enyaw. Bent on following militant Nhilism he carried on with this so-called life. It all changed because of the "three days." Life seemed to change for him with the exception of one thing. He still could not find it in himself to open to another, to find peace.    I'm not going to tell everything. Anyhow I told you that story so I could tell you this one.   I went out with Sarah on Canada Day. I picked her up and we went out for a walk. We wound up at Galt Gardens taking in the festivities. Time passed, the park emptied but neither of us noticed. I did something during that timewhich was horrible of me. I let her in. I didn't notice that it was happening, but when it did it didn't matter anymore. I would take it that she felt the same. I walked her back to her house and we kissed goodbye. Knowing that she was going to be gone for holidays for a lengh of time she decided that we should go out again, and that led to today.   I picked her up at 8:30 and we went to Save-On so that we could buya  bagged salad as well as something for desert. We then went back to my place so that I could make supper for her. We had conversation about everything. After supper we went into the backyard so that we may drink Baja lisen to music and talk. She complained of a head ache, I gave her a small massage so it would feel a bit better. I offered to take her home and sit with her till her friend comes over after midnight to take her to her formal home. It wasn't until then that I even thought of...anyhow, she told me that she was wanting to tell me something and that was when I knew I was in trouble.     "Sarah---Wayne...  Wayne disengages, Sarah walks him back to the couch. They sit.  Sarah---There's something that I wanted to tell you but I didn't know how.  feeling an impending sense of doom Wayne tries to divert the comming blows that will undoubtedly scar him for life.  Wayne---You don't have to say anything.  he feels a surge of momentary hope. maybe, perhapse by some chance he will be able to leave with some shread of self-dignity and self-worth.    to bad"  I told her that she didn't have to explain her actions but she wanted to. She told me that she was just out of a relationship and that she needed time to sort out things for herself.  I told her that I understood, and that I would wait for her. She said thank you, and that she really enjoys spending tme with me. And then we changed topics. Thankfully her friend got off of work about an hour early so I was able to get out with some semblance of self-worth.  I felt as if I wanted to die. Almost three years since the three days and still she was the first one I've ever felt anything for. ever. So here's where I'm stuck. How can I tell her that I can wait if I know she'll be there?

      Saturday June 28, 2003. I went to the bar, something I don't often do. I'm glad I did because I met a very special someone there. I'm not going to say anymore because there is a distinct possibility that she'll be reading this in the near future and I don't want to say too much right now. I know I've talked about a few girls who made things interesting for a while. She's different. I see her and I feel peace.  If you know me you will also know what that means.  I've already said too much.

      I just saw a show that has further increased my dissappointment with American Society as a whole. Dr. Phill. It was about cheerleading. Gril suing the teacher for not getting in the cheerleading squad. claimed that the teacher had changed her score card so she couldn't get in. another part was the girl who's life was ruined because she couldn't get into the squad. skipping classes and started taking drugs, losing all her "coolness." get a life. I'll say more later.

      hello everybody, trying to think about something really funny and witty. can't dissapoint anybodyany of you wonderful fans out there. I'm sure that you're hanging off of every word I say. Let me see...  sf's guide to sushi  What better way to celebrate our diversity than to go out for some sushi. Not only is sushi Japanese in origin to better expand your understance and acceptance of other cultures, but because of this God awful SUV driving, decaf skinny latte extra foam drinking, tennis playing, goddamn white collar capitalist rut we seem to be wallowing in, raw dead fish served on rice, in roles, and on its own is now the "in" thing to eat. Fuck. God forbid that you don't fit in with all the other wannabe asian freaks running around this world, but i digress. where was i? sushi, the fashion statement of the food world.  There are three different types of "sushi." Yes i did say three, and yes i do know what i'm talking about so shut up and listen.  1. sashimi. plain and simple, sashimi means raw fish. I know I'm supposedly telling you all there is to know about sushi, so what's sashimi doing here? Sit down and shut up for a minute. I figure that you need to know the basics before we go on. That's right little grasshopper you do take your pants off before taking a piss. So back to it; japanese people do eat fish in its base raw form. the least ivy league wannabe of the group. chopsticks required, you know that pair of long sticks many asians like to use when eating. Don't worry about looking like a complete jackass when you admit to your date that you don't have the mental capacity to operate a piece of wood, chances are no one in the restaurant does either.  2. nigiri sushi this stuff is the shit.   3. maki sushi the sushi upper crust. at least that's what the western world thinks of when they hear that magical five-letter word. Real asians, not those people who want to impress their next fuck with being "high culture," don't often eat this stuff. It's a lot like an asian version of a sandwhich, but don't tell the wannabe rich white guy. Of course there are many different catagories of maki sushi, all with very ethnic sounding names such as: spicy tuna handroll, california roll, etc, etc.  Now the secret to being a sushi connasour is to be able to eat the offending piece of flesh without ralfing on your date/boss/significant other.  more to come

      hello everyone. Just some random writing to fill up some space. What should I talk about today? Whitehorse. It's where I am planning to go to next year for my psIII placement. I think I should clarify.  In the Education faculty there are three professional practicums that we must complete. Anyhow, psI and psII went great for me so I am given the opportunity to travel anywhere to do my last practicum. So I plan Whitehorse. Really cold place in one of Canada's northern territories. People tell me it's one of the more miserable places to be during the winters. -45 in the summers but up to 25 in the summers. It should be a lot of fun.  So why am I planning to go up there. Well, to make it short, it's not Lethbridge. What's so wrong with Lethbridge you ask? Here's one of the posts that I wrote for lastkidonthebus:   _____    Last kid on the bus...feels like most of my life has been like that.  Not going to bore you with too much of the sentimental bullshit. You won't get any of my crap about how nobody wanted to pick me on their sport teams or shit like that. It always pissed me off to listen to people whine about their childhood and be stuck in one of those fuckin' cycles. "I can't ask girls out because Cloe Patterson laughed at me when I was 6 and it made me so nervous I peed my pants." Get the fuck over it.  chances are Cloe dropped out in Junior High married some 40 year old pedophile named Chuck, and currently holds the title for most appearances in a "D" rated prono film. Now unless you still have the problem of pissing over every girl that you talk to, you don't have a problem anymore.    what was i trying to say before i started that rant is...  So i live in this little crap town, Lethbridge.  Our famous attractions include:                      1. a very big train bridge                    2. a wisky post from pre-confederate Canada that never actually existed in Lethbridge.                    3. the largest distribution of churches per capita anywhere.                    4. surly Native Americans                    5. surly Red Necks                    6. the largest concentration of old people outside of Victoria and Florida.                     7. more Asian people than you can shake a stick at.              and 8. the god-damned wind             So if you're not interested in cruzin for chicks at the local senior centre, and going gopher hunting with 50 caliber sniper rifles, you're, like me, screwed.  welcome to my life. call me wayne.   ______  Interesting isn't it?  If you're  interested in seeng more of the old page go to  urlLink dazed.

      This is what was written back  __    Here it is Sarah, your choice if you want to read it or not.  You say that I am not the bad decision, it was your actions. You tell me that you gave too much of yourself too soon and that you need to back off. You say that you didn't want to make things too complicated for us. You said that we can no longer be friends. Didn't you want someone to go out and have sandwiches with? Someone that you can enjoy yourself around? From what you've told me from your past I can empathise with your fears dealing with relationships. You told me about us/mexico and it seemed to me that you were reaching out. And you didn't like the notion of me liking you like I would a sister. "I want to start by making a strong foundation as friends, and then we can build our relationship from there. If you can take it slow and flirt with me at school. I'll kiss you when I'm ready." Please tell me what I was supposed to think?  I know how important religion is in you life and what role it plays in your day-to-day world. I know it has brought you strength and hope, and through faith, the ability to go on. Didn't you say that actions and intent speak louder than rantings comming out of a person's mouth? Though it's unfortuneate that I don't share your same faith, does that make me so much easier to dismiss? I understand your concern for your children. I understand that it might be confusing for them to try to discern the nature of relationships with you and your friends, I wasn't asking to be over every day, I wasn't asking to be portrayed as the male influence in thier lives. It was never my intent to have them call me "dad" anytime soon. I do not have any notion that "I have to save this single mom." I only wanted to be with you, share in whatever joys or misfortunes that we both have. As a friend or otherwise.  Here's the one thing that got me though, your descisions and your actions weren't that great as of the last little while. This would have to be over the nature of our relationship. Didn't you say that I did have a choice to get "mixed up with you" rather than tell me that it's a "bad idea?" So if getting emotionally involved with me was such a bad thing then I am the mistake. You said that you couldn't be my friend anymore because of "personal reasons." Are these  the same reasons why you broke your relations with the guy in Calgary?  I'm not angry or upset with you. If you thought I was, then you didn't know me as well as I thought. What I am is sad. I find myself caring about you. You are in my thoughts, and I have a feeling that this feeling was, at least some point, mutual. I wasn't asking for you to marry me, I only wanted to be in your company. You asked me to tell you when you were pushing me away, this is it. I won't beg for you to reconsider, it's a decision that you've made on your part, I can respect that. Just remember that not all people are bad decisions. I'm sorry Sarah, but things will be different between us the next you see me. What you said killed something inside me, i'll mourn its loss. It's said that we each have a path that we must follow, some journey that was plotted for us from before we were born. It isn't reaching the end that is the most important, but how we get there. Each step that we take will determine our journey down the road. It's my hope for you that you will find someone that you can be comfortable with and open yourself too. For whatever reason you didn't feel that this was to be me. I'm not saying that we were meant to be together forever and ever, I just wish that you could have shared these things with me. I'm going to go on a walk. I don't know if you'll recognize me when you see me again. Wayne will always love you.  Take care of yourself Sarah.  sf    ___  Overly dramatic wayne, but then again you've always been that way haven't you?    shut up simon.

      __  Hi How's it going?  I've been learning some hard lessons lately and I've realized I've made some mistakes and bad decisions. So for reason's I don't feel comforatble explaing, I regret I can't be a close friend to you anymore. I'm going to have to cancel our coffee tomorrow  Please don't feel like it's anything you did cause it's not. I want to hang out with you on a casual basis at school and such; but I'm going to have to say no, to one on one dates. Please don't mis judge me, remember that it may seem irrational to you but It's not just myself I have to worry about but the whole big picture. My kids, and God included. Thanks for your friendship  your a wonderful guy. I hope you'll still talk to me at school!  Sarah  __   it's great to know that i was a mistake and a bad decision. gives me that warm fuzzy feeling inside. thanks sarah

      I was working in Essies last night. This in and of itself is allright, sure it means that I have to work, but at least while I'm being a capitalist whore I get to look at all the pretty ladies.  Sometimes the ladies even offer various...but that's a different story.  I need to get going but I'm gonna tell you about the one large "altercation" that we were pulled into.   people suck

A co-worker hit me over the head with a pot today, but I don't think that counted. All that did was inspire retribution. Well, no one really liked him all that much, people appreciated having him locked in the meat cooler for an hour...hmmm.

      So here I am again, sitting infront of this stupid monitor. Why is it that I find myself in this position. Over and over again I find myself here trying to look for answers for a question that I don't have.  and all the rest of this meaningless dribble. when i write on this blog i ask myself two things, three actually, the third is "do I want a beer?"  The first thing I ask myself is will anyone even see this blog? the second. does anyone even care?

      I have to say I have a real good friend out there.   I know that she's a agreat friend because whe I was confused she used little words to explain it to my dumb ass. That's friendship. Thank you.   So it seems like almost all of those loose strings are on their way to being tied up. It's kinda scarry, having nothing left to tie me down.   I was even able to get the pesky mutual fund guy out of my hair. That took some effort. It brings up some ideas on relative morality more dealing with the nature of lies. When is lying a bad thing? There are two philosophical theories that one can use to look into the subject. Consequentialism and non-consequentialism. Is just something that we talked about in my Ethics in Teaching course that I never felt I recieved a good answer to.  non-consequentialists would argue that all individuals are moral agents in their own right and to maintain respect for these moral actors you must always follow the correct action regardless of the outcome.  consequentialists would say that it is the results of the actions that you need to take into consideration, all actions should before the greater good.  In essence:  non-consequentialist - fuck what happens, do the right thing you spineless son of a bitch. consequentialist - let's kill all the poor, they're only leaches in our society anyway.  I love philosophical thought.   so on the notion of lying. When is it allright to lie. Appart from the crazies most people would say it's contextual. If some serial-killing-psycho asks if your significant other is in the house so they may use thier skin as a meat suit, you'd probably tell the guy that you haven't seen him/her.  So when is it "bad" to lie? What lessor degree does the situation have to be to justify lying? Is it just some simple cost analysis as to the probable outcome and then use tose figures to determine our actions? If that's right can't we justify just about any action that we may choose to do?

      caroline called.  for those of you who don't know who caroline is she's one of, if not, my bestest friend in the whole world. anyhow she asked me if I wanted to be her roommate for the next year. Her fiance, if accecpted to school, will be moving to BC for two years and she wanted to know if I would move up and be her roomie for a year. I have to say that I really wanted to.  this is the girl that's going to be my best man, i love this girl. so she said come up to calgary, I was really tempted. Talked about since I'm so far into my program I wouldn't be able to transfer my courses over. She asked if I would take a year off, almost said yes. I just really need to get finished school. had things been a little different my bags would have been packed, I would have been outta here.  sf

      well, what can i say today? not a whole lot really. the mormons are after me again. little stint that i'd like to call "dinner and a baptisim" kinda funny really. fun hanging out night with jilliane, turns into a great big lds event. don't get me wrong, she's a great gal, haven't hung out with her for some like 2 years, but when i get to the dinner everyone was "your with jill? all right jill! *wink wink, nudge nudge*    yeah, anyway   i get through the dinner and we move onto the baptisim. really big sermon on how important the ligitimacy of the clergy is.  what ever, but the thing that really got me was the fact that they had duteronomy quoted on the walls. for those of you not familiar with the bible duteronomy is the fifth book of moses. hard core christian, jewish, and catholic shit. this is one of the sections that scare me shitless. why? here's a section from duteronomy 17. oh, this is taken from the king james edition so you can check on it if you don't believe me.       "...if there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the lord thy god giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the lord thy god, in transgressing his covenant, and hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which i have not commanded; and it be told thee...then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stoned, till they die."  this is some scarry shit. poor little bhuddist boy thought, at that moment, he was a gonna get linched.  "we don't set crosses on fire. no sir, we ignite them in the glory of the lord!!"  if you excuse me, i'm gonna go ask my parents to tuck me in, my dad to check for monsters under my bed, and for my mom to read me a nice bedtime story.

      back from Calgary, some people have been asking me if there was anything wrong. guess that i show my weariness on my face. suppose it's a step in a direction.   other news i had my first broadcast of my radio show this morning. it didn't really go as planned because the library keeper decided that he didn't like to have to phone plugged in and didn't tell anyone that he had disconnected it. So much for my interview that was planned. The result was a lot of frantic improv on my part. suppose that the show went well, but there was after all a hell of a lot of room for improvement. feels like the last 17 years have decided to hit me all at once.  i was finally able to tie up a lot of loose ends...i'll say more when i'm actually lucid.  sf

      okay, just got back from doing my first stint as an asm. doing this show right now at the university called "uncle vanya" it's a russian piece, dry as hell. looks like i'm going to be bored out of my fuckin' mind.  well, at least until hell week starts, then there's the run. 4 weeks of being bored then three weeks of insanity.  gotta love theatre.    so writing about Erin B. she's a girl on an exchange program from ohio, for those of you who aren't really familiar with the geography of the states, it's south of ontario.  right. don't rightly know how to explain it, but i met this girl during new student orientation. said that she was from the same school that chip came from, frazer, neil, and i couldn't get over it and thought it was a lot of fun. so i got her name and made a mental note to keep track off her. could be fun to know the girl, chip was interesting so i was kinda curious about Erin. this was tuesday. so the next few days i would introduce her to the others in the department:   "this is Erin, she's the new foreign exchange student."   it was kinda funny for a while, only for the first two days. so i started to get to know this girl a little bit better...didn't really do much other than talk a lot and most of the time it was about little incidental stuff that only lasted for a few hours of hanging out on the couches or some such. simply stated there wasn't really much that happened during that first week other than that i talked with her. i think it was friday evening when i gave her a call and asked her if she was doing anything on sunday. she said no. sunday rolls around sitting here wondering what it is that we can do i mention comming over to my house. told her that everyone was out of town so the place would be very quiet. gave her directions by bus on how to get here and we left it at that. after i hang up, i thought the whole thing to be very strange. would this girl really come?  i was kind of doubtful; i mean what does she know about me?   well:  his name's wayne, he's a visible minority, drama student, has some sort of a sense of humour, and has been hitting on me since i've got here. other than that i don't know anything about him, other than the fact that i've heard he's got naked at something called twoonie theatre.  given this kind of sketchy info would you travel to the other end of town to go to some guys house, guy that you don't know at all, after he's told you that his house is deserted, and you don't have anyone you can call to bail you out if you need it? i don't think so. imagine my suprise when i saw her get off at my bus stop. i gave her a little tour of the house, figured why not people are curious and it gives me a starting point for talking, after we watched unbreakable, bowling for columbine, and had spirited away playing in the background while talking about stuff and finishing off a hawaiian pizza. we just sat and talked about a lot of everything. mon and tues just said hey, sat around a lot and talked here and there. not about anything in particular, just sort of hung for a bit when we saw each other.   incidentally at the table on tuesday i saw sarah and talked with her for about an hour. that's another story.   so tuesday i walked Erin home with lina, tawny. lina went straight to her place and  i mentioned to tawny about going off with her, but trying to get that across was like talking to a brick. incidentally everyone thinks that there's a little something going on between us, not truth, but you know rumors. so we got to see her place and while i was heading i asked her about supper or something for wednesday, all good.   wednesday, talked some more during the day. incidental stuff, nothing of earth shattering importance. met up with her for "supper." it started as going to icy's and getting some food. hers was beef taco salad, i had veggie burrito, both had frozen yogurt, blackberry and oreo. took her 25 min to eat her food. it's going to be something to look at when we go for some food at a sit bown place. kinda weird if i'm finished in 5 and she's still hating after 3 hours. digressing. conversation turned a little heavy then. she told me about her cousin and what happened when she was in cleveland. he was into the drugs and one night month before she came here he got high called the police to take him away, ran out and forced an officer to kill him. said that she saw the whole thing on the police cameras. i listened. i told her about when i wanted to die. how i want to live.  went inside and sat at the pool for a bit talking about my views on religion and how i saw the world. then i went to the ckul meeting.  after ckul, i went over to her place so i could keep her company while she was doing laundry and we wound up talking some more about non incidental class subjects. after the dryer was finished doing what dryers do we went back over to her house and sat on her front porch. i couldn't believe how cold it was but i couldn't move. Erin opened up to me and told me about all of the fears that she had in lethbridge. how hard it is for her to deal with what happens here.  religion plays an important, fundamental, role in her life, and she's in a position where she has had to sacrifice what "society" believes "theatre" should be in order to maintain this core. i saw that it hurt her deeply. she is in fear of becomming isolated, more shunned, from the other members of the drama department because the majority of us don't share the same views as she. how is she supposed to "fit in" without sacrificing her ideals? she believes so srongly in what she believes is right, but doesn't want to isolate herself by becoming preachy to the rest of us. this pressure on top of finally, after some years (6?) of not being able to live/leave her family to live away from them, and the tragity of what occured with her cousin, it weighs heavily.  i took her hand and told her that she wasn't alone, and will never be alone. i don't know if she believes it, but i meant what i said. holding her hands... she talked about how much she liked me but could'nt date because i wan't christian.  that hurts. same stuff sarah told me too. told me she saw a calm centre to me, she likes me, groovy. told me that years back she made a vow not to kiss anyone until she gets married, and that being around me she is strongly tempted to forget it. we talked about things like this for over an hour, even when we were interrupted by the r.a. she never let go of my hands.   i don't know where i wanted to go with this. it's just too important to forget.

      So I'm trying to get myself a radio station through CKUL. That's the station that we have over here at the university. Now most years it's been alright and there really hasn't been any problem getting time slots. Funny thing, this year it's all nuts. Last year there were people with 3 hour time slots, now the old volunteers have to settle with a 1 hour show, and even then there's no guarentee that I would be able to get any time. That's gonna suck.

      new semester starting tomorrow. I'm really excited over the fact that I get to see all of my friends, and make a bunch of new ones. I've already met a bunch of people bacause I am in TAS. Guy named Kyle, or something, and a really cute girl named Elizabeth. Got her phone number and everything already. Chem major, cute girl. Wonder if she'll ever come down and get a TAS membership...  down to what I wanted to say.  I'm scared shitless. I think it has something to do with the endless and unrelenting march of time.  I think I'm also afraid, not of being alone, but being forgotten. I'll talk later.

      I've been having the most amazing luck with women lately.  It's basically composed of me hearing every single break-up excuse known to man. Litterally. Here are some of the more interesting ones:  1. You're not Christian. 2. You're too religious. 3. You're too Japanese. 4. You're too young. 5. You're too old.  Want to let you know # 4 and 5 were said by people who were only a year older/younger than me. I'm not a fuckin pedophile.  6. It's not you, it's me. 7. It's not me, it's you.  That combination just cracks me up.  8. My daughters almost as old as you. It would just be weird.  Don't ask. cute daughter though...  9. I'm not ready for this kind of comittment.  10. You're not comitted enough. 11. I'm looking for someone who has a future and can support me.  The above was said when we were both 19. Someone who has a future and can support me. I was going to school!!! What sort of support and future did this person have in mind? There is no way that I was gonna get a job right out of high school, pick up some girl and start having kids. Kinda scarry but it's not unheard of here. Living in this bible belt people are marrying eachother off as soon as they go through puberty. Kinda scary, kids who just figured out what to do with the thing between their legs are going out, getting married, and based on their enormous ammounts of life experience, raising kids and imparting that information onto them. It's either that or becuase there's so many redneck people living here, there's almost a mentality that is driving some girls to go forth and procreate. Who cares who the father is let's just get knocked up! No wonder I'm a drunk.   12. I'm a lesbian, I just wanted to know what it would be like to date a guy. 13. You're too much of a friend and I don't want to lose that friendship.  here are the two kickers that I want to write about.  14. You're too experienced for me and I don't think that it's the right thing for me at this time.  This was comming from a second year girl. I met her as she was waiting at the couches for the rest of her group members. Some sort of rehersal for Drama 1000 presentation. Being the carefree guy that I portray myself to be, I go over and start talking to her. Find out her name is Kim, Com-Sci major, etc, etc, etc. Anyhow as her group starts to show she asks one of the guys to give her a back rub. Buddy saiz no, tells her he sucks. How could I pass up that opportunity? I volunteer. For all of you who are reading you should know that I am amazing when it comes to having my hands on a womans body. Being modest here when I say that for an "untrained, uncertified" person(whatever that's supposed to mean). I'm better than a lot of butchers who work in massage parlours. The legal kind you sick bastard. in 15 min I had her moaning and giving me her number. Few days later we go out on this date, was allright, nothing really to write about. Wrap it up by going to her house to watch a movie. So I give her a more personal  massage she seemed to enjoy it.  Few days later, after my first Random Poetry meeting,  I give this girl a call to see how she's doing. She gives me this song and dance about how I am too experienced for her and how that's bad for her "at this time" whatever that's supposed to mean.   A girl dumping a guy because he's too "experienced." There's something wrong there, right?  I could go on bout this but it's another post and I have shit to write, don't sidetrack me. So I hang up the phone and go down to the food court to grab some munchies. At this point I have thought I have heard every single "I'm dumping you line" ever invented, half laughing, getting even more cynical by the moment. This is when I see one of the girls that was in my poetry meeting. She asked how I was doing and I told her. She said she empathised because she hasn't had a real date for the last 3 years. Don't get me wrong, this is one of the most beautiful girls I have seen in the last few years. Very well put together. This news shocked me. So in hopes of turning a bad situation into something good I tell her I'm going to take her out on a date. She replied with much enthusiasm. I was in shock. Not only does this come less than 10 min since computer girl dumped me, this other one was a hottie.  She was going to leave the next day for an extended Thanksgiving weekend (Canadian one not American). Today, thanksgiving day she sends me this. Number 15.  ________  Hey Wayne  Hope you had a decent weekend, I'm sure it was busy busY! lol.  Anywho, in responce to your lunch request...I'd love to, but I can't.  Unfortunately its not gonna work to go on that date...I've kind of suddenly decided to move home....sorry, it was kind of a sudden decision, made this weekend.  So I guess I'm not gonna be able to do the random poetry thing either...bummer to both of those things.  but I have to so this...I kind of realized that I'm not supposed to be here right now...if that makes any sense at all.  but ya, If you've got MSN or ICQ or something let me know, we could still talk then, that'd be cool.  Kaila _______  Now I know this has absolutely nothing to do with me, but I choose to take this as, "i'm leaving the city because I can't think of an excuse good enough to get you to leave me alone. My only available choice of action is to run away and hope that you never find where I live. Stay away from me Asian, psycho."   or   "i'm leaving the city becuase you drove me away."  It's a lot more fun this way, I'm sure if you think about it for a while you'll understand too.  I'm done for today.  sf

      I saw her last night at the closing of Blood. It felt as if it had been months since I've seen her last. She came up and started talking to me. While we were talking she started a conversation with other people about how she didn't want a ride, it was getting so I had to go and start doing the electrics strike. It seemed that she wanted to talk, or something, though this may be all in my imagination. As she was finishing telling the guys, lina, the god botherer, and some others, I said I needed to go and do strike so I left. I was curt and clipped in my responses, but how else could I have been? The girl who said that she didn't want to see me, or talk to me anymore, comming along as if nothing had ever happened. If she wants to talk she knows where to reach me.

      I was just asked to fill out a survey. Now normally things would be allright, but the survey they asked of me was written so that the gatherer could ask the question why do you think that minorities aren't as prevalent in the faculty of education. Why aren't there more ethnics teaching ethnics? interesting point. can see good from the question, but I can see a lot of stupid from the question as well.  more to come when I formalize my thoughts.

      I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  Remember the good times that we had? I let them slip away from us when things got bad How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one  I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I'm so tired but I can't sleep Standin' on the edge of something much too deep It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard  But I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to loose Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light  And I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  And I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Weep not for the memories

      Friday, November 14, 2003   Wayne... I wish I could make it better. I don't know enough. I wish a lot of things, all of which would be useless to voice. I wish I knew what is going to happen to your people. I wish I could answer your questions, make it better. I can't.  Wayne, I understand the pain that caused your action, but why did you give the bible to me? Why to me? You could have stabbed me and caused me less pain. I couldn't speak for anger. I know you were in pain, you weren't thinking. Been there. I love you, I forgive you, but I need you to know how it felt for me. I understand your need to search, I hope with all my heart that you will find Jesus. That's right, I'm going to say it, I'm not going to be ashamed or timid anymore. The truth is Jesus, I'll believe that till I die, I don't know the answers to your problems, I don't condemn you, but that is the truth. The Bible says that God is lenient on the ignorant. Your people are ignorant-- some of them--but you are not. Please, for your own sake, keep that in mind.  Thank you for loving me. You told me you don't want me to just let things slide, because I will grow to resent our relationship. You want to be with me, I want to, too, but as a result you keep pursuing and I keep giving in, and this is the only way I know how to not let things slide.  This is goodbye.  Wayne, this is a decision I have made. I don't know if I can explain, I'm not going to try. It is sudden, it is painful, you are hurt, you are angry, bitter, maybe hate me. I hope someday you can find it in you to forgive me. Yes, if you were a christian this would have been different. I won't deny that. But I'm the one who made the choice to do what I knew was wrong. That's the last thing I'm going to say or listen to about who's fault it is or isn't. Quit feeling sorry for yourself, and quit beating yourself up. It doesn't help a single thing.  I can't go with you to Empress Theatre. I won't be using your tickets for Blood Relations, thank you for offering them to me. Please don't see me off at the airport. I can't accept the Canadian box from you, I'm so sorry I know you worked hard on it. Please don't call, please don't write. Please don't send me anything for my birthday, or try to visit. I will not be coming to 5th floor lobby again (stop saying you'll be the one to stay away, this is my decision, I reserve the right to do as I please). I will not be visiting this blog or your personal blog again. I won't be participating in or attending Twoonie. Thank you so much for lending me your Cd player and discs, you will find them in the box office tomorrow. I'm so sorry.  I love you. I pray for you, for your grandfather, for your future and your search for God. I love you. I don't know what else to say. I'm going to do everything I can not to resent what we had. I love you, I'm not sorry I met you. I hope I never will be sorry.  With all my heart, Erin  ｶ 5:47 AM

      Life is funny isn't it?   You have to wonder.  We go through life  searching for someone,  someone who can give  completion.   A person to whom you  give yourself.  Fully, completely,  no reservations.   Most will go through  life forever searching.  Always feeling as if  they are lost.   A left sock  stuck in the wash.  Wet, cold, alone.   The loneliness becomes  a comforting familiarity.  And though you fight,  it becomes a friend.   You resign yourself  to the cold.  You give up.   You tell yourself  the cold isn't bad.  You tell yourself  you perfer things  as they are.   But you're alone.   And as you lie there  dead to the world  something happens.  You meet someone.   it starts slowly, or it hits you like a frieght train. whatever analogy you want to use. the thing is your taken completely off guard, it blindsides you and while your standing there looking dazed, you fall in love. madly in love. you spend time wondering if it is love that you feel. do you actually feel this way or is it the feeling that you're addicted to. sit, meditate, comtemplate, think, feel, love.   love? are you sure?   how do you tell if it's really love? you know how you feel. but do you really? she makes you feel complete when you're together. isn't that simply enjoyment of the feeling, not the feeling itself? so how do you know? is it lust, infactuation, or simply a hormonal imbalance? how do you know? how can you be sure? the question demands an answer. so answer it. i looked, i searched, then i asked myself what was the most important. after a while an answer came to me.   her happiness.   there's a distinct possibility that after next month it will not involve me, knowing this hurts. more than anything i know, but i love her. so i'll spend what time i have left with her, and cherish those memories that we'll share. and after she goes, i hope for her the best.   i love you Erin.

      She kissed me. Erin kissed me. Erin gave me a kiss. wow. I hope that it was allright for her. It's funny.  Suffering from performance anxiety that is. It means so much to me. I really so love that girl.  november 1, 6:29 pm    I remember the time. kinda pathetic isn't it?     oh, I forgot to mention. I hate ice. Not because of all it's inherant good chilling properties. No mostly because of the humiliation factor. That and it tried to kill me.  Let me explain. It was snowing and cold the night of November 1. After Erin closed the door I proceeded to do this little hop skippity jiggish dancy thing on my way down those stairs. I came about half a shuffle'foot to biffing it on those stairs leading down to more unforgiving and malicious ice. yeah, that's my ice story. forget the fact that I was excited as a little school girl on getting kissed. She kissed me!   ok enough of that.    yea!

      Hi everyone. Look what I found! I was online looked in my mailbox and boom. A friend of mine sent me a forward containing the following. It seems to do much in signifying all that is wrong in societal thought, so I put it in. You should tell me what you think of it.  ________________________________   will we still be the Country of choice and still be Canada or the USA if we continue to make the changes forced on us by the people from other countries that came to live in Canada or the USA because it is the Country of Choice????????   Think about it........    All I have to say is, when will they do something about MY RIGHTS? I celebrate Christmas, but because it isn't celebrated by everyone, we can no longer say Merry Christmas. Now it has to be Season's Greetings. It's not Christmas vacation, it's Winter Break. Isn't it amazing how this winter break ALWAYS occurs over the Christmas holiday?? We've gone so far the other way, bent over backwards to not offend anyone, that I am now being offended. But it seems that no one has a problem with that.  This says it all! After hearing that the state of Florida changed its opinion and let a Muslim woman have her picture on her driver's license with her face covered this is an editorial written by an American citizen, published in a Tampa newspaper. He did quite a job; didn't he? Read on, please!  IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS OR CANADIANS, MUST ADAPT. I am tired of our nations worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans and Canadians. However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled when the "politically correct" crowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending others. I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to our countries. Our population is almost entirely made up of descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here, need to understand. This idea of our countries being a multi cultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. As Americans and Canadians we have developed our own culture, our own society, our own language and our own lifestyle. This position has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.  We speak ENGLISH or French, not Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language! "In God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.  If freedom offends you, or you don't like this way of life, then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. We are happy with our cultures and have no desire to change them, and we really don't care how you did things where you came from. This is OUR COUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle. Every citizen has the right to express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great freedom, THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.  If you agree -- pass this along; if you don't agree -- delete it!   _____________________________________________________  isn't it fun? I'm having troubles deciding if this person was serious, or fooling, canadian, american, or sees north america as one big amalgamous country. At any end it was able to amuse for the last 5 minutes.

I'll spend time again with you dear blog and any perchance readers that may happen to stumble into my room. So till later...  here's my favourite Canadian artist of the moment. I had an opportunity to meet and work with her this last semester, and I'm smitten. awwww   urlLink Welcome to Pochsy.org

      So hi,    Some very interesting things that are happening soon. Let's see, it's what...the 30th today. That means that it's Canada day tomorrow! Great fun to be had by all. Canada's birthday. Born in 1867 Canada's still a fairly young country, only being 137 tomorrow. Too many growing pains that we're dealing with. Things like constantly defining our collective culture, economic and socio-cultural stratification has always been an area which caused much tension and strife, not to mention being north of so many americans.   You know, I can't really structure my thoughts right now I'll try again later. well...5 more nights before I go off to Okinawa! Looking forward to fun.

      hello everybody.    Well let's see what's going on...two days ago my sister had her high school graduation. All in all it was a very nice day. It took the whole day but it was an interesting experience to see the youngest at a ceremony which effectively ended her high school education. The strangeness I'll comment on when I have more time.  Today is the day where all Canadians over the age of 18 with federally issued identification may go and express their appathy. That's right it's federal election time once again. You know, I have a question. Myabe one of you can answer this for me. Unlike the states, we here don't vote for the individual, we vote for the party. Whomever is the party leader in the riding does the running, and whomever gets the most seats becomes prime minister. So far straight forward. So why is it that in Canada for all the campaign promisses that are strewn around, all of the candidates say "I will...I am...I had..." Kinda busy right now so I won't be able to get on my rant about the whole political system and climate in Canada. I'll save that rant for a later date.  sf

      There was a short thundershower tonight. It made me feel connected to everything somehow. A deep seated feeling in my soul that I was connected to everything. It's a funny thing really. Only happens when it rains. Guess that's part of why I want to get out of the prairies so much.

      Hi again everyone. It's been a while since I've written. I'm sorry about that. It's mostly because I've been in constant contact, wmail anyways) with Lexie. Since I've been able to tell her everything that's been going on, I really didn't feel the urge to post. I guess that's me being lazy. Well, let's see. I've been busy with preperations to go to Okinawa. 13 more nights before I get on the plane and head off over seas. If you think about it, I havent' really, it's not that much time before I head off. wow. anyhow, I suppose that I have things to amuse me before my time there and after I come back. Let's see. There is work, completing my course at the university, getting all of my prep work done for my fine arts project this fall...starting on my professional portfolio, trying to find enough money to give me some spending money for my trip (which at this point I have none) and generally keeping up on all of the housework that needs to be done.  I guess it is enough to keep me occupied. None of it will probably happen, but there's always the hope.  Well, I should get running again. It's 1 in the morning over here, I'm watching Shakespeare in Love, so I can have a good, "really missing Lexie moment" Need to get up again by about 7ish so I can get outta here and finish my homework. Spend something like $700 to get my work printed off...*sigh* anyone have have cash they can gift to me? in exchange I am willing to write you a small song and send a tape with me performing it for you?  sf

      Greetings from Japan!!  I finally found:      A) time    B) a computer that didn`t cost an arm and a leg to use, and most importantly,   C) a toilet that didn`t try to spray hot, burning water in my ass everytime I take       a shit. I mean seriously It`s something akin to getting a raidoactive enema. Sure      it might be good for you but do I really want it?  The answer comes in as No!  So all is good over here. I`m sitting in the lobby of a hotel in Kumamoto, wondering when my tour guide will come and take me away.  Kumamoto is a small city in Kyushu, one of the four main islands in Japan. I think it`s the smallest but I don`t really know. The weather is kinda nice. There`s been a constant wind while I`ve been in Japan so although the temperatures been in the low-mid 30`s, insessantly, the wind`s allowing me to atleast pretend that it`s somewhat cool.   Okay, it seems like my tourguide has come. Look for future editions and explanations of my trip including but not limited to:   Disneyland   Tokyo sight seeing   My family  sf
