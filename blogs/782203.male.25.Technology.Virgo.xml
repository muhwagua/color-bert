Saw a pretty hot looking gal in the gym there that made me work out that much harder but now im feeling the pain and kinda regretting it :( after that went to watch Bend It Like Beckham , pretty funny movie but the shittiest thing happened while we were watching the show this kid sneaked up to our row peeked at us and went back to his friends and they all started giggling like the idiots they were .....anyway they were sec school kids so i figured no point confronting them .....but it really pissed me off .ok later i got to go sign up for my advanced thery test but just damm lazy to go cos no one is at home so just feel like lazing ard at home with no one to nag at me ........oh well maybe i will go to the library instead much nearer ...see how lah .......damm i got to stop typing "......" ......ok thats all i got to say now .......

      Just Saw the sadddest movie i seen in a while ...Its Dancer in the Dark starring one of my fav musicians bjork.Thanks to my recently acquired broadband connection i manage to dl it although it took me like a week! anyway the wait was well worth it cos the movie is really something, bjork plays this factory worker from czechklosvakia who is losing her sight , its hereditary , so shes saving up money for an operation for her son so that he wun go blind as well. To escape this grim reality she daydreams that she is in a musical becos like she says , "nothing bad happens in a musical". halfway during the movie a quick succession of tragedies occur and her life rapidly takes a turn for the worse and her daydreams become more and more frequent cos thats the only way she can cope with them. The ending is really tragic and I couldnt help letting out a tear or two , it was just that painful to watch. I read that when this picture was awarded Best Picture at 2000 Cannes festival (Bjork got Best Actress) there were people who booed and jeered , cant really understand why !  I downloaded A Clockwork Orange yesterday gonna watch it later .....well nothing else to do also ......

      How can a gal who once made me as happy as i can remember,  now can cause me such misery and pain? There was a time not too long ago when i couldnt wait to see or talk to her, i thought abt her all the time. Now all she seems to do is put me down , tell me how irritating i am or how sick she is of me .....I wish i never met her ....But anyway she is out of my life for good now , and vice versa. Only thing i have left of her is the book she lend me, its gonna be a painful reminder of what i went thro with her everytime i look at it.

      Damm Man Utd lost again ! wtf man they are playing like crap and I almost cried when i saw Barthez flapping his arms like a dying bird trying to get to a cross , he is really out of form rite now. and the rest arent really much better , every promising attack broke up in the final third of the field and bloody nisterooy is like a big baby who keeps complaining to the referee everytime he falls to the ground, i mean get with the game man ! Hope Fergurson does something really soon or we might see the team failing to even get a top 3 position.

      So had a pretty cool birthday yesterday, wati took me out for a nice dinner at delifrance and to watch Road to Perdition. And she even bought me a beautiful pen shes such a sweet person ! The movie was excellent, and it was really refreshing to see Tom Hanks take on a role of someone who is so bent on revenge that he doesnt care who he kills to get it, there was one scene where i was pretty sure he wouldnt kill the guy so i was kinda surprised when he did. However , i still prefer his previous feature American Beauty which i watched a few days ago, it was really funny and also every character in the movie was really engrossing to watch with their own little quirks.

      Yesterday was my convocation , and it was pretty cool , i thought i looked pretty cute in my pretty convocation gown ! Took loads of pictures , ok not loads around 20+ pics with my friends and my parents. And I wanted to take this picture with this cute gal that i had a crush on couple years back but unfortuantely she kinda asked my other friend to join us i the pic damm ! oh well no worries i will just have to cut him out of the pic after i develop it *snicker* ....But i was really stressed the day b4 cos i couldnt find the damm convocation tickets and i was like turning the house upside down looking for them. Luckily i realised i left it at my sis's place so had to travel all the way there and back to get them ,took me like 3 hours ...sigh i dun know why i always do stuff at the last minute. And then i found out my mom forgot to sow the hooks on my gown and that got me even more stressed out cos i asked her to do it like 2 days ago ....Fortunately everything turned out fine in the end  Ok today is my bday , yup im 24 ...24 that seems so old yet i still feel like im 18 or something ......I mean i still wear the same type of clothes i did when i was 18 , ok maybe they are more tasteful now but still ard the same. No big plans for today , just gonna see Road to Perdition later with a gal friend of mine, heard its a great movie but damm couldnt they have chosen a better movie title or something ?  I downloaded and watched american beauty at ard 1 am in the morning and i loved it ! It was so engrossing and Kevin Spacey was really awesome as this burnt out 40 something husband guy with a really dsyfunctional family , his wife is so driven by success and material things that she totally ignores her family , and the daughter is so embarassed by him and his wife that she starts having a relationship with her creepy neighbour who films her every move...only complain i had was that spacey kind of gives away at the beginning of the movie that he was going to die , the ending would have been much more dramatic if i didnt know that.

      Monday morning and i had to go to the hospital for my skin problem. Got totally ripped off they took skin samples and did tests and all that crap and then came to the conclusion that i had dry skin and send me home packing with 2 jars of moisturers, what a total rip off cos it cost me $150 altogether.  Other than that it was a pretty uneventful day, came back home and played CM for the whole afternoon, checked on my online job sites for any job vacancies but still no luck. Sigh i wonder how long its gonna take its been like 3 months already and i feel guilty sucking my parents dry of their money. Just my luck that i had to graduate from university in the middle of our country's worst economic recession, or at least the worst that I can remember.   Oh yeah downloaded another couple of tracks from the Queens of the Stone Age's new album Songs for the Deaf, this is really amazing stuff, best music i have heard this year. Hope to get my hands on the CD soon so i can play it on my hi-fi, listening to it on the computer just ain't the same thing. btw an interesting fact abt the Queens is that Dave Grohl is their new drummer and he does an awesome job. I never thot i would be into this kind of classic rock stuff but i guess im just really sick of nu metal rite now , most of the bands out now sound so generic and lacking any sort of passion in the music they play. Except Korn though, Untouchables rules !!! But Linkin Park, Limp Biskit and all that other crap i just hope they die out soon.    Albums I listened to today on my hi-fi:  1. Toxicity by System of a Down  2. Untouchables by Korn  3. Sources Codes and Tags by Trail of Dead  4. XX by Mushroomhead  5. Is This It by the Strokes

      Ok it has been a pretty interesting week.....nope actually it was really crappy. The first gal i ever met off the net basically told me i creeped her out; yeah life doesn't get any better than that does it. Apparently i was invading her personal space and our meetings were very 'unnatural' and she said i assumed that she wanted to be friends in real life as well when she actually didnt.  Well here is the thing, after we met for the first time, i wasn't going to ask her or anything cos i thot it went pretty badly, She was the one who called me and asked me to go out with her again; so im kinda confused - if she just wanted to be online friends why the hell did she ask me out again ? and also why did she meet me again for breakfast after that? and also the last time we met she actually was suggesting going to play badminton; if it was that unnatural why would she even do that it just doesnt make any sense and yeah its been picking on my brain the last week. But I do not want to ask her about it cos it would probably make things weirder than they are.  But cant help having this feeling of regret cos i really liked her, she was this gal who went thro and still going thro a lot of crap in her life and is now a lot stronger for it, shes totally supporting herself eventhough shes studying which is much more than what i can say for my unemployed ass, and also a really kind gal who cares for others, i mean when she spend like 30 bucks on a birthday present for the kid she was giving tuition to, i was really impressed, it's probably something that i would never do. Basically she made me want to be a better person. Oh well thats life ain't it, just full of weirdos(i mean me) and disappointments

      A friend of mine failed her driving test today and she seems really upset over it. She was saying how nothing seemed to go right for her and i can really relate to that; thats what i was feeling a week ago. Anyway because of my 'honesty first' phase right now i think i kinda made her feel worse damm someone warned me it would backfire on me but i wouldn't listen. I think when pple are depressed abt something they would rather hear consoling words than honest words.

      Was reading the classifieds today and there was this letter in the forum sent in by this Malay gal complaining about her frustration in getting a job because so many of them required Mandarin, and she basically called it subtle discrimination. Well I have been complaining to everyone about this for a few months now and i know how she feels but hey thats how the world works. Ya it fucking sucks but there is nothing you can do about it. Her letter is not going to like change that.

      Got this really weird letter from the army. It basically said that I have been posted to the G2 Branch of HQ 9DIV as an "Interrogator classified under Interrogation Cell" and that I have to attend this 'MI Course' on the 28th of April. Ya i got no idea what the hell it means either.  Met up with Wee at Bedok today, i was so tempted to tell him how much i hated the fact that he got into NCS but not me, but manage to supress it though. We talked for like an hour and a half and he drove me back home, sweet fellow...  Got an email from Roxy today, man its been so long since i talked to her so i was really glad that she emailed me. Haven't seen her online for such a long time that i was actually getting worried that something was wrong and was thinking of emailing her. It's pretty scary when you got no idea what happened to a net friend you have known for a while.  Lana Lang from Smallville is such a babe, I think it's her eyes, they just drive me wild !

      I don't know why i get so serious and uptight when it comes to net conversations. Yesterday i finally confessed to a net friend that i didnt like the fact that she kept replying to my messages with frivolous messages like ":)" or "hehe" and that i didn't like it because it made the conversations feel very one sided (as i was doing all the talking) and that i would rather hear her thoughts and opinions on what i say. I hope she wasn't too offended about it but i think she was. Oh well...  Another thing that I really dislike is people who take too long to reply. Ya i know its weird but it pisses me off. And i also get irritated when pple just go offline without giving me a chance to say bye. For me a net conversation is no different from a phone conversation. On the phone you say "bye" and wait for the other person to say "bye" before you hang up. But some of my net friends just say bye and go offline without giving me a chance to say bye as well. I mean it's like they are in such a rush that they can't even wait an extra minute for me to reply, whats up with that !. Ya i know i'm probably being a little too weird about this but i can't help it, thats how i feel.   I think the reason why i'm so uptight about net conversations is probably cos , as sad as it sounds, the only social interaction that i have right now. My social life is practically non-existent right now and its been even worse since i graduated. When i was studying i was too busy with school work and all that to really think abt my lack of a social life. But now that i got so much time on my hands, i realise how lonely my life is right now. And i also realised that i have not felt happy in a really long time, but i was too busy with school and stuff to realise it before.

      A net friend told me something that was really private today. And as much as i appreciated the fact that she trusted me with that thing and i know i wouldn't betray her trust, i think it was kind of risky to do that cos the person who you know online might not be the real deal, like he/she might not be as trustworthy as you think he/she is and it would be really bad if he or she betrays that trust. As much as we would want to believe it, not everyone we meet are good people.    A few days ago i came to the realization that i read too much into my friendship with Sharon than I ought to have. She was treating me just as a casual friend but i was thinking we were closer than that and that was how all the problems started. I guess I felt that way because she was telling me some really personal problems that she was having at that time so i believed that she was telling them to me because she felt a connection to me. But now i realise that she did that cos its much easier to tell someone online your personal problems as compared to someone that you know in real life. Maybe its because a real friend has a much greater potential to hurt you with that knowledge compared to a net friend.   It's 2:35 AM now and i think i'm gonna go to sleep.

      Ok so i told the online friend that she is the one i wanted to go out with, and i think she was taken aback a little. Anyway i hope she doesn't take it too seriously, i mean its not like I'm looking for a gf or a relationship cos thats the last thing that i want right now, all i wanna do is go out and hopefully have a good time. I really hope things dun go weird between us because of this cos it would really really suck if it did.   Just saw Boston Public at an ungodly hour of 12:30 and well it was kinda boring not really memorable. I thot the whole class project involving the students suing Lipsihtz was kinda silly and not really believable, despite my lack of knowledge of the American judicial system i dun believe such a thing would be possible in real life. I think the series should just focus on real life social issues that are more believable.  It's 2:14 AM now and i think i'm gonna go to sleep.

      Just came back from Somerset, but the control they gave me was a different model from the one that i gave them and i forgot to check when i got it , fuck i hope it works cos i definitely do not wanna go down all the way back there again.  But it was a rather interesting trip, at least more interesting than i thought, at the mrt station there were these 2 old ladies who were heading towards the escalator that is going upwards towards the train and for some weird reason they were changed their mind and headed towards the escalator that is going downwards from the train which of cos they couldnt take,and then they came back to the escalator heading upwards again and took it. Please God kill me b4 i start doing senile stuff like that !   While waiting for the train, I sat beside a man who lifted his foot from his sandal and playing around with it , i''m serious ! It seems like he was like digging under his toenails for dirt or something it was just so damm gross ! Damm there's weird people everywhere!   Then in the train as i was sitting down this Indian gal sitting opposite of me started staring at me and i was like wondering why the hell she was doing that, i thought she was checking me out which would be probably the first time a gal ever did that to me! But then i realised that she did seem somewhat familiar but i just couldn't remember who she was. Finally it came to me that she was my distant cousin that i haven't seen in like god knows how many years . Anyway i went over and said hi and it was kinda nice you know, i mean talking to a member of the opp. sex after such a long time in captivity (i mean my home). But then i had to get off cos it was my stop and didn't have time to get her handphone number.   I been wanting to go out with this net friend of mine cos we been talking for quite a few months now and i think we get along pretty well so maybe we could like go out for a movie or something. But the problem is i already asked her once and got rejected so there is no way in hell im gonna ask her again. Anyway in my opinion i dun see whats the big deal cos in the worst case scenario if the date goes really badly we can always just laugh abt it online the next day rite , and if it goes well then we have fun. Oh well....

Well like i told her , I suddenly just feel the need to write down all my thoughts, uncut and uncensored, dun ask me why i also dun know! I don't know how long i'm gonna do this so to the people who do read this blog (yes all 4 of you), just hang on for the ride ! BTW think i shall change the description of my blog to "Ramblings of a bondafide madman" ..I dun know what the hell bonafide means but it sure does sound cool doesn't it ! : )

      I was reading Audrey's new blog yesterday and got the shock of my life when she mentioned that my blog was really funny ! LMAO That would be like the last word i would use to describe my blog .....But she seems like a pretty cool and fun gal, and those pictures she gave me of her and her cousins in the changing room were pretty cool..And nope i know what you guys are thinking, they were all fully clothed. : (     Woke up this morning to the loud din of my mom's voice complaining to my dad abt something i dun quite remember, its amazing that im in my room and shes in the kitchen and i still can hear her thats how loud her voice is. I think its a trait of older Indian women...Even in the tamil movies those Indian women talk so fucking loud that i just have to switch to another channel.   Gotta go down later to Somerset to change the remote control for my auntie's cable TV.  I kept putting it off cos its damm fucking far you know and its kinda dumb just going down to town just to change a stupid remote control, i was waiting for a day where I was going there to watch a movie but then my dad started giving me the speech abt how our auntie helped us so much in the past and how we should be grateful and all that and i just started getting really sleepy so I just cut him off and told him i will be going today. Heh he was kinda pissed abt me cutting him off but he didnt say anything cos well i agreed to do what he said rite !    Read the funniest thing in today's newspaper. The PAS, which is the ruling party in the state of Kelantan are thinking of relaxing polygamy rules in the state because get this , "to solve the problem of single mothers " and that this women need "companionship and love" !! LOL Oh god have you heard anything more sexist in your life ? And of course this has absolutely NOTHING to do with the fact that 2 state ministers were caught practicing polygamy illegally in the state recently. And then they try to justify it by saying they will whip any person who like abuses the law for the purposes of lust! Like HELLO what other reason do you think they will do it for ? Cos they really wanna help with the problem of single mothers in the state? YA right and im not handsome !    Listening to Beck's Odelay right now, I think its like probably like the hippest record i got in my collection, makes me shake my body uncontrollably whenever i listen to it and now i got it turned it up all the way to 12 on my hi-fi which believe me is damm fucking loud. Ahh the things you can do when you parents aren't around ....  Two of my friends just got into NCS (national computer systems) and im really happy for them..NOT! Fuck I'm better than them when it comes to programming skill, they know it and I know it and it pisses me off that they got in while i didnt even get a call to come down for a bloody interview!  Yeah i know how un-PC it sounds ok but thats what im feeling rite now so screw PCness !  Ok got to head down to somerset now to get that stupid remote control now !

      Ok just came back from the library at tampines. Went there to relax but instead (like everything else in my life right now) the exact opposite happen . So i was at the library looking for this book by Neil Gaiman which  urlLink Di  recommended called Coraline but when I got there i couldnt find the piece of paper which i wrote the name of the author so i had to sms her and get it from her ...ok so small glitch , then when i finally found the section where his books were, i couldnt find it! crap when i checked at home at the library website there were 3 available copies ! Anyway i looked around for like 20 minutes or so and finally gave up and just borrowed another book by him called smoke and mirrors and looked for another book to borrow. And then this pair of secondary students sitting on the floor in between the bookshelves basically blocking the already narrow aisle and that really pissed me off, i was thinking "why dun you move fucking further apart so that u block more of the aisle and no one can walk in at all?" Anyway  i just stood there and stared at them and i guess they got the hint cos they stood up and got out of there.  Oh yeah and then there was this group of secondary school gals who were like giggling the whole time in the library which even pissed me off more. Fuck, what is it with secondary school gals and giggling , why is everything so damm funny to them, i mean do you see secondary school guys grouping together and giggling like a bunch of idiots, i dun think so!   And then comes this announcement over the library PA that the library is closing at 5 pm and im like totally confused, what the hell i just got here 1/2 an hr ago!! Can't they just standardise the closing times for all the different library branches instead of confusing us like that by having different closing times for different branches !!  Anyway i borrowed a flash/dreamweaver and a C++ book and got out of there and headed back home.  And then on the MRT i had the damm good luck of sitting beside a boy who, in my humble opinion, should have been born a monkey cos he couldnt stop swinging on those handrails on the train and making really dumb ass irritating noises that were really driving me crazy. And his bloody parents encouraged him even more !!! I was honestly praying to God that the little monkey would fall and hit his head and start crying cos if that had happened i would have laughed my ass off i tell ya!   But as usual i didnt get what i want.

      Jiaqi asked me to go to a Halloween party on thursday..now the only problem is finding a party to go to, i mean there has to be some club in town that is holding one of those right.... yeah i know i hate clubbing but i think just need one night to like totally go crazy and wild , besides if im wearing a costume dun need to worry abt making a fool of myself cos no one would regconize me ...who knows i might even get some ..ya ok maybe i should like get back to reality now.   Just download Coldplay's new album and listening to it, its pretty good so far gotta give it a few more spins, but it just reminds me of Radiohead's Bends a little too much , you know the acoustic guitar, the falsetto lead voice basically everything!

      Saw the Crossroads ep. of 6 Feet Under and got like a huge shock of my life. I was still getting used to seeing the lead actor kissing another guy in the past episodes and suddenly i get hit with male FULL FRONTAL NUDITY. And we are not talking abt like 1sec it was like 20 secs or something cos he was talking to Nate in that naked state. Sheesh you hardly see full frontal in movies nowdays so i hardly expected it in a tv series. And also it made me feel kinda inadequate : ( ...nah im kidding !  but its too bad the lead actor (whats his name again) broke up with Keith, he was quite a nice guy and pretty good looking also ....hmm i think i better stop now im kinda scaring myself !

      Oh i talked to my friend and he told me he only paid 300++ for his graduation studio pictures. I paid ard 1k. Can anyone say RIPPED OFF . Well they did provide really good service for me like buying packet drinks for me and holding open the door as i left the studio so that accounts for a little of the 700 dollars difference .... *Bert trying to justify the cost*   Got into an argument with my dad just now, he keeps telling me to go sign up for the driving lessons but the fucking problem is we dun have enough money! I already told him it will cost around 2k which i know he doesnt have but he keeps telling me to find out if i can pay like per lesson. Either way it costs ard 2k what so whats the fucking diff ! If you dun have the money you dun have the money ....Anyway im not gonna argue with him im gonna go down later and just get all the info from Ubi Driving Centre then just let him do what the hell he wants.

      I'm so in love with Six Feet Under, probably one of the best series I can remember watching in recent years. It just keeps getting better and better with each episode and keeps turning out surprises when you least expect it, will not go into details cos I don't wanna give anything away. I just finished watching the 6th episode and now dl the 7th. At this rate i'm probably gonna finish the whole series by the end of the week. For those who do not know the series is about a family who runs a mourtuary home,  and tthe head of the household the father passed away recently and about the remaining members trying to get on with their lives. Its like totally funny at times and yet can be really sad and poignant at others. The characters lead pretty dsyfunctional lives but i can really relate to them.

      Ben just told me he got a new girlfriend, and its obvious how happy he is right now. I'm really happy for him but have to admit I'm a bit envious. Not because I dun have a girlfriend, but because i haven't felt happy in a really long time. The last time i can remember feeling that way  was when I was with her. I really miss that feeling.  In the last week i broke down and cried twice, and the worst thing is I dun even know why i did. Am i losing my mind? Maybe its because of her, maybe its because im no closer to getting a job now then when i first started looking and i dun know why that is. I have no idea. But I've been feeling this sense of hopelessness that I just can't shake off. I just dun know whats my purpose in life anymore.

      Ok haven't really updated my blog in a while so i better get right to it!  SO what did I do today ...hmm ya almost got into a car accident thats what , thanks to Hafeez! I dun have a licence but this was the scenario: He was going to turn left into a carpark but there was a bus at the bus stop just b4 the carpark so he just went to the 2nd lane and turned into the carpark from the 2nd lane. At the same time he turned the bus started to move off and it almost hit us as we turned into the carpark , he did signal but i dun know he didnt slow down or anything , so who's fault was it ? Anyway it was kinda scary...  Anyway we went to Daud after that to have dinner, i ordered a mee goreng and teh tarik , he a really expensive plate of nasi lemak considering the pathetic chicken wing he got with it , it looked more like a chick than a chicken i tell ya ! After that we went to Bedok Interchange where we walked for a while and went back home , sigh i wish they do something to Bedok Central like add a ferris wheel or something its so damm boring!  (Slightly) Funny thing i was on my way to the bus stop but changed my mind and decided to walk home instead , it was like a good 20 minutes and when i got home i was sweating like a pig..I think when you are really bored you just try to do stuff to occupy your time. Anyway its good exercise right ?   Shynn from the job agency called me and told me i might get this temp job doing database admin at this american firm at a fucking pathetic 6 bucks an hr ...but i can't be choosy, need something IT-related that I can put on my resume. Gonna apply for this company called Crimson Logic tommorow , they got a vacancy for Java Developer which would be the perfect job for me cos i love programming in Java! Hope they grant me an interview...

      Went for an interview yesterday for this 1 1/2 month job and the interview didnt go too well, i know i probably not going to get the job. Anyway it kind of sucks cos just found out that a few friends of mine just got jobs already sigh ..happt for them but also feeling kinda sad that i'm still no where near to getting one myself. Wonder how long this is going to last ....  Played basketball with my friend in the afternoon today for like 20 minutes and after that we were sweating like pigs ! oops i mean perspiring ..now my muscles are aching like crazy . But it was good to get off my butt and do some real exercise after like so many months of inactivity and We are gonna play tommorow morning also ! But we were interuppted by a group of mats who took over the court to play soccer. I wanted to tell those assholes off , i mean its a basketball court not a soccer court ! anyway sam said we should just leave but it really pissed me off !  Getting kind of frustrated with my hi fi cos i think the lens is dirty or something it keeps skipping no matter what disc i play. Have to go down to Bedok and get the lens cleaner thingy asap before i go crazy !

I much prefer the term music connesisr..ah screw it dun know how to spell that word , you know the word they used to call the wine experts !

      Went to the photo studio with my sister today to choose my graduation pictures. Well she did most of the choosing , i mean for me all the picture frames look the same ! anyway after that we went to Mos burger to have dinner. I was talking to her about Sharon , well she brought it up cos i told her abt Sharon the first time we were going out, so she was wondering how things were between me and her . Anyway next thing i know i was telling her everything that happened , i guess it was just something i needed to just tell someone. And i'm glad i did cos she really made me feel better, and for the first time i feel like im ready to put all the stuff that happened behind me.

      Some days i wonder why i was born an Indian ...today was one such day. My parents and my two aunts are sitting in the hall watch this tamil variety show. So i sit down and watch with them out of courtesy lah. I''m watching the show and i'm trying to figure out whats so interesting about it. In the show its basically local Indian stars dancing and lip-synching to songs from the tamil movies , or else they themselves would be singing the songs, like karaoke. And I'm thinking to myself why would anyone wanna see something like that ? Really dun understand ...sigh

      Ok sigh boring weekend so far , just spend most of my time playing Neverwinter Nights, damm dun u just hate it when they make a game so good you cant help wasting your life on it ...but learn quite a lot of things applicable in real life from this game for e.g. do not accept sexual favors from women in return for sparing their lives ! ok maybe not that applicable in real life but you never know... Was going to go to the library today to borrow a good fantasy book so i was online looking for some recommendations but all of them were on loan or not at Bedok Library ..damm Bedok Library really sucks i tell ya.... Hopefully i get to watch 2001 Space Odyssey later , if i dun get asked to do any housework by my parents ...supposed to be a classic or something ...just hope there's going to some scary aliens and bloody space battles in it ..nah just kidding Di ! ;)  Oh yeah also got Billy Elliot on StarMovies at 9 pm , sounds like an interesting story , a boy who rather do ballet than boxing but only thing abt brit movies is sometimes i got a really hard time understanding their accent though .

      Went to Serangoon Broadway Photo Studio today, kinda pissed with them cos they told me that they would give those pictures that i didn't choose to develop, to their lab and ultimately it would be destroyed. So i asked them if they could give me the negatives and they said no. Talk abt doing anything to make a profit , well seriously have to thank my dad for this ...He was the one who was like rushing me to find a photo studio the night before so i just choose a random one and now seems like it turns out to be a wrong one. At least if i had more time i could ask my friends who already graduated for recommendations ..Oh well no point regretting now ...I just wish he stops doing that, dun know why he has this need to do everything in the fastest possible time even when its not necessary , its really irritating sometimes. Oh yeah on the way there on the bus i was listening to Tool's Aenima and got so caught up in it i began singing along (oops!) and the auntie beside me started looking me in fear like i was some psycho or something. Oh well not the first time a woman thot i was a psycho anyway.  "He had a lot to say. He had a lot of nothing to say. We'll miss him. So long. We wish you well. You told us how you weren't afraid to die. Well then, so long. Don't cry. Or feel too down. Not all martyrs see divinity. But at least you tried." - Eulogy by Tool

      Dreamed I was a fireman. I just smoked and watched you burn.  Dreamed I was an astronaut.  I shot you down like a juggernaut. Dreamed we were still going out.  Had that one a few times now.  Woke up to find we were not. It's good to be awake.  Dreamed I was a tidal wave I ravaged your coast, there were no survivors.  Dreamed I was your landlord.  I showed you place when you had lovers.  If I was a vampire,  I wouldn't suck your blood.  Then I dreamed I was you.  Sweetest dream I have had.  If you could hear the dreams I've had, my dear,  They would give you nightmares for a week.  But you're not here and I can never sleep.  Come home so I can be a creep.

      Haha even in games i cant get laid! Been playing this game, Neverwinter Nights, and today this female convict i was hunting offered to sleep with me if i spare her life , so i RELUCTANTLY accepted. (hey i was playing an evil character ok i had no choice !) as soon as i got my kit off the bitch stabbed me ! Yes I know how pathetic it sounds so pls dun comment abt that thank you!   Met a really annoying catholic yesterday, you know the type who thinks they have to tell how great their religion is to anyone who isnt a Catholic. I tried to steer the conversation to something non-religious but it was really futile. I talked abt Lord Of the Rings and she's like "Tolkien is a Catholic and he was really happy when his son became a priest"  ..and im thinking should i say something like 'Praise the Lord' ...Then she was like preaching abt true happiness and like theres many kinds of happiness and by that time it was like 3 am so i just said gdnite and went to sleep ...

      So went to see the movie 'The Phone' with a net friend today; i found it so boring but she was scared stiff , I actually had more fun watching her hiding behind her jacket ! Abt the movie well it steals from the Ring and What Lies Beneath and there are like 2 scenes that scared me thats about it. And also the director keeps showing flashbacks to the past in the movie , but there is no indication they are flashbacks and i got confused sometimes whether i was watching a scene from the present or the past. Highly NOT recommended!

      Alamak just found out that I can change the words for my haloscan comments...I was trying to figure out for weeks how to do that cos i seen other people do it. Well like my mom used to say: "You learn new things everyday". Of course she said it in Tamil, her english isn't that good. But I dun know how to write in Tamil so i can't write that here. But even if I wrote it in Tamil I still have to translate it to English so that my fans can understand so it will be pointless. Sigh why can't everyone in the world just speak one language!

      Another day, another disappointment. Faith told me that her colleague isn't too impressed with my grades; said he expected better. So basically that's the end of that. Honestly i have to say I'm really disappointed that I didn't get an interview; i know that I'm a really good Java Programmer; all I need now is some employer to give me a chance to show it. Just gotta keep looking until I find that person.   I am jet black.  I am stone cold.  Jet black to the center.  Funny like a funeral.  I need you to bury me.   Jet Black by Jawbreaker

      Uggh the Bachelor is so disgusting. The guy goes to a different gal every night and makes out with them and at the end of the date he asks them whether they wanna spend the night together. And yet i still can't not watch it. I think Shannon is gonna get voted out cos she's the only one who is upset about the fact how sleazy it the whole scenarion was and not letting him get his way with her. Well no one forced her to join the show right.....  Ah-ha I was right, Shannon was the one asked to leave; So that leaves the other 2 gals, the one who admitted her boobs were fake and the other one whose boobs are probably fake. And Shannon can still ask the guy why she was voted off. Of course he said because it was they were 2 very different people yada yada. Hello it's because he didnt get past first base with her unlike the other 2. But wonder she even joined the show; must be a little thick in a head if you ask me.

      I hate to be in a conflict with someone. Most of the time when something like that happens I try to resolve it as soon as possible and just move on. I guess its because i believe that life is short and you never know what might happen tommorow also; for all I know I might get hit by a car or something and die. And as weird and morbid as it sounds, I wanna die without any unresolved conflicts in my life. But of cos its easier said than done; sometimes you just can't forgive someone for something they did to us no matter how hard we try , and even more so if they aren't remorseful about it and think they didn't do anything wrong.    What's the meanest you can be to the one you claim to love  And still smile to your new found friends?  In the same confusing breath,  You pull away and draw me in.  I wanted you. You wanted more.

      Visited a gal's blog. Her mom was caught in a serious motorbike accident and now she might not be able to walk. Kinda makes you realise how unpredictable life is; all it takes is one unforseen tragedy to turn your whole world upside down. And it also made me put my problems in perspective. I'm forever whining abt my lack of job opportunities and how boring my life is but maybe i should be grateful for the good things in my life, that i am healthy and that my family is healthy also. I think it's just human nature to focus on the negative aspects of our lives rather than the positive aspects. Well at least its mine.

      Hmm read this at  urlLink Soccernet  just now ... "But eventually all Everton's hard work produced the goal they deserved when they finally took the lead on 35 minutes as Li Tie surged from his own half, won the ball and chipped it on for Radzinski, who laid it back to the charging  Chinaman ." Ok I'm no expert in the English language but  Chinaman  sounds a little racist to me, shouldn't the correct term be  Chinese  ?

      The stallion is not happy today. Still feeling the effects of the pizza yesterday and my stomach/ass has been hurting like hell since I got up. But still went to Hafeez's house to scan my transcripts and stuff to send to Faith's colleague  but when i got back one of the floppies i saved into couldnt work. Isn't it amazing how technology has ignored the floppy. CD-ROM, CPUs and almost everything else is faster and better but not the floppy. i mean I'm sure there is a way to increase the durability/speed/size of the floppy right its been the same since i first started using the PC which was like in December 98.  Anyway i left a message on Hafeez's mobile to email me the pics on the spoiled copy, hope he sends it to me as soon as possible. Got a shock of my life when Audrey called me on my handphone yesterday, I thought something bad happened cos we never talked on the phone before. Well thankfully i was wrong ...lol i think shes like the chirppiest person i ever met, she's like so hyper and sounds so cheerful ! She was telling me how excited she was about me coming to join her at work and how great it's gonna be with me there! Sigh talk abt pressure; i dun know .....hope I don't disappoint her too much.    I wish I could sleep. But I can't lay on my back. Because there's a knife For everyday i knew you   The Speed of Pain  by Marilyn Manson

Hope i get it because from what Faith told me it seems like a great working enviroment very casual and friendly! Well just have to see how it goes.....but dun wanna get my hopes up too much cos did that way too much the past few months and i just got really disappointed when those opportunities did't materialise.   I ordered Canadian Pizza , ate too much and now my stomach feels so bloated and feel like puking ...dammit !!

      Sigh another boring day ...finally submitted the application for Sun Microsystems , the due date is 2 days away. Snail mail is so leceh (tedious for non singaporeans) , i mean we live in the IT age now why waste time and money with stamps and envelopes! I even had to fill in the application form by hand cos it was stated explicitedly..ya like my handwriting is a clue to what kind of employee i would be .. Dumbasses !  Oh ya and i had to provide details abt my parents's occupations and my sister's also, again why the fuck does that matter !   I guessed my dad changed his mind about putting up the xmas decorations today cos he didnt wake me up.. Thank god ! Now all i got to do is pray for the hotel job to start soon so i dun need to help him ..ya ya you might think its really selfish of me but you haven't worked with my dad b4 . do that and you will know what i mean.    Other than that spend a good part of the day talking to Faith and doing the daily boring household chores ....i wonder if they have those mousewheels for people, u know the one where the hamster or mouse runs in;; then i could get into one of them and just run all day long; at least that would occupy my time and keep me from dying of boredom.   I wish TCS would just cancel all its local productions cos come on they really suck. Living with Lydia stars ...err ...this rather large Hongkong actress with a horrible haircut who has the most annoying way of speaking English in my opinion; she stresses every words i mean whats up with that. Phua Chu Kang used to be funny but now its just really tired and they seem to be rehashing the same old jokes again...And lets not forget First Touch the local medical drama that takes place in a maternity hospital which strangely looks nothing like a maternity hospital maybe cos its just a cheap tacky set . Bring back ER u losers !!   Favourite angsty lyrics of the day :   Fuck it all! Fuck this world!  Fuck everything that you stand for!  Don't belong! Don't exist!  Don't give a shit!

Oh ya yesterday at Suntec i saw the strangest sight; people standing having their dinner on tables that had no chairs having their dinner ! Well a friend told me it was pretty common nowdays but I dun know just seemed strange and a little cruel...but thats me.  I should be starting very soon at the hotel; my sis called me and told me to get prepared. Hope I dun screw it up !   Hmm Lana Lang doesn't look like her usual hot self in today's Smallville episode.....something's different maybe it's her make up or something. Gonna have to write to her about that ....btw I don't care if you are Superman, no one misses a Radiohead concert to save his best friend's life !!!   My dad just told me thatwe have to wake up early at 8 am tommorow to do the Christmas decorations for our house....guess he forgot that Christmas is still more than A MONTH AWAY. And every year its the same boring streamers and lights at the same places ....sigh ...Christmas at my house stopped being fun a long time ago; dun know why we even bother.

      Ok so i met Faith and she was really nice, even treated me to dinner , actually i wanted to treat her cos her bday was tommorow but she insisted.. :) heh but i was really tempted to roll my eyes when she described the music i listen to as 'heavy metal' but fortunately resisted the urge. Oh ya and she gave me the 'Dangerous Liasons' VCD in exchange for my three Janet Jackson CDs. Thats like the movie i been looking for since i was 5, but its censored so I won't get to see Uma Thurman's boobs ..sigh...After that we went to meet Xing and his friend Marcus, the one i thought wanted to hire me. But turned out to be a complete waste of time cos he wasn't the least bit interested in talking to me, spend more time talking to his gf ! I already knew that he wasn't interested when he talked to me over the phone few days earlier; basically after he found out that I didn't know VB/ASP he cut the conversation short. And I told Xing about it but he told me it's ok and to come for the meeting anyway. Now it just seemed like a waste of my time.  CDs I listened to today: 1. Dummy by Portishead 2. Homogenic by Bjork  ( LISTEN TO THIS AT NIGHT ITS AMAZING!!)  3. Brighten the Corners by Pavement 4. The Stone Roses (self-titled) 5. Toxicity by System of A Down 6.

      Ok gonna meet Fayth for the first time at Suntec later. Cos Xing wants to meet us both at once regarding the job offers he has for us; He's looking for a web designer for his company website so i recommended her to him. And his friend Marcus just started an IT company so he's looking for people to join him so i'm gonna meet him later. Kinda nervous cos my previous two off the net meetings were not really what i would call successes ...met Sharon which went horribly wrong and Indu who told me within 10 minutes of meeting me that my dressing was really  DULL   : (

      Damm the bloody server for Shi Yang's JSP server is so unstable works one sec and screws up the next. Gonna try and set up a server on my com so that he can show his boss the project but I totally forgot how to set up the Tomcat server ! Other than that did nothing much talked to Faith and Pei Ying , a new net friend I just met recently, she seems like a pretty nice gal. Speaking of net friends wondering what happened to Di, haven't seen her for like almost a week. It feels kinda strange when you see someone almost everyday and suddenly they don't come online for a while ...anyway she's probably busy with her packing and getting her student visa and stuff. Gonna go see Harry Potter this wednesday with Ivan and Wee (hopefully) heard generally great things about it. Just hope we can get tickets. Oh ya watched Star Wars and Scream 3 on Ch 5 yesterday; Star Wars was as great as i remembered it I can't believe the number of people who haven't seen this classic! Scream 3 was really awful and just so damm boring, which is really shocking considering how good the first one was.

      Woohoo just finished debugging this JSP Project i'm doing for Shi Yang; it's like this online engineering quiz. Anyway been working on it for a while now but after the operation i had a few months ago i kinda lost interest in it, also dun know why. Anyway last couple of days I have been working really long and hard to make it work and now it's almost done, just a few things left to sort out depending on what Shi Yang wants. But feel quite shiok when i finally got it to work, it's almost like an orgasm i tell you. I think I'm gonna call myself the JSP King from now on ...Screw you NCS for not hiring me; next time when im rich and famous i'm gonna make it my personal mission to bring you down !!  *laughs like Dr. Evil*  Note to myself : You seriously need help, geek !    urlLink Online Engineering Quiz

      Went to the market around 9 am with my mom today, cos i had to deposit money into Theresa's bank account which was right beside the market so i figured i might as well go with her. Made an interesting observation : All the women at the market were at least in their late 30s, did'nt see anyone younger than that ! Hmm wonder why....  OK been playing around with Photoshop  7 today, and its really fun ! Tried this cool effect on my Manson banner above , if you wanna see it all you got to do is move your mouse over it.: ) Pretty cool rite ! Have to thank my mentor Faith for inspiring me to learn this : ) Thanks love ! OK well maybe its not much but hey I just started give me a couple of weeks at least alright !   Kinda worried about going to work at the hotel cos i'm afraid it might jeopardise the relationship I have with Auds. I mean we get along fairly well now, afraid things might change if we started working together, like it will get all awkward and weird or something. She seems pretty excited abt working with me and i'm kinda afraid that well i might not live up to her expectations of what she thinks i am like in real life...Oh well just gotta wait and see i guess...But Theresa was saying that she's really popular at the hotel, and shes picking up things so fast that they dun believe she's never worked in a job like this before. Sheesh talk about pressure !

      Theresa called me and told me I would probably be able to start working with her at the end of the month. Finally i'm getting off my fat ass and earning some money. I-admin hasn't called me yet so I dun think I got the job, if i did they would have pretty much called me earlier i think. Hopefully i will get to see Harry Potter next week , two friends already said it was a pretty good movie.  Tried to watch the 2nd half of 2001 Space Odyssey but got way too sleepy , i dun think i will ever get the movie !  Arrgh totally forgot to watch Temptation Island, was so engrossed with Silence of the Lambs on Channel I that i forgot.

      Missed blogging yesterday ..actually not missed just nothing of note to write about ..went to Parkway Parade with Hafeez to buy his kettle jug thingy, walked ard a bit and came back home ....  Today not much better, just waiting to watch survivor which starts in a while. Gonna head down to library to borrow some ASP books , think im gonna need to learn it cos lots of jobs are asking for it. And maybe XML also ....So bored...hope i-admin calls me soon!   Been listening to a couple of my old CDs (Vitalogy and No Code by Pearl Jam, Color and the Shape by Foo Fighters) last few days, I really need to get one of big CD Racks to hold my CDs, now they are all over my room.   Dun know what is gonna happen between me and a net friend, think she's still pissed at me. I told her she was overreacting and that made her even more pissed. Sometimes it doesn't pay to be honest i tell ya. I mean i already apologized like a million times and she still doesn't wanna talk to me, what else does she want? Maybe its dumb of me to react the way i did , i mean I shouldn't have cared that she still considers a guy that 2-timed her to be sweet and caring and wanted to call him. Or that this same 'sweet and caring' guy was trying to get back together with her just a month back eventhough he IS still with his girlfriend. I guess I just have to learn not to say anything even if i think they are gonna get hurt. It's not like i know her personally!

      My cousin is going for a vacation in December and he asked my dad whether he could leave his dog here for 3 weeks. My dad said yes as usual. It didn't matter that my cousin has talked to us for like a year before today. Or that I'm probably the one who is gonna have to handle the dogs while he is off to work. Or that the 3 of them will make a hell lot of noise and give the neighbour upstairs another chance to call the cops on us. Some people just dun know how to say NO i guess. I am in a really irritable mood today, its like male PMS or something !

      OK so this was how the interview went. Basically he asked me a lot of technical questions that i really couldn't answer cos i couldn't remember! It's been a while. Should have revised beforehand damm ...but overall i did OK.  Anyway the job wasn't what i thought it was, as it wasn't a programming job like i expected. Instead i would be like the link between the client and the programmers; I would ask the clients to describe what they want in the system and then design the system and hand it over to the programmers to code.  Pros of the job :  1. I will be able to travel overseas quite often to meet clients. (a huge plus) 2. It's gonna force me to improve my people skills which admittedly are pretty crappy now. 3. The company really seems to be doing very well, so my future prospects look to be really good  Cons: 1. I wouldn't be learning any new programming skills. 2. I really wanna do programming cos i think i got a flair for it. 3. I have to deal with strangers a lot.   Sigh ....  Oh ya bloody Wei Qin played me out! We were supposed to go see 'The Guru' but he dumped me for a barbecue at his friend's place ...sniff ...

      Ok I'm back from my interview.  Next time i'm going for an interview im gonna bring a compass or something, its ridiculous how road maps can differ so much from the real thing ! Was wandering around for a good 20 minutes until i finally found the place. Ok now Abt the interview! Well when i got there i was really pumped cos I was listening to Slipknot on the way there; hey if that CD doesn't get your adrenalin pumping nothing will ! But the interview was really surprising, i wouldn't even call it an interview , more like an evaluation. The 7 of us (1 person didn't turn up) who got called were split into 2 teams and given this question to discuss : If you were stranded in the desert and given a list of items , how would you rank them in order of importance. The items included stuff like a litre of water , matches , mirror etc etc. Well i was pretty vocal the whole time and I also presented my team's findings. And that was the end of the interview! Overall i think i did a pretty good job. Gonna be really disappointed if I'm not called up for a 2nd interview.  Oh ya i was like totally overdressed ; i was the only one wearing a tie out of the 5 guys there . So paiseh ....Anyway the company is a pretty small office and the mood is very casual, i think it would be a pretty cool place to work. But well now jsut wait for his phone call lor... Kinda pissed at my sis, she keeps forgetting to call Audrey abt the Shangri-la job and i have to like keep reminding her ! I mean if you forgot once its ok lah , but 3 times a little excessive if you ask me.  Now waiting for Lana Lang/Smallville ...hmm is it at 10 or 11 ? Can't remember .....

      Bored people do strange things. I just spend like an hour cataloguing all the CDs i have and transferred them into a urlLink  webpage . So far i got 108 CDs not including my CDs pre-college (Ace of Base, Mariah Carey) , i thought i had much more.   Also watched the M. Night movie, Unbreakable, on StarMovies couple hours ago and i thought it was pretty engrossing take on the superhero genre but the ending was really abrupt, i think the movie should have played out the conclusion onscreen rather than using the on screen text at the end to wrap up the movie.    Think i might have overreacted a little on the not saying goodbye thingy (see earlier post) but it was the 2nd time it happened to me yesterday and got me really irritated. Seemed to be getting more and more irritable these days ..hmm

      OK finally finished writing the email describing my 'soft' skills ; the guy from i-admin asked me to send it to him. So what did I write ? Well a lot of crap that isn't really true, how i'm like ultra friendly, able to multi-task and work well with others, how i like to take initiative in everything I do. Of cos i already thought of fake examples to show them in case he asks me to give examples, which i'm sure he will.   Going to watch Mulholland Drive later, that David Lynch movie, a friend was describing to me how amazing and bizarre it was and i'm really curious about it right now.   I wished people would have the courtesy to at least say bye before they log off during an online conversation, I think it's kinda rude when you are in the middle of an interesting conversation with someone and then they just abruptly disappear. I thought maybe she got dc so i waited for like 5 minutes and then i thought maybe i pissed her off or something. I mean how long does it take to type "Gotta go. goodnight" ?   Now gotta go and prepare for my interview, must think of what I'm gonna say when he asks me to describe myself and all that !   Oh ya was really surprised to hear "Forsaken" from the Queen of the Dammed soundtrack on TV yesterday! It was the background music for the "Who wants to be a Millionaire trailer, pretty weird choice for a gameshow trailer. Anyway It's the best song off the album and I highly recommend the album to anyone who likes dark, gothic sounding haunting music; 5 songs (including Forsaken) are written by Jonathan Davis from Korn specifically for the movie and Linkin Park (I hate them) fans should check out "System" which features Chester on vocals which I have to admit isn't half bad.

      Got a call from this company called i-admin asking me to come down for an interview on monday, Bad news is the pay is a pathetic 1500 a month ! But i got no choice gotta go for it, beggars can't be choosers rite. So if i get it i will be earning 1k less than my friends in NCS...Life so fucking sucks doesn't it !   Other than that a really boring day, watched another ep of six feet under today and the first ep of sex and the city. ( i thought it was sex in the city ). And got this really bad headache that has been going on for 2 whole days, hope it disappears soon enuff; feels like someone drilling a screw into my brain.

      Woohoo yeah this is my new blog design , thanks to Faith. I saw the one she did for her sister and was pretty impressed so i asked her to help me out and this is the end result ! Sigh if only she wasn't married i would propose to her !   Ok so went for my first jog in months at East Coast with Ben but only jogged like a kilometre before it started to rain. *Bert secretly thanks god* . After that we went to Komala Villas for lunch where i had thosai rava, it was ok but nowhere near as good as the ones at Little India. After that we walked all the way back to his place in which he proceeded to show off his extensive collection of porn in his PC ;) Went back at around 7pm cos he was going to meet his girlfriend.   Arrgh I forgot to watch Charmed today , only managed to catch the last 15 minutes ....but thank god there's still Smallville! My darling Lana Lang ....*swoons*

      Ok missed blogging yesterday because i was at my sister's place the whole day for Deepavali. Woke up at 5:30 am yesterday cos my mom had to be at my sis's place early to cook her world-famous 'ayam masak merah' which also happens to be my favourite dish. As usual my dad was trying to rush us all along like we were in a damm race or something.  Anyway while i was there something really embarassing happened. The hall was pretty crowded with a lot of her guests so i sat on this old wooden chair. All of a sudden it just broke and i ended up flat on my ass! At least most of the guests tried their best not to laugh though which was really nice of them ....   Dad pissed me off again. Ben called me at 9 am today and i was still asleep. My dad answered the phone and instead of telling him to call back later, he felt the need to wake me up! What's his freaking problem ?   Been thinking of trying to patch up with Sharon. I think we had a really meaningful (net) friendship b4 all that stuff happened and i would hate to see that just disappear without at least trying to save it. But even she doesn't want to, i hope we can at least part amicably cos i think its pointless to hold grudges considering how short life is. And there are also a few things that i really need to tell her also that i didnt before because i didnt wanna complicate matters, but now i just wanna be honest with her. The only thing i'm afraid of is that she would think that i'm doing this cos i wanna go out with her or something which is the last thing on my mind. Anyway she's probably having her exams now so i'm gonna wait until the end of the month cos i really don't wanna risk upsetting her now during this crucial exam period.  Oh yeah saw the funniest website today check the  urlLink Asian Prince  out !

      You know what I really need to stop taking net relationships so seriously. Why the hell should i care if a gal describes a guy who conveniently forgot to to mention to her that he had a gf while he was dating her,and basically treated her like crap , "sweet, caring and really comfortable with himself" ? It's not as if i know her personally or something !     Just got a phone call from my dad : "Gilbert come up to the 11th floor , LISTEN CAREFULLY , the 11th floor and help me carry some stuff"   Isn't it nice when your dad thinks you are such a fucking moron that he needs to repeat what he's saying and even remind you to listen carefully?   And let's not forget his need to tell me EVERYTIME i take the dogs for a walk where i should walk them !  Can anyone say CONTROL FREAK!   I left a used tissue on the couch by mistake, i was watching tv and i forgot to throw it away b4 i went into my room. My mom then told me about it and i threw it away. But apparently that wasn't enough , she had to complain to my sister about that tissue. And my sister still felt the need to talk to me abt it ! Forget about Six Feet Under, if you wanna see a dysfunctional family just come to my house.  Yeh Li just showed me this website done by this 17 year old guy , and its so good that its fucking depressing! If you wanna see it Click  urlLink Here . But he digs the same bands as me (Mushroomhead, Korn) so more power to him i say !   I added a little more information about myself and also a link to another blog , Audrey's friend Cheng whom i don't really know personally but her blog is pretty well done (although sometimes I got problem understanding it sometimes but i think thats my problem)  and she has commented on my blog a couple of times which is really nice of her.

      Ok just came back from Somerset, went to see Red Dragon with Yeh Li and Jiaqi, it was pretty good movie, very entertaining, way better than the crap that was Hannibal but not as engrossing as Silence of the Lambs. Would have loved to see more of Anthony Hopkins though i think he was rather underused.Oh ya Jiaqi and Yeh Li forgot to pay me for the movie tickets and i also paiseh to ask them for it....Cos i didnt wanna seem too money minded mah ...  Oh ya why are women late for dates/outings so often, its so irritating, Jiaqi and Yeh Li were more than half and hour late ! They should have at least given me an expected time of arrival so at least i would have an idea what time they will reach.   After that we went to Youth Park to see a couple of local bands perform in this band competition. A couple of bands were pretty good, and i really enjoyed their performances but the rest of them were average. And i did come away with a poster of the Foo Fighters they were giving those away. Left around 7pm cos Yeh Li and Jiaqi wanted to go back and i didn' wanna really stay there by myself kinda sian also.

      Ok i changed the comment server to Haloscan so all four of you can start commenting again, yeah i know you guys been dying to do it for the past few days. I asked a friend to give me her comment account at YACCS but she refused. Sigh there used to be a time when girls would do anything for the Indian Stallion ....   I'm blasting Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar right now cos I'm alone at home woohoo! Listening to the song Beautiful People right now. "The beautiful people, the beautiful people, it's all relative to the size of your steeple"  That lyric always cheers me up ...hey wait a minute, by right it shouldn't!  : (  Something i can never figure out is how my dogs sleeping in my room aren't disturbed by the music. Dogs are supposed to have a much keener sense of hearing compared to humans right ? So how come the loud music from the Hi-fi doesnt affect them at all? i mean hell my parents complain abt my music everytime! Maybe it shows that dogs can appreciate good music !   I'm heading down to town later to catch the movie Red Dragon with Jiaqi and Yeh Li cos bloody Ivan cancelled at the last minute. HE says he hasn't slept in the last 5 days and some other crap like that. Like I care !

      Dun you just hate it when a joke backfires in your face?     I send out this joke sms last night that said that i was in the hospital , but if you scroll down the message you will realise its just a prank. But most of the people i send to didnt scroll so they really thought i was in hospital and sms me back which i thought was pretty funny. (Hey i'm bored and unemployed ok, everything seems funny to me ). Then an hour ago while i was sleeping in bed (and i think i was dreaming abt me and Uma Thurman doing something fun) , and my friend who just came back from Paris called me up because she thought the sms was real. Well now i can't go back to sleep : ( . Yeah she's an air stewardess with SIA so she flies to all these exotic locations every week. Sigh makes me wish i was an air stewardess also...  I hate it when i see people unhappy, for some reason it really bothers me. And its even worse when i can't do anything to cheer the person up and most of the time i can't, guess i just dun have the knack for it.   The damm enetation server has been down for like 3 days now, and i think im gonna look for another one to host my comments. But can't blame the enetation creater also , he is only 1 guy running the whole thing and the problem is there are too many members then his server is able to handle. I checked out the forum and there are a lot of complaints about the server crashing so often and it sounds like he is gonna quit pretty soon.

      Hmm i think i should take a notebook with me when i go out, there was so many things that i thought of when i was out and was gonna write them down here, but now i can only remember 1.   Well here goes : At the train station there were this students who were taking donations for a particular charity, and a lot of people just rushed past ignoring them. And I seen this happen like my whole life, but only today it really bothered me. Are people now so busy that they can't even stop for a couple of secs and donate some coins to charity ? And yes i know it sounds a little self-righteous but thats what i feel   Met wee at Sim Lim Square where i bought 50 CD-Rs for 30 bucks to burn all my eps of Six Feet Under its really taking a chunk out of my HD space. And then i as i walked around i saw another shop selling 50 CDRs for 20 bucks dammit. After that went to BK where i had a whopper meal and was given an  EXTRA  packet of fries by mistake. Yes finally i catch a lucky break in my life ! The world seems so much brighter now !

Yeah thanks woman for picking New Year's Eve to tell me this , now im feeling really moody about it ...anyway doesnt matter cos its not like im going to go out and celebrate new year also, probably gonna countdown at home with my 2 dogs , probably try to get them to bark once the clock hits midnight or something.

      Met Faith today to exchange Xmas presents; she bought for me Time to Kill by John Grisham and i got for her a gift pack from Body Shop (thanks to Di for the idea) . Heh now i got so many books to read , still got 3 harry potter novels left and so far i only read like the first 2 chapters of the Philosopher's Stone. Oh ya i was waiting for Faith at City Hall MRT and saw this pretty volouptous ang moh gal wearing a teensy singlet and no bra and basically her boobs were on full display...sigh those ang mohs are a really daringbunch aren't they ? If only more local gals dressed like that ; the world would be a much happier place! Ya ya i'm a perv i know so sue me !   We went for lunch at Ganges, an indian vegetarian restaurant upon my request cos i decided I'm gonna try to eat healthy at least when i'm outside. But when i got back home i had like 3 slices of rich chocolate log cake that was in the fridge..ok ok 4 slices happy ! What to do , chocolate is my kyptonite when i see it i can't help but feel this urge to have it ! :( I think i would do ANYTHING, and i mean ANYTHING to get chocolate so any gals reading this you might wanna take note in case you wanna take advantage of the Stallion ...yeah dun tell me the thought has never crossed your mind ok ! ;)   Went to watch Blue Crush after that ; some of the lines in the movie were plain corny and really made me cringe but overall the movie was ok , mindless and generic plot but still pretty fun; cos the surf scenes were amazing and the lead actress was quite a hottie also.

      Alright yesterday my mom's ayam masak merah also went bad! I think its because someone used the same ladle on that dish and the catered food on Xmas day so the bacteria got transferred. It kinda sucked cos there was like a lot of it left but no choice had to throw it away. I told my dad to give his bloody friend (the one we catered the food from) a piece of his mind but he's like "let it be" ....pfff he should be the Fifth Beatle or something!   Other than that it was a great day cos i met up with my long lost cousin Shirley who i havent seen like in 8 over years ; she came with her folks to my house yesterday. We used to be really close when we were kids cos back then my family stayed at her home for a couple of years, so it was really nice to catch ya with her and see how's shes doing and stuff. Even got her on my msn messenger so hopefully we can keep in touch ....   We all then went to my aunt's place later at night and i met up with Cecelia and Damian my other cousins as well ..So all in all it was a pretty good day, compared to my usual day where i just rot at home! Hopefully this happens more often!

      OK well so what happened on Xmas day ...well for starters a lot of people told my sister that i put on a hell lot of weight which was reallly depressing but it was true. OK so my New Year resolution is to get rid of my baby or at least reduce it by a sizable amount. For those who are clueless my baby is my tummy :) . Im gonna head down to the bball court everyday and like shoot hoops or something for a start ! Anyway I have to also cos my reservist training is in April and i dun wanna go into it unfit cos it would be that much harder then. Oh and i gotta see my cousins Slyvester (although i call him Silver since we were kids) and Damien so that was pretty cool although they didn't stay that long. My mom was pretty unhappy with the way Silver looked cos he was like having an eyebrow ring and stuff, and she was like 'im glad you didnt turn out like that" ...She can be so shallow sometimes.  Hmm just wondering is it considered perverted to think that your 17 year old distant cousin is a total babe cos she is ! She has one of those eyes that those Hindi actresses have , the kind of eyes that sparkle ...all the chicks i dig are either attached or too young or related to me or think I'm creepy ....sigh ....  Oh ya the catered food that my dad ordered from his working colleague went bad by evening; think cos they probably cooked it like the day b4  in the morning. Well hope he learns his lesson and not be so easily influenced by people next time; but i doubt it cos this kinda thing happened like countless times b4 , he can be so naive .

      At my sister's house today; met her at Causeway Point to buy out clothes for Xmas. It kinda sucked cos there were a few clothes that i really liked but they didn't have my size. It's like prejudice against big-boned people or something. But the thing abt those full length mirrors in the changing rooms is they made me realised how much weight i put on! Really need to do something abt it ASAP or pretty soon i have to call myself the Indian Hippo or something. Anyway managed to find 2 decent tees in my size which i bought.  By that time it was around 10 pm so i decided to stay over at her place ; and so now here I am. But i can feel a cold coming over me , feeling kinda hot and also my running nose is getting worse; hope that clears up by Xmas day. Hmm kinda strange last 2 days not a lot of people online at night ...so boring no one to talk to and I'm not sleepy yet. Oh well i guess I'm gonna play TNET then.

       urlLink  Hmm just realised this year has been kinda disappointing in terms of music i listened to. I haven't heard any album this year that completely blew me away and that is something very unusual for me . For last year that album was  urlLink Relationship of Command  by At the Drive-In; For 2000 it was  urlLink Slipknot' s self titled.  Listened to a couple of great albums this year , the best of which was Korn's  urlLink Untouchables  and Queens of the Stone Age's  urlLink Songs for the Deaf  but they still have their flaws. But I haven't bought a lot of albums this year compared to last year mainly cos of the lack of funds .  Can't wait till i get a job, i think i will probably be buying like 2 - 3 CDs a month at least once I do .Until then MP3s have to do. But the biggest disappointment this year has to be Creed's  urlLink Weathered  , when i heard it i couldn't imagine how a band i used to love can put out crap like that . I think i gave it like 10 listens before i gave up; probably the worst album i heard in a while. Btw i'm willing to let it go for 10 bucks so if anyone is interested contact me ok.(it comes with a free VCD of some of their music videos)   Just saw the last hour of Survivor , i totally forgot that this was the season finale so i missed the first hour when Helen got voted off. But the grilling by the jury on Clay and the other guy was really brutal. Well of cos it's all ego. I mean almost everyone did lie to someone one time or another ,but when they get lied to and it resulted in them getting voted off they get all defensive and self-righteous and using words like honestly, decency and self-respect ...Hypocrites everyone of them! Hope Clay loses i really dun like that lazy ass.

      Ok i dun like to use this word but dammit Flo is a bitch  ! I have no idea how Zach puts up with her cos when i watch her on TV i already get so pissed ! She's like a little kid throwing stupid dumbass tantrums all the time and blaming Zach for any screw up that happens. Just now she wanted to give up on the race because she didnt think she could take a 24 hr ride on the train ! I mean jesus you are in a race for a million dollars , suck it up and stop whining! Well thats what I would have told her if I was Zach , but he was like so patient and accomodating; i really have to tip my hat off to him.He should get like an award or something just for putting up with her. I am such an idiot ..i didn't know that today was the finale so after the first hour of the amazing race i switched off the tv ....then i switch it on at 5 just in time to see the winners being congratualted !! now gotta watch it in the evening again but i already know who is gonna win ...idiot !

      Ok just came back from my interview at this company thats working for Mindef. Didn't go too well the test that they gave me was pretty hard It was about networking and machine language code and stuff that i havent touched like forever. But at least i did better than the guy next to me ; he even had trouble just filling in his personal particulars form :)  And also the other candidates were like so unfriendly ; i was chatting with one of them but he had to go soon after but the others were like so reluctant to talk to me...but well the indian stallion does intimidate most men so can't really blame them also. After i finished the test , or at least finished as much as i could i had to wait like over an hour before they called me for interview which was kinda unprofessional in my opinion; i mean i was on time so why can't they also !   Got interviewed by 3 pple including one chio bu who i was like kinda making eyes at throughout the interview ...i could swear she was looking at me lustily also ....or hmm maybe she looked annoyed i couldn't really tell also. Probably shouldn't have done that but hey i'm a guy ! Anyway they looked at my test results and didnt seem too impressed so i think that was that. After that the chio bu lead me out of the office and said she will call me in a week or so. Damm should have asked for her phone number or something ! : ( Anyway i think i need to get new pants; its so weird its like all my pants shrank at the same time incredibly bizarre i tell ya !

Like i got nothing better to do ! I mean you give people stuff for free thats one thing ; but if they can't be bothered to come down and get it why the fuck should you bring it to them ...and i got fucked when i told him that ...  Well he brought it there himself...and also brought along our bike and carrom board to my aunt .....wonder whats next   Went to the provision shop just now and the shopkeeper tells me that his daughter is working at Hongkong Bank might have vacancies at the bank and he will ask her if can get me in ...isn't that like the nicest thing !?

      Went to OCBC today to deposit some money for my sis ...the damm queue was like so long i think i was in it for like almost 40 minutes ..sigh the things you do for your sis ... Was kinda pissed at my dad today; he sometimes seems so naive ...he ordered catered food for christmas from a 'friend' it costed him ard 300 bucks ..but the stupid thing is that they dun deliver the food which is so freaking ridiculous and the guy lives in woodlands which is like so damm far....and catered indian food usually sucks 9/10 times , speaking from experience , and also i was so looking forward to my mom's ayam masak merah ..i hope the food isn't gonna suck but im not holding my breath. Now Dad says he's gonna try get back the money and cancel the order ..well good luck with that.

      Got called up for an interview for a company at Science Park which is just beside NUS .....but there is gonna be an hour long test to see how my programming skills are ..hope I dun screw this up like i did for the other one..... Spend the whole day listening repeatedly to Led Zeppelin's  urlLink BBC Sessions  , a 2 CD set of their performances for BBC in the late 60s; its simply amazing . Anyone who loves the sound of the electric guitar should get this ....the amazing solos by Jimmy Page are like orgasm-inducing; in my opinion he's the best guitarist ever , yes i think even better than Hendrix. Add to that Bonham's booming drumming and Plant's amazing voice and ...well you just gotta listen to it for yourself.  At least check out the song "Since I've been Loving You" ...its amazing that a band that was playing before i was even born can still so fresh and relevant today , not in the slightest bit outdated.   One more thing . i wished people would stop saying stuff to me like "Don't give up looking for a job" or " Are you jobless because the market is bad or you aren't trying hard enuff" or "you better get a job before the next batch graduates". I swear im gonna fuck the next person who says that to me. They might mean well but it really gets on my nerves so pls don't. I am not going to give up cos that is not a viable option so people  do NOT need to remind me. And the other 2 are so dumb I won't even justify them.

      Got an email from this company which i applied for; basically I have to give them a short essay on Grid Computing and what i know about it. Well i know nothing about it so probably gonna spend tommorow to go read up on it ...i think it has something to do with grids and computers though ;) . Other than that i would describe today as a complete waste of life.

      Ok Yesterday started off really crappy. I got asked to go for an interview , a temp job at this company at tanglin shopping center ...the pay was pretty good 7.50 an hour and renewed monthly. Anyway they were impressed by my resume but they gave me a test ...which was to modify a html page into a form page and using javascript to validate it ...its actually very simple i did it b4 for my school project but i screwed up , there was this damm javacript error and i couldnt fint the source of it ...so that went my chances of getting the job.   After that went to Borders and listened to some new CDs at the music section which made me feel a whole lot better. I have to get the White Stripes new CD,  urlLink White Blood Cells  . Some of you might remember the brother and sister band from their performance at the MTV Video Awards earlier this year , they were surrounded by fans dressed in red and white during their gig. Check out the song "Fell in Love With a Girl" if you wanna try its amazing!  Listened to Audioslave's new one also too , the band formed by the ex-members of  urlLink Rage Against the Machine (imo the only rap metal band with any cred that puts crap bands like Limp Biskit and Linkin Park to shame) and the frontman of  urlLink Soundgarden  who replaces Zack de la Rocha. Well have to say was kinda disappointed , Chris Cornell's vocals lack the intensity and the rage of Zack's vocals and also his lyrics arent really that great also compared to Zack's political rants.   An interesting logic puzzle :  Alright, there are 3 pple who got caught on a pirate ship. They were supposed to be killed but the captain gave them a chance. He has 4 caps, 2 white and 2 blacks. He made all 3 lined up and threw one cap in the sea. With the remaining caps, he put one on each person's head. The first person can only see the cap in the sea. The second person can only see the first person's cap. The 3rd person can see both pple's caps. The captain then said "If you can guess the colour of your own cap correctly, all will be set free." There was a silence then the 2nd person answered correctly. Why is it the second person and how did he answer it correctly?

      Finally me and Dad got to putting up the xmas decorations and it was worse than i expected. I was seriously pissed off by the time we stopped work at around 5. Dun feel like going into the details ...anyway i always get pissed when working with my dad so nothing new . And still not done got another day to go ..Well 1 thing was my dad played this horrible music on the stereo while we were working ...first CD was like the music you hear during Chinese New Year at those shopping centres; you know those happy bouncy crappy tunes with the traditional chinese instruments....CD2 was songs like Quit Playing Games by Backstreet Boys and other crappy love ballads; but the catch is they were sung by Filipino singers not the original artists which made it sound even worse ! I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at one point.Dun understand why anyone would wanna listen to that do you ?

      Had a really strange dream last night and the amazing thing is that it was so vivid i can remember almost ever part of it; and thats very rare for me cos i rarely remember my dreams. Even weirder was it was about a net friend i never even met before. It started off very nicely but then suddenly turned into a nightmare; the net friend in question jumped to her death and i was totally freaking out. Wonder what it means ....

      So finally brought  urlLink Boy  to the vet today and got the medicine for his skin problem. Think he's gonna be ok in a week or so.But he yelped really loudly when he got his injection, scared me for a second. Oh and something really funny happened just now , my dad brought a couple of his friends back home and Boy got so excited that he got a hard-on which was really obvious although his friends were like trying their best to pretend not to notice. And then Boy's semen was like dripping all over the floor and my dad was like trying to clean it up, it was pretty funny stuff : )   Hmm not sure why theres this syntax error on my blog site ...been trying to fix it but so far cant pinpoint the problem. Any HTML experts there who can help me out ?   In my CD Player today : 1.  urlLink Untouchables  by Korn 2.  urlLink Follow the Leader  by Korn 3.  urlLink End Hits  by Fugazi

      Sigh i'm less and less inclined to blog nowdays ...just nothing interesting in my life right now worth typing about. Today i spend like 4 hours playing this  urlLink tetris  game. Finally reached the target of 60 pieces per minute after 3 days ; had a bet with a net friend she thought i couldnt do it but i proved her wrong !  OMG I just realised i really need to get a life....  I will not be working with my sis at her hotel after all, she told me there aren't any vacancies left anymore at the moment and asked me to try the banquet deparment ...but audrey told me that that being a banquet waiter is a much tougher job for the same pay , u serve much more people and the trays are much heavier....Well maybe i will just give it a try, see how .

      A net friend of mine finally met her net friend who came all the way from USA just to see her ! And they totally clicked and he's now gonna come down here to work so that he can be with her. I'm really happy for her, hope it works out for the both of them. I was worried for her before she met him cos was well cos online relationships can never substitute for the real thing in my opinion , u could totally click with someone over the net but that doesnt mean u will be as compatible in real life , i learned that the hard way.   Well my dad is starting Xmas early this year by playing Santa Claus, hes giving away my old pc to my aunt for free eventhough she already has 1...i wanted to keep the hard disk (cos its brand new) and install it in my dell PC but well he wouldn't hear of it.  Well thats my dad, always puts others before family.

      A dready day where it rained like the whole damm day and its still raining now so i was stuck home alone. Downloaded and watched 'Rock Star', a movie starring Mark Walberg and Jennifer Aniston. Marky Mark plays this guy who is so obsessed with his fav band Silver Dragon that he sets up a cover band that plays all their songs note for note. Then when the vocalist of Silver Dragon leaves the band he gets the chance to lead it but he soon finds out that being a rock star isn't all its cut out to be. A pretty decent movie but nowhere as good or as memorable as Almost Famous, another 'rock' movie.   Alright a friend of mine is selling cookies , 50 cookies for 18 Singapore dollars so anyone who wants to purchase them for CNY or something email Hanna at chemohans69@pacific.net.sg for further details. Also orders for Valentines day will be at 10 dollars for a bottle of cookies (ard 30 pieces )

      So i went to the ***** office yesterday to look at the job offer. I would be a paid 2k a month for a year (training allowance) with no CPF or benefits ; basically its like an industrial attachment for 1 year. After which if my performance is up to Sun's standard then I would be hired as a permanent employee of ****** otherwise I would have to look for other employment.   But in my opinion I think its a good opportunity because ****** is a relatively new field in IT technology and not a lot of people are like trained in it (as far as I know) so even if I do not get hired by Sun after that year I should be able to get employment somewhere else easily. But of cos I'm gonna work my pants off to impress them during this 1 year so that they will keep me.   The only thing that sucks is that my workplace is gonna be at Nanyang Technological University in Boon Lay which is like at the opposite end of Singapore from where I live so I am looking at around 3 hours of travelling time a day to and from the workplace. Maybe i might stay at my sister's place in Woodlands for the weekdays if she doesn't mind have to talk to her about it.  Oh ya i think i was quite lucky to get this job offer cos I believe i was not one of the 6 originally chosen for this position. When i went there yesterday i went for the briefing with another TAP (Training and Attachment Program) group for another company (ST Technologies) . i was the only one there for the job at ******. After the briefing i asked the briefer(?) why that was so and he told me he already gave the briefing to the other Sun job candidates a week ago. So i'm quite sure that the only reason i got called up was maybe because one of them refused the job offer or was unable to take it. Well its a lucky break for me so I feel that i gotta take it!   Here is an  urlLink article  at CNET about my job scope if you guys wanna take a look. ******* was the guy who interviewed me and Im pretty sure I'm one of the 6 engineers mentioned there who would be working with the 3 research scientists.

      Great news!! A lady from *** called me regarding the job at *** and asked me to come down to their office at Raffles Towers tommorow so that they can give me the offer letter with the contract details and stuff. I have been jobless for like 9 months liao and it was really getting to a point where it was really embarassing to mention to people so can imagine how glad i was when they called me. Well still not sure how the pay is gonna be like but hopefully its reasonable , but i'm just excited about working in such a big company like *** so let's see what happens tommorow !

      Been listening to this exciting new band called  urlLink Chevelle  and they are pretty amazing. They could be the next big thing after Linkin Park (ughh hurts me just to say Linkin Park) but with the big difference that this bunch of kids are actually talented musicians, especially the bass player he's awesome! Well the vocalist sounds too much like  urlLink Tool 's Maynard on some tracks (like 'Closure') but then again how many bands can be called original nowdays. They are already getting quite a buzz in the US of A so let's see how long before they get heard on SIngapore radio if ever. Tracks to check out are 'The Red', 'Comfortable Liar' and 'Send the Pain Below'.

      Well interesting last couple of days. Finally asked that  urlLink net friend  who like ignores me most of the time why she was doing that and she told me she wasn't really into online chatting (anymore). Oh well that's that.   Then had this conversation with another net friend. Me: Yo!  She : What ?  Me: Yo as in hi ?  She : What you want ?   I do not understand women. One day can be nice to ya next day can be .........or maybe it's just me i got no idea.  My mom just called me couple minutes ago. She calls me everyday she is at work and tells me the EXACT same thing each time and annoys the crap out of me.  Mom: Cook rice. Me: OK  Mom: Take out the curry. Me: OK Mom: Wash the dishes and switch on the lights at 7. Me: OK Mom : And feed the dogs. Me: OK Mom: Dad told me that you didn't wash the dishes until he told you to. Me: Ya Mom: Ok thats all see you later. Me: OK  Even when you do things when people tell you to do they still complain. Yesterday night when my dad came back he complained about the fact that i didnt wash the dishes (ok i forgot) and went into his whole speech about him working 12 hours a day. So i immediately got up and washed the dishes. And he still complained to my mom. Sigh really need to get out of the house ASAP.

      I love internet banking ! Just paid my SCV bill online via the DBS website, it was my first time so a bit kancong also but when I updated my book later at the ATM the transaction was updated so it's all good! Next time I'm at the post office I'm gonna laugh at those losers...err i mean people queueing up to pay their bills . Ya I'm mean so what not happy is it !!   Went to the library to argue my case , they said I didn't return one of my CD-ROMs that I borrowed like a month back, but I'm pretty sure that I did cos I remember returning it together with the book that accompanied it using the bookdrop. The librarian said they would search for it for 7 days and get back to me. Whatever happens I ain't gonna pay for it !   Mental note to myself : Stop this silly obsession.

      How is it possible that someone i used to chat with online for like 3 - 4 hours everyday can now totally ignore me online? I am just so puzzled by it. And no I'm not taking it seriously but i'm just a little confused. Oh well i guess people change....or I didn't know that person as well as I thought I did....Or it's a sign i need to get out of the house more often......

      I think it is safe to say that I'm not gonna get the *** job ....have to admit I'm kinda disappointed cos I was really close but I think got no one to blame but myself , I could have done much better during the interview. Going to have to do better for the next one.  I downloaded and been listening to a song off the movie Gattaca('Departure'), the symphony piece that's played when he leaves Earth. This song makes me sad yet i just love it to death, and thats really weird cos I usually hate symphonies !  Latest Update : The guy from *** emailed the 12 of us saying that they still haven't made the decision because its subject to approval from EDB. I really hope they make their decision soon cos it's driving me crazy ! Well he emailed us cos some of the candidates called him and asked if they got the job which i think is kinda dumb. I mean if you got the job then obviously they will call or email you right. But that's just my opinion.

      Ah ok never blog the last 2 days cos nothing to talk about. Today played bball with Sam and halfway throughout the game my back really started to hurt like hell. I think need to do back strengthening exercises or something; or maybe i'm just getting old : ( After that came back to my place where he was playing Championship Manager on my PC for like god knows how long while I got so bored I even fell asleep.  Just watched Living with Lydia couple minutes ago; the whole plot of the episode was ripped off Look Who's Talking , you know the movie with the baby that talks; it was really awful. Oh the American Music Awards is on now i go watch liao !

      So finally went for the interview with Sun this morning , and it went ok but i could haven been better; got tongue tied on some of the questions. Anyway i have a 50 percent chance of getting it. Cos there are 12 applicants left and they choose 6 out of this 12. Hopefull i get the call next week, it sounds like a really interesting prospect.   Went out to a pub cum restaurant (forgot the name) at Mohd. Sultan with my cousin last nite, the music they were playing was pretty cool at first, they were playing jazz but then deteriorated into pretty sucky pop music soon after. Anyway had burger and fries the serving was so huge i could barely finish it; My cousin ate less than 1/2 of his. After that we went to this pub called Led Zep in Orchard. It was pretty cool they were playing Hendrix and really loud too ! And the owner came over to talk to us somemore; well he was talking mostly to my cousin whom he knows but he was very friendly to me also lah.   Bobby (my dog) is really irritating the crap out of me, he spotted a female dog (probably in heat) last night when i brought him down for a walk last night and that horny bastard has been barking and whining at home ever since and its really annoying. I whacked him a few times to shut him up but no use ...seriouly considering sending him for castration tommorow if he doesn't stop.

      Played bball with Sam yesterday and got totally trashed, was not fun at all. We then went to watch 'Das Experiment' , a German film that won Best Picture in the German Awards, and i highly recommend it! The movie is about a group of volunteers from all walks of life in a social experiment conducted by a group of German scientists. They were placed in a setting resembling a jailhouse; half of them were made prison wardens while the other half were prisoners. The prison wardens were told to keep order at all cost in the jailhouse but without resorting to violence. The main character is one of the volunteers who is actually a reporter trying to get an exclusive scoop on this experiment. During the first day, the prisoners are pretty jovial and play around with the wardens who are not sure how to react. However by the 2nd day start using rather extreme measures to keep the prisoners in check and also humiliate them. Soon the situation spirals out of control and ..well you go see lor !  But a minor complaint is some of the events in the movie are a little unrealistic, like the magical appearance of a screwdriver....  But i can relate to the movie because I was a military policeman when i was in the army and part of my job is to handle military prisoners. When i first started my job i treated the prisoners with respect and was rather polite to them. But after seeing how my superiors treated them , I also started to mimic their behaviour. We would humiliate the prisoners by making them push-up naked and by giving them tasks that were impossible to follow (for e.g stripping off their uniform in 30 secs) and punishing them when they couldn't do it. And when the prisoners asked for the time , i would make fun of them by replying "Why you wanna know, you meeting your girlfriend later is it ". And once Ahmad Latiff the national football player was in the cell for going AWOL. And we tekan him when we found out he was in the cell.....just because we could!  But thats nothing compared to my colleagues in the detention barracks, i have heard that they ever beat up prisoners who try to incite a riot.  I am not proud of my behaviour, in fact now i think of it i can't imagine doing some of the things that I did. People who know me well know that I'm a pretty mild mannered person. I think when you are placed in a position of power and authority it is very tempting to abuse it, just because you can. Something to ponder perhaps.

      Hmm today was a pretty boring day, was supposed to go see Gangs of New York which i really wanted to watch but my friend cancelled on me last night :(  So spend the afternoon playing TNET,chatting with a net friend who was in school, doing the laundry and taking a long nap. Not a lot of people to chat with now cos most of them are back in school and stuff; kinda sucks but thats life,  dun know that many pple who are like me at the moment.   Had a vivid dream during my nap : I was at a library waiting to go into this room (where they were selling their old library books) with a whole bunch of other people. And there is this cute looking Indian librarian at the information counter and i start chatting her up and even asked her for her number and she gave it to me. And we started talking and that was it I woke up soon after. But I dun remember how she looks like now though :( Hmm wonder what it means.   Hmm I'm probably just being paranoid but got this feeling that a net friend i met recently is avoiding me online, we barely talk since we met. Man hope i didn't do anything weird or strange when we went out that time, at least I dun think i did ....I guess i'm probably over reacting. Gotta wait and see.

      Ok guy from Sun Mircrosystems just called me , gotta go for a 2nd interview on Saturday at their main office in Orchard ..at Magazine Rd ...hmm it seems so familiar i know i been there b4; must check the map later ! But so embarassing my handphone no battery so the fellow called me twice on my hp and both times kenna disconnected. Ok next time i have to make sure my hp is charged at all times. Oh and the good news is I do not need to do a presentation for the 2nd interview like the interviewer said during my first interview ...i think its probably thanks to my boyish good looks! ;)   But was supposed to go to the  urlLink Book Fair  at Expo with a friend on that day also so that kinda sucks....so i will probably have to cancel, hope she understands. I will make it up to you babe i swear !   Today was a day of rest, my body is really aching like hell so didnt go to the bball court today, but I'm gonna go tommorow in the morning! But damm it had 3 helpings of my mom's mee siam cos i was so hungry and the mee siam was really happening. But i'm gonna skip dinner though so that will even it out hopefully. Maybe i will ask her to cook more of her vegetarian dishes cos when she cooks those i really lose my appetite.  My bloody printer screwed up i keep getting this horizontal lines whenever I print. Called up Epson the guy told me to do this head cleaning like 5 times , it used like 1/3 of my bland new ink catridge (that cost me like 22 bucks) and it still didn't solve the problem. Have to bring it down to their service centre in Commonwealth(!) on thursday, it is still under warranty until next month somemore so at least its a good thing it screwed up b4 then. Why the hell are all the companies and service centres have to be like in the west side so annoying !   Gonna go see  urlLink Gangs of New York  tommorow with a friend , although most friends told me its a little draggy (its 2 hrs and 45 min) . But critic reviews have been awesome so well i think i will just go and see for myself, even if it sucks at least got some nudity. Hmm wonder if Cameron Diaz strips ....  Oh ya Sam was kinda unhappy that i highlighted in my blog about the fact that he got his shot BLOCKED by a FOURTEEN year old GAL on the basketball court 2 days ago so to stroke his ego a bit can you guys go  read  urlLink this article  on him. He was in the Monash debate team for some Business Convention thing in India a month ago and also got  picture of the debate team there, he is the ....err...big boned ..guy right in the centre , the only chinese dude in the picture.

      Ok couldnt sleep well last night; I dun know its weird every night b4 an interview i get like insomnia. Last night was thinking about my previous interviews and also about someone. By the time i got to bed it was like 3 am. Thanks Cat for listening to me last night i really appreciated it.   I have to tell you i hate the morning crowd ..everyone seems to be in a rush or something , in fact they were even walking up/down on the escalator ! I mean not everyone can be late rite? But i think once i start working i will probably be rushing like everyone else.  Ok took around 20 minutes to find the lab and i was then interview by a panel of 4 people; 1 ang moh guy , 2 Chinese guys and 1 Chinese gal. I think i did pretty well right up to the point when they clarified that the job scope was basically to be a reseach assistant; that kinda took me by surprise. Ang Moh guy think noticed and asked me if i was disappointed , of cos I said no and that i would treasure the chance to try a different field of work, but if i knew the job scope beforehand i probably wouldn't have applied for it also. Anyway if selected I have to give a presentation to the people at Sun Microsystems in town...Sigh the things you gotta do nowdays to get a job.   Came back and had another game of bball with Sam , and i won ! Which was good lah cos i always kenna trash ...Fortunately for me all my long range shots were going in while his was missing ...cos i had no more strength to run so i just shoot as soon as I got the ball. Its been like 3 hours since we played but my legs still aching like crazy. But it was really tiring but i think I lost like 100g of fat today so it was worth it! But wonder what I'm gonna do when he goes back to Aussieland in Feb , no one to play with anymore .. Ok gonna go read Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Aksomething which i borrowed from Di , i didnt really like the first one in the series was really struggling to finish it. Hopefully this one is better !

      An even more strenerous workout today at the basketball with Sam cos we played with a bunch of kids and teenagers , it was kinda embarassing cos i was the worst player among all of them and it was pretty obvious ! But Sam got his shot blocked by a gal who was like 14 yrs old so at least that was some consolation haha ... But i got a feeling that I'm gonna wake up tommorow all tired cos never felt so exhausted in a long while !   I better get prepared for my interview at NTU tommorow by Sun Microsystems, sigh thinking of the journey to Boon Lay by MRT really makes me feel damm sian i tell ya, I mean theres a Sun office in Chai Chee why didnt they just call me go there instead ! But well see how it goes tommorow !

      Pretty good day today , met up with Sam for basketball in the afternoon but we didnt get to play for too long cos it started raining; it's been raining everyday for the past week. We then had pizza for dinner quite happening and add to that my mom's fried rice and i gained back any calories that i lost playing bball earlier.   I'm actually a little pissed with 2 friends rite now ...but I am gonna rant abt that in my private blog. Yeah i got this private blog set up recently to like vent my feelings like when I am unhappy with them. But don't wanna post it here cos those people might read it and get upset or offended and thats the last thing i want to do.  Gonna go to sleep now its 4:22am.

      A guy from *** called me regarding the job application. I gotta go down to *** on Monday for an interview. Didn't think I was gonna get called up cos they asked me to give them an essay on *** a while back and I did  a pretty last minute one which I thot kinda sucked. Let's see what happens on Monday.  Boy's skin problem is not getting better despite the medication, really wished I had brought him to the vet earlier when it wasn't so bad. Think I have to try another vet cos he is really itching and also he's really starting to smell.  Going to go down to the library to return my computer books cos they are overdue today. I Keep borrowing them but end up not reading them. And also gotta get a new print catridge for my Epson printer. Damm I didn't even use it that often and it finished liao. Need it to print out and mail the application form for Crimson Logic. I applied for the job like a couple months back and they finally emailed me asking me to send my certs and testimonials and stuff. They send me an email  last week but I have been kinda ignoring it (holiday mood mah), but I'm gonna try and send it by today. Dad left a whole pile of clothes on the table for me to hang out to dry...and its hell of a lot and I'm damm lazy to do it. :(

      Things and People i am thankful for the past year:   1. I got to know a lot of really nice and/or interesting people thanks to ICQ , people whom i would have never have gotten to know otherwise. Some of them i now consider very good friends; and others i really wanna get to know better. But I did make some mistakes though that did jeopardise some of those friendships; and one of them I'm not even sure I'm gonna be able to salvage and that makes me sad. But I do hope those friendships that i still have will be there for a long time to come, but i got this feeling that most of them won't really last as long as I would want them to last. But thats life. But for those who consoled me when i was really down i will always remember them for it so a Big thank you to them.   2. I'm thankful for the fact that I have at least managed to conquer SOME of my shyness when it comes to members of the opposite sex. Yes I am sure you all will be shocked to know that the Indian Stallion is actually a pretty shy person in real life , and that is something really hard for me to admit ok but its true. Well I think its because i always had this feeling that I'm not exactly the kind of guy gals wanna hang out with cos first of all I'm no Mike Myers when it comes to my looks and secondly i'm not the most interesting person out there also; my life now is really really boring, at least to me.    3. I'm grateful for the fact that i got to know this really amazing person online and even gotta spend some time with her , every moment i did spend with her made me as happy as I ever been in a really long time. Ok ok so she ended up telling me that i was creepy and that I was invading her personal space  (which i realise now that i was); but well shes someone who i really respect and admire cos she went through a lot of crap in her life  and came out the stronger for it; and i will always remember her for that.    4. I'm grateful for my sis who has always been there for me when i needed someone to talk to , to my overprotective mom for always worrying and fussing about me even when she didnt need to , and to my dad for ...err...giving me money when i needed it.   5. To the friend who took me out for my bday and even bought for me a really great bday present; she has no idea how much that meant to me.   Ok i think thats all..cant remember anymore now also.

      So yesterday was a good day, spend my new year eve with a net friend. Went to see LOTR and then we walked around Orchard and talked until 2 something. First time in years that i spend new year eve without my dogs at home though, I'm sure they must have missed me. The movie was awesome, totally enjoyed it from start to end but it got really cold in the cinema towards the end, was really tempted to ask my friend for her jacket but well decided(probably wisely) not to. But there were a lot of Bangladeshi nationals in Orchard yesterday and some of them were so annoying , they were like whistling and shit and then there was this group that was like spraying those party foam sprays thingys at everyone and basically pissing a lot of them off. Oh ya and then my mom called me like 2 am and asked me if i knew what time it was and why was I still not home...Sigh that was so embarrasing ....But all in all had a pretty nice time , hope she did too !

      Sigh I just checked. Gavin Rossdale and Gwen Stefani got married last year on September 14 ...one day after my birthday. Damm you Gwen i loved ya u know .....I'm gonna take the wallpaper of you off my computer when i go back to work on Monday!   Feeling really tired right now. Research is not easy i tell ya; it is terribly frustrating and tedious and sometimes its like (at the risk of sounding cliched) looking for a needle in a haystack. Wonder when I will get my hands dirty and dive into the actual grid stuff.  Hoping to go catch a movie or something in the weekend; really need to chill out and relax.   Check out this cool  urlLink Mind Reading  thingy , I was kinda puzzled about how it worked at first but figured it out after a couple of tries. (No its not something scary i swear)

      Finally signed my bond with *** yesterday with my sis and her hubby acting as my sureties. One of the terms of the bond is that they have the right to terminate my contract if I contract a serious illness during the 3 years of the bond period.  But the interesting thing is that if I contract HIV I will also have to pay back the money that they spend training me. I find this a bit discriminating. I mean if a smoker gets lung cancer i doubt they will do the same thing. And what if the person practices safe sex but still gets infected? And the last thing someone needs after learning they have contracted HIV is to be punished financially for it.  Besides if I am not wrong most people who contract HIV still lead normal lives at least while the virus remains dormant which could even be for a period of 3 years. I mean I'm not concerned that I might have to deal with this personally cos I got more chance of hitting the lottery than getting laid ( let alone getting HIV) in the next 3 years; I just find the whole thing totally unnecessary and prejudicial.

      Arrgh wish people would stop sending me all those emails with those stupid inspirational stories about how you should treasure your loved ones or how you should live each day to its fullest because I honestly do not give a damm and I find them extremely annoying.  Didn't do much today at the lab ...well actually i spend quite a while trying to figure out how to set a Gwen Stefani jpeg as the wallpaper for my workstation and finally manage to do it with the help of my colleague. Sigh now thats one person I dun think i will ever get tired of looking at! Other than that did nothing much went for a pretty long lunch at NIE and a couple hours later a pretty long teabreak. Ya sounds very slack I know but this is the last day I'm gonna be able to do that. Cos tommorow I am signing the deed/contract and I officially start my work from thursday. Which also means i got to be there by 9:00 am instead of 11 am like i do now.    But there is a problem my bro-in-law who is one of my sureties tommorow lost his IC and Miss See See specifically said that we have to bring our IC. He has a temporary IC so i hope that will suffice but i am gonna call her tommorow to make sure.

      Well the doctor told me there was nothing wrong with me. I am relieved but I am also a bit pissed. I went for an ECG (which came out fine ) and then an ultrasound that cost me more than 400 dollars altogether just to find out that there is nothing wrong with me. I mean that is a lot of money to me ( I am not exactly rich) and makes me ALMOST wish they found something wrong. Yeah i know how stupid that sounds and that I should be grateful that I'm ok but thats what I'm feeling can't help it.   I am in a really irritable mood today. Every little thing is pissing me off  today; my damm hi fi which keeps skipping , my damm doorknob that broke so now i cant close the room door otherwise i can't open it; stuff that friends said which usually don't bother me but really got on my nerves just now, the stupid dumbass grammys that claim to reward artistic achievement in music (what a joke), the fact that there will be people who will rush out and buy albums by artists just because they did well in the grammys and the fact that they gonna pre-empt The Practice to show the stupid dumbass grammys at 11 pm. Oh great I switched on Ch 18 to watch The 70s show and instead of that they are showing the grammys. And Channel 5 is now showing the critically acclaimed 'Hard Target' starring the thespian Jean Claude Van Damme and Natasha 'Species' Hendstridge. Oh wait Gwen Stefani is on now on Ch 18....man she is so so freaking hot, damm Gavin Rossdale that lucky bastard, if i had a wish it would wish to be him for a day. (He is Gwen's bf for the clueless)

      Watched the MJ interview yesterday night and it left me feeling sorry for him and also his kids. After watching the interview I'm pretty sure that he isn't a pervert, but I think he is basically a child stuck in a 44 year old body and it's probably due to his bad childhood. But then again there are a lot of people who went through traumatic childhoods (even famous celebrities) and still manage to lead normal lives; I guess at some time they came to terms with their past and moved on with their life. But the problem with MJ is he is too scared to do that, and with the amount of money he has he can afford to keep that illusion of being a kid going. I mean this is a guy who is uncomfortable even saying the word 'sex' and who only seems to able to relate to kids.  I am really afraid for his kids though, i mean being forced to wear masks whenever they go out in public and having no contact at all with their moms..they are either gonna grow up weird like him or really resent him later in life.   Anyway thats just my opinion of cos feel free to disagree with it!

      Went to Bedok just now to do two things. First I went to the library to return my Flash book which i had for two months (I renewed it) but I read like the first 5 pages of it thats all. Don't even know why I borrowed it. Anyway borrowed 2 books , a book on Solaris 9 which is the OS that they use at the lab where I work and Unix Shell Scripting which I have to learn pretty soon. There were a lot of other books on the two subjects but these 2 had the most pictures so I got them instead. :)  After that went to the photo studio to take a passport sized photo for my company website. Sigh I am one of those people that can't smile on cue but i still tried to for the pic. I ended up with a really weird smile that made me look like a freaking pervert and made me wish I didnt smile. But got no choice cos I need to have it up by tommorow so gave it to Jiaqi (thanks babe I owe you!) to scan for me and I just uploaded it to the website. No I will not give you the URL so don't ask me; just let me suffer in shame and dignity please I beseech you. *Sniff*

      Suffering from a really bad cold rite now; I lost count of the number of tissues i used the whole day more than 2 boxes definitely. And add to that seeing the crappiest Man Utd performance this season in today's match against Bolton and you can say it was a pretty awful day.   Last Friday the whole team went for lunch at Macs at Discovery Centre and (Dr.) Simon treated the whole 10 or more of us which was really really generous of him. And then as usual I ate my lunch incredibly fast that kinda surprised the rest of them ; some of which haven't even started eating! It was kinda embarassing I really gotta try and slow down the next time. And to think in JC i was like so proud of the fact that I could eat a burger in under a minute .....sigh i was such a geek then.   Need to get a passport photo and get it scanned tommorow cos I need to put it on my APSTC website by Monday. I got one already an IC size pic but i look like a drug addict in that so gonna take a better one tommorow.

      Marilyn Manson will release "The Golden Age of Grotesque" on May 13, 2003 on Interscope Records. The first single will be "mOBSCENE." Marilyn Manson takes his inspirations from the glamour of 1930s Hollywood, the grotesque of Vaudeville to the extreme height of cabaret decadence and so-called "degenerate" art in Weimar Berlin just before its destruction. Manson says, "This album is about expression. The imagination and personality of the individual cannot be trapped by small minds or defined by any one person. The genius of art finds sanctuary among children and madmen to survive. That, is who we are."  Marilyn Manson has collaborated with renown artist Gottfried Helnwein for the album's controversial artwork which is part of a greater series that will be exhibited in museums all across the world.

      My task was getting a bit sian so i started playing with this p2p client that M was actually experimenting with and i ended up chatting with other people on it. Think tommorow I am going to ask A if I can do something else; but then again I won't be coming on Monday cos i'm gonna collect my results for my heart ultrasound thingy so maybe I will ask him on Tuesday.   Also met with Mr. Vincent , one of the directors of the company in a rather imformal meeting where he just like briefed us about how we fit into the big picture.. And he was like he prefers us to address him by his name rather than call him Mr. Vincent. Apparently thats how the culture is like; it's cool but I dun know i find it a little weird. I still got trouble calling Appie without the Mr. in front. And he said we are also gonna get like both NTU and Sun passes and name cards so looking forward to that. Next time can use the namecards to pick up chicks ....chicks should be impressed by that right ?   "Yo yo whats up I am an associate engineer at *, here is my card , and I would really love to show you my engine sometime baby so call me !"   Can't wait to try that line out!  Shoutout: Diana I miss you already babe have a great time in UWA alright ...I will be waiting for you till you come back ....  Oh ok ya two things I learned in the past week. 1. There is a fine line between being funny and being downright annoying. 2. Never never never ever in under any circumstances poke fun at a friend's bf/gf .

      Appie isn't coming in today; he works from home sometimes which is really cool hope I can do that next time too; but gotta have quite a fair bit of disipline also; I will probably be like spending more time chatting than doing work.  Watched "Meet my folks" yesterday it was pretty funny. One guy was like justifying to the gal's parents how there was nothing wrong with the fact that he likes to be spanked in bed.  Amd the lie detector test showed that one guy DID sleep with his ex- girlfriend's MOM eventhough he denied it.  Can't wait for next week!   Eek my blog looks like crap on the Mozilla browser at work I can hardly read the words. Gotta do something about it soon.

      Work today was better cos i was like testing out the software that i downloaded on friday. 1 of which was pretty interesting it showed 3D models of protein molecules and DNA; Basically most of the software were for the field of genetics. Also the fourth trainee started work today (left 2 more to go) , a gal and she seemed really nice so i am kinda looking forward to working with her as well. But its always 9:30 now and im already feeling really tired ..gonna go to sleep soon.  oh and i also learned today F4 means Faggot 4 !

      Went to Tampines to meet Rifah to pass her the Office XP CD and also to buy shoes for work tommorow. She treated me to ice cream at Haegen-Daz(sp?) which was really nice of her and also made me a little paiseh but i told her i would treat her back as soon as I get my paycheck! Hmm actually i promised a lot of pple treats once I get my first paycheck....better stop doing that.  After that went to Bata and Americaya and tried to get shoes my size but the largest they had was 10. So finally I just went to the salesgal at Hush Puppies and asked her to show me any shoes she had that were at least a 11. There was only 1 and after making sure it fit me i just bought it. This is what I am going to do from now on cos its really frustrating when I find a shoe that I like but when i ask the salesperson they tell me they dun have that size.  Oh ya don't know why but I am beginning to find the slightest stuff really funny. In the MRT on the way to Tampines there was this old woman in my cabin who was talking really loudly (to no one in particular) about how arrogant Singapore was with regards to the water dispute with Malaysia, how she supports Mahathir stopping the supply of water to us eventhough she is a Singaporean and how just because Singapore was richer than Malaysia we think we can bully them. I was like trying my best not to laugh but I was the only one; no one else found it funny they just stared at her with a puzzled look. Hmm....  On the MRT ride back saw this ad in the train which showed this gal jumping in the air and with the tagline "You can also move freely" or something like that. So i thought it was probably a tampon or some sanitary pad ad but it turned out to be an ad for acuvue contact lenses. Talk about misleading advertistments ....Or maybe my mind just works differently.  Wonder how long the comment server is gonna be down. :(

        Congratulations, you're a Drac, a seductive fae.  What kind of female faerie are you?   urlLink Take the female faerie quiz  by  urlLink Paradox .  This is a little worrying ...but for anyone who dares to think otherwise; let me just make really clear the fact that the Stallion is 100 percent straight alright !!  Damm it Man Utd got beaten really badly by Arse(nal) yesterday night and the biggest culprit had to be Giggsy who missed an unguarded wide open goal. He also miscue another shot in the 2nd half like 10 metres from the goal that ended up closer to the corner flag. I guess when you are earning like 50k pounds a week working on your shooting skills doesn't seem so important aymore.  Woohoo got rid of the blog banner at the top after copying the style tag in the HTML code from  urlLink Rheen's  blog. Yeah it is not exactly ethical but it was kinda dumb having two banners at the top. Wait lah I get my pay then I subscribe ok !

      Spend Hari Raya buying my work clothes with my sis at town. All i ever wear is jeans so i got like 1 work-suitable pants left and it also kinda shrank on me. Anyway bought 2 pants and 3 shirts, wait hmm i think I need a little more that. Tried to buy my shoes at the same time but they didn't have my size (size 11) in any of the shops in town. By the way if you are wondering about the rumor about guys with big feet, its true i assure you ! ;)   Thursday: Went for my echo scan at CGH; the doctor took this like hand held scanner thing and pressed it against my hairy chest for like 20 minutes. And somemore got scolded by her when i tried to turn my head to look at the ultrasound screen; as if like turning my head is gonna affect my heart rate or something cheh ! Anyway gonna get the results of the scan on the 24th; yeah i guess it takes 11 days for doctors there to like analyse the results cos they are that stupid or something.   After that went for lunch with a friend at Siglap at Cafe Cartel and return her Harry Potter books. You would think that being a huge fan of the fantasy genre i would enjoy Potter as well but in fact I found the books really boring. In fact i fell asleep on my bed while reading one of them , not bluffing i swear ! And also got back my Led Zeppelin CD from her ...sigh how i missed that CD thank god its back with me now. *kisses CD*  Today went to work again , its really cool cos now i have to be at work only at 11 am  so i dun get the morning rushhour crowd in the MRT , can definitely find a seat and relax all the way from Bedok to Boon Lay. But today was damm boring though; Appie gave me this task where i had to download any application software from this website and there were a hell lot of them. Sianz. But for lunch , I and 2 other fellow trainies went to NIE so it was nice lah got quite a fair bit of hot chicks there compared to the faculty of mechanical enginneering. Went back at 5:30 and i had to stand all the way back to Bedok; my feet hurt (and smell) like hell now. Dun care next time im gonna rush into the mrt and push anyone out of the way to get a seat. Hey Darwin's law rite ...

      Today was my first day of work and it was a little overwhelming cos they do not use Windows OS there ; instead they use Solaris and Linux which i know little about so I really gotta work my butt off to try and familiarise myself with them the next few weeks. But my superiors there were really friendly; there is this ang moh guy (Appie) who is like goofing around all the time, he is such a riot ! The others are very friendly also and I think I am gonna enjoy working with them. Gonna go back on Friday cos Thursday i will be going for the scan on my enlarged heart....

      So the Xray showed that my heart was abnormally large. The hot Sikh doctor said there are basically a few causes , either i was born with it so thats not a problem or something wrong with my heart muscle or valves in which case I'm screwed. Going to CGH in a couple of hours to see the cardiologist for further tests.   Now i got two parts of my body that are abnormally large.  Update:  Just got back from CGH, they ran an ECG and the doctor said it looked fine. He also said my heart was borderline large whatever that means. But he still wants to do an echo scan on thursday, the results of which i will only get on the 24th of February. I am not sure if EDB will wait that long for me so I just emailed them and asked them. Now gotta wait for their reply. Talk about bad luck; haven't start job already so much stress and not to mention the damm echo test gonna set me back 300 bucks.

      Went to watch Final Destination 2 with Sam and Ai Ling just now ; the movie was extremely gory and some scenes will make u cringe so all in all it was a decent movie but there wasn't much of a plot though. After that went to his grandma's house where we had some pretty delicious mee hoon curry dish, satay which I and sam barbecued, some kind of pork bun which i think is an acquired taste, prawn salad and fish soup. Came back to watch the Pool-Boro match which was boring as hell (Liverpool are like the most boring team ever) and then brought my dog for a walk cos he needed to relieve himself, sigh should have toilet trained him when he was younger.  I got some weird reactions from some of my friends after they read my previous entry. Frankly I am really afraid of whether there is anything seriously wrong with me (i mean there must be something wrong otherwise they wouldn't ask me to come back) and whether this will cause me to lose the job. But the reactions of some of my friends ..anyway I will know everything by Monday.

      A nurse at the clinic I went to for my check-up asked me to come down again on Monday. Apparently the doctor found 'something' in my X-Ray and wants to talk to me about it. But she told me its nothing that serious but said she can't give me any more details cos the doctor has all the information so i'm guessing she has no clue either. I don't know what to make of it. I guess I will find out on Monday.

      A rather boring day; the highlight of my day was probably bathing my dog.

      I went to buy lunch 2 days ago at a coffeeshop nearby and saw this old women walking on the pavement using a walking stick; she was walking 1 step at a time at a horribly slow pace. And it was kinda sad u know and in a way it frightened me cos i started thinking what if i had to walk like that when i get old. Imagine taking more than an hour to go to the coffeeshop when people do it in like 15 mins or less. Scares the crap out of me.  Met my JC classmate yesterday for lunch and coffee. She jsut came back from Melbourne after her graduation so it was really fun to meet her again and talk abt stuff and see hows she doing, helped her pick out a new PC also . Damm now the PCs are like 2.4 GHZ,  makes my 1.7 seem so slow......sianz  Totally panicked around 1 am just now when I couldn't find my letter for my pre-employment medical check up this morning. I was searching for like 2 hours plus when i finally found it below my queen size mattress ; how it got there i got no idea. Anyway went for the appointment just now and got checked out by this totally hot Sikh doctor damm made me wish i got a full physical examination. Would have turned out my stallion charms on her but i saw the wedding ring on her finger ....damm my sense of morality!   Anyway i didnt bring my specs (hey i dun use them what) so i gotta go down later again; first gotta find them i never wear them like in ages also .

      Woohoo NUS has given us an alumni account to access my (School of Computing) SOC BBS newsgroups which I think is pretty cool cos it will allow me to like keep in touch with whats been going on in my faculty. So you SOC alumni pple go to http://alum.comp.nus.edu.sg/ to sign up alright!   Watched Notorious , a 1946 B&W hitchcock classic, it was pretty good and the chemistry between the 2 leads was amazing; I don't see that kind of chemistry in movies nowdays ....hmm I wonder why......

      Finally watched Magnolia like almost two months after i downloaded it. Really really good movie although at 3 hours its a tad long and the middle part was a little draggy for me. But Tom Cruise was amazing as a vulgar woman-seducing dating guru i think that was like his best performance ever!    Left Donnie Darko and A Clockwork Orange to watch ....gotta watch them b4 i start my job otherwise no chance liao. Speaking of which I'm still not sure exactly when im gonna start also ....think probably have to wait until they clear me medically and security-wise. Saying this cos everyone is asking me when I'm starting !   Now downloading Rear Windown and Notorious 1946 from Alfred Hitchcock ..well i hope those are his movies sekali turn out to be like porn movies then gonna be damm boring.

      I can't sleep. Was tossing around in bed for the last hour but there was like a million thoughts that kept going through my mind. Really strange thoughts. I was thinking about how if something was to happen to me tommorow or the next day, that probably no one but my family would realise it that very day. Was thinking about this girl whose blog I read today, I'm worried for her. Thought about work and how I still feel so unproductive and that maybe I am not putting in the effort that I should. Thought about the fact that I told myself I would do my progress report this weekend but didn't. Thought about that girl. Wondered if I would ever get that which i so desperately want right now and if so when. Wondered if there was anyone in this world who didn't have any problems and was totally happy and contented with their life and if so I wanna ask them why. Thought about how the gal who introduced me to blogging in the first place seems to have lost interest in blogging, and for some reason it made me a little sad. Thought about how stoned I am gonna be at work later.   Gonna try and get back to sleep now.

      Read in Life today about how Adrian Brody, the guy who won Best Actor for his lead role in The Pianist, went on a starvation diet which caused him to lose 14kg in 6 weeks, stopped listening to any type of post 1940 music and sold off his car, threw away his handphone and locked his NY apartment to try and experience a bit of the loss that his character went through. Talk about dedication to his art!  The movie is really amazing and for those who haven't seen it please do.  Did nothing much today. Played more TNET, chatted with some net friends online, efiled my parents' tax returns and took a nap. And just like that my weekend is over. Back to work tommorow.   Mom bought a tub of ice cream today. Sigh here I am trying to cut down on junk food and she's tempting me with stuff like this. And now shes asking me to eat it arrrghh.

      Was playing tetris at  urlLink TNET  this evening and had this following conversation with this guy (he sounds like a USian  Guy: play teams? Me : me no speak english Guy: Who gives a damm you stupid fuck! Me : me no like you , me no want to friend with you. Me : you bad man speak bad words Guy: Fuck you, u r a fagg Me : u r a fagg? Guy: Yes. Game starts and I totally whip his ass and win the game. Me: Me win ? Guy : Yes you won you dumb fuck. Trashes him again the next game Me: You bad at game no ? Guy leaves.  Damm that was funny as hell really enjoyed that. I dun know when I am playing games I tend to be really arrogant and annoy people just for the fun of it. I would insult them like telling them they suck or that my dog can play better than them, but only guys lah or gals who are like totally bitchy.   And thats the end of my Saturday.  Oh I almost forgot I changed my phone ,err the red sporty rubbery one i think its 5610 for a smaller one, 8250 ...I dun know whats the difference other than the size but it has to be better right cos the model number is bigger!

      Going to buy 4D for my dad now. $30 dollars big and $20 dollars small for 1317. He spends like 100 bucks a week on that same number for the last 3 -4 years or even more i also can't remember. I here struggling for money and not buying clothes and all the other stuff that I wanna buy till I get my damm pay (which has been delayed once again ) and yet he finds no problem just donating it to the government, and its not like we are rich also. And I hate to buy it cos I dun believe in gambling but what to do still gotta do it.  Just got back from the 4D counter. When i was there filling out the lottery ticket form this indian old woman came up to me and asked me if I could fill up a form for her also and being the kind indian boy that I am i did but then she gave me this piece of paper with 11 different 4-Digit numbers ! Took around 5 minutes to fill it cos the numbers looked like they were written in roman numerals I am not kidding( well she was really old) .  I just changed my nick back to Paranoid Android. I have used like 5 -6 nicks over the past few years for ICQ depending on my mood and situation. First was 'Blacksnake78' ....no explanation necessary. Then there was "Nightcrawler78" cos I always slept really late like 3 -4 am. Then changed to Paranoid Android. Then there was "13" during my whole period of depression late last year when I was jobless and cos of some other stuff that I won't go into. Then came "Space Invader" after a gal i was interested in told me I was invading her space, I don't know why she said that, I only asked her out EVERYDAY for 2 weeks.( I thought she would be flattered ..sniff ) Then now back to Paranoid Android - Paranoid cos I am feeling a little paranoid about work and the damm sars, and Android cos ...err..cos I got buns of steel ?    I know some day you'll have a beautiful life I know you'll be a sun In somebody else's sky but why ... why... why... can't it be... can't it be mine...  Black - Pearl Jam

      Yesterday while I was sitting in the train with my colleague there was this woman who was standing quite close to us.  The thing is I wasn't sure if she was pregnant or just fat so I didnt know if I should have gave up my seat to her. I mean she didn't have the 'glow' that pregnant women supposedly have so I thought she was just fat. And if I had gave up my seat to her and she wasn't pregnant it would have been quite an insult. Anyway my colleague stood up and gave up her seat to her , and I think she was pregnant cos i heard the woman's friends using words like 'maternity' and 'baby'. Anyway I was a bit paiseh lor(embarassed) cos being the guy I should have offered my seat. Oh well I propose that maybe pregnant woman should have like a special badge or a wristband to show that they are pregnant I think that would help a lot.   Alright if I could point you to the left of my blog you can see a brand new zonkboard version 2 installed, so for the lazy asses who are too lazy to click the comment link you can just leave your comments there. Nah just kidding It's just there cos Haloscan screws up sometimes. Please please do try and use it , and use different names if possible everytime u give a comment so that it will seem like I got much more friends than just the 4 of you.  Ok I'm going back to the ticks on my dogs , die you little bloodsucking scum!

      Is it just me or is American Idol getting really boring?  For me I loved the first 2 episodes cos they were the funniest, who can forget that spanish dude with that horrible rendition of Julio Iglesias's Escape or the arrogant guy who went out to party while the others were busy practicing in their hotel rooms.  Now it is just the same people singing songs every week, only differences are that the song they sing changes and every week there is one less person. I didn't even watch yesterday, was watching Remains of the Day instead but slept at 11:30 (really tired) so didn't manage to finish it.  Close shave yesterday, I was doing some work-UNrelated stuff on my computer (taking a break mah..) and I didn't notice Dr Simon coming in until he spoke up. Think maybe we should hang a bell at the door so that we will know when anyone comes in.   Oh ya Simon said that our paychecks will be delayed a little bit longer, he didnt say exactly how long but he's not in charge so he probably doesn't know. Very very frustrating.  The weekend is almost here and I ain't got any plans. Yup so probably gonna spend it the way I did last week, picking and squashing the horde of ticks on my 2 dogs. And surfing porn.   Have a nice weekend people.

      Damm SAR is really getting scary. 2 people died today from it in Singapore today and the health ministry and MOE closed all schools for a week and a half 'to assure the concerned parents'. Parents were already writing in to the strait times forum last week telling MOE to extend the school holidays by a week but the damm government as usual ignored them; but after a kid was infected last week they do an about turn and give in.  Call me a paranoid android but the thing I am really worried about is when I go to work in the morning , the MRT is packed like crazy and if really sueh sueh(unlucky) got someone near me with flu i think its really gonna freak me out. OK maybe i am overreacting but I dun know have to admit I am kinda scared.

      During the academy awards two days ago there were some Oscar winners who used their 1 (or is it 2?)  minute of screen time to voice out their personal views on the war.  And why shouldn't they, hell so what if the show's main purpose is to honor outstanding achievements in the film industry, you got millions of people watching it live so might as well make full use of it to express your political views as well, I mean thats what you call freedom of speech and the American way.   I only wished that EVERY one of those winners gave their personal opinion on the war instead of those few who actually did, imagine how much more interesting it would have been then.  You would then have 3 hours plus of passionate views on the war, who wouldn't wanna see that!   But why stop at war, I propose that everyone who wins should voice out their personal views on everything, from abortion to welfare to animal rights to tax cuts to racism to movie critics who suck cos they dissed their latest movies.  Ok so these topics aren't as hot as the war right now but again , its freedom of speech!  If they care about the issues and wanna voice them out during the academy awards they should have the right to, and for those in attendance who dun really wanna hear their views well screw them they suck !   Yeah sure you could join an organisation that fights for those rights like PETA, but how many people you can reach that way compared to the millions who watch the oscars.? And not to mention it is much more work.   Just my 2 cents worth.

      Well the singnet gal came over again and I said I wasn't interested. She was trying to change my mind for a couple of minutes but then gave up. Feel kinda bad cos she did spend like half an hour talking to me yesterday to try and persuade me. Damm my raging hormones, next time I should just say no immediately.  Yesterday I went to the general office in NTU to look for Simon's office and I went into the office , the woman at the desk told me no students were allowed in the room. When I told her that I was a staff there , she was pretty surprised and said that I was looked young and handsome to be a staff there. Ok so she didn't really say the yong and handsome part , but thats what she thought cos I could see the lustful look in her eyes, and I know it cos I have seen that same look in so many middle-aged women that I have met. Then she started following me around using the pretense that she wanted to help me find the office, but I thankfully Appie called me and told me to get back to the lab. Damm it's so hard being the stallion sometimes.

      Was talking to this rather cute chick from Singnet, she was trying to get me to change to 512k adsl and she was talking to me for like 1/2 an hour, she even came into my room, I tell you no gal can resist the stallion ! Ok ok so she came into my room to check my PC but she stayed there to talk to me instead so thats something rite !  But my room was a total mess , I had like used cotton buds and 3 glasses on my computer table so a bit paiseh but I think my charisma kinda overshadowed all that. Anyway she will be coming tommorow and I am gonna tell her I am not interested cos I am pretty happy with my cable modem. Hmm but feel so guilty leh .....Haha if it was a guy I probably would have told him to get lost at the door...I am such a buaya.

      I honestly do not care about the Gulf War that much. Yeah I do read up on it in the papers everyday, but I just browse through the articles quicky. Like in today's papers , they were talking about the kind of bombs and planes that were used in the war ; I didn't read that cos I honestly didn't care. Maybe I should care , after all there are a lot of innocent civilians who are gonna die as a result of this war, but then again there are people dying everywhere like in the poorer countries , of famine or drought or poor living conditions; for me there isn't much difference. Maybe I should care cos its a case of the USA trying to bully the world into follow their lead without even considering other alternatives to war, but I don't. Yes I guess that makes me a totally ignorant person with regards to the war , so those who wanna discuss the war with me , don't say I never warn you hor.

      Watching Miss Singapore Universe now and I got no idea how the judges rate the contestants. I am guessing they just close their eyes and press the buttons at random or something. I really hope that Melinda Kaur wins it, and if not her then Eileen or that Eurasian chick Holly. Anyone else and I am going to petition the organisers to send me instead.  Crap Melinda screwed up the interview question......think it might cost her. Ok none of my 3 picks made it to the final 5...Just curious what other pple think cos maybe I got unusual tastes in women or something....Comment and tell me k?

      Had another dream about work today. I dreamt that I and my colleagues were having lunch at this canteen and I went to get mine from the chinese food stall. And for some reason the vendor charged me five bucks for a simple meal with rice and meat and vegetables, I think she was racist or something. Anyway being the demure guy that I was I paid it anyway and went to sit with my colleagues and started eating my lunch. Then this guy came up to me and said his boss from the chinese food stall charged me wrongly just now and asked to pay more! So i got really pissed and I start screwing him, asking him how could a simple meal cost 5 bucks and told him to give me a breakdown of the charges. And he pointed to the signboard on top of the food stall and there it showed that they charged like 50 cents for the plate and another 50 cents for the service! So i got even more pissed and I just started shouting at him even louder and he left. And my colleagues were like totally embarassed.That's it.  Had a really nice company dinner at this place  beside the Safra Resort at Changi last night. I think it was a club of some kind cos there was a carpark, a playground and what looked like a games room there. I and another 2 of my colleagues reached the place first and since the rest haven't arrived yet so we decided to go play on the swings at the playground there and it was really pretty fun! And there was this parent there who was staring at us probably wondering what the hell these three adults were doing on the swing. Anyway I think my swing was faulty cos it started to give off this metallic creak you know like in movies when the joint is gonna snap so i didn't stay long on it. : (   Anyway my supervisor and other colleagues arrived not long after and we went to eat. I love the place and the atmosphere; our tables were on the beach in open air just a few feet away from the sea and you could hear the waves and feel the breeze and when you looked up you could see the stars, it was really cool and pretty romantic also at least to me. The food was pretty good too they had like beef, chicken, potato salad, normal salad, sausages that kinda stuff it was a buffet thingy and I had 2 helpings. All in a all had a pretty nice time.

      It's weird nowdays when I talk to my friends online Its like I got like nothing to say. Which is a little weird cos if you know me then u know I'm pretty chatty on ICQ. I guess maybe my brain is just tired or something.  There is the company dinner at this restaurant in Changi tommorow cos this VIP is gonna be there , but it's supposed to be a really casual dinner so I can wear jeans. Heh nowdays I mostly wear jeans to work anyway, but as soon as I get my first paycheck I need to get like 3 pairs more cos now I only got 2 pairs of jeans that fit, it's really weird how my clothes keep shrinking so often.   Anyway I am gonna go to bed early tonight cos I am tired as hell, and also there's nothing good to watch on tv also.  The Bachelor yesterday was really boring cos they were like focusing on the 5 guys they shortlisted to be the bachelor and barely featured the 25 gals! I mean come on who cares abt the bachelor i just wanna see the chicks! And smallville is getting a little boring already I think I might stop watching that pretty soon.

      Oh god today's meet the folks was the funniest ever ! Instead of the usual 3 guys trying to win a dream holiday date with one gal , it was the other way around. But the guy was kind of a perv, he was like trying to get the 3 gals to flash him while they were in the jacuzzi together. And worse the 3 gals actually were going to do it but the dad stopped it. And the guy was totally ignoring the gal with the smallest boobs eventhough she seemed to be the only one with a personality and was like persuading his parents to take the gal with the enormous boobs.  Oh ya and 2 of them seemed to be such bimbos! One of them was a former Teen USA who was like so dumb. Her ex was like telling the parents that she ever moved in with a 60 yr old man who was like her sugar daddy. She rebutted by saying "He wasn't 60, he was 51..." Jesus !

      Stayed up until 1 am to do the dashboard webpage thingy and excel file for Simon. Still not done yet . Hope he doesn't screw me for it during the meeting at 2 pm later. Also not sure what I am gonna say if he or Appie asks me for my progress.  I think I am probably gonna start a work-related blog. Then I can like update at the end of every work day ; it will allow me to keep track of what I have been doing and also I can show my superiors what I have been doing on a daily basis.  Hopefully can get it set up by today !

      Dreamt of a commercial about the Singapore Zoo last night (of all things!)  Kid : Mom I wanna go to the bird park! Mom: You wanna go to the zoo instead? They got a new logo and name and everything! Kid: Woohoo a new logo!!? Yeah i really wanna see that ! Screw the bird park, let's go to the zoo! Ok ok i know its corny. Sigh why can't I dream of Cameron Diaz or Gwen Stefani instead?  Read that local footballer was called Blackie by this ang moh footballer during an S-League match. For some reason it made me laugh. Which is really weird cos being Indian I should be offended but yeah it just seems funny to me. Hell I hated it when my schoolmates in St Patrick's called me by the word 'Black' also. Hmm maybe its the first signs of a nervous breakdown or something.

      Ok I added a change background color for those of you who use older browsers. My blog looks really dark on those browsers making the words hard to read. Not sure which color would be best cos i dun have any of those browsers so if you are one of them then suggestions will be very much appreciated!   Oh ya a reminder : Making your scrollbars the exact same color as the background so that it is invisible is a big NO NO. It is not fun trying to figure out where the damm scrollbars are when you are trying to scoll a page. Not everyone has mouse with wheels ok. I seen some blogs like that , annoying as hell. Almost as annoying as those which loads music and force you to listen to it when you visit the website.

      I got a meeting at work tommorow to monitor my progress. I am kind of worried cos I havent had much of progress in the past week, I have tried really hard but I just can't find the stuff that I was supposed to be looking for. And if I tell that to my superior tommorow its gonna sound like an excuse.   Sometimes my parents can be so freaking annoying. They refuse to talk to each other , but they use a technicality to overcome this ,when they need to tell each other something they use ME to relay the messages. I mean its stupid cos if you dun wanna talk dun talk lah ! So like just now the 3 of us were in the hall and my dad tells me to tell my mom to call my aunt. And my mom will then tell me to tell my dad that she already called her. REALLY STUPID. And sometimes they will call me from my room just to do that which pisses me off even more , as if i got nothing better to do like that. No wonder I turned out so weird.

      Woohoo Boy is getting better... I brought him to another vet a week ago after the medication i got from another doctor like a month back didnt work. This vet told me he had seborrhea which is a genetic disease that some shi tzus , snouzers and some other breeds have and its uncurable. But it can be controlled with a jab but it only lasts like 2 months ...So after 2 months I have to bring him back for another jab. But at least now hes really feeling better. He is much active now compared to like a month back and he doesnt smell also.    Sigh I'm sick still have to do housework ....Just hung out like 6 poles of heavy laundry. Now sweating like a pig in a cage on antibiotics..Told my mom I wasn't feeling well but she was like "Dun bluff, just hang the laundry..!" *grumbles*

      Damm Haloscan down again. I didnt go anywhere today got struck by a really bad running nose , basically dripping mucus the whole day. Spend the most of my morning doing the Excel thing from work ....still struggling with it.Have to go down to the library tommorow and borrow a book on it to help me.  I think I am going to put in a shoutbox or something like that so that at least when the comment server is down the 4 of you who read my blog can still comment.

      Spend the whole day doing the Excel thingy for Simon ...I am going to  try and finish it tommorow , now too tired liao.   So might be going to the IT fair at Suntec tommorow ..eventhough I got no cash at all to buy anything thanks to crappy management from a certain govt board. Then there's this local gig featuring various bands from NUS halls at Youth Park from 6 - 9 pm. Thinking of going to that one if can find someone to go with ..anyone interested? *looks pleadingly* . But I got the feeling most of the bands are probably going to sing chinese songs or cover bands like bon jovi  and linkin park *eek* but hopefully there's at least a few decent bands that I will like.

      Just got an email from Simon asking me to convert this HTML document to Excel ...shit I dun know crap abt Excel. Stress Stress!! Seriously I am getting a little frustrated right now. I mean the tasks that I am doing now aren't really playing to my strengths. For me I want something that is at least a little challenging that involves me using my brain (like programming or learning a new application or technology) .  I wanted to work on the PHP portal but a colleague of mine got that job. I wanted to work on Build-IT which is something like Visual Basic for Java ( a drag and drop application) but couldnt cos it needed Windows (which the lab dun have) and I didnt have a laptop. I wouldn't even mind doing research on JXTA which is a new technology that is being used to create P2P apps and games and stuff like that (but another colleague is doing that) . So I am stuck with searching the internet for bioinformatics applications. Its really frustrating cos first of all some of the apps cant be installed on Solaris ...and then those apps that can be installed have such crappy documentation that I basically have to like figure out how to run them by myself , and its all run by command line ( by typing commands like in DOS). My progress is painfully slow and I really feel extremely unproductive compared to my other colleagues. Sigh really hope I either have a change of heart or get assigned something new really soon.

      I would kill for a bathtub now. If I had one I would be lying in it now having a nice bubble bath right now cos I really feel so damm tired right now. Probably be soaking in it until 10 pm.  (cos Charmed starts at 10 mah) Got a huge shiny pimple right above my right side of my lip. It is so annoying ..gonna burst it later.  I have such a huge fetish for gals who speak languages that I dun understand. On the way back on the bus from NTU I was sitting beside this gal who was like talking to Swedish or Icelandic or something to her guy friend and it sounded so freaking sexy that I was totally turned on. Dun ask me why I like that. Hey maybe she was saying how hot the indian guy sitting beside her was, who knows right ?    Read in today's newspaper that studies show that hugs can help greatly reduce stress in people. So any gal reading this, if you are really stressed please dun hesitate to call me anytime anyday if you need a hug cos I am just that kind of really caring guy. But if there is more than 1 gal , the gal with skimpier clothing will get higher priority, just to let you know. ;)   Alright off to have my dinner now , bread with fish curry ...I swear my dogs eat better meals than me.

      Heh so they just passed a law barring cyclists from using footpaths where pedestrians walk on , after people complained in the Strait Times forum about being injured by cyclists who banged into them. Mark my words, once a cyclist gets knocked down by a vehicle on the road they will reverse the ruling.   The Zoo has postponed its 500,000 dollar plan to change its name, logos and image. Which is a waste cos we all know that when people decide whether or not to go to a zoo, the logo and zoo name are the most important factors in their decision and not the quality of the facilities/service/enclosures there.  My day was frustrating, another day of research and I didnt find anything that I was looking for.   Oh ya BLUE is coming to town for a concert , think a lot of gals I know planning to go. Arrrggh wanna say something BAD about them but have to remember that everyone has their own tastes and I should respect them. *fingers itching*   Heh Asha Gil actually smiled during the weakest link next week ! That one must watch!

      Watched the preview of Miss Singapore Universe last night; ok this might be a bit MCP-ish but I got no idea how most of the gals there even got shortlisted! Hell I got gal friends who look better than most of the final 20. And this malay chick who was one of the prettier ones didn't even make it to the top 20! Hmm I wonder if color is part of the judging criteria.   I woke up today with a horrible stomach upset; you know the type that gets you all naseous and break out in goose pimples. Took two long trips to the toilet in the morning and basically felt like crap the whole day. Sigh I knew i ate too much at the wedding...

      Crap i was having another really nice dream today but my cousin woke me up by calling my handphone. When we finished talking I remembered that i was having a dream but as hard as I tried I couldnt recall it. Just know that there was a lot of people in it.  *Burp*   Just came back from lunch from my malay neighbour's wedding at the void deck of my block. We had briyani , satay , fried chicken and red bean soup for dessert. The food was great and I am full as hell. Think I am gonna take a short nap now.  Stuff to do today:  1. Email 2 friends. 2. Send the two letters to Mindef which i got way back in Jan. 3. Email superior with report.

      I feel so tired right now. The whole time I was at the office today all i was looking forward to was for the clock to strike 6 pm so I could go back home and enjoy my weekend. I spend the day looking for an IRC type chat window for the web portal that we use.  Simon asked me to set up a 'dashboard' so that he could monitor my progress.....Can anyone tell me what a dashboard is cos I dun wanna ask him leh so paiseh!

      Took a break at work and went to  urlLink Mr. Brown . This guy is so funny, such a pity he has stop updating his website for almost a year already.  A sample:  ".... when you can convince a nation to drink purified sewage water, then raising transport costs, increasing GST, and cutting CPF during a recession are a walk in the park."

      Woke up late today , at 8:30, i had to be at work at 9. Had to take a cab which cost me like 20 bucks, and I still haven't been paid yet so had to ask my dad for the money. Speaking of which it could take up to a month for me to be paid which kinda sucks but there is nothing we can do. So can look forward to one more month of asking my parents for money ..sigh.   Read an article in Streats today where a reporter posed as a 15 year old gal on IRC and got numerous sexual advances from various guys, basically showing how dangerous it is on IRC for young teenagers. OK heres the thing , this isn't the first time a reporter did something like this , i can remember Strait Times doing something similar a while back and also New Paper if I'm not wrong. Secondly everyone knows how dangerous it is, but they(the reporters) aren't doing anything about it or even giving suggestions to try tackle the problem, its like the only reason they are covering it is cos its a juicy news story. I seriously think that maybe we should start educating teenagers and kids in primary and secondary schools about the dangers in IRC and online chatting in general and meeting strangers from the net because lets face it , most kids are naive at that age (I know I was) and at the same time are really curious also. Just my two cents worth.

      Oh ya totally forgot had another vivid dream yesterday. The most vivid one I had since the one i had in December last year, that one was about me banging a net friend i never met. Eh hello it was a dream ok not like I could control it or anything!   *Start of Dream* My cousin lost his job and I got him a job at my place. Then one of my colleagues had this huge problem with him and after that he was forced to quit. Then I and him were at my another cousin's house..and my sister and her friends were like mass dancing to this tamil song so we both went into the bedroom. And there he was like thanking me for recommending the jobstreet.com website to him cos he found like several suitable jobs there. Then he handed me a book abt Solaris (Sun's Operating System) to thank me. *End of Dream*   Talk about a totally geeky dream. Sigh..well dreams never make sense anyway.

      Went to see  urlLink 'The Pianist'  yesterday night with a friend at Tampines Mall and also had dinner at BK; so much for my plan to lose weight. The Pianist was a really good movie about the experiences of a famous Jewish pianist during the holocaust and its really amazing what the guy went through and what he did just to survive it eventhough he had a good deal of luck as well. Honestly, I think if I was in his situation I would have probably lost my mind. Gonna download Schindler's List and watch during the weekend.   Got a whole list of tasks given to me at work today and I'm feeling a little stressed. I have to go read up and learn abt Sun Grid Engine, Open Grid Services Architecture, Message Passing Interface and J2EE. And no I have no experience with any of them except for J2EE so thats why a bit kanchong. Gotta really up the tempo starting tommorow.

      Oh ya for those who don't know I'm doing research in Grid Computing.  "Grid Computing basically means that you share resources across a network of computers and make it virtually seem like just 1 machine. The method you use to do this, can differ but in many cases (like SGE, LSF and PBS) would be batch-processing. By having a whole big number of jobs and dispatching it to a large grid, you are able to reduce the time required to do this work. [For example] analysis of data (like protein alignments, dna structures, etc). If you have one large dataset of 100 megabytes and it requires at least 6 hours to process 10kb of it (quite feasible for protein alignment), you can estimate how long it will take to process the full 100 megabytes. When your application submits jobs with each a small piece of the dataset and then submit it to a large grid, it will once again reduce the required time substantially." - my superior

      I was getting ready to go out today cos i was meeting a friend to pass her some software. Then had this conversation with my dad. Dad: You going to Theresa's (my sis) place is it ?  Me: No I'm just going out. Dad: You going to work is it ? Me :Noooo. I'm just GOING OUT.  Sigh its kinda sad when you go out so rarely that when you DO go out, your parents immediately assume you are going to visit your sis or going to work.  God I really need a life.   Damm Man U lost; I switched off the TV after Owen scored the 2nd goal making it 2-0 in the 87th(?) minute. Can't believe we lost to such a crappy team like Liverpool. Damm Veron flopped once again arrgggh I'm so pissed rite now.

      Made a few changes to my blog; mainly the part about my fav authors and stuff like that ...sigh the things people do when they are bored. Been thinking of the stuff that I am going to buy with my 1st paycheck.  CDs : 1. The Last Broadcast by Doves 2. Audioslave by Audioslave 3. Riot Act by Pearl Jam  Other Stuff: 1. Digital Camera (cheapo one ard 300 bucks ) 2. Those 3 in 1 printer/scanner/fax thingys. (400 bucks?)  3. Clothes for work 4. Guitar Lessons at Yamaha every weekend.  5. A Car 6. Powerpuff T-shirt and couple more shoes  Hmm probably not gonna have enuff to buy everything there (think i might have to postpone the car ) but we will see how. Show me the money EDB !!

      I lost 1.2 k in a matter of hours. First paid my overdue Starhub internet bill which was around 200 dollars. Then transferred 1k to my mom's account. No trust me I am not filial or anything, my mom made me sign a legally binding document as soon as I turned 18 which states that I have to give her a 1/4 of my salary every month. But she was kind enough to add a clause that allows me to pay only 5 percent in the unlikely event that I suffer loss of any of my limbs or am declared clinically insane. Sniff... there is nothing purer than a mother's love is there ? I love you Mom !  Just to clarify I got paid 2 months salary hor. Heh 4k a month? I wish !!

So happy now that I can feel an orgasm coming on! *shudders in ecstacy*  Oh yeah and got my name cards too , 2 boxes full. Time to hit the clubs and pubs and start networking with the chicks out there. Oh but first gotta get some new clothes to replace all my old clothes that have mysteriously shrunk. But once I do that, there will be no resisting me so all the boyfriends out there better watch out. Cos there is a new Stallion in town.  Ok orgasm over back to work. Sianz.

      Saw the lamest ad ever on Channel 5 just now.  A young gal and her mom were at McDonalds ..and the mom ordered happy meals for both her and her kid. And the kid looked at her and asked why she ordered happy meals. And the mom replied "Because you make me happy"  God can't believe they pay people to come up with crap like that.

      Woohoo the Arses blew 2-0 drew against Bolton so now Man Utd are 2 points ahead of them with the same number of games played. Well the referee tried his best to help the Arses by sending a Bolton defender off on the 90th minute and then added 6(!) minutes of extra time; I can't even recall the last match that had injury time that long!  A really surprising twist on last Friday's survivor, Rob broke with his alliance of 4 and voted for Alex, after Alex told him straight out  that he will probably be the first from the alliance to be voted out.(really dumb of him).   I found out yesterday that someone might have said something about me that wasn't true, and I have no idea why that person said it. It is really bothering me. Think I am gonna confront the person really soon and find out if its true.

      Was hoping I would be able to wake up really late today cos I got so little sleep the night before but no such luck, they are doing some upgrading to my estate and at 9 am they started drilling and it was so freaking loud I couldn't sleep. And I am on the 8th floor. Really pity those who live on the first few floors. With our advances in technology you would think they would have figured out how to make those damm drills quieter, i mean they did figure out how to make guns quieter didnt they.  Checked out a few songs from the White Stripes's new album, Elephant, and they sound really amazing I'm definitely gonna get the album as soon as I get my pay!  OK I think I better go do the laundry now and wash the dishes.

      The last few days were really awful for me. Well let's see first there was my insane dad who really overestimated my dog's navigational skills. Then last night I got a pretty nasty email from big boss asking me if the really urgent task that he assigned me 2 days earlier had "fallen into a black hole". But the thing is I did reply to him regarding that task but he said he didn't receive it. Anyway I called him up at like midnight today and found out what he wanted me to do, and then was doing it until 4 am today. Then when I was gonna send him what I did through email, I found that he emailed me telling me I had until Monday to do it. Sigh really wished he had called me to tell me that !! But a colleague of mine helped me do a huge part of the task last night until 3 am; I was pleasantly surprised and not to mention really grateful cos if she didn't help me I would probably be up the whole morning doing it. So babe dun know if u gonna read this but thanks a lot alright, you have no idea how much i appreciated it!  That's not the end. Today I went to Sun main office at Central Mall for training, and when I checked my Sun email there was this email for this guy asking me why i used the email alias that he had been using for the last 5 years and why I never did anything eventhough I was receiving mail that was obviously not addressed to me. I replied that I didnt notice cos I dun use my Sun mail for work purposes so dun check it often..and then spend the whole morning looking at close to 90 email messages that I got and forwarding to him those that belonged to him. But really the damm system should have stopped me from using a email address that was really taken rite!   And then I found out that all my colleagues had gotten their pay! But when I checked mine it wasnt there, I still had only 10 freaking dollars in my POSB account. Was really disappointed lor cos I been looking forward to getting my pay for like 2 months already, Ab called the HR department for me, my bank account number was correct so I really got no idea why I was the only one who didnt get paid. Hopefully they sort it out by Monday and give me my money !

      My dad lost Boy. He was staying at this place in Woodlands for the past week and he just let Boy roam around the bloody housing estate on his own and expected him to find his way back to the flat my himself. Yeah thats my dad for ya. He does this kinda stuff all the time here (eventhough i hate it everytime he does that) but I never expected him to be dumb enough to do it in a place that Boy is totally unfamiliar with, I got no idea where his fucking brains went to. He came back like an hour ago and was telling us how some kid at the school nearby told him that a guy caught Boy and took him to the police post nearby, and how my dad went to the police post and they told him that he was taken away to the pound (SPCA?).   Just called my sis and she is gonna call some guy (the number was given by the police post) abt Boy first thing tommorow morning. I pray we will get him back.

      C showed me something really freaky with regards to my blog, check this out  urlLink http://indianstallion.blogpsot.com . No its not my blog url (the p and s are switched in the word 'blogspot'), it is some religious website. And its true for any web address that ends with blogpsot.com, its forwarded to that page. I think its illegal though i remember yahoo suing pple who had domain names such as yahhoo.com and stuff.   I got a 5 minute presentation to give tommorow and I got no idea what to say. My chosen topic was Indian weddings (dun ask me why i chose it) , and I think im just gonna get some screenshots of my sister's wedding and burn them into a cd and just talk abt each one of them briefly thats abt it.

      As expected I had a stomachache in the morning when i woke up no surprise there, it always happens when i take really spicy food but it was well worth it. I woke up several times last night ...had this recurring dream abt , strangely enough, the 2 net friends i met last Saturday. No nothing erotic, just that 1 of them kept asking me a question repeatedly, but what the question was I can't remember now. Weird.   Just had another helping of ayam masak merah for dinner today (again!) and then followed it up with a glass of eno, hopefully that helps to like neutralise the spiceness or something.  Followed Ab to install Sun Grid Engine in another lab in NTU...we met up the guy in charge of that lab for lunch and we started debating about religion (Ab is in process of converting to Islam) and well ...lets just say religion is a really sensitive and not to mention subjective topic which is why usually i try and avoid discussing it with people cos most of the time someone might take offence. But it was really cool today though cos despite the fact the 3 of us had really conflicting views with regards to our own religions (or lack of religion in my case) we still respected each other's opinions and views eventhough we disagreed with them. Anyway it was a really interesting discussion in my opinion, sometimes its really nice to discuss a topic that u tend to be really passionate about.

      Man I am so freaking stuffed rite now. My mom cooked ayam masak merah today cos my sis and her hubby came over to visit. And that is my fav dish in the whole world cos its mouthwateringly delicious. Its like chicken sambal but the gravy isnt as thick as sambal and its much sweeter and pretty spicy. It was so good that I licked the gravy off my plate! But got a feeling my stomach is gonna suffer from my greed tommorow. Watch this blog tommorow to find out.

      Man I got a really bad headache now. Met a couple of net friends (and a guy) for pool at this place in orchard. It was my 2nd time playing it ever but I totally loved it, partly cos I beat one of them the very first time....(ok she probably let me). Got trashed like crazy the next 4 games but well it was still really fun I wanna play somemore !   After that we went to a pub and chilled out and talked for a while , the music totally sucked they were playing ah beng techno music, you know like techno remixes of famous pop songs, i started to get a pretty bad headache there. After that we went to this Turkish restaurant where they had like this thing called sashmi which i reckon is like some type of drug thingy that u smoke but came with like different flavors and stuff ...i tried it but it was pretty strong the smell and made my headache even worse so i stopped.  All in all it was pretty nice, esp the pool part ....i wanna shoot again ! Oh wait I said that already...  Oh ya while I was waiting at the MRT station waiting for one of them to arrive, there was this pretty eurasian gal who was like trying to get pple to do her surveys but most of them just passed her by. So being the kind selfless handsome guy that I am I went close to her lah and smiled at her but she totally ignored me! Then I tried circling around her like a few times but she didn't even stop me to ask me to do the survey ....in fact she went over to another part of the station....sometimes it doesn't pay to be kind I tell ya.  Oh and i gave up my seat to a little gal in the MRT yesterday! Mommy was so proud of me when I told her.  Just found out its called sheesha not sashmi..I'm an idiot ! and its a type of tobacco!

      My day yesterday 10 am : Woke up, read the paper, had 4 pieces of toast 10:55 : Came online, chatted with a net friend. 13:00 : Took shower, had lunch. 14:30 : Chatted with another net friend. 18:00 : Not feeling so good so took a 2 hour nap, woke up, showered and had dinner. 20:00 : Chatted with net friend and my jc friend. 22:00 : Watched Survivor ( I think I am in love with Heidi, shes a hottie!)  23:00 : Chatted with 4 net friends. 02:00 : Went to bed   Hmm I might possibly be addicted to ICQ, well at least thats what my colleague suggests. But honestly I dun think so cos I dun use ICQ at work at all eventhough I could if I wanted to. So I think its more of a lack of a social life rather than an addiction. :(  But going to shoot pool later with 2 ...err...net friends. And I am gonna suck really badly cos I only played pool like once in my life. Why don't they have carrom in those places, I am really good at that, I was my kindergarden champion ok dun play play!

      Sigh I am down with a pretty bad cold. You know I think I am allergic to soemthing cos everytime im at home every weekend 9/10 times i get a runny nose and fell like crap. Wished I knew what it was. Hopefully I willl be way better tommorow. I need a hug...*looks out to his blog visitors with tears in his eyes*   Met 8 of my JC classmates for dinner/supper yesterday, it was pretty cool to see all of them again after such a long while but sigh one of my friends said that I had put on a lot of mass around the waist area, man I really need to start working out but sigh so damm lazy! We then went to Swensens at the airport t1, I had grilled chicken which was ok,nothing great and then shared an Earthquake (huge dish of ice cream) with some of them, it was really sinful though.  But I was a little pissed at one of them while we having dinner. He started telling my friends something that I told him in private which kinda sucked cos it wasn't something that I really wanted to share with the other friends and I was embarassed by what he said. Sigh well thats guys for you, anyway thats the last time I am gonna tell him something personal.   Oh Buffy is back ! But at the totally crappy timeslot of 12 am on tuesday. After Bachelor and the new series Birds of Prey. Bachelor is really lame rite now and I wasnt too impressed by the premiere of BoP. Arrgh i hate damm TCS. I probably have to like download the Buffy episodes from Kazaa.

      I read this at a Islamic website which was highlighting reasons why they don't eat pork.  "The pig is the most shameless animal on the face of the earth. It is the only animal that invites its friends to have sex with its mate. It feels no jealousy. And among people who consume pork, the practice of wife swapping and other forms of promiscuous behaviour is common. "  Yeah you know now I think of it, after i eat pork , sometimes i am like really tempted to call up my friends and have an orgy.

      We had a meeting today ...and we have to do 5 minute presentations next wednesday to show our presentation skills and also to correct our mistakes cos appie told us we would be doing a lot of presentations in the future. So he was asking each of us what we wanted to present, it could be absolutely anything we wanted, but when it came to my turn i dun know i couldnt really think of any. Anyway i finally just said I would do a presentation on indian weddings ...and the minute that came out of my mouth I was like why the hell did I choose such a lame ass topic, I hate Indian weddings and I think I been to like 5 in my entire life. Hopefully I can think of something to talk abt by tommorow maybe ask him to change..but my mind is still a blur.   Appie was telling us how he met his gf (she's sporean) on IRC while he was still in Holland. And how that the first time he heard her voice on the phone he knew that she was the one ....he came here to visit her in 99 and they just clicked and now they are gonna get married in a couple of months. Pretty amazing eh?  I already know quite a fair number of friends who met their bf/gf through the net as well ......dun know if that will happen to me ...but i doubt so though.   I think I might give IRC another shot ....who knows i might meet like a pair of hot Swedish twins on some irc channel and we fall hopelessly in love with each other...hey it could happen alright! And if it does happen I can safely say I will be the happiest man on earth!

      Been all alone at home since Sunday evening, cos my folks went over to my sister's place at Woodlands , its the indian new year. But quite shiok lah having the whole house to myself, can do stuff around the house that you can't do with anyone around, you know like walk around naked and ....err thats abt it but still fun lah. If I had a digital camera I would take pictures of myself and post it up here for you gals to see  but unfortunately I don't. Nevermind not long until I get my pay so just hang in there.   Went to the library on Sunday afternoon also to return my way way overdue books and borrowed 2 others, 'Learning the vi editor' for work and 'A whore just like the rest'  by Richard Meltzer a rock critic. Not a lot of good books on rock music at Bedok library. There were tons of them on the Beatles which is ok but  i mean come on, how about Led Zeppelin ?? And then even had a book on Bon Jovi ...bleah  Hmm Appie said that there might be a chance that we might be able to work from home in the near future. Actually he used to work mostly from home before we came but now he has to supervise us as well. But now that we are more or less comfortable with our work, there might be a possibility that we get that chance (to work from home) maybe like one or two days a week. Well if that becomes a reality Im telling you it would be so damm cool. Cos the travelling really takes so much out of me sometimes. Just gotta wait and see.

      Was watching this local kiddie show called 'Champs' on Central cos a friend of mine was going to be in it. Well the show was really lame, I tell ya it was basically promoting volunteerism to kids. And they really went to the extreme to do that. One scene had 2 kids selling flags at the MRT station; one kid was saying how much he loved doing it while the other agreed and said selling flags really helps build up his confidence. Kid, if selling flags can build up your confidence, then you got more problems than a lack of confidence I tell ya! Oh and another scene showed a group of kids volunteering to clean up the school garden and pond ....then when they finished doing it they all hi-fived each other and cheered......Riiiiiiigggghhhht  Anyway my friend had 2 lines .."what is your idea" and "that's a good idea"..... but its pretty cool seeing a friend on tv though, you go gal!

      Met Jiaqi, the birthday gal and Sabrina for lunch at Sizzler at Suntec City and the food kinda sucked, I had like teriyaki ground beef steak with cheese on top, wouldn't really recommend it. But the soup and salad buffet was pretty good and really filling, and also had ice cream ...by the end of it I was really full ..oh ya and finally had the bday cake , mango fruit cake ! Anyway I am skipping dinner now, must watch my figure you know it doesnt just maintain itself! Speaking of figure when I came back i realised that my jeans was torn at the back of my waist, damm giordano I should sue them, now i only have 1 pair of jeans left. And I dun get my pay for another 2 weeks!  Anyway it was really cool catching up with the two of them and talking and stuff, I haven't done that like in a while. Oh and huge thanks to Jiaqi for lending me the LOTR book, i owe you one babe !   Heh Man Utd is leading Newcastle 6-1 with 30 minutes left to go...Yeah you heard me right. I tell you this is the best I seen them play in a long long time, they were such a joy to watch, they totally walked all over Newcastle, who are supposed to be challenging for the title as well. They gonna play Arse (nal) next week, I think after this kind of display, any Arse fan (I call them arses) will probably be really nervous about that match!  Well im sorry Arses but come next week you gonna get your asses kicked woohoo!

      Yes finally the weekend is here ! Was a pretty short day we had training again at Sun main office at Central Mall, but after that I met the boyfriend of a net friend of mine for coffee (for the first time ever)cos he works in the same building as well. He;s probably the first guy I met off the net and most likely he will be the last also. No it wasn't as weird as it sounds. But not gonna say anything more about that.  Oh yeah bought the birthday gift for my friend whom I'm gonna meet tommorow ; I offered her a free ride on the stallion (aka me) instead but she politely declined, think she was probably too shy lah that poor gal, I'm sure she was tempted. She's 23 now ...sigh I can still remember holding her in my arms when she was a little baby, kids grow up so fast nowdays dun they ....sniff...   Oh yeah had to do a lot of whining,crying and begging just now to my mom to give me 50 dollars for tommorow cos I am totally broke now. Yeah let me assure you the sight of a 24 year old man in tears begging his mom for money isn't something anyone wants to see. What to do when it comes to my family we believe in tough love, gotta earn everything we get. I can still remember that since I was a year old I had to go to the provision shop to get my own diapers and milk powder, thats how independent we had to be.Kids nowdays got it easy man!   When i was in the MRT today and the train reached Boon Lay MRT which is the last train station, there was this gal who was still sleeping but the gal beside her didnt even bother to wake her up, she just got up and left so I woke her up by tapping her on the shoulder. Isn't that like the decent thing to do, I mean if it was me I would also want someone to wake me up if I overslept. However, some friends I asked later said that they probably wouldn't also which I found pretty weird. Oh well.   Oh ya a net friend pointed out that all the blogs I link to save one are gals. I didn't even notice that. Interesting.

      Today was such a good day. Went to Sun Office for Solaris 9 administrator training from 10 to 12, and after that had lunch at Marche's(sp?) at suntec city, Sun paid for us which I thought was really cool of them. I ate like nobodys bizness, had sirloin steak with baked potato on the side, pizza and crepe with banana, strawberries and ice cream. Damm wished I could have ate more but I was way too full after that. Eh wat still haven't get my pay so this kinda thing must take advantage rite ! Anyway the bill came up to like 360 bucks for like 12 of us and that was like after a 60 dollar discount somemore. Hope we do this again soon!   After that we got to go back straight home (provided we work from home), i got back like 3:30 and napped like a pig until 7 ...now gonna do some work or else I'm gonna feel a little guilty.

      Nothing much happened today. I was supposed to get this task that I was looking forward to, involving software that does 2D cartoon animation but we have too many tasks right now so we had to put it aside for now. Oh I am gonna get my namecards (a whole box of it like 100) and this special card that will allow me access to the computers and phones in the Sun's main office this friday so thats pretty cool especially the namecard cos its gonna say "Gilbert Thomas, Associate Engineer, Grid Computing, Asia Pacific Science and Technology Center". How sounds impressive or not? First thing I am gonna do once I get the card is find that gal who ignored me that day when I was flexing my biceps and give it to her. Now I think of it I was being an MCP when I said shes probably a lesbian that time.  But if she ignores me again then well shes definitely ....err not straight.   Got another training by Sam at Sun main office tommorow morning, looking forward to it, a welcome break from work and he's such a cool guy. And also get to wake up an hour late so thats always a plus!   Meeting up with a group of friends on Saturday to celebrate the bday of one of them. I think this is like the first time I will be going out anywhere in a month other than work which is kinda sad. But gotta ask Mommy for money cos I still haven't gotten paid, but they told me I will get paid on the 24th or 25th of the month so keeping my fingers crossed.

      Arrgh I am an evil man! Supposed to call a friend to wish her happy birthday at midnight today but I totally forgot! Damm gonna call her at lunchtime and wish her.  A net friend told me that this Sporean guy whom she chatted with like 4 times in like 4 months ON ICQ is now telling her that he is totally in love with her and desperately wants to meet her. When she, and rather wisely i might add, said no, he said stuff like that he will always love her and the ball is in her court and crazy stuff like that.There are some really really weird people on the net aren't they.   Ok ok I can relate a little, i thought I was in love with a gal that I went out with like 3 times last year also but thats something totally different alright, she was hot as hell so all the blood from my brain went down to my penis (and its a lot of blood I tell ya) hence causing me to be temporarily insane. Anyway it wasn't as bad as it sounds also, I did get her to drop the restraining order within a week and she no longer has this look of fear in her eyes when we meet. Anyway I digress, that guy is really weird isn't he?

      Eek I got Simon-phobia now. Everytime I see him I get damm nervous cos he arrows me all the time for tasks! My colleagues are even starting to make fun of me, saying I am his pet and stuff like that. He is a nice guy but he just makes me nervous leh and I feel really uncomfortable around him . Hope this feeling doesn't last long.  Alright I just watched Friends and Scrubs just now and was too tired to laugh even. Gonna go to bed now....eh wait maybe surf some porn first.

      Fed and took the dogs for a walk, cos my folks went to 2 weddings today. I hate indian weddings, they are usually incredibly long-winded and really really boring, can stretch up to 3 hours. I mean would you want to sit in a chair for 2 hours plus and listen to a priest chanting non-stop in a language that you don't really understand. I didn't think so! So I lied and told them that I had work to do which was true, but I ended up not doing it...hmm that still constitutes a lie right?    Anyway when I brought my dogs down I wore a singlet to show off my recently enlarged biceps ( thanks to all the walks I been going for) and I saw this quite cute looking chick at the void deck waiting for someone. So I walked in front of her and at the same time discreetly flexed my (recently enlarged) biceps. She looked at me for like a sec then looked away. That's all. Sigh well its pretty obvious isn't it? She must be a lesbian!  Gonna need to think of something to say later for the meeting tommorow. Simon is going to be there so it's gonna be more serious than the usual meetings.. Stress !!!

      Read about this survey that showed that gay men had much longer penises compared to their straight counterparts. Sigh well we all know what this means. Yes ladies its sad but true, I must be gay. Really really gay.     Karl Urban: you like them tall, dark, sexy and fun.    urlLink   Which guy are you destined to have sex with?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I don't even know who that is! But I guess I wouldnt mind having sex with him, he seems kinda cute....

      I absolutely hate seafood. Any kind of seafood. Fish, crabs, prawns you name it I hate it. I hate fish cos I hate the horrible feeling you get when u swallow a fishbone by mistake, and it happens way too many times for my liking. I hate crabs cos they scare the shit out of me with their black beady eyes and extra large pincers. I am telling you those things are evil , I can feel my hair stand everytime i pass a tank with crabs in it, can practically feel those eyes following my every step. If my family was attacked by a horde of crabs one day i will probably just scream and run away, thats how much I fear them. Prawns dun bother me that much , unless it is those big prawns then same thing I dun touch them.  Despite this, what did my mom cook today? Prawn curry, fish sambal and fried fish. I skipped lunch but i had to have dinner cos being a growing boy I need food mah. So I had rice with the vegetables and sambal without the fish. And ice cream. Burp

      So I went for a grid seminar at NUS today, pretty boring stuff actually but the food was really good , free refreshments and lunch provided! Actually we left the seminar earlier cos we had training at Sun office at 1 pm, but the lady who organised the whole event persuaded us to have lunch first and told the caterers to start serving so we could eat which was really cool of her. Just hope people didnt think we came out of the auditorium just so that we could eat first ! Oh ya also got free pen woohoo, cos I was thinking of buying but now no need.  The training was really good cos Sam, the presenter, is a really wacky guy! I laughed quite a few times while he was explaining to us the exciting new features of Solaris 10 which will only be out next year, he keeps cracking jokes and he has this really infectious laugh that totally cracks me up each time. Definitely a very fun guy to be around, looking forward to next week's training. But he wore a cowboy hat when he left the office that was a little ...unusual.  Yay finally got my Sun badge, with a photo of my face on it. So now I can like join Sun seminars and enter the Sun office whenever I want. But I look like crap in the photo which kinda sucks, but then again I look like crap in real life so can't really complain can I.  Read this at a blog:  "He washes my hair almost all the time, he likes to do it - and he's better than the hair-wash people at salons. Whenever I have backaches, he'll massage me. He stays up with me when I work, and soothes me to sleep when I'm fretting. And the best thing is, he's always trying to communicate his thoughts, feelings and his love, and working towards being a better person."  What an amazing guy, that made me feel so envious of her ! (No i am not gay)

      Heh me and a colleague just got a pretty big animation project to do , its like a 3 month kinda thingy. I'm kinda glad I have this actually because for one it involves Java (woohoo!)  and secondly it sounds it involves way less research and more hands on work. But its gonna be pretty tough from the look of it but at least it will be challenging thats whats gonna do it for me.  I will be going down to NUS tommorow in the morning to some LT in Biz Ad cos we have a Sun Microsystems seminar thingy there, and in the afternoon we will be rushing to the office for training. Also gonna be appying for our Sun badges at the same time.  Not sure what I am gonna be doing this weekend. I am pretty sure I killed all the ticks on my dogs already.

      I think I am in love with Anindita, the hot Indian lawyer babe from the Bachelor.  She's like a totally feisty chick who isnt scared to speak her mind, what more could you ask for in a woman !  She told Christi off when she talked bad about another woman behind her back.  Even better was when she walked out on the Bachelor before he made his decision to pick the final 10.  That took balls!  And the American-Chinese gal followed her shortly afterwards.  She said in an interview that it was because earlier she and the american chinese gal asked him what his parents thought about interracial marriages and he didnt give a satisfactory answer.  Sigh if I was the Bachelor I would have proposed to her there and then and ask the rest to go back.   Oh yeah Christi seems a little insane.  And Aaron was dumb to have picked her.  She was like winking and giving him one kind of weird look while he was handing out roses, so obvious she was hinting, actually more like pressurising him to pick her. And when the number of roses grew less and less she was close to tears.  And the part when the credits were rolling and she was like telling another gal how much she loved Aaron (repeatedly) , that was just creepy!  In the trailer for next week Aaron was mentioning that she had 'a Fatal Attraction thing going on there' which was kinda mean but pretty funny!  And its obvious the producers were milking the psycho woman angle for all its worth (she got way way more screen time than the rest), so gotta pity her a little.

      *start of slightly dramatised incident that happened to me earlier* As I was walking back from bedok interchange to chai chee today, I came upon this kid who was struggling to get his skate scooter up a flight of stairs, and all his other skater friends were already way ahead of him. I snatched the scooter from him and carried it effortlessly up the flight of stairs. (thanks to my enlarged biceps)   He looked at me with tears of gratitude in his eyes and said "Thank you, strong and unbelievably handsome uncle. Don't know what I would have done without you." I gave a hearty laugh and replied "Nah dun worry little weak one, one day you will be as strong as me, even if you probably won't be as handsome. Now run along and catch up to your friends. And don't tell anyone about what I did for you ok!" The kid nodded, wiped away his tears and rode away on his little scooter.  *end of slightly dramatised incident*  Feels good to have done such a selfless act of kindness. Can't believe a guy like me can still single. Yes ladies if you didn't catch that I am totally available !   Not a good day today. I had a really bad stomach upset in the morning and was totally full of gas, in fact I could even feel the gas being produced in my large intestine as I was doing my work. It was really uncomfortable I tell ya, felt like ...errr...a guy pumped full of gas. Anyway feeling better now thank god.  Had this training/presentation by this guy from Sun Microsystems on Sun hardware for around an hour and a half and I was really struggling to stay awake the whole time. It was like an hour after lunch and the topic wasnt really interesting. Anyway I think he must have noticed cos there were only like 10 of us only. Kinda embarassing.  Eek I think I feel more gas producing rite now!

      Today in Fear Factor, 4 gals dived into a tank with crocodiles. It almost seemed too crazy to be true. I have to admit that I probably wouldn't have the balls to do it, so gotta give those gals due respect. But a guy won the 100k though but it wasn't really fair cos the final challenge was a rather physical one.  Walked home from Bedok Interchange to Chai Chee instead of taking the bus today. It wasn't that long a walk around 15 minutes but it was pretty good workout (hey im not in the fittest state right now) and I think I can almost feel my biceps growing so it's all good. Gonna do it again tommorow.  I'm ahead, I'm a man I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah I'm at peace with my lust I can kill 'cause in God I trust, yeah It's evolution, baby  Do The Evolution by Pearl Jam

      There has been a lot of uproar in Singapore recently over the AVA (forgot what it means) culling stray cats.  And yes i think it is sad and unneccessary because its obviously an overreaction to the whole Sars thing, even if they deny it.   But I don't know, for me the problem wouldn't have come about in the first place if we didn't have irresponsible people who actually let their dogs and cats out on the streets when they didn't want them anymore or found them to hard to handle. For me thats no worse than what AVA is doing. But we don't see people voicing out strong opinions regarding irresponsible pet owners or petitioning for laws to try and stop people from abandoning their pets. I wonder why that is so.

      Had a pretty nice time with my colleagues yesterday; we went to this place called Peace Centre near Plaza Singapura to have dinner at McDonalds and then shoot pool. I totally sucked at pool, I mean I was really god-awful, a blind guy could have probably beat me; nearing the end I almost felt like bursting into tears, but there were too many gals around so I kept my cool and hide my tears.   After that we went to Boat Quay to go get a drink, there were quite a number of pubs there that had live jazz bands playing that I really wanted to check out cos they sounded pretty good but didn't think my colleagues were interested. Anyway we ended up at Breworkz(sp?) at Clarke Quay and I had a couple of beers (around 3 glasses) and some of my friend's red wine. It was quite cool we talked and stuff for quite a while ...although most of the stuff turned out to be work-related, not about work but more about the people we worked with. I guess other than work we don't really have THAT much in common. At the end, I was kinda feeling it already in my head!  After that we went to this prata place nearby, it was kinda gross 2 of my colleagues found hair in their prata ..one of them found 2 ! There was probably some on my plate also but I ate too fast to notice. And then we all left for home around 2:30 am.  I am pretty glad that I work in a place where I can get along with my colleagues that well; I have heard from more than one of my friends in the IT line about the places where they work; their colleagues don't even acknowledge each other when they come into work in the morning or when they leave at home. And I don't know I can't imagine myself in a workplace like that, becos my social life is practically non-existent outside work, so if it was the same at work then I probably would go crazy or get depressed or something.

      Had a pretty bad dream last night. I dreamt that my mom had a heart attack and passed away; and I was really busy arranging the funeral. And it felt so real that when I woke up , just for a split sec i was wondering whether it was real. Talk about a really disturbing dream.  If anyone here is looking for some guy to con I recommend my dad. He just bought a Rolex watch off someone and then now is spending 400 bucks to fix it. And recently he spend another 200 dollars to fix 2 cable points in our house; now there are 4 cable points in a house with 3 people living in it. I got a word to describe that but I am not gonna say it.   Just got assigned a pretty huge task today and it is making me kinda nervous. I am doing it with another colleague of mine but I really hope he has some experience with it cos I definitely don't. I got to get the first draft by friday so its all very rush. Stress!

      Yesterday after work I was on my way to meet my sister and her hubby at Heeren for dinner.  And i took a cab because I was already running really late.  And the cab driver was the nicest guy ever, he took a wrong turn at the junction, so he told me he would deduct the fare accordingly.  Anyway we were talking and he was telling me how he just got retrenched from his 2k++ a month job and so had to drive a taxi now for a living.  And he was saying how when he tried looking for a job b4 he drove a taxi he could feel that he was discriminated against cos he was Indian.  And also how he got frustrated by the fact that so many of the jobs wanted the applicants to be Mandarin speaking.   I could really relate to that cos it happened to me as well when I was searching for a job.  And what I hated even more was when people tried to explain it to me that it was because all those companies were dealing with the China market.  For me, thats bullshit.  Even temp admin/sales jobs in the classifieds require chinese speaking.  But really its something you need to experience to really understand how frustrating it is.  Heh I was kinda taken aback when this new IA student who is working with us right now asked me yesterday where i bought my shirt ...and then he asked if I liked cheesecake, really thought he was gonna ask me out to a cafe or something.  I asked why and he told me he was selling cheesecakes as a part time bizness.  Heh lucky i clarified, was gonna tell him that the stallion doesn't swing that way.  Had a great dinner with my sis and her hubby at this thai restaurant on the 6th floor of heeren. The tom yam soup and sweet and sour fish were to die for.  And it was also nice to see her again after quite a while, but we didn't really have time to hang out that long.  I guess thats inevitable when you are both working adults.  Oh I am planning to watch Ju-On soon , it's this Korean horror movie; I saw the trailer when I went to see X-Men, almost  peed my pants I tell ya.  I think there are sneaks this week if I am not wrong.

      For people who watched the Matrix and was confused about the Architect's (I prefer to call him the Babbler) speech, might wanna take a look at  urlLink  this . Don't go there if u planning to watch the movie cos its a huge spoiler !  Lol just saw the new M1 ad....its making fun of Starhub's free incoming calls policy by having this couple trying to get each other to call the other party. But it is quite annoying when people keep messaging you to call them so that they save money, my sis always does that to me !

      Doing my progress report now to submit to *** ...telling me the stuff I learned and was trained in the last 3 months in my company. Super Sian. Listening to Manson's new album while doing it. Liking it more and more as I listen to it. Manson has decided not to take things so seriously this time (Holy Wood, his last album, really sounded tired and overbearing), and it's so obvious you can even see it from the song titles; the first song is "This is the New S**t" for crying out loud. And then there are lyrics like these: "I've got an F and a C and I got a K too, the only thing missing is a bitch like U" - from the song (S)aint You are the church/I am the steeple/When we f*ck we are God's People - from the song Slutgarden  Priceless, simply priceless !

      Hello my pretties ...yes haven't been blogging for a while, been damm lazy lah. Ok anyway I had a great time yesterday at raffles hotel , an IT company was having their 5th anniversary and they invited Ab to go but he went back to Holland to see his family so me and a colleague went instead. The talks were pretty interesting, especially the first one by this really knowledgeable and experienced ( old)  guy who was talking about what new IT companies should and should not do in order to succeed, specifically those that were involved in R & D and product development, and it kinda relates to my company. And the food was pretty excellent too , there was like rendang mutton and salmon and chicken cooked in some kinda of sauce and also some other meat that i wasnt sure was what but just ate cos they all look as delicious as hell. For dessert , i had chocolate cream cake, some caramel thingy, watermelon, more creamy stuff. All in all a very nice lunch.   After that went to shoot pool with my colleague at beach road for around an hour, and then we went to watch Matrix Reloaded, it was a pretty cool movie but I really don't get some parts of it. Have to ask someone about it, probably gonna ask Di; if anyone can explain it to me its her ! Don't wanna mention any of my doubts here cos I am sure theres a lot of pple who havent watched the movie so dun wanna spoil it.  Today I went to Sim Lim Square for the 2nd week in a row, with 3 of my colleagues, i got myself an optical mouse and 10 800Mb CDs ..finally can burn all my 700mb+ movies that are taking up space on my HD. After that went to watch 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 days' with one of them; we had like totally crappy seats on the 2nd row my neck still hurts now from looking up for close to two hours! The movie was better than I expected it to be, plenty of funny moments and then there's Kate Hudson who is like a total hottie. Actually there was one good thing about sitting in the 2nd row - could see her boobs close up !   Anyway the movie is abt her trying to hook a guy and then make him dump her in 10 days or less by being clingy and psycho, its for a magazine article shes writing , about the mistakes women make with guys they like. But at the start of the movie, her friend was like really depressed cos she got dumped by a guy she dated for a week, cos she felt that they really had a connection and she started calling him everyday and telling him that she loved him, u know stuff like that. And that really reminded me of myself; cos I was in that exact same situation with someone last year, only difference was i went out with her 3 times instead of a whole week. Hey give me a break i was only 24 ....was young and naive mah ! Ok I didnt tell her i loved her (although i was really tempted to) or called her that many times but did other stuff which i will not mention here for the sake of preserving my dignity. *Slight spoiler ahead * Anyway at the end of the movie, the guy came back to kate's friend and asked her to take him back ...that's another big difference ...but what you expect, its a romantic comedy, if only real life was like that...sigh

      Big Boss was at Monday's meeting and he was telling us about how we should be more pro-active and voice out our ideas/thoughts even if they are in conflict with his own. And  I guess he is right, but he is quite intimidating especially in his emails so it is kinda scary to do that , but yeah definitely gonna try .  The team in Japan is interested in the project that I am working on, so once it is completed I will have to go to Japan to demo to them, thats pretty exciting rite ! But I have to admit my knowledge of bioinformatics is still very lacking rite now (which my colleague pointed out correctly a few days ago) , so I really need to read up more on it so that I can at least hold my own if I am ever in a conversation with someone well versed in that field.   OH I am going to Raffles Hotel this friday for a presentation thingy by a big company in singapore who specialises in Computer aided graphics , its their 40th anniversary. Ab was supposed to go but becos of his holland trip he can't and he asked me and another colleague to go instead. Think it should be an interesting experience, but I need to get a new pair of pants and shoes cos the attire required is business attire and my pants are more of the casual type. Just bought Manson's new CD but haven't really listened to it that much, heard it on the train on the way to work today but i was half asleep. Will post a review here after I give it a proper listen !

      Ok just finished my work task thingy. I can safely say now that I hate ...no make that despise HTML tables. Took almost 4 hours to finish one html page consisting of 1 table with 140++ rows (1 bioinformatics application per row) and 8 columms. Please god hope big boss doesn't give me something like this to do again. But the funny thing is I dun really feel sleepy now although its like 3:15 am now and I gotta wake up in another 3 hours time. Weird rite.  While i am still awake I have to say I am kinda disappointed that my entries lately have not had a single comment. Ok call it ego , call it a desperate need for validation by my peers(most of whom I never even met b4) but yeah it sucks ! *Starts grovelling at your feet* So please if you see comment(0) under an entry just comment something, anything , you will make a lonely 25 year old virgin boy really happy. OK I know how pathetic it sounds but I dun care !  Hmm I think mommy put something in my food during dinner, dun feel like myself right now.  Speaking of mommy she nagged and nagged for me to give money from my paycheck to my dad eventhough I didn't really want to. Finally yesterday i just couldn't take it anymore and transferred it to my dad. Yeah call me unfilial or whatever but I have my reasons which I will not divulge here (some things still must keep secret mah).

      There should be an extra Online Status in ICQ : "Really Invisible". Because sometimes you wanna be 'Invisible' just because you only wanna talk to certain people and so you put them in your Visible list. But then there are times when you dun wanna talk to anyone at all, this is where 'Really Invisible' comes in. I should bring this up to the ICQ people.   My left button is totally screwed up so I changed the buttons around ...now im using the right button for double-clicking and stuff. It's a real pain in the ass and is slowing me down like crazy, so really stressed now cos I am trying to finish this work thingy!  Update : ICQ thing was dumb , please ignore that.

      Ok need to clarify this with you people. Do any of you find vampire movies sensual? Specifically the part where the male vampire bites the innocent young woman on her bare shoulder near the neck, and the gal seems to like go into orgasm or something as the blood drains from her neck/shoulder? OK cos I do , and when I told a friend about it, he compared to me to his army bunkmate who collects female school uniforms and even sleeps with them in camp. Now thats weird..not to mention creepy.  So just wanna know if anyone else feels the way abt vampire bites as I do!

      Alright my colleague helped me install Redhat 9 on my new HD so now I can finally run some of my bioinformatics programs that I been working on at home instead of having to connect to my work computer. Ok ok you got me thats a lie !! Its mainly for storage of my porn happy ! Geez you people are so judgemental !   Been listening to Pearl Jam's new CD ,  urlLink Riot Act . It's an amazing record definitely their best for a long while, previous album Binaural was a bit of a disappointment so I am really glad that this one turned out as great as it has. Now hope can say the same thing about Manson's new one when it comes out. But I am going nuts over my hi fi ...it keeps skipping like crazy. Maybe its time to get a new one perhaps...

      Went out with a couple of my friends around evening today to Sim Lim. I needed to get an extra HD to install Linux OS and also gonna use it to store my videos, mp3s , porn etc. etc. Got a decent one Western Digital 40 GB for 125 bucks and with 3 years warranty somemore. After that we went to Harvey Norman at Suntec where my friend bought a new laptop. I am really tempted to get one myself but well dun wanna spend that kinda money unless I really need to. Yeah I tend to be kinda 'careful' with my money. maybe cos I never had much of it growing up. I didnt struggle for money or anything of cos, but I didnt really have the money to buy luxuries either. And then there was my sis who was spending enough for the both of us and then some. (She's gonna kill me when she reads this)   But I do remember this one incident when I bought this pair of Reebok high cut sneakers with some kinda jungle pattern in secondary school (hey those were the rage back then alright)  for ard 150 bucks, was so excited about it when i bought them, and when i told my dad about it, he went like "That's too cheap you should have bought something way more expensive" (insert healthy dose of sarcasm here) . Heh the things you remember eh ? :)   Anyway going to my colleague's place in the morning tommorow to get his help in install the Linux on my system. And then gonna work my butt off over the weekend cos big boss is gonna be sitting in on Monday's meeting. Eeek!

      Went to NUS today to bring one of our workstations there t, we are doing a collaboration with one of their departments , and i will have to go there like once a week starting next week to do some stuff. But the freaking monitor was so damm heavy that I think I might have torn my bicep muscle or something, it hurts like hell everytime i press on it.   Can't wait for tommorow cos Thursday is Vesak Day so at least can get to sleep late for once ...but i had two meetings with friends the next few days which got cancelled so that kinda sucks. :(  *Start of dream* I was in Tampines JC which i was from originally and i saw this rather pretty gal walking with her friend. And i was really attracted to her so I used this lame pick up line:asked her if I ever seen her before. She of cos said no and then i asked her for her phone number. She started to give it to me but hesitated and started saying about how she was afraid her bf would find out ...and right on cue her boyfriend came out of nowhere; he looked like one of those Miss Universe types and he started chasing me ! And I just screamed and ran away. Then i dreamt the gal was trying to break into my house at night while I was sleeping and when i opened the door it was the boyfriend instead ...and it ended like that ..thank god. *End of Dream*  p.s Is it weird to find goose pimples on a gal a turn on ? Err just asking hor ....for a friend !

      I am so freaking pissed right now. But can't say why ....Alright actually I blogged about it just now but then realised its not cool to bitch abt someone when i know they are reading it so took it off.   A stupid mynah took a dump on my shirt today during lunchtime ...out of a 100 people it had to choose me. I never win anything in lucky draws but when it comes to this kinda stuff totally different story.  Too tired to blog further, going to bed ...oh Jenna won Survivor, I think she has to be the most undeserving winner ever, Rob totally deserved it imo.

      THE mom didn't wanna go anywhere today, really wanted to take her out today to a nice dinner but well its her choice after all. She hates to eat out, would rather wake up early in the morning to go to the market and then proceed to spend the whole morning cooking lunch and dinner instead of sitting in a nice restaurant relaxing and at least having the chance to get some decent conversation with THE sis and me. Women, can never understand them! And now THE sis told me they might not go to tekka (little india) after all. This is what happens when you don't plan things in advance. Now I shall go and bathe THE dog.  Oh by the way wanna dedicate this entry to sangeetha (think she should know why ;) ), you got no idea how much I loved your last entry , got me grinning like an idiot when I read it....you know ....i think I'm in love with you ....

      Good day today, went out with my (guy) colleague to see X-Men 2 at tampines mall in the afternoon, it was a pretty awesome movie imo, way better than the first installment of the series. Yeah and thats the end of my review so go see it! Oh and bought Pearl Jam's new album, ok not that new it's been out for a while now but didn't have the money to buy it till now. Got a sampler together with that album from Music Junction, but so lame it only has 'snippets' of the songs not the full versions. I mean thats so freaking lame hell I would rather download the mp3s and listen to them. Gonna give the sampler to Boy to play with later.  Anyway was gonna go back home after the movie but decided to give my friend a call cos he's living pretty close by, he agreed to meet me for a while ...then i decided to call my other jc friend and she turned out to be at home too so i kinda persuaded her to meet us also, she didnt want to at first but come on no gal can resist the Indian Stallion for long once i switch on on my babyish cutesy voice . We met and talked at BK for a while, then me and gal friend went to watch Anger Management which turned out to be a not so great movie, way too silly but there was a few funny moments.  Oh and most probably will be able to work at home this Friday again woohoo! But must try and be more productive than the last time!

      Wow ok I think this is the longest break from blogging I took. Yeah been really busy at work cos I had 2 big tasks this week that I needed to finish by yesterday which I did. The BBQ at big boss's place was pretty nice, we had sausages, chicken, patties all kinda stuff ..but it was a little too quiet for my tastes though not sure why...oh well who cares when there's free food right ! I tried to help out as much as I can in bbqing the food but not much experience actually so mainly used lots of eye power. But I did help out a lot in trying to finish the food, we had so much left over. I brought back sausages and patties, gonna have them for dinner today.  Oh i totally missed Survivor cos of the BBQ, I still have no idea who won .. :( But it is kind of a shame cos I think this was one of the more interesting Survivor seasons in a while, just because it was so unpredictable, thanks to Rob who I think plays the game as well as anyone I seen so far ...it would be really cool to see him go against Richard Hatch. Which I am sure they will do, have a Survivor of Survivors when the show starts losing its popularity.   Gonna meet a colleague for lunch and to watch X-Men 2 later. Was supposed to meet chio bu (pretty gal) instead but she cancelled on me, sigh well if I had a dollar for everytime that happens ..... Nah she had something that came up, anyway at least my colleague agreed to go out with me instead, god bless that kind sweet man, if I was gay I would totally go after him.  Gonna suggest to Ab that maybe the whole team can like leave work couple of hours early one day and go watch Matrix Reloaded at Jurong Point for the 5 something show and maybe have dinner afterwards, I think that would be kinda cool. See what he says ....if I am lucky he will read this before I ask him !   Going out with my mom and sis tommorow cos it's Mother's Day, yes finally I can buy her something decent that she might actually like...she wasn't too impressed with the toothbrush I gave her last year. Sis suggested to me that maybe we should get for her a new Punjabi Suit. And also treat her to a nice dinner at Little India. We will see what she wants. But anyway whatever I am gonna spend on her tommorow I am gonna take out of the money I give her monthly so no worries! But I won't tell her tommorow of course, dun wanna spoil her day.

      Pretty cool day today, 12 of us went to Pizza Hut for lunch and ate like nobody's business, i had like 5 or 6 slices of pizza, soup, salad, breadsticks and dun know what else. Downside was when I got back I was as sleepy as hell and had a really hard time concentrating on my work. Hmm maybe we should make it dinner next time !   There's a company barbecue at big boss's place on Friday which is pretty cool, but before I can look forward to that I need to hurry and complete two tasks that I are urgently need to finish by Thursday.  So probably not gonna be blogging that much for the next couple of days. But who knows rite.   P.S Is it me or does Lana Lang look way hotter in the new season of Smallville?   Oh yeah and I got the nicest compliment from a net friend earlier, you know the kind that makes you feel all good inside ...thanks for saying what you did babe ! :)

      I wanna watch  urlLink Amen  which is showing at the Film Festival rite now but got no one who wants to go with me (Yes I don't have a lot of friends). Anyone interested ? It's showing from the 7 - 10th of May at 9 pm but I cant make it on the 9th with a friend cos I got company barbecue on that day. :(   Define pathetic : When you need to make a mass plea online on your blog to get someone to go to the movies with you.  On another note, I am starting to develop a fear of black holes, you know those things in space with such intense gravity that they suck in light even. But can't tell you why.

      Went out with a friend for dinner at Pizza Hut , yes im splurging my new found wealth now that I am rich. Anyway while we were there we saw this bunch of kids there by themselves who couldn't be older than 10, at most 11 ! Hell I went to McDonalds for the very first time when I was in Primary 6 ...I think I first went to Pizza Hut when I was in JC or maybe even later. Kids nowdays are so pampared aren't they ! Anyway it was really nice catching up with my friend, the last time we met was when we had this gathering a while back but we didnt talk much. For me I almost always prefer to go out with someone alone, like just the two of us, rather than a whole group cos I think theres more interaction that way and the conversation is more personal . Whenever we go out in big groups I tend to be much more reserved. But that's just me.   After that went to Giordana, she bought a really nice red top. Actually there was another top that I think she looked way better in but she thought it showed way too much cleavage. Sigh well at least I gotta see her in it for like a minute b4 she changed back. ;) I got myself a pair of jeans also for around 45 bucks cos I got only one pair of wearable jeans now. Oh and the salegals at Giordano were so wonderful I tell ya, we were at the one at Tampines Mall and the outlet didnt have the size that my friend wanted. So the salesgal called up the outlet at Century Square, found out there was a top that size there and went there and got it for my friend. Now that's what you call service. And all the salesgals there were friendly and nice too and it seemed totally natural and unforced. I read in the papers like many months back that Giordano has a strict hiring policy also, something like they only take in 20 percent of the pple they interview, basically you have to have a really amazing personality for them to hire you. I once knew a gal who worked at Giordano before and she was exactly the same, had this really amazing vibe that made me feel so at ease and comfortable whenever I was with her. I think I wanna marry a Giordano gal when I grow up, must tell Mommy that.  Oh people go and get the new CD by the  urlLink White Stripes  its amazing, for those who dun know them they are a duo, Meg and Jack White and they play 60's inspired  bluesly guitar rock (think Led Zeppelin , Hendrix ) and its a very refreshing change from all the nu-metal crap on radio/mtv/tv rite now. Jack White is a really talented guitarist and sounds like Robert Plant from Led Zep on some of the songs, a pretty unique voice. Unfortunately didnt think Meg White is that great on her drums, shes average at best. But still definitely the best album I have heard in a long while. Songs to check out are "Black Math" and "Ball and Biscuit".

If you need to do stuff like this to get off then I really feel sorry for you.

      Hmm spending 4 hours on a presentation that lasted 10 minutes...now thats what I call unproductive. But yeah thats how long I took to prepare the presentation i did today, was doing it from 1 am to 5 am this morning. But I think I got a pretty good topic to present though which was the  urlLink defacement of Madonna's website  on April 19th, compared to my colleagues who instead had to do presentation on several type of software. I actually wanted to do a presentation on P2P networks and the legal and moral implications that it had on the music industry, and using Madonna as a case study but my supervisor said I should try and stick to the given topic, which was kinda disappointing but i guess its good practice. But I wish I didn't get as tongue tied as I do when I'm giving a presentation, well I was definitely better than last week when I pretty much sucked but still not as good as I wanna be.  Went for dinner at Kenny Roger's with a friend at Marina Square, then I bought  urlLink Faith of the Fallen  by Terry Goodkind at a book fair there for only 6 bucks ! Then got the White Stripes's new album  urlLink Elephant  and listening to it right now (sounds good so far) . Heh really feels good to be able to spend money without feeling guilty that you are bleeding your parents dry ! Oh I can work from home on Friday , pretty cool rite ....I really think I would work better from home, cos honestly the journey takes a lot out of me i mean 3 hours of travelling a day can really get to you sometimes. But of cos need to have that self-discipline to do work when you are at home, anyway I am really gonna be trying my very best to try finish some of the tasks that I have left that are already overdue, dun know leh but I think I haven't been as productive as I know I can be so gonna have to try and rectify that.

      Had the whole house to myself yesterday; my parents and dogs were off to my sister's place to stay over and probably be back today. Sigh times like this I really wished I had a chick to fool around with. Instead ended up just watching a cartoon (Who Framed Roger Rabbit),  doing some of my work tasks and surfing porn. Oh but did catch Payback at night; it was a pretty cool movie starring Mel Gibson, had a whole noir-ish feel to it. Don't ask me what noir-ish is , I got the word off a review off the movie I read online.  I think I probably spent the whole morning up to lunch just replying all the emails that I got. I exchanged multiple emails with my colleague about this project we were working on ; eventhough he was only 2 tables away.  I thought emails were supposed to make your life easier instead of being a hassle.

       I am listening to The Mars Volta's new album right now, De-Loused In The Comatorium, I am still at the 3rd song but man I am already totally blown away. I have never heard anything remotely like this before, the last time i was so overawed like this was when I heard Radiohead's Ok Computer. I NEED to get my hands on the CD as soon as possible, hope Music Junction has it I will go look for it on Monday after work.    From  urlLink The Mars Volta  website:  That record is De-Loused In The Comatorium, the astonishing first album by The Mars Volta. De-Loused In The Comatorium is an iridescent, fearless, brain-busting hour of music, a fictionalized celebration of Julio Venegas life. Based on a story written by Cedric, it is a concept album in which the hero tries to commit suicide by overdosing on morphine. Instead of dying, he falls into a coma for a week, and experiences fantastic adventures in his dreams, elemental battles between the good and bad aspects of his conscience. At the end, he emerges from the coma, but chooses to die.   Read  urlLink reviews  or you can listen to the entire album  urlLink here .

       Earlier this month I had this entry about a certain  urlLink website   that was the website of the day for me, and what do you know, it got featured at  urlLink somethingawful.com  .   Here is one of the entries at  urlLink http://www.bryanchung.per.sg/  :   "While "Jie Jibe" Cheryl and I were at East Coast Park playing water at the beach. While she was SM Sing someone, she was caught unaware by a wave. Water entered her hand-phone and hence it was somewhat spoilt. She was not able to access the "Menu" option. Bad gone to worst when the hand-phone rejected her ism-card. From then on, she had a mood swing. She even bought a McDonald's meal and did not want to eat. I tried my very best to help her with her phone. My last resort was to pray. I continued to pray more than once and never gave up trying to make her hand-phone back to normal. God answered my prayers soon. I felt so happy when her hand-phone was back to normal. The ism-card was detected and "Menu" option was accessible. The sense of relieved went through Cheryl and I felt happy for her. I told her it was not me, it was God helped her. Thank you God."   Amen to that !  Eh you know what , my 8250 has been screwing up recently , switches off by itself sometimes.  As good a reason as any for me to start praying again.

      Went to see Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle with my colleagues yesterday and man that was one hell of a crappy show. Demi Moore actually flew; that was how ridiculous it got. That's 3 crappy shows I seen in a row. But did see the trailer for 'The Italian Job' a movie starring Edward Norton who is one of my favourite actors, hoping to catch it as soon as it opens.Speaking of movies, I been trying to ask every chick I know to go see Finding Nemo cos everyone who has seen it tells me its really funny; but so far all of them said they seen it already.  What a coincidence .....  After that we went to a nearby coffee place for a while. I paid 5 bucks for a cup of vanilla latte. Heh its funny cos 4 months  I wouldn't even think of paying that kinda money for one miserable cup of coffee. Scary what having money can do to your spending habits. Anyway we started talking about ghosts and spirits and how there are people who can see them. For me I am still skeptical about it eventhough I do know a friend who told me she sees this kinda stuff. I think its probably because I already have a hard time believing in God, let alone ghosts and spirits.   Oh pretty cool I met this guy from Atlanta, Georgia online ; he's a guitarist in a band and he was also a fan of At the Drive-In (ATDI) which is one of my fav bands. He was telling me about Mars Volta's ( band that was formed after ATDI broke up) new album and how amazing it is. Can't wait to get my hands on it.

      A friend told me recently about how his mom embarassed him in a shopping store and it kinda reminded me of my date on New Year Eve last year. Was out with a gal and we were sitting down and chatting; it was around 2:30 am in the morning , and suddenly my phone rings. I answer it and immediately heard my mom shouting over the phone asking me if I knew what time it was; apparently the clocks at home weren't working. Anyway she continued on asking what the hell I was doing out so late etc. etc. After I hung up I could hardly look at my date in the eye; if I had a gun I would have probably shot myself there and then.

      Read in streets today about this new no-frills airline called Air Asia that will offer flights from Singapore to KL for S$15. Yeah it's that cheap; my friend is pretty excited cos it means that he can go back every week to his hometown instead of like once a month by coach which takes like 8 hours. And the whole team were also thinking of going to KL for a couple of days to chill out next month so this will really save us some cash. The airline is probably gonna start next week. But don't know how they can still make a profit charging 15 bucks a person.  I have 2 really huge tasks due tommorow; I finished one of them but barely started on the other ....really need to learn how to multitask; gonna pull an all-nighter tonight.

      Met a couple of my friends from junior college for dinner and drinks just now; We went to this pub near changi village called Bark Cafe, it's an open air place with dim lights and pretty nice music, had a lot of fun.  I had a couple of Heinekens and this beer called Killkenny's or something which was really nice, really smooth compared to other beers, you could probably drink the whole mug at one go. Yeah I never been much of a pubbing person in the past; mainly because I never had the cash to do it on a regular basis and also I was quite the shy reserved type back then; still am now  but I have been working on changing that for like the last 6 months or so.   Ooh so irritating I left my computer on when i left because I was downloading this 500mb application that i needed to test for work; when i came back my computer was off; my mom switched it off by turning off the switch!!! Even though I told her a million times never to do that. Now i have to download the damm thing all over again ....ROAR!!!

      I went to the bank yesterday to replace my ATM card and get a thumbprint for my study loan repayment loan (I was a month late in handing it in). I swear the bank officer who was attending to me was flirting with me. She was asking me where I studied and stuff, and she took longer as usual when she was holding my hand to put the thumbprint on the forms.   Well she was probably fantasising at the same time  if it was true about what they say about guys with big hands.   Oh and she gave me candy also while she was processing the form; hell if that doesn't isn't an obvious sign of saying that she wanted me really badly I don't know what is. I mean who gives candy to a 25 year old? I am pretty sure the guys before me didn't get any.  Signs people, sometimes you can't ignore the signs !

      The world has gone potty, or should I say Potter. I do not understand what it is about that book that drives adults to a state of temporary insanity; that they would wake up and go to the bookstore early in the morning just to get their hands on the book.   I read the first instalment after hearing all the hype but I found it really boring. Here was the same old fantasy cliche about a normal boy who finds out that he isn't normal after all; that he comes from an ancestry of great magicians and is destined to be one himself. The characters were all one-dimensional ; that kid monfrey is all mean and evil, while potter and his friends are the good angels, who when they break the rules, only do it because of good intentions.   I seriously urge people to go read "The Wizard of Earthsea" by Ursula Le Guin; it also tells of a story of a kid who goes to a magic school; I read it when I was in secondary school and it was  the book that got me so interested in the whole fantasy genre. You can find out more about it  urlLink here.

      I met a childhood friend yesterday; we used to be neighbours you see but we kinda lost contact after she moved probably around 7 - 8 years ago. Anyway it was really great meeting up with her for dinner again cos I kinda missed her! We had dinner at Pizza Hut at Tampines Mall ..oh speaking of which do not go to that outlet; they have the worst service there ! This was the second time i went there in like 2 months and both times it was really crappy.   But we did have a rather nice time talking about old times and basically catching up on each other's lives. All in all a pretty cool day.   Oh after the dinner we went to watch Ju-On; it totally sucked , the scariest parts were those they showed during the trailer,i got scared like probably twice throughout the whole movie ..she on the other hand was covering her eyes during the scary scenes ..and this was her second time watching it. Sigh women ...But there was this bloody irritating ah beng behind me who kept talking throughout the whole damm movie with his 2 ah lian friends ; and he was even talking on his bloody handphone twice really loudly. I shushed the idiot but the retard probably didnt understand what it meant.

      My system administrator of my lab is blasting Celine Dion's "All By Myself" out loud on REPEAT. This is like the 10th time I am listening to it. Seriously considering suicide right now.  Yes yes I know everyone is entitled to their own musical tastes and I should respect them; but surely Celine Dion is an exception ?

      Oh a colleague of mine asked me today while we were on the train what I thought were in the compartments under the seats at the ends of the trains.   I told them it was probably crowbars and drillers, u know so that they could force the driver cabin open and take over the train controls if the train driver goes berserk and tries to derail the train. But my colleague said it probably contains guns and weapons in case of a hijack on the train...heh some people are so silly aren't they ...guns ....!  Ok just wanna state for the record that Charlene is probably the only gal who really understands me, babe if i was a gal I would have your baby; but I guess you have to settle for robbing me of my virginity when u get back to Singapore.

      Watched HULK with my colleagues today. Well I didn't really like the movie that much. Firstly, they took way too long to setup the story, the hulk doesn't even appear until like more than an hour into the movie. Secondly it was way too serious for a movie that was based on a comic book, the first part of the movie focused on Bruce's problem of opening up to his girlfriend and repressed memories of a traumatic incident in his childhood that was causing him nightmares. I only enjoyed the final hour of it to be honest. Oh ya the movie is 2 1/2 hours long.   Oh and I bought Radiohead's new album today, the limited edition which comes in a booklet, its really pretty and really cheap, only 18.99! Will probably be listening to it the whole day tommorow on repeat, will post a review soon!

      Arrgh missed Joe Millionaire yesterday cos I only got back around 11:30 last night. We had a kind of individual performance review/project update by our supervisor so that kinda dragged for a bit. But yeah it was good cos I gotta tell him stuff that I really wanted to tell him; that I was feeling really unmotivated at work and that I would rather work on team-based projects instead of individual ones. And I was told I needed to be more energetic when it comes to tasks that I didn't really like to do; which is really true, when I have no interest in the task I have assigned I tend to like delay doing it. Need to really work on that.

      I really dreaded waking up this morning; it just rained so the air was fresh and clean; and there was this really strong breeze...if I didn't have a meeting that morning I would have probably just slept more and come to work late; it felt that good. Maybe companies should let employees come in late during mornings like this; I certainly would if I was the boss! *hoping his supervisor reads this*   Spend the whole day doing system administration duties and didn't have any time to do my own tasks. The one horrible thing about Unix systems is installation of applications; so many times I encountered problems because of some missing library or compiler error or some bizarre unknown error. We spend 1/2 a day trying to install this application (ironically it helps report bugs) and we still couldn't get it to work. The problem with open source OSs is there isn't one specific compiler or libraries that is in every Unix system; unlike Windows. Being a sys admin sucks big time dun know how pple do it as a job; really admire them.

      Was doing some stuff on my company machine because it's my turn to be system administrator for my company, yes I have root access to the system and the power to delete accounts and stuff (but i gotta learn how to first) so for the next month my colleagues would probably treat me like god, well they better do !   Spend my afternoon watching the animatrix which I got off Kazaa Lite , took me a week to download, it is really cool I highly recommend it, esp this fight scene between this guy and gal and they end up tearing up the clothes off each other...man never thought cartoons could get this sexy!

      I realised that I find it much easier to blog when I am at home compared to when I am at work . On Wednesday when I was working from home, the entries just came out by themselves I didn't even need to put much thought into it. But yesterday after I came back from work, I was really struggling to type words out, I had something I wanted to blog about but it in the end it got so frustrating I just gave up. Maybe I should just stick to blogging on my off days.

      Sigh really sad now people always misread the Stallion's good intentions. This is what happened: I went to a talk by this Professor from University of Melbourne at NUS and before we went in, we had the usual temperature checks and were given a sticker with our temperature on it. After the talk, I noticed that my colleague's sticker was loose and probably gonna drop off anytime, so being the kind and friendly indian boy that I am, I reached over to press it down for her. Immediately she slapped away my hand and gave me a cold stare like I was some kind of a perv. Tell you it really doesn't pay to be kind.  Oh and the sticker was at her right shirt pocket.    Oh and on the way back home, this kid asked me for the time and i was so tempted to retort "Do I look like a clock?" . But of cos I wasn't that mean, just pushed him aside and went on my way.

      I am thinking of changing my nick from Indian Stallion to something else. For some unknown reason, chicks find it hilarious, which isn't really too nice cos I was expecting it to invoke awe and (sexual) curiousity in them.  I got a couple of  nicks in mind already that would probably be taken more seriously ; Gargantua, Big Bert, BeastInTheSack, LoveMachine ..that's about it. Any more suggestions will be more than welcome.

      I was really irritated by a net friend yesterday. I was telling her about that really friendly and interesting gal I met on sat ( see my entry  on 6/8/2003 ) and how I would like to really chat with her again , and the first thing she asked me was if that gal was Chinese. And when I said yes, she went on about how there were nice indian gals who were also friendly and interesting and why I didn't find those women appealing. And she's not the only one, my mom too does that. My mom would tell me (in tamil) that I should give indian gals a life (by marrying them).   So I am gonna say here what I told her, color is not and has never been a factor for me at all when it comes to the chicks. If I am attracted to a gal it would be because of her personality and how well I think we click (ok it wouldn't hurt if she had a hot bod as well, hey I am a guy after all), not because she was Chinese or Indian or whatever.   I have always felt that I was Indian by birth and my skin color only; I can't speak Tamil decently, I have no interest in Tamil music or movies and I have never had that many Indian friends in my life ..well yes I had 3, they were my neighbours since we were kids but I don't keep in touch with them that much now. The only other Indian friends I have had are net friends, most of whom I never even met. I am not trying to reject my Indian roots or whatsoever, but I just have no interest in Indian culture, I can't help it.   I would love to blame it on my 1/4 Chinese blood and the fact that I took Malay as a 2nd Language in school rather than Tamil, but my sister proves that isn't true, she is very much an Indian in character, has mostly Indian friends , loves Indian movies/music etc. etc.   Of course I am not naive, I know for most gals in Singapore they would most probably not consider dating outside their own race, and that is their right of cos, that's the way it is.  Just needed to get all that off my chest.

      Led Zeppelin new 3-CD set of live recordings, How the West Was Won, debuted on No. 1 on the Billboard charts last week. This is a band that was performing way before I was born. There is also a DVD release featuring some of their concerts which I am definitely gonna get...first I need to buy DVD player.   But I have to say this, if you consider yourself a serious rock fan then you NEED to go listen to Led Zeppelin, cos they were basically the blueprint that most rock bands  base their music on. And they sound even more amazing live, you can check out the 2-CD set Led Zeppelin: BBC Sessions to see what I am talking about.

      Listening to Verve's Urban Hymms at work now.    Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony that's life... Try to make ends meet , you're a slave to the money Then you die.   Vey true in my opinion. Most of us are and will be working for the better part of our lives just to have the money to buy the stuff we want. Sometimes I wonder what it is like to be rich and be able to afford everything you want. Yes I know ENVY is one of the 7 sins.   On a brighter note , I am having loads of fun exchanging daily emails with a new net friend of mine; I used to do that with another net friend not a while back but we got into a silly argument and it just stopped after that. Of cos it prob wouldnt last but its gonna be fun while it does.

      While I was in the church for my classmate's wedding, for some reason I started thinking about the bible ..and I realised that Jesus seemed to be a really humorless man.  He never cracked any jokes or played any pranks, or at least none was mentioned in the bible. And I just wonder why is that so. Heh if I was him, I would have probably try to get the apostles to walk on water just as I could and then laugh at them when they fail miserably and drop into the water. But yeah something to ponder.   One more thing I don't get is why they always have the statue of him nailed to the cross and bleeding at the top of the altar in every catholic church.  I mean when you go for a church wedding and you see that it kinda takes out a little of the joy from the wedding cos it is a rather painful image. Surely it would be better to have a nicer statue up there that showed him during happier times , like maybe riding on the donkey or playing with sheep? Yes he died to save his people but dun think Catholics really need to be reminded of that everytime they go to church, do they?   Oh and just remembered this line from this passage during the First Reading during the wedding mass ..it was from the Book of Euclid-something. It was listing the qualities of the perfect wife , being chaste and supportive and loving ...and then there was this line: "A quiet wife is a precious(or some other word) gift."  I thought that was a tad sexist.  BTW all these is just my opinion , not a fact . Cos religion can be a really sensitive issue.

      Went to the PC Show at Expo on Friday to look at some digital cameras, think I am going to settle for the Canon A60 most probably, a friend who has it highly recommends it. But it is a little on the big side, I need a camera that is easy to conceal. We will see.  Yesterday I went to the church wedding of my junior college(JC) classmate in the morning. It was really sweet, her hubby was singing to her this romantic song (well the words were romantic) while she was walking down the aisle towards her. That was followed by the wedding banquet in the evening, food was good and gotta meet up with my other JC classmates as well, and also free flow of Beer.  One of my classmates tried to get me to go with her and her boyfriend to Madam Wong and hang out with other colleagues (she's an air stewardess) but I declined. I do not like to go out in big groups and even worse when its a bunch of pple I dun know, yeah I am not exactly a social butterfly.  But it was pretty cool cos I got to talk to this really friendly gal who was the bride's cousin on the coach ride back home, she works in the travel agency and was telling me about all the places she went to and her experiences, it was a really interesting conversation .

      A conversation between my colleagues earlier.  Her : Just now you say cannot go deeper but actually can. Him : Is it ?   And the first thing that came to my mind was "That sounded so dirty..."   Miss Universe is showing on tv later. I don't know if its just me but its getting really boring , u got all different kind of boring segments like evening gown and the interview which no guy really cares about. All I wanna see is the swimsuit section can someone sms me when that starts thanks.  If I had the power I would make the following changes to the Miss Universe competition.  1. The girls will be in bikinis throughout the competition. Anyone who wears a one piece will be severely penalized. Gals who go topless get bonus points.   2. Water will periodically sprayed on the gals ..oh wait the bikinis have to be those really flimsy kinds.   3. Instead of evening gown change it to a mud wrestling competition.  4. For the interview section , the gals can request for another question if they fluffed the first one ...if they flash their boobs. Gals who are topless get the 2nd question automatically (obviously)  5. For the costume parade , instead of over-elaborate dumbass costumes, the gals will be claded in various bondage attire or skimpy chambermaid outfits.   Yes, I know I am a perv.

      Finally finished the task .....gonna celebrate by getting some decent sleep now. Oh huge thanks to 2 of my colleagues who helped me till 3 and 4 am last night with it eventhough they had a big presentation in the morning with the big boss in attendance. Really lucky to have colleagues like that. I would have kissed them today if it wasn't against office policy.   This guy chatted me up a couple of seconds ago, he said he was gay and when I said I don't talk to guys online he's like going "please" and even gave his phone number asking me to call. Weirdo.

       From A New Paper article   THE study shows that Indian men are twice as likely as Chinese men to have erectile dysfunction. Dr James Tan, consultant urologist and principal investigator of the ED study, said: "Indians seem to have twice the risk of having ED compared to Chinese. "No reason is immediately apparent in our study."  Hmm interesting ..well I think maybe its because Indians are usually way bigger in that department so its harder for us to get it up ? ;)

      Song that describes my mood right now: "Sometimes I feel like a whore" by Everclear.   Stay cool Bert, only 1 and a 1/2 hours to Gilmore Girls.  Things I learned today:  1. Do NOT flirt with married women online 2. Do NOT mention the word 'porn' when asking for a  chick's  gal's ICQ number.   Updated:  3. Do NOT refer to women using the word "chicks" (have to thank Eileen for this)

      Today was temperature gal's last day, she told me they were going to get another gal when she was taking my temperature in the morning. And I was looking for a nice time to ask for her number, hell I even pretended to go to the toilet like 4 times in the afternoon but everytime she was talking to some other chick. Oh well.   Oh noticed something strange today, while on the MRT train I was watching this ad on the tv screen they had in the train; it showed a Chinese guy boxing with a black dude and the Chinese guy got knocked out.  But  when he was on the floor , the guy waving his arms in victory was also Chinese! Wonder what happened to the black dude.  Pretty weird, I wonder if anyone else noticed that.   I really can't wait for the weekend cos I am feeling quite drained right now, really need a break from the workplace badly. Just one more day though ...but as usual no plans lined up for the Saturday, maybe ask a couple of my friends to go shoot pool.

      Finally bought my shoes from Hush Puppies. Just went to the store and asked the salesgal what shoes were available in size 12. She showed me 2 shoes , one size 12 and the other size 11 but it was a pretty big cutting. The size 12 looked like something my uncle would wear so I settled for the 11, after trying it on of course, it was a pretty nice fit. Then the salesgals mentioned that there would be 10 percent discount if I paid by credit card, but i told her I didnt't and put on this really pitiful face, and guess what, she gave me the discount anyway ; thought it was really nice of her. But as I was trying the shoes out she was asking me if it is true what they said about men with big feet and I told her that I knew one way she could find out. Ok ok I made it up she didn't ask me that.  But hell could see in her eyes she was really curious though!  So I wore the shoes to work today and 20 minutes into the journey my heel really started to hurt like hell, the damm shoe was biting into it. It got progressively worse until I was practically limping when I reached the office. Should have taken the uncle shoes. Oh well hope it gets better really soon.   Temperature gal didn't put the sticker on my shirt like she did the past few days .....I think she's angry with me or something.  Dun know what I did also...Women!

      Had a really vivid and long dream last night. I dreamt I was at this place having dinner with a relative and her husband. And then I asked her if she wanted to go and see a movie with me after dinner, her husband had to go somewhere . She asked her husband and he rather hesitantly agreed, but told me not to try anything funny (or something to that effect). I then remember us going to the cinema, I think it was the old Cathay cinema that used to be at City Hall but don't remember watching the movie. Next thing I knew I was at her house and she was being verbally abused by her husband and her mother-in-law. And for some reason I knew she was also physically abused by her hubby as well. I tried to persuade her to leave the house with me but she was way too frightened of them to leave eventhough she really wanted to. Then someone locked the gate to her house and she couldn't leave anymore, I was standing outside looking in.   My shoes finally gave up on me, the front part of the sole came off as I went back home so I am wearing my ultra tight leather shoes today. Going to go down to Tampines to get a new pair from Hush Puppies later. Oh and need to get a credit card and luggage bags for my Thailand trip !

      Went for the wedding of 2 of my junior college friends today ; they been together since then and that was like 8 years ago, it's really cool and I am happy for them.  But it kinda sucked when me and my friends had to be separated at the reception, basically the guys and the gals had to sit at different tables away from each other. Yeah a little too strict for my liking, but well it's their custom so we have to respect them even if we don't understand or agree with it right. But the invitation card specified that men and women couldn't SIT at the same table, so I was suggesting to my guy friends that we STAND around the table where our gal friends sat, but they didn't really wanna go for it. Cowards !  But i pity our gal friends though, they were visibly upset that they had to be separated from the Indian Stallion for lunch.  After the reception, the rest of us went for some coffee where we talked for like an hour plus; it was really nice catching up with them, hope to do it again really soon.   Listening to the Mars Volta album online now, damm really regret not buying it at HMV that time I saw it ; instead I ordered it at Borders cos I could get it a dollar cheaper, but it will take like a month to arrive. Can anyone say "damm cheapskate loser" ?   Oh ya a friend of mine told me a couple of days ago that I seemed really different on the phone from my online/blog persona. And it got me thinking about stuff. Like what happened with  that gal . But she's right, I have to try and not be so insecure.    BTW alright if the temperature gal is there tommorow, I am gonna ask for her number ! Cos after tommorow I am going back to NTU to work. Hope I have the balls to do it.  Oh crap I forgot her name.....

      So the evening at the big boss's place turned out to be pretty ok ; although there maybe could have been more pizzas rather than KFC chicken but hell it's free so I shouldn't be complaning also. Anyway had a nice time chatting with my colleagues and near the end we chatted with the big boss, well he was doing most of the talking, I guess me and my colleagues still a tad uncomfortable holding a conversation with him because we don't see him that often.    Met my Junior College(JC)  friends for drinks at the Bark Cafe at Changi at night, one of them was with her boyfriend, and they were so affectionate with each other I was starting to feel a tad envious.....sigh. Anyway it was really great catching up with them although we only met up for slightly more than an hour. But going to meet them again (and a bunch of other JC friends) in a couple of hours for another friend's wedding reception so it's gonna be like a mini class reunion.   Oh I shared a mini barrel of Tiger with one of them at the cafe , so by the end of the session I was kinda high already. However it really helped loosen my tongue when I talked to my friend on the phone when I got back home, I was yapping away like nobody's business instead of the usual case where she does most of the talking. Hmm maybe I should make it a point to drink everytime before I talk to a gal on the phone.   Oh I found out something interesting yesterday : the numbers from 13 to 19 all end with the word "teen" right., e.g. thir-teen. And  people who fall within the age range 13-19 are considered teens.  Hmm so I am just wondering if thats how the words teens came about! What do you think?   Oh and a weird thing about Central Mall (the building in which my company's main office is) . There are two floors that are called "2" and "2A" . That seems a little weird in my opinion, why didn't they just name 2A "3" instead.  Kinda reminded me of the movie " urlLink Being John Malkovich " which featured a building with an office floor on the 6 1/2 level. People who worked on that floor had to jam the lift just after it passes 6 and then use a crowbar to force open the door and crawl out to the 6 1/2 level, which by the way was only 1/2 the height of a normal floor. Yes it was a really bizarre movie, but also probably one of my all time favourites as well. You should watch it if you haven't already.

      Very eventful day. Firstly was this woman who called at 7 am to talk to my dad and woke me up; I told her my dad wasn't back yet and she called 5 minutes later !  I didn't pick up the 2nd time though , I just pulled out the phone line out of the socket. Speaking of which, my phone doesn't have an option of turning off the ringer (only has 'High" and "Low" settings) , how dumb is that. But really I can't stand people who call in the wee hours of the morning even though they know people are still sleeping at that time. My friend did that , and my mom's sister as well. Doesn't mean that if you wake up early everyone else has to also.    Anyway because of that annoyance I totally overslept and woke up at 9 am. By the time I got to work it was like close to 11. But then I went to the cute chick to take my temperature and what do you know, we started chatting! Ok not that long lah, around 5 mins but still it was pretty nice.   Oh me and my colleagues went to Brewerkz (sp?) for lunch and same thing happened, the waitress was really friendly towards me; asking me how i liked my food and if I would like anything else after i was done; she didn't ask my colleagues that. Sigh I tell you the air was thick with my colleagues's jealousy, but yeah sometimes its really hard being the Stallion. But I think it probably has to do with my haircut, cut it really short yesterday evening so now my scalp (which i always thought was the sexiest part of my body) is pretty much exposed and probably a turn on to the chicks.  Watched the first part of the final episode of The Bachelorrette yesterday night also, I preferred Ryan over the other guy who seemed way too smooth and clever with his words for my liking, it ended up making him looking pretty insincere in my eyes. Ryan was definitely more quiet and shy but he didn't hide his feelings for Trista which I think was cool; although he was really insecure and a little intense at the beginning when he asked Trista to express her feelings for him in words once in a while. Actually he reminds me of myself.

      Spend the last hour reading  urlLink game reviews  at somethingawful.com. Have to say I haven't laughed so hard in a while, the reviewer has really a gift for really mean and sarcastic humour. A sample below:  "Based on the way the graphics look in this game, I am guessing they were created when the software team, angry at the programmer who coded the terrible AI by opening up Visual C++ and karate chopping the keyboard four hundred times, pinned him to a table and beat him with a programming manual until he vomited all over a nearby scanner and bled to death. Of course this was before they realized that they had gotten the wrong guy and had accidentally killed their one-man art team, so they solemnly decided to scan his vomit and use it for all the textures in order to honor his memory."  Going over to my big boss's place tommorow night for Pizza and KFC , a kind of get together for the members of the team. But its kinda difficult for me to relax when he is around, he makes me a little nervous.  But hell who cares cos I love pizza ! Gonna starve myself the whole of tommorow so I can meet more in the evening!

      I would like to extend a really long middle finger to TCS 5,  for falsely misleading me for the 2nd week running that the Joe Millionaire finale was going to be telecasted today.

      Hmm the cute chick who takes my temperature everyday at work did something diffferent today; she placed the sticker on my chest!; ok on my shirt but around the chest area . The thing is usually she will ask me to take the sticker myself. Must be the new cologne that I am wearing. But really I think they should make it so that she has to wear a nurse's uniform, that would really make my day I tell ya !   Still trying to get used to working in the new office; but one thing i really don't like is that some of the other people are really noisy sometimes and its kinda annoying when I'm blogging ...err i mean working.

      I saw the weirdest thing at Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station as I walked towards the NE line to take the train to Chinatown.  It was a horizontal escalator which was around 50 meters, you know like the ones you see at the airport but much shorter. I can understand the use of those escalators at the airport, its probably for people with heavy luggage but I can't understand what purpose it can serve in this case.  Anyway such a escalator would be more useful at Outram in my opinion, it's a  5 minute walk to transfer to the NE line from the EW line.

      As I type this I am listening to the CD I just bought at Borders just now , urlLink  How the West Was Won  by Led Zeppelin.  Blogged about this  CD couple weeks back.  There is also a DVD version of the album but I don't have a DVD player :(  . Anyway it sounds really good so far , but I prefer the versions of the songs from the  urlLink BBC Sessions  album. However I am only in the middle of the first CD in this 3-CD album, ergo have to reserve my judgement of the album until I listen to it in its entirety.  Oh please do go and see  urlLink City of God  , a really engrossing movie that follows the lives of a group of children in the slums of Brazil which, although referred to as the City of God by its residents, is more like a hellhole where kids go around with guns looting and shooting at will. The movie is really violent though; some scenes are really disturbing and made me wonder if the movie is actually based on a true story. But when the credits roll a footage of a tv news interview is shown, and it is exactly identical to a scene in the movie except that this time it's the actual gangster talking to the camera rather than the actor.  Of couse some parts were probably dramatised but still a very welcome change from the usual Hollywood fare. Highly recommended !  Oh forgot to mention ...heh I got a net friend to go with me to watch the movie, thank god , cos was seriously planning to go see it alone.  Had quite a good time , and I think I kinda swept her off her feet !

      Talked to a net friend on the phone for close to 5 hours last night ; it's a new record for me, hell the longest time I been on the phone was probably like 2 hours , andthat was with a guy, but let's not go there.  But it was a really pleasant experience and I am probably gonna meet up with her next week!   I have always wanted to do a '50 things about me' list like I have seen in a lot of blogs out there but I don't know if I will ever be able to. I guess there are a lot of things about me that I still wanna keep private from some of my real life friends/colleagues. And I am pretty sure some of those things will surprise them a lot also or even find hard to believe.  Maybe 1 day I will be able to put up such a list but don't think it's anytime soon.   Anyway spend the whole afternoon at the vet, brought Boy and Bobby to the vet. Boy for his monthly injection to curb his skin infection and Bobby for his cataracts and bad breath due to his bad gums and teeth. Also got them to shave Boy bald, he looks really cute now I am gonna put up a picture really soon alright so you guys can check him out. Anyway the final bill came up to 190 bucks, yeah that was a 1/10th of my salary gone in 2 hours :( . Sigh the things you do for the kids.

      OK a very tech-geeky post: I been using the Mozilla browser and email client for quite a few months now; it is now my default browser. I did try using it a year ago but it was really unstable, buggy and really slow but the latest version is a totally different story. For the uninitiated, Mozilla is an open-source web browser/email client software that was created using Netscape's source code after it was released to the public.  You can read more about them and download the browser urlLink here .  Anyway Mozilla has a lot of advantages over IE6 , firstly it allows tabbed browsing which means you do not need to open every new explorer window for every new webpage like you have to do in IE, instead you can open them in tabs . It also blocks pop-up windows which you get if you go to porn sites or even sites like geocities which can get really annoying. But lets say u wanna allow a site to display pop-ups , for examples blogs with pop up comment windows, all u have to do is click the exclamation mark at the lower right hand side of the browser and click add in the window that appears and it will allow that site to display pop-ups permanently. You can also search for words on a web page without opening the find window, all you have to do is type "/" and then start typing the word u wanna look for. To find the next occurence of the word just press F3. You can even look for links!  The email client is also vastly superior to Outlook Express. You can filter emails in your Inbox by sender, for example you can display only all emails by a certain friend or even view those that aren't in your address book. You can also color code your emails for example , Red as in urgent or Yellow for tasks to do later. Lastly it has a spam mail control filter that has really helped me with my spam, it filters spam into a separate folder or deletes it, depending on your preference. It has a lot of other message rules and filters as well that you can use to make email management much easier.  The disadvantage is some web pages use IE-specific javascript functions such as scrolling windows which cannot display in the Mozilla browser. And also some sites like Launch.com do not support streaming videos in non-IE browser. However , this is not a fault of Mozilla but rather the over-reliance of web developers to cater only to IE users. The W3C has definite browser standards that all browsers are recommended to follow but Microsoft created their own additional standards so as to frustrate non-IE users. Also Microsoft has not done any major updates to IE in a long while , probably because they know they are the overwhelming force in the browser market so they probably feel there is no urgent need to improved the browser's functionality.   Anyway do at least try it out alright , its a  urlLink 13MB download  , and hopefully you will love it as much as I do.  Oh 1 more thing , unlike IE when it crashes it doesn't bring down the whole desktop with you. But I have yet to see it crash on my Windows XP machine at home, only at work on my Solaris machine.

      Caught the sniffles this morning and now feeling really hot and bothered. Brought home a company workstation back home yesterday; our centre is under renovation so it would be useful when I wanna install and test out some of my ...err..stuff. Anyway how many people can say they have a computer with a 64-bit processor at home eh ; I am gonna brag about it to all my (net) friends. OK I am such a geek.  Oh go read today's urlLink  TODAY  paper cos Mr Brown wrote a really funny article in it regarding the  urlLink RJC incident  . Btw there was also an urlLink  article  in it where they say that women should not  wear bras as they are "an unnecessary undergarment forced on women by society as a statement of modesty, albeit a false one."  Well as a strong advocate of women's rights I have to agree; women have suffered long enough; its time for chicks to give the middle finger to the unreasonable demands of society and let it all hang out !  I have failed miserably in my attempt to get a chick to go see urlLink  City of God  with me. They are either under-aged (it's RA) or not free or not interested in watching a foreign language movie. I never quite understand why some people wouldn't even consider watch a movie unless it's a hollywood blockbuster or has a well-known star/director in it.  I mean at least give them a try before you say you don't like them right. *frustrated*   Listening to :  Portishead's  urlLink Dummy , Ani DiFranco 's  urlLink Dilate  , Marilyn Manson's  urlLink Antichrist Superstar     how could you do nothing and say, i'm doing my best how could you take almost everything and then come back for the rest how could you beg me to stay, reach out your hands and plead and then pack up your eyes and run away as soon as i agreed   Done Wrong by Ani DiFranco

      Got some really disappointing news, the kind that basically screwed up my plans for the next few months. Oh well like they say, if it is too good to be true, it probably is. And i should have known better because it happened to me once before not that long ago. I think from now on, I am gonna treat all news/opportunities/gals that fall into the 'too good to be true' category with a large healthy dose of skeptism.  That way you don't get too disappointed if it doesn't materialise.  Listening to :  Bjork's  urlLink Vespertine , Slipknot's  urlLink Self-titled , Jimi Hendrix's  urlLink Are You Experienced?

      Alright read a  urlLink letter  in the Straits Times Forum today by a Mr. George Lim who protests rather strongly against the goverment allow gay people to hold key positions within the government. His argument is that homosexuality is morally wrong (doesn't really say why) and therefore socially unacceptable. So he is afraid that through the government's decision , that gays will slowly be accepted into society resulting in gay marriages and then in the future even be allowed to adopt and raise children, which he doesn't believe should ever be allowed. And then he goes on to say that the government should take 'sound and responsible action to protect young citizens from the corrupting influence of immoral behaviour'. Of cos the immoral behavior is homosexuality. Oh and he put homosexuals in the same category as criminals.  Ok in my opinion the biggest problem is all the arguments he puts forth is based on his beliefs and what he has heard rather than actual facts. He does not present any facts to support his claiim that gays are not born but rather made due to "negative influences in their lives'  such as sexual abuse. Ditto for his claim that a child having gay parents would grow up corrupted and not knowing right from wrong.  Or that gay people have the ability to influence children to be homosexuals themselves.  OK my own stand on homosexuality is that it is just a sexual preference ; the question of morality doesn't even come into play. Basically my principle in life is do whatever you want as long as you don't hurt anyone else.  Very simplistic I know but it has served me pretty well so far.  So by that principle there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. OK i have to admit I still feel uncomfortable seeing guys kiss , but thats my problem and I am trying to come to terms with it.  And no I dun have any gay friends in real life either but then again I dun have that many straight friends either. Btw feel free to disagree with me of cos.

      Yes finally I bought my digital camera, the Canon Powershot A70 !  Comes with a lot of manual functions which I do not know how to use yet; but I am going to go through the user manual over the weekend and figure it out. In the meantime check out very amateurish pictures taken by me of my dogs last night. Heh the poor guys were sleeping but I kinda awoke them with my flash. Bobby actually seemed pretty annoyed at one point ,he was like glaring at me. Well bloody hell he can forget about  dinner tonight ! Oh ya the url is  urlLink here !  OK at the risk of sounding sad and desperate anyone interested to go see City of God, that Portuguese movie, with me ? Please ? Preferably a chick ? Btw it's RA. Oh and I am also thinking of taking up guitar lessons; it's something I been wanting to do for a long time but just never got around to it. Thinking of signing up with the Yamaha school at Bedok Central. If anyone got any lobang (Singlish: special deal) I would be really grateful !   Was listening to one of my first ever rock CDs today at work today, Throwing Copper by Live. Man it's hard to believe that it's been such a long time since I got it , that was way back in junior college which makes it 8 years. Can still remember waking up at 3 am every Friday morning to watch Channel V's Billboard Top 20 Countdown on Channel 5; that was how I got to know about Live, Weezer, Alice In Chains and Pearl Jam;this was way before mp3s and I didn't even know how to use a computer yet. Heh and I remember blasting this album in my room really loudly when I was really pissed also just to annoy my parents....sigh that was teenage angst for ya !

      Ok this is a possibly dumb question but I really wanna know so here goes. I have seen a lot of ads lately featuring the new Samsung phone, not sure whats the model, but it has this 180 degree rotating camera lens. My question is why do you need rotating camera lens? Can't you just turn the phone around 180 degrees ?

      It's really easy to make assumptions about people based on the way they dress/talk/look. But from a conversation that I had with a gal friend earlier I realised that those assumptions can be really off the mark sometimes; and the revelation now made me look at her in a totally different light. And I mean in a good way. Makes me wonder what assumptions people make about me.   Btw you probably heard about the Raffles Junior College teacher who was caught on video tearing up her student's homework. Well if you wanna see the video  you can go  urlLink here . But seriously don't think it's that big a deal, i got and saw worse treatment in school. I got chalk thrown right in my eye by a teacher for not paying attention; and another teacher tore off the front page of my textbook because I cracked a joke that he didn't like.   Finally for a good laugh check out  urlLink Mr Brown's  page. I used to read his writings faithfully, they are incredibly funny but he went on a hiatus middle of last year. Seems like he's started writing regularly again so be sure to check it out. He pokes fun at the government, the water issue, the new NE MRT line, basically anything that singaporeans can identify with . Ok back to work. Damm sleepy though.

      Spend a better part of the day doing work-related stuff.  I really hate to stay at home on weekends, feel like I am wasting my life away by doing that. There is a     urlLink blues festival  today and tommorow which I would really love to go to but got no one to go with.  Note to myself: I need more friends.   Today was my dad's birthday and we went to this nearby kopi tiam (coffeeshop) for dinner, it was a pretty low key affair. Thank god it wasn't as awkward as it was the last few years when my mom will kept pestering me to wish my dad 'Happy Birthday'. I guess this year she finally gave up.  Thank you god.  Found a 24-hour Hungarian porn channel on the net, ok one more thing to keep myself busy with when I'm at home on weekends !

      It wasn't even a Bon Jovi  tribute band, it was even worse. It was Cherry Chocolate Candy, the local pop gal trio.  Talk about a big disappointment; I am pretty sure they mentioned the word 'Rock Band' in the email they sent out to us but have to check it again.  Anyway the starting was cool cos they actually made us massage each other. I was sitting beside a gal so I was more than happy to oblige.  Hey it's not everyday I get to have my (unusually large) hands on a gal's shoulders and neck alright, ok actually it's like never. But I had to massage the guy on my left as well; damm that wasn't fun at all. Ok now I think of it I dun know why I even did that voluntarily.   Anyway the worst part came when the 'rock band' proceeded to sing one of my most hated songs, the Ketchup song, and then tried to get us to do the Ketchup dance or whatever its called.  I got the hell out of there in a hurry.  Came back in for the lucky draw; I was really praying really hard to God to give me the !st prize which was a 3k hi fi sound system (my current one is totally screwed up) but well it didn't happen.  Maybe God was too busy responding to prayers asking him to  urlLink repair spoilt handphones .   But there were pretty good moments too, the MC got some people to go up on stage and do some really silly dances or act out stuff and they were pretty hilarious, some of them had the whole roomful of people laughing uncontrollably. And the food was totally awesome! After the function I went to Borders to look for the Mars Volta CD. It still wasn't in yet. Was really tempted to get Led Zeppelin's new 3-CD live album but it was like 39 bucks; I will try Music Junction over the weekend to see if I can get cheaper there. Yeah I have always been really thrifty (miserly?) when it comes to spending money on myself but on the other hand I got no problem splurging on friends.  Hmm maybe someone with a psych major can tell me why ?

      I got the chance to work from home yesterday; and I stayed up until 5:30 am this morning still doing work. Heh it's amazing how much difference not having to travel 3 hours in a day makes. Usually when I get back from work , I am so tired I just don't feel like doing any work-related stuff. Anyway I didn't get much done in the afternoon because I had a really bad headache so that was also another reason I stayed up so late. Ok enough about work; I am getting bored just blogging about it.  A pretty bizarre incident happened at the MRT Station today.  I saw this guy actually trying to get thro the station gates without paying ! He was following another commuter really closely and after she went through ,the guy tried to go thro the gates before it closed on him but he failed.  But he just went to another gate and tried again and he succeeded this time.  Some people will do anything just to save a buck.>  My company is having a function at the Grand Hyatt Hotel tommorow afternoon and there is gonna be a lunch buffet kinda thing and a 'rock' band performing so I am kinda curious to see what kind of music they gonna play; ok its probably gonna be stuff like Bon Jovi and Scorpions (yucks) but hey who knows I might get lucky and get some RHCP songs at least.   Watched Joe Millionaire yesterday; it's down to Zora and  the banker chick whom I can't quite remember the name. I think it's pretty obvious that the banker chick will outright reject him ; like hello she's a banking  executive, and she's pretty classy so doubt she would go for him without his money. However Zora would also probably reject him because she is pretty guarded so once he finds out that he lied she would probably just figure that he isn't someone she could trust.  Can't wait to see it next week. Yes I know it ended i's run in the USA quite a while back so  please dun post any spoilers thank u.   As you might or might not notice, my entries have been decreasing in frequency except during the weekends; heh it's probably gonna be like that from now on .  What to do work can really kill the mood to blog sometimes.

      My dad has this tendency to go on a cleaning spree every few months; today was one such day. When I got back home, I noticed that everything in my room was re-arranged and re-organized. Basically what he does is he goes through and pours out everything from my drawers and cupboards into the floor or table depending on his mood. Then he puts back everything one by one into where he thinks they should be. So of cos now I have absolutely no idea which drawers have what stuff; and not to mention I had some really private stuff in some of my drawers; but hell as long as it's neat and tidy right thats all that counts.  Oh and he mixed my 200-- music cds together with my 100-- vcds ; I am definitely gonna have a lot of fun sorting that out.

      Ok thanks to Ab for these two really bizarre products :  First, we have  urlLink Bumper Nuts , a website selling nuts that you can actually attach to your car  or any type or vehicle to show off to your friends.  You could even hang it on your kid's toy car.  From the website : "Any respectable parent would not let his kid ride around the yard without a nice pair of Bumper Nuts hanging off the back of their Hot Wheels!"  And urlLink  this  is for lonely gals who feel all alone at night .

      Yes I needed to get that off my chest.  I am really sick of how some people try to make fun of the Tamil language by using yan-de-pu-dan-ne and other such nonsensical words because they think its funny. And yeah this came about after i read this blog where the gal uses words like that to describe how this bangladeshi man was talking. And then I remembered what happened when I went out with my friends the other time; I called my mom and talked to her and one of my friends started doing that , using those dumbass words. I mean making fun of how someone's mother tongue sounds like; how low is that ? I doubt a Chinese person would like it if i went "Ching , Chong , Hoi, Moi " everytime he speaks mandarin or cantonese or whatever. I swear the next person who does something like that in front of me is gonna get it from me.

      The movie was really good ; I usually don't like to watch animated features but everyone who saw the movie highly recommended it so I decided to give it a try. Well I am glad I did because it was a really funny yet surprisingly touching movie.  And some parts of the movie were pretty scary; I probably wouldn't be able to look at a barracuda again without hatred in my eyes.; those fish are really evil I tell ya !  Ellen DeGeneres was really outstanding as Dory, the fish who only possesses short-term memory (immediately reminded me of Memento) . There were references to other movies as well ; but I will leave you to see it and find them out yourself. So basically I highly recommend it as well; wouldn't mind watching it again ! *hinting to any chicks who haven't seen it*   But there was this annoying kid beside me who practically remembered the movie by heart (god knows how many times he saw it) , and he was narrating the story to his friend or sister, thank god he didn't do it the whole movie; if i wasn't with a gal I would have probably punched him senseless.   Oh and had a great time with my net friend; was kinda afraid it would turned out awkward but she turned out to be pretty cool and chatty as well! Must ask her out again sometime.  Oh and here is the pic that Rani send me of herself.

      Met my friend for dinner yesterday; he was my junior college classmate and he's getting married 3 weeks from now. It seems like everyone I know is getting married now, I think that is when you know you are getting old. But he and his girlfriend have been together for the last 8 years which is pretty amazing isn't it. For me I still got 5 years more before Rani, my village virgin bride from Bombay, comes to Singapore so I guess I just have to wait patiently till then. But let me tell you I seen her picture and she's a hottie !   Ooooh I finally got someone to go with me to watch Finding Nemo! Well can't really blame her ;  few gals can resist me when the Indian Stallion turns on the charm ....alright alright so I whined and begged her to go watch with me and threatened to cry if she didn't. Hell whatever it takes right , it's the result that matters not the means.   Oh Mars Volta's new album, De-Loused In The Comatorium,  debuted at No. 39 on the Billboard charts ! It is quite a big surprise considering At the Drive-in's Relationship of Command didn't even break the top 100 (Mars Volta was formed by 2 of the members of At the Drive-In after they disbanded). I think its most probably due to the fact that they had Red Hot Chilli Peppers bassist Flea as their studio bassist for this album and also they were touring with RHCP so that kinda raised their profile a bit. I  tried looking for the album at Sembawang Music Centre at tampines but they didn't have it either. Really lazy to go down to Borders in town to get it; especially on weekends when it's so bloody crowded. I will probably just wait a couple more weeks and try again ; till then I will just listen to it online at the Rolling Stone website like I been doing everyday. But seriously people you need to go listen to it ; its totally out of this world, think punk meets prog-rock , or a punk version of Radiohead's OK Computer . And no the vocalist does not scream or shout; most of the time he sings and he has a really amazing voice. Check out 'Roulette Dares' to see what I mean.

      I just got my EZLink Card GIRO-Enabled. It's pretty easy all you gotta do is select the GIRO option at the Ticketing Machine at the MRT station and choose the amount of cash you wanna top up everytime the card runs out of money. So once the card has a negative value it will top up automatically the next ride that you take. Now don't need to waste that ONE MINUTE every few weeks to top up my card manually.    I always wondered why people like to rush up the escalators on the MRT station. Especially when the display shows that the train won't arrive for the next 4 minutes or so; even if they reach the platform first it wouldn't make a difference rite. Does anyone else do that? Leave a comment and explain it to me alright. And also when I get off the Boon Lay MRT Station people will never wait for me to exit first before they rush into the train. It got me so irritated that now i purposely bang into them (I'm a pretty big guy) when I leave the train. Childish I know , but hell they started it !   Went to Music Junction on Monday but they didn't have the Mars Volta CD; not sure if they gonna bring it in which means I might have to get it from Tower or HMV which is gonna cost me like a lot more.  . My tasks have been piling up over the last couple months so I told myself a couple seconds ago that I would I try to get one of them done by today. Wish me luck. By the way I really like my awfully pretentious title.

      You know how the government is raising cigarette prices to try and stop young people from smoking right.  Well I just had an idea, why don't they just raise the price of a cigarette pack to like a 100 bucks. That will stop people from smoking, period. You also won't see young kids sharing their cigarettes with each other, hell i mean when you pay that kind of money you wanna enjoy them yourself right !

      Watch MTV Music Video awards yesterday and Chris Rock who was the MC really got me laughing like crazy, the guy is so damm funny. But I have to say he has got balls, he makes fun of all the celebrities and even downright insults some of the people. After Good Charlotte performed on stage he referred to them the 'mediocre Green Day'! He also said Ashton Kutcher was 'literally a motherfucker' . But my favourite one was when he was saying how Americal Idol should get proper judges; "Paula Abdul judging American Idol was like Christopher Reeve judging a dancing contest!"  Yes so very mean I know but damm funny though.

      I am more emotional than I would like to be, and trust me it's something that is really hard for a guy to say.  I do have a tendency to get upset when people criticize me in a harsh manner or make really nasty comments. I try not to be (or show it)  of course, but it does really affect me. Call it a lack of self-confidence or whatsoever, but I am very very concerned about what people think of me, especially people I consider my friends.  Maybe because I know I don't have that many to begin with.

      BTW you people should know that there are FREE alternatives to Microsoft(MS) Office. So if you don't have the dough to shell out 300 bucks (I think) for MS Office or you don't feel comfortable with getting a pirated copy you should take a look at two alternatives, one is  urlLink OpenOffice  and the other is  urlLink StarOffice . Both can be used to open, edit and create MS Office documents as well;  of course sometimes the formatting looks different when you do open MS documents, they are two different sets of products using two different technologies.  OpenOffice is free while StarOffice is free for students, researchers and faculty members. I just think I should highlight this because before I joined my current company I had no idea that such alternatives were actually available.  I have to confess I don't have much experience with OpenOffice , I mainly use StarOffice and it does slow down sometimes for me when I am formatting a large chunk of text, but hey it's free after all; you can't expect it to be as good as a 500 dollar product can ya, but it still does a pretty decent job.   BTW note to myself : Don't ever buy comics for chicks for their birthdays again. If I do I promise to knife myself in the groin.

      OK just read this rather bizarre news at Soccernet. Chelsea, whom have been spending loads and loads of money on new players (100 million pounds so far), bought a Russian footballer by the name of  Smertin for 3.45 million pounds recently, but two days after signing him they allowed him to go on loan to Portsmouth, saying that he was a player they bought for the future.  Which would be perfectly fine if the player in question was someone young and still developing his skills, but the guy in question was a 28 year old!

      For the last couple of months, I thought that I was the innocent victim who was unjustly victimised in all of this; it took someone else today to make me realise that this wasn't the case.  And it was something that was really painful to hear, but once i heard the words I realised that they had a lot of truth in them.  Like someone I know always says, it takes two hands to clap.  I guess when things get really bad you always try to find something or someone to blame instead of looking at yourself. Well I have to admit that's true for me. At least now that I do know my faults I can at least try and correct them, it might be too late but I still have to try. But to the person who made me realise this , I just wanna say that I have always valued your friendship, but after today I have to say I feel so damm lucky to have you as a friend, because friends like you are really rare, at least for me.

      You know some people should be banned from making jokes. I don't know if they are trying to be funny or something but well ...tell me if you think this is funny...  Me  : How much did you get that cup of coffee for ?  Him : Ten dollars.  REALLY ANNOYING.   And also another time I missed the name of the person in a conversation a group of friends were having so I asked the person who they were talking about. He replied "The cleaner".   Like I said, some people should just stay away from jokes.

      Ok just watches Singapore's Brainest Kid , the local quiz show that pits our youngest bright minds against each other.  Well today was the gals' turn  (last week featured all male kids although I can't understand why they need to separate kids by their sex)  and.... well brainy wouldn't be the first word that comes to my mind, how about incredibly annoying instead.  9 out of 10 questions asked by the host ( the incredibly hot Cheryl Fox) was met with the standard response "pass" by the little brainiacs.  And even more annoying was the fact that they didn't even consider thinking about some of the questions, they just said pass as soon as it appeared on screen.  So for most parts of the show all you can see are the kids saying "pass" repeatedly.  Yeah that's quality tv for ya, I would put it right up there with WWE. But well Cheryl you can give me a totally uninterrupted lesson anytime baby. *fantasises*

      Alright I had a really enjoyable trip to Bangkok, it was a real treat! The food that we had at the hotel was really amazing; anything you wanted to eat was there , i could remember one of the nights i actually had lamb, prok, chicken and beef all at the same time. We also went to eat at this really wonderful vietnamese restaurant courtesy of J who treated us , really nice of him.   Another thing is that Thai girls are so damm hot ! Every 100 metres I walked there was a thai girl who will catch my eye. Most of them have really great bodies and really attractive features. Hell even the gal at the flea market I bargained with was hot, should have asked her to take a pic with me.   We only really went out  2 nights , both to Pat Pong and I bought a whole lot of stuff at the flea market; like a name card holder for 4 bucks ! Also bought a couple of stuff for the people back home, but couldnt buy much cos I only had like 100 dollars.   Of cos there are the downsides; it's pretty sleazy , at the side of the flea market u have the go-go bars with the thai women pole dancing. Then when we took a taxi or tut tut in the evening the driver will ask us if we want massage (the not so clean kind) and sometimes they will keep asking you repeatedly, I guess they earn quite a huge commision. Then we also came across young teenage boys who were dressed up as women. And an old chinese man with two young gals, one at each arm.  And so on.  A pretty funny incident happened in the hotel room. I ate a banana from the fruit bowl thinking it was free, then my room mate told me that it might not be. So I called the hotel reception and enquired; they said it was 500 baht !  But few days later I found out that they thought I meant the fruit bowl ...so that was a relief.  Anyway on the whole the experience was a really enjoyable one for me , I got to see a totally different culture and a way of living that was foreign to me. I took some pictures , not that much ...will try and put them up asap.

      hey people just a quick post b4 i got for my training. Well I haven't been able to get out much here because the last 2 days there was training the whole day followed by buffet dinners in the evening which kinda sucks, haven't even bought anything yet. But the people here are really friendly and there is this girl at the reception counter who looks hot as hell. But the hotel room is totally amazing (hell it better be when its 200 US dollars a night) but i accidentally ate a banana from the fruit bowl in the room cos I thought it was free; but when I checked it costed me 500 baht ...that's 20 Sing dollars talk about rip off! Hopefully I get to go out these last 2 days , I am flying back on saturday afternoon so there's not much time left. Sa-wa-di-ka ! (or something like that) .  p.s Anyone know how to say "How much you charge for extra service?" in thai?  Oh but the plane ride was really fun, although I didn't get to sit on the window seat like I wanted to ..sigh so spend the flight watching 'Finding Nemo'. And there was this really pretty stewardess smiling at me ...

      I have to admit when I first found out that Fergie bought a 18 year old teenager for 12 million pounds I was really skeptical ; it seemed way way too much for a kid whom no one had really heard of. But after seeing him in action in Man Utd's first match of the season I have to say it is starting to look like a masterstroke, the guy is a really exciting talent! He has a whole lot of flair, he was doing step-overs and dummys and man can he dribble ! And he was involved in all 3 goals after he came on , talk about an amazing debut !  And he looks pretty cute too which could attract a whole new group of teenage gal fans, although his hair a bit funny.  Btw I think Wenger should start training his team to play with 10 men, Campbell just got sent off. Thats two send-offs in their last 2 matches.

      All English Premier League fans should check out this game. Basically every week you choose 11 players and depending on their performances every week in their matches you get points. NO prizes but it is pretty fun trying to figure out which players to pick every week and who to drop , and also you get to play against your friends. Anyway if you are still interested,  create a team  urlLink here   After you create a team, choose to Join a Private Group.  Then, when prompted, enter the following information...  Group ID#: 8850 Password: 1234  That is the league that I am in.

      It's really hard to get me pissed off,  but someone is doing a real good job trying.  But the Thailand trip is just happening at the right time, I really feel like I need to get away from everything for a while. Even if it's only a week.   Watching Buffy on TV now but the damm show freezes every 10 seconds. It is so incredibly annoying that I feel like taking a bat to the TV. Lucky thing I don't have a bat.

      Oh just read in the Strait Times forum today about this person who was praising the National Day Parade (NDP) held last Saturday. I watched the parade, I thought it was really lame. First of all I hate the fact that every year they have to make it a point to remind everyone how multi-cultural/multi-racial Singapore is EVERY bloody year. Can't they give it a rest for at least one year at least. And also there was the lame-ass  chanting of "One People, One Nation, One Singapore" , kinda reminded me of the cheers we used to do during Orientation in my Junior College. Damm annoying and fake.   Anyway the only reason I watched it to see the Silent Precision Drill Squad (SPDS) performance by the military policemen , cos  I performed the same drill for NDP in 1998. It was pretty good, especially the guys juggling on top of the motorbikes, that was pretty cool. After that I switched it off.   They should have had a performance on the North-East line and SBS  and celebrate the opening of the world's first driverless train system. They could get various TCS actors/actresses to speak out on how much they loved the system; especially how they love paying higher fares despite the glitches still not fixed in the system, or how they like the fact that the Buangkok station remains closed which means the train moves faster because they don't need to stop at that station, or how with the new line the bus services along the route are removed so that they do not need to face the dilemma whether to take the train or the bus when they travel. And then add a skit that shows those residents who complain about the higher fares, removal of bus services ,or the closure of Buangkok MRT station (aka traitors to Singapore)  being persuaded by the government that they are wrong to complain....then make they chant "One People, One Nation, One Singapore!" (or risk being deported).

      Just realised it's been a year since I started blogging. I created my blog on the 1st of August 2002, after some persuasion by Diana, a net friend of mine, who however doesn't blog anymore. But I didn't really care much about my blog or updating it regularly until a month later, when certain events occured in my life that affected me in a really bad way, so I turned to blogging for a cheapo form of therapy.  But once I started I didn't really wanna stop, cos it did make me feel a whole lot better and also I felt the idea of expressing my thoughts into words rather liberating.  Cos I am sure there are times when everyone feels the need to express their thoughts or emotions to someone else, especially someone who is willing to listen.  OK now let me get back to my porn movie.

      Was supposed to meet my net friend today for lunch but she had to postpone it , no biggie but now I am stuck at home with nothing to do. It's only noon but I am already feeling bored as hell. Maybe I will dl and watch Star Wars Ep 2  Watched Austin Powers: Goldmember yesterday night cos a lot of friends were saying it was really funny, but I thought it was rather unfunny, I laughed like twice during the whole show. But have to admit the cameos by Paltrow, Spacey, Cruise were pretty amazing. Especially Paltrow.   I need to stop being so paranoid. Thought I did something to creep out a gal friend of mine a couple of days ago; but ended up that it was all in my head...*sigh of relief* .... well I did it once before so it was like deja vu you see. But it turned out that she was just having a bad day.   Oh yeah I saw a bunch of teenage Ah Bengs at the bus stop on the way to work yesterday. I think there were 7 of them , the youngest looked like he was at most 11 , the oldest 15. And they were ALL smoking, well they were sharing 2 ciggies between them but even the youngest guy was smoking. I dun know I just find it kinda sad.  At 11 shouldnt you be like playing catching and stuff instead of smoking?    OK all those non-singaporeans , please go to this  urlLink website  where you can win a trip to Singapore plus shopping vouchers and stuff.

      Eh no, got one more day right. Damm. Actually we were given 1/2 a day off tommorow but there is this (totally optional) training conducted by one of my superiors. I was talking to him about it now so I think it wouldn't be so nice to not go now. But it does ends at 4 , so I will just leave after that. And also I just got a TINY push from one superior regarding the big project that I am working on, got around 10 days to wrap it up AND come up with a complete write-up. Trust me it's gonna be really tight, and still got the trip to Bangkok on the 19th to prepare for. I don't know if I should get one of those luggage bags. I thought my sis had one but she had one of those huge sport bags, she used that for her trips. I am going with 2 of my superiors, sekali they see me with the sports bag like so unprofessional like that.    Probably gonna meet a net friend this Saturday, been talking to her on the phone for the last couple of weeks so I am kinda looking forward to it. YES I do have a lot of net friends, most of whom I 'met' during my 8 months of employment, I had no money to go out, and I  felt guilty about asking my folks for money also, so basically spend most of the 8 months at home, when I wasn't going for interviews and stuff. Anyway I got so bored so decided to go online on ICQ and look for chicks to talk to. Tried IRC but didn't really like it, i tried talking to this gal once and she immediately asked for my height and weight. Talk about shallow, I just wanted to talk! The others I met through their blogs. There are a couple of them whom I really wished I got to know much earlier cos they are such amazing people,  really glad I got to know them. People like C.  A friend did something today that I didn't have balls to do. More power to him i say.   Ok got to make this appeal to everyone: Some things that I blog about I don't really like to discuss in person, so please do not bring it up alright. Of course, I know that my blog is public and if I wanted to keep it private I shouldn't be blogging about it, but don't wanna waste time explaining why I do, cos from experience non-bloggers won't understand. So this is just a request , not a demand. Thank you.    sekali = whats the english translation ?

      Had to do a presentation during today's monthly meeting. I still got a tad nervous while doing it; I guess it's probably because I am not used to being the main focus of attention, it makes me really uncomfortable.  I have been feeling rather irritable the last couple of days for no reason at all, little things at work or in online conversations the last few days are really getting on my nerves; stuff that would normally not bother me, man hope this passes really soon cos I hate feeling this way.   Called a friend just now she just came back from Pennsylvania (sp?) where she was for the past 3 months, she had a totally great time there, hell she and her froend even chased a tornado in their car, just like in the movie Twister , and she took some pictures also, I will put them up as soon as she sends them to me, with her permission of course.   Sometimes hearing about all this experiences of my friends have make me realise that I have had a really boring life the last 24 years. I can't really recall one truly exciting thing that I did in my entire life, and that's kinda sad.  Most of it was because I have always been afraid to take risks because of the fear of failure, and I do know it's something I need to overcome and I am trying to, but like they say it's easier said than done.   Oh and  urlLink this  is for people who forward those emails to everyone else, you know the ones that promise you money or a handphone or good luck if you forward them.  I really HATE those emails by the way, so if you are one of them who does that you know what to do.

      Ok the title has nothing to do with this entry but just thought I would remind you guys that I am going to Bangkok!!! OK back to entry. As I and my colleagues were walking to a nearby coffeeshop for lunch,  we heard a loud screech followed by incessant (me trying to sound cheem) honking. As I looked down from the bridge, I saw this car stopping just in front of the ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) gantry.  It was pretty obvious the bloody driver forgot to put in his cashcard so he stopped abruptly just to do that. It was such a dumb thing to do, if the car behind him didn't stop in time it could have been a really nasty accident. I don't know how much the fine is for not paying the toll but surely it isn't worth getting into an accident right. Some people just put money in front of everything else, even their own safety.  Oh just had the most heavenly pastry brought back from Australia by my fellow colleague, damm I forgot what it was called but its a lot like apple pie. If it was any more delicious I would have probably have had an orgasm there and then. I think they have it at this bakery place in Bugis also, must go there soon and try it again.   BTW got a new  urlLink blog  that you pple should check out, started by a net friend of mine,  I think I was the inspiration behind it. Sigh feels so good to touch so many (online) lives in my small, humbly insignificant way.   UPDATE : Shammi just clarified that I was NOT the inspiration behind the blog. Hmm I am still skeptical though, I think I was, at least subconsciously.

      So went for the meeting at NUS at 10 am in the morning; the guy we met kept rambling on and on about what he and his students were currently doing and his vision for the future.  Some of it was pretty impressive I have to admit; but had nothing to do with the project we are doing with them. So what could have been a short 1/2 hour meeting dragged on for an hour and a half, and that was because because he had another appointment  (thank god).  However the project | am working on will certainly help bring funding to the organization if we get it off successfully; so hopefully I can complete it asap.   I paid my sister a visit after that cos it was her off day; well I haven't seen her in around 2 months so decided to just check out what she's been doing.  Ended up staying over, still here right now. Had chicken pie last night for dinner made my her mom-in-law; man it was pretty heavenly and at least a welcome change from the rice/curry combo that I have almost everyday at home!    Pretty interesting article in today's Life section of the Strait Times about inter-racial relationships and how they are more socially acceptable (or tolerated?) today. But an Indian gal friend mentioned an interesting fact : that although Indian guys with Chinese girlfriends are pretty common now, the opposite is really rare; that is you almost always never see Indian gals with Chinese boyfriends. Wonder why is that ?   P.S What is a reasonable selling price for a 2nd hand Omega external CD-Writer ( 48x24x48) ?

      That was what I said to the temperature gal when I saw her outside with another gal the building where I worked. Yes I am an idiot.  Of course I knew that as soon as I said the words, but it was too late. Well she did reply me though, told me she came to visit her friend who was working there. But after that I just said bye (I think I said bye) and scurried away before I said anything worse, don't know if that was possible though. "How come you still here?" ??? What the hell was I thinking? Sheesh ok maybe from now on I would like to be known as the Indian (Dumb)Ass. Oh well she and her friends were probably lesbians! It was almost as bad as the time when I went out with this totally hot gal, probably the hottest gal I ever met, and she asked me out for coffee after we went to watch a movie, and I replied "I don't like to drink coffee....".  Still have nightmares about that date.

      I blogged about having a  urlLink dream  about one of my relatives a couple days ago. Well last night I got news that she was asked to leave her house by her husband. Quite a bizarre coincidence rite. But it's kinda sad cos she has two really young kids, but she is better off without him in my opinion. But then again its always easy to judge when you aren't involved in it yourself.   Watched the finale of Joe Millionaire on Wednesday; Evan picked Zora, just as I hoped, and then the surprise twist was revealed ; they were given 1 million dollars to start their new life together.  But I later found out that the finale and pretty much the other episodes as well was heavily edited to mislead the viewers. Kinda makes you wonder how real the other reality shows on TV are as well. Well if you want to read some of the inside scoop on the show go  urlLink here . But you might not want to if you are going to watch next week's episode.

      38.7 degrees Celcius. That was my temperature this morning. I was pretty groggy this morning and had the worst headache, and to top it off I puked, although it was just water cos I didnt have any breakfast.  The doctor gave me 3 different type of pills, 2 for my fever and one for my running nose and thankfully it seems to be working now. But I am still feeling really cold. Hopefully I can go back to work tommorow,  I have 2 days MC but with the amount of work that needs to be done I can't really afford another day in bed. Ok back to the bed.

      Went to play pool with a friend, got totally trashed , but he did give me some tips and I think I did improve slightly. But I still can't break properly its pretty embarassing, and sometimes I tend to miss the ball completely.  Need to practice more. Oh and I gave him a burned copy of Mars Volta album. He's the 2nd guy that I gave it too. It's a little crazy but I really want everyone I know to listen to the album, its just so damm amazing. Hopefully if they like it they will buy the original album and support them. Yeah I am a dreamer.  Oh and bought a couple of stuff. First was a book from MPH ,"Bioinformatics for Dummies" (it's for work) and the other is Audioslave's self-titled album which I am listening to now.

      Just had a large stuffed crust pizza for dinner, of cos I didnt eat it alone, I shared it with my mom. But I probably ate 3/4 of it.  But the good thing is that it was a vegetarian pizza. Was Inspired by a friend who recently turned vegetarian herself.  Ok I am off to read the first chapter of my intro to philosophy book, although i am sleepy as hell now.

      I went to the library after work yesterday to get a book on scripting, couldn't find any so borrowed a book titled " An Introduction to Modern Philosophy" instead.  Well just wanna try and expand my horizons if possible, but the truth is I still haven't touched it. Ok I am gonna try read a chapter a day, I will blog about what I read (and hopefully learned) tommorow night. Was supposed to go out with someone but she cancelled on me.  Been happening to me way way too much recently.  But she's sick so it's just my luck.   Got a presentation in NIE tommorow morning, its gonna be my first ever presentation to potential customers so i am a little nervous. Hope it goes well! OK off to bed , really need some sleep now.   Oh by the way some good news, my bank account has gone from a measly 30 bucks when i started work to a pretty healthy amount now. But the bad news is that i saved up so much because I haven't really gone out in quite a while.

      Due to and overwhelming sense of boredom, I decided to turn on MTV to see if there was anything worth listening to. The first song i heard was this song by Lena ( i think she sang the god-awful ah beng anthem Barbie Girl) , and the song went something like "It's your duty...to shake your booty." Yup this is the crap they are playing nowdays, and that also reminds me of the other totally dumbass song by Nelly where he advises his poor female friends that "it's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes". Probably so that they don't get dehydrated. Nice fellow.   Then a couple of videos later is Limp Biskit's new video. Yeah unfortunately one of the worst bands I ever heard are back with their new album.  I seriously don't know how people can actually listen to something this awful, all their songs sound almost exactly the same, and Durst basically just keeps complaining about how everyone is against him yada yada.  When you are a freaking millionaire who gets to hang out at the Playboy mansion, you don't get to complain.

      Ok this was one of the most boring days in recent history. I spent the whole day from 8 am at NUS for a whole series of lectures, there were around 11 altogether and it stretched from  8 am all the way to 6, with only 2 breaks for lunch and tea-break.  And out of the 11 lectures I only found 2  that were actually interesting, the rest were so boring and dry I had trouble keeping my eyes open.  Really feels like I wasted the whole day there, should have gone to work instead.   BTW I have been listening to Mars Volta's new album like non-stop since I got it,  definitely a shoo-in for my album for the year.  OK I know I have plugged this album a few times already, but seriously go listen to it at least once. You will either hate it or love it. (Hopefully it's the latter) But either way, I can gurantee you have never heard anything like it, and you will probably never will.   "THE MARS VOLTA have painted an other-worldly musical canvas so vivid, one listen and you won't remember which way is up. It simply doesn't get any better than this."   urlLink Review   "... it's hard not to feel that "De-Loused In The Comatorium" is the auditory equivalent to awakening from a musical coma that has knocked us out for the past half a decade."  urlLink  Review

      Called my friend in UK just now. She's finally settling in her new room at the dorm, after having trouble with her accomodation initially. Gonna call her again next week. But it still seems so strange not talking to her every night like we used to.  Ok almost every night. Really miss talking to her.  BTW if you wanna make a call overseas sign up with  urlLink Sunpage  , it's only 3 cents a minute for overseas calls to a fixed line number (calls to a mobile phone is much more expensive) . And it's free subscription and registration so you have no extra costs.   I spend the whole afternoon rushing to finish this task that's due on Tuesday.  Man I really really hate to do work on a weekend, sometimes I wish I had a job where once you finish your workday you can go back home and not worry about it anymore. A job like an air stewardess for example.   Ok the Man Utd vs Arse match coming up in 10 minutes. I'm outta here.

      Went to my cousin's place this evening, it was his birthday today so he had a small party at his place. It was pretty cool, he actually mixed a drink for me , i forgot what it was called, sounds like pepsi-cola ...he's a bartender you see.  Anyway it was really nice catching up with him cos I haven't seen him for like 6 months. Oh and he lent me a whole stack of CDs, VCDs and porn CDs to bring back, I didn't really want the porn CDs being the decent innocent guy that I am, but it's not really nice to refuse a guy on his birthday so I reluctantly accepted.  Ok going to watch them right now. Oh and he was also nice enough to lend me his guitar book, hopefully I can finally learn to play one.    Oh and before I forget, happy birthday michelle  !

      One of my close friends is currently working as a clown's assistant. He wears a giant chipmunk suit and plays with kids. But this is the really interesting part. He waves at chicks and they wave back. And when they wanna take a photo with him, they tend to hug him pretty tightly, which obviously he doesn't mind at all. But I just find it amazing how gals would hug a complete male stranger just because he is in a cute looking costume,  it's like they don't even realise that there's a guy behind the chipmunk!

      I found out something really amazing recently; I have somehow found a way to make myself invisible to some people. I could be sitting in the same room as them but they wouldn't even realise that I am there.  And sometimes it can even turn invisible people who are in close proximity to me, those people don't notice them as well.  This is a really cool power to have, if not for one big problem.    I don't know how to turn it off.

      Ok this is so weird, I am losing all my stuff the past few days! I lost my Nokia 8250 in Penang, i lost my departure card at Penang airport , which means i had to rewrite all my information on a new card on the spot, while my bosses waited for me. And now I can't find my namecard holder with all the namecards of the people who were interested in the project we demo-ed in Penang. And now I am freaking out cos I have to send to one of my bosses the contacts so that he can contact them.   While I am freaking out , let me just say I have learned quite a lot from my trips recently. I was basically hired as a technical person, but after the trips I gotta see the sales part of the business as well. Of course I am still struggling right now; I have never been much of a people person, even less so when it comes to strangers and having to talk to clients and sell our services and products to them.  But the big bosses have given a lot of advice on that part of the business, hopefully I can pick it up as fast as possible.  I got another presentation next week to a client from a local university, so it's all happening hard and fast right now, and it's all just a tad scary. Ok now back to looking for the namecards.

      After my Penang trip, I can safely say I think all women should pierce their navels, it is as sexy as hell.  Oh and speaking of which, I was on Business Class on SQ for the flight back to Singapore,while my bosses were on Economy due to some mix-up in Malaysia arranging out flights back. Yeah that was really weird. But the difference in service from Economy to Business is really huge, too bad I only got to enjoy it for like an hour.

But gonna call her tommorow , she told me Sunpage has really cheap IDD rates for calls to England, will check that out tommorow.

      Went out with some of my colleagues yesterday, had a pretty good time. But just one thing, we end up talking about work most of the time. But I think that's the only thing that most of us we have in common we are all pretty different people with totally different interests, it would be hard to imagine most of them as friends if we weren't working together.   Anyway we went to watch Pirates of the Caribbean, it was really good, although it had a little too much swordfighting for my tastes, but Jonny Depp was a riot , he's just so brilliant at playing this weird characters (remember Edward Scissorhands?). Oh and it had the really hot chick from Bend It Like Beckham , Knightley, i read in a review she was only 17 when they shot that movie; you know you are getting old when the new and upcoming stars that are emerging are all younger than you.

      Yes I am back from trip to Penang and man did I have one hell of a time ! OK first day was really really sucky cos me and my colleague spend the whole damn night preparing the machines for demo-ing at the conference, and the following morning we missed our breakfast cos we were setting up the machines at the booth.   But from the 2nd day onwards it was really fun , we went swimming at the pool (and I had a pretty good workout) and had a  pretty good seafood barbecue. Then on the 3rd day I went parachuting, not sure what's the term for it but basically I was up in the air in a parachute dragged by a speedboat , well it was damn short (only 5 minutes) and cost me 50 ringgit , but what the hell right its a one time thing so we went for it. And it was worth it cos I tell you the feeling of being up there in the air is really amazing.  Oh we also had the really famous Penang laksa, man let me tell u it's the best laksa I ever tasted, and it tastes nothing like the Singapore version. If you ever go to Penang u gotta try it , it's along Penang Road. I would have had 2 if I wasn't on a diet.   Oh a funny incident : we were having drinks with our bosses and I asked for a vodka lime, but the waitress didn't quite understand me, instead got me a vodka neat with a slice of lime ! Trust it that's not something you wanna taste at all.    Oh finally something not so good, I lost my handphone in Penang, I brought it there just so I can keep track of the time (I don't have auto-roaming enabled) but it must have slipped out or something. Kinda sucks cos I got all my contacts in there .  But I did write down some of my contacts in my address book couple months ago so it's not that bad.   Finally why are there people wishing me 'happy birthday' using ICQ when still got 2 days more ? (Subtle way of revealing my birthday)

      Kinda worried out, the guy who is supposed to prepare the machines at Penang for our exhibition couldn't do it in time , so I have to prep them myself on SUnday night once I reach Penang. That is assuming all goes well, if there is some problem with the machines that I can't solve then I am screwed.   Got a haircut 2 days ago, the barber cut it shorter than I would have liked and now I look like a bloody army recruit.  But then again it feels really nice when the wind blows against my almost bare scalp, so I am not too upset about it. Downloaded the video of Madonna's performance at the VMAs just to see the kiss between her and Britney and Christina , and it was no big deal , like one second only. Kinda disappointing really. Yeah don't why it is, but the sight of chicks making out is a turn-on for most guys.  Ok now I am going to prepare my presentation slides for Penang , will be doing a presentation at a local university in Penang. Nervous as hell.  Doing it while I am listening to the new Mars Volta CD that I got yesterday from Borders on full blast, ordered it like a month ago but haven't had the time to collect it. You people should really check it out, itts damm bloody amazing.

      Phew finally got the Installation working today!  Thank god I couldn't get any sleep last night because of it. Yeah my flight to Penang is confirmed; I am leaving around 7 pm this coming Sunday and will be back on Thursday night . But me and my colleague will be staying in separate rooms at the hotel which I think is kind of a pity cos I think we should save our company's money and share a room instead; I definitely wouldn't mind, after all we are both mature adults right. Alright so there's the small matter that my colleague is a chick, but I am sure she can control herself around the stallion (with a little bit of effort) . Yeah that's me,  always putting the company in front of my own comfort.   On the way back on the train I saw this ad that showed a scorpion with the word 'Fearless' and a slogan which said 'I am who I want to be' or something like that. And guess what it was for; a damm Siemens M55 phone.  So what , someone with a M55 is deemed to be fearless and original ? Do people actually fall for this kind of advertising?   Oh and the good people at Blogger responded to my complaint about not being to post using Mozilla.  All I needed to do was clear my cache.

      OK bloody hell I don't know what google did but the page where i add entries to my blog looks really weird in mozilla; kinda disappointing that they never tested it on other browsers before they made the changes permanent.    Other than that I had a pretty great day ! Ok well a stressful day cos I am really rushing my work stuff; I need to test out an installation by tommorow morning so that I can tell a guy in Penang how to do the same thing. But the great news is boss junior just told me I am going to Penang ! Woohoo when I heard that I was happy as hell cos it's another chance to fly ! Yes I really love flying dun ask me why; it's probably just the idea of being in the air and getting to see the whole country below you.  Not to mention the really cute air stewardesses ! Well it's not 100 percent confirmed cos he just told me, it's not really in writing or anything but keeping my fingers crossed. But in the meantime I am kinda feeling the stress now cos need to prepare something for the conference at Penang.  An another really cool thing happened, I met a blog/net friend at City Hall today. I was pretty sure it was here cos she has loads of pictures at her site so I was like staring at her. She noticed me doing that and gave me a look, you know the "what you staring at, you handsome Indian perv?" kinda look. Anyway I called her name and then intro-ed myself and she finally realised who I was.  But her boyfriend looked at the stallion with some rather obvious jealousy so I just left quickly; ok ok I am kidding he was quite a friendly guy.  Hope he doesn't read this, he's pretty buffed , could probably cause some serious damage to me if he wanted.

      It's easy for me to say I am not bothered by it, which is why I keep saying it to myself. But saying and doing is a totally different matter. Sometimes I feel something very close to hatred, thats how much it affects me. Yet I don't show it, not because I don't want to , but because I can't. But I am desperately waiting for that day, the day when I can show it.  I know there is no point in feeling this way, life is too short to bear grudges yada yada, but yeah where feelings are concerned, rationale goes out the window. I thought that things were going to get better at one point not too long ago, but it turned out to be a false dawn. But when you are in the pits there isn't any way but up right?

      Recently, a colleague of mine was telling me that for universities in France, freshies have to undergo acts of extreme humiliation by their seniors, and this happens for all new students, not only those who are trying to get into fratenities or whatever they call it in France. Acts such as having to consume human excrement. And I was pretty puzzled as to why smart intelligent adults would allow themselves to be degraded in such a manner, I didn't get it. And he replied that they did so because they wanted to be considered part of the society or social circle so they are willing to do it. I didn't really have anything to say to that at that time, but I thought about it a lot after that.   Anyway this is my opinion now; everyone wants to belong to a group or society, it's in our nature. But when you have to degrade and humiliate yourself just so that you will be accepted by that group or society, then it definitely isn't worth being a part of. And this also extends to having to change your behavior to be accepted by that group. For me at least if that group cannot accept you for who you are and appreciate you for it, then there is no point modifying your behavior just so that you will be accepted by them, because that would mean betraying yourself and what you believe in. You are better off looking for a group who accepts you for who you are.   Of course I am not talking about individuals who deliberately try to harm other people in the group with their actions. But seriously, as long as their actions don't affect you why should you care or be disturbed or irritated by what they do?   Ok yeah just needed to let that out.

      Kill Bill totally rocks !! Most stylish movie I ever remember seeing and it really blow me away right from the opening sequence. The fight scenes were totally amazing (but extremely gory) and the movie was full of hot ass chicks, the hottest of which was this Japanese girl dressed in a school uniform. I don't normally go for that but this gal was like evil to the bone, and for some reason it was such a huge turn-on. I almost orgas when she asked this guy at a bar whether he wanted to f**k her or not. OK ya I know I need help. But seriously she can slice my gut anytime! Well then of cos there is Uma Thurman, She had a baby during the shooting of the movie, but you won't even notice it cos she looks so damm hot in the movie. Dialogue-wise it was very interesting but nowhere near Pulp Fiction, but afterall it's a homage to the Samurai and Kungfu movies of days yonder (me trying to sound cheem). But still an amazing movie, probably the best movie I seen in quite a while, and I wanna see it again !!

      There was a time when we would wish each other good morning or at least acknowledge each other's presence when we came in. However, nowdays that doesn't even happen. People just stare blankly at their screens without looking away, even when someone sits besides them. I guess things change over time.   On a happier note, I am going to watch Kill Bill later with a friend at Bugis, on a big ass screen somemore (well it better be big ass cos it has seats up to row X!). Really looking forward to it cos I am like the biggest fan of Pulp Fiction, one of my all time fav movies.  But I am wearing a new shirt that seems kinda tight around my massive biceps ...ok ok flabby upper arms happy! Hmm it didn't seem so tight when I bought it.

      Spoke to a friend online about music and nothing else for like more than an hour last night, and it was so damm fun! It's been such a long time since I found someone who shared my passion for music; and who actually knew and was a fan of like almost all of the bands that I love. Never thought it would happen. Hell she even has A Perfect Circle's Thirteenth Step and Mars Volta's De-loused in the Comatorium also, how cool is that. Oh and she loves Led Zeppelin!! She also introduced a few new and pretty cool sounding bands to me as well so I am gonna get Muse's new album soon! Sigh I think I am in love liao. Ok ok Geets just kidding lah, you know you are the only one for me right? ;) Hmm hope none of the other gals I said the same thing to reads this entry. *worries*  Interesting thing happened at Sim Lim Square yesterday. I bought a 150 CD-Rs from this shop for work purposes and used NETS to pay and he gave me only the NETS receipt. That receipt didnt really specify the name and price of the products so I asked him (nicely) for a proper receipt. He showed me a really irritated face but went back and printed one anyway. But while he was doing it, he was talking to his colleague in Mandarin. I didnt really understand much of what he said but I heard the words 'Mah Fan" which of cos I knew meant 'troublesome'. The asshole probably thought I didnt know any Chinese. Anyway I already paid so I couldnt really say anything but yeah it pissed me off. Maybe I should have told him off after I got the receipts but thenl I have to admit I am pretty non-confrontational, one of my faults. But  this is pretty common, although usually they speak in Hokkien when they wanna say something behind our backs, but my parents can speak Hokkien fluently so they always tell me what they said.  And some of the stuff they say is really bad.

      OK at my sister's place right now, it was a rather quiet Diwali yesterday as she didnt really invite that many friends. Which is kind of a pity cos she has some pretty hot looking friends. Things only started getting interesting late at night when my cousin came over with his wife. We talked and he bought this rather nice ale that was called "India Ale" which ironically is from UK. It was pretty good actually and tasted a whole lot better than beer. And it went down much easier as well.  Then we all went over to a friend's house and I had another 3 bottles of ale, something called Master Brew, so by the end of it I was feeling a tad tipsy. But yeah ale is definitely better than beer, so those who don't like beer should try it out.  Had a whole lot of food as well, in fact so much that I over-ate and felt kinda sick afterwards. Oh and I brought my camera to take some pictures but I didn't realise the batteries were flat, and the closest shop was an Indian shop so it was closed. Must remember to bring spare batteries next time with my camera. But my bro-in-law did take some pictures so I am probably gonna put them up really soon. Keep watching this space till then.   OK I am dying to go watch Kill Bill.  Watching Uma kicking ass in a sexy as hell jumpsuit thingy, movies don't get better than that.

      Went to meet my friend at Siglap last night to pass her back the LOTR book I borrowed from her. Heh I read like 3 chapters only, I found it so damm boring. But it was really nice to meet up with her and catch up. Hopefully we don't take too long to meet up again. Came and called my friend in Nottingham, talked for like an hour, kinda missed talking to her. Oh and I got her to listen to one of The Perfect Circle's songs and she really liked it! How cool is that, finally someone likes one of the bands that I dig, that doesnt happen too often. But kinda sad, I asked her if she missed me but she said no. Guess I shot myself in the foot with that question. Sniff...Well I miss her. (This is your cue to go "Awwwwwwwwwww") But yeah she's probably the first indian gal who I actually could talk to and have a decent conversation with.

      I forgot to mention one more thing that I loved about American Beauty.  The families in the movies try to keep this illusion of being a really happy family to outsiders, when in reality they are anything but.  And I think it's really true in real life as well, Most people usually seem to have this really happy family life, at least to their friends and frelatives. But I wonder how many of them are actually just faking it. My guess is that it's the majority. My family ? Nah I think I wun answer that.

      On the way back on the MRT , I saw this teenage couple who were standing pretty close to me. And the guy was like hugging her and showering her whole face with kisses the entire time, in a really playful way.  And it just made me smile.

      So I haven't found anything that striked me as beautiful so far today. Talk about sad. Well it's not exactly true, there's this beautiful and really amazing thing that I see almost everyday but it doesn't really count. Was also trying to find beauty in my work to make it less tedious but that didn't happen either; I guess beauty isn't EVERYWHERE. ;)   Was listening to A Perfect Circle's Thirteenth Step the whole day while doing my work. I am so in love with the album. It's incredibly mellow (read: very soft) but hell the music is just so beautiful. Go check it out.   Not having a great day today. Can't wait to go back.

      I love this movie. And I really mean love. It works on so many different levels. In the movie there's this guy who walks around with a camera and films everything he sees . At the start he just seems so creepy to everyone and probably to the viewer as well. But as the movie unfolds, you find out the real reason behind it.  He reveals to us that he sees beauty everywhere,  even in something as simple as a plastic bag floating in the wind.  And thats the reason why he goes ard with the camera, so he can capture every moment of it. I love the scene where he reveals it to his gf, he is so overwhelmed with emotion as he said he. But yeah I believe it to be true, that there is beauty all around us. But most of us just never take the time to look for it. But you know what I am going to try find something of beauty tommorow.    The other favourite part of the movie i really love was the end. Lester the main character  finally finds out how to make himself happy at the end of the movie,  but unfortunately it's taken away from him soon after.  It's sad but at least he was happy for a time. Seriously I wonder how many people live their whole lives without finding happiness. I know I am still looking for it.

      Went to this local gig at Far East Plaza with one of my colleagues yesterday. There were around 7 bands in total. Well I wouldn't say it was that great; The first 3 bands were decent, the rest not really that interesting to me. I guess the problem was that all the bands basically played two type of music . One was mainstream stuff (Creed , Matchbox 20, Blink 182, Buckcherry) and the other was punk, both of which I am so not into.  I have to say my fav act of the day was Gall Bladders, it was fronted by this cute as hell chick who was bubbly and had such a great personality.  They played mostly pop punk stuff, and a pity that for some of the songs I couldnt hear her vocals.  But there was this song called Stupid Porridge Girl that was pretty cool , loved it. Maybe someone can tell what local bands you would recommend to someone who is currently listening to prog rock (Tool, Mars Volta, early Radiohead) and classic stuff like Led Zep and Jimi Hendrix.    Speaking of music, A Perfect's Circle's new album is totally amazing. I was sure as hell that Mars Volta's album would be my album of the year, but after hearing 13th Step hmm might have to reconsider.  This is not an album for those looking for something heavy, in fact most of the album is incredibly mellow. But god the arrangements are amazing , and that voice, Maynard has the best voice in the business. This the kind of album that is perfect to listen to at night while you are lying in your bed. Oh and I am gonna get Bowie's new album as well read really good reviews about it. Damm I been buying like 2 CDs a week, need to stop/control myself really soon.

      OK so went to see Underworld at Tampines yesterday with a friend. Despite a lot of bad reviews from almost my friends I still decided to see it cos Audrey was raving about it. And you know what I am pretty glad that I did cos I really liked it!  The cinematograhy and sets were cool as hell and the story was really engrossing! For those who don't know the movie is about this centuries-old blood feud between the vampires and lycans (short for lycantropes aka werewolves) .  I suck at reviews so thats all I am gonna say, but if you like dark gothic movies then go see this ! But if you are looking to be scared then skip this, its not a horror movie. But couple complaints about the movie, the movie should have been way longer , it really seemed really rushed (which was probably why there was a not so subtle hint of a sequel at the end)  ,  it's a fantasy movie , and in my opinion those movies should take the time to unfold the story.  Another complaint was pretty boy Speedman (from Felicity) was totally forgettable. He was supposedly the guy caught in between both sides but his acting was so lame u don't really care for him. But still I would recommend it.

      I think educated people sometimes tend to think they are superior, at least in some ways, to those who aren't. We have this notion that we are more civilised and/or cultured compared to them, and we live much more . I have to admit that even I have been guilty in the past of that, like when I see people living in villages or tribes, I would have a opinion that they are very backward compared to us, and of lower intelligence, Just because they can't communicate in English or don't have knowledge of things that we know.  So why am I bringing it up? Cos I found piss in one of the toilet seats in the company lavatory just now. I find it amazing how people who are supposedly 'educated' or 'civilised' can't even learn how to piss properly. And even if they don't, is it too much work for them to use the damm toilet paper and clean it up. I doubt they would do the same thing at home so why the difference when it comes to a public toilets? People are so impossible to figure out sometimes.

      OK was pretty disappointed today by the horrible response to my email to my JC friends which i sent out on Monday about meeting for dinner tonight. Well some of them couldn't make it and they responded which was cool, but some did read the email but did not reply, instead I had to find out from another person that they couldn't make it. Which I don't really understand cos how difficult it is to click the 'Reply' button and just tell me? Anyway only 2 others replied to say they could make it. But one of them backed out today when she found out it was only 3 of us. Which kinda irritated me further cos for me it would have still been nice to meet up for dinner and talk cock, considering I haven't seen her like forever.   Anyway I called my childhood friend and ex-neighbour and we are going to go see a movie later this evening at Tampines. Really wanna get out of the house tonight, don't wanna stay at home. I don't know why but I really can't stand staying at home nowdays, it's just so incredibly boring and like got nothing to do. It wasn't that bad when my sis was still staying there, but now she's not its like really bad.   Was kinda amused when I saw the front page of the Strait Times today about the first Chinese astronaut going into space, and the launch was in China . Is that really that big a news that it deserved the front page considering the fact that space exploration hasn't really advanced in the last decade to my knowledge. And the article when on to describe in detail what his first space lunch was (rice with pork or something), and his first words in space which caused 'euphoria' in China. It was "I feel good". But of course,if those words don't cause mass euphoria then nothing will!   Just read about a commando trainee who died after his instructors pushed his head into the tub of water 5 times as part of a survival training course. In the official statement released by the Ministry of Defence, they stated that "instructors are not permitted physical contact". YA RIGHT. Say that to my instructors in army who grabbed me by the collar and shaked me around, and hit me on my head. It has probably been going on forever (the water torture) but of course unless something serious happens no one cares. That's the way the army works.

      Something funny happened at the work pantry yesterday. A colleague dropped a coin on the floor and it landed between her feet. And I was sitting like 3 meters away and I shouted "It's between your legs!" . She gave me a really weird look when I said that, probably cos there were other people around at that time as well. Women, can never understand them.

      3 cents a minute my ass! When I got my bill today I was pretty shocked cos the amount due was like 78 bucks. Anyway i checked the bill and I was charged 25 cents a minute instead. So I called up the hotline and apparently the number in UK that I called was in a "special area" which charged their own levy or something, and it applies for any UK number with that area code. Which of cos they conveniently forgot to tell me when I signed up. After that I asked them (with a no little sarcasm) whether they had any other special areas in other countries that I should know about, and the gal said no.   Going to my sister's place for some short prayers later and dinner. Actually was quite reluctant to go at first cos it's like so far away and Im pretty tired, but well haven't seen her in quite a while so yeah changed my mind. Yeah I know the things brothers do for their siblings. But of cos I am gonna ask her for money for the cab ride back!   BTW American Beauty is on Channel 5 this Sunday at 10, if you haven't seen it already then make sure you see it, cos its a really brilliant movie , probably one of my favs ever. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as this burnt-out family man who then suffers from a mid-life crisis and starts behaving totally irrationally. And oh yeah every one of the characters in the movie are dsyfunctional in their own little way and its often really funny, but also kinda sad at times. Anyway just watch it.   Read great reviews about A Perfect Circle's new album,  urlLink Thirteen Step . gonna get it soon. For those who don't know A Perfect Circle is a side project of Tool (which is like my fav band ever) 's frontman Maynard with  former Tool guitarist Howedel. It's similar to style to Tool but not as dark and they don't have songs as long(Tool songs average 6 mins or more).  Can't wait to get it, cos I was pretty disappointed with Tool's last album, it was good but nowhere near their classic Aenima.

      I got on  urlLink Friendster  a couple of months back, but never got around to using it that much. Heh well until now.  It's basically a way for you to stay connected to your friends online. And you are also connected to their friends , as in you can view their profiles and try to get to know them if you want. Anyway you should check it out , and if you wanna add me then just search for me using my singnet email addy, if you don't know it then you don't deserve to be my friend !  Hmpph! Ok you know what I sounded really bitchy there, it's a little scary. Ignore that.

      Went to see Seabiscuit with a friend yesterday, the movie about a little horse that could, and about the jockey who ride it. SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD. It was a pretty decent movie, and quite inspiring especially the way Seabiscuit went from a abused and mistreated young foal that was never given a chance to a champion racehorse. But the movie isn't just about the horse, its about the jockey who rides it and how he overcomes a really rough beginning to his life to make something of himself. In a way, he and Seabiscuit are very alike and fate brought them together. But my only complaint is I didn't really feel a really strong bond between him and the horse. But that could be just me. Oh and the other complaint is there aren't really any hot chicks in the movie. Hey I am a guy after all.  After that had dinner at this pizza place, and a really good conversation going throughout the evening. Haven't had much of that recently, online conversations are nice but it doesn't really compare to the real thing. Yeah I know, I REALLY need to get out more.  Oh and I bought Lauryn Hill's MTV Unplugged CD, listening to it now while I work. I have been a huge fan since the Miseducation album, but when the Unplugged album came out I was still unemployed and horribly broke.  And saw it at Borders yesterday and decided to get it. So far it sounds really good, but there's way too much talking by her for a music CD. She should have really taken the spoken bits out, in fact if she did it would probably fit into a single CD.   Also placed orders for The Roots' Things Fall Apart and Dredg's El Cielo while I was at Borders, should be getting them in a month's time. But the damm Roots album is 28 bucks, should have asked the price before I ordered, stupid of me. I will try and find it at HMV and Tower, if can find it for cheaper then I  will probably cancel the order.  Arrgh I hate my stupid Sony Ericsson T100 phone, it hanged on me again , the damm keylock is on and I can't switch it off. It happened to me once but I manage to unlock it then, but been trying for like 15 minutes and I still can't get it to work.   Finally I would just like to say I love chicks in singlets, they always look hot as hell.

      Nothing to blog about recently. Oh I saw this gal with incredibly long hair on the train a couple of days also , it reached up to her ankles! Damm was so tempted to touch it, I really got a fetish for chicks with long hair. Such a turn on.   Yesterday we went to this eating place called the Reading Room with a couple of gals from a different department. Striked up a pretty interesting conversation with this gal, she seemed really nice. One of the other gals spilled some sauce on her jeans as well, sigh wasted I wasn't beside her or I would have helped her wiped her off, being the nice gentleman that I am. But it was really fun meeting new pple from the organisation.   Going to see the movie 'Seabiscuit' tommorow. I would have rather preferred to watch Underworld which seems to be a pretty cool fantasy movie in the vein of the Matrix, but well the horse movie (it's about a horse) should be pretty good as well , read a lot of positive reviews on it.  But don't think there are any chicks in it.   My mom woke me up at 6 am, before she left for work, to remind me to go buy lunch for myself when it was time for lunch. And I shouted at her to stop waking me up everytime she feels the need to tell me something totally useless. Sigh can anyone say OVER-PROTECTIVE. And this is not the first time she did it, when I was sick last week and was in bed like the whole day she came in like every hour and waked me up to ask me if I was alright. Sigh I wonder when will be the day she will finally realise that I am already 25 years old.

      Interesting site  urlLink here , it's a makeover site that allows you to upload your own picture and change it however you want, hairstyle , lipstick whatever you want. She's doing one with my picture. Will put it up here when it's done. Always wanted to know how I look with lipstick also.   Went to a chinese restaurant for dinner with the big bosses, it was mainly seafood which isn't one of my favourite types of food but hey the food was free so can't really complain. But dragged on until 9+ so now kinda tired. But one of the gals there was rather attractive!

But it's gonna be a pretty short trip only 2 days, but I enjoyed my time the previous time so looking forward to it again.  Just got the SDU (Social Development Unit) newsletter and I'm half-tempted to try out some of the activities. There's this tennis for beginners lesson and its like 80 bucks for 10 lessons which is pretty reasonable. But I don't even remember where I put my SDU card.

      My fever went up again last night, so I had to go see the doctor  for the 2nd time. She gave me another huge assortment of pills and 2 days MC.  Now i got 5 different type of pills to take 3 times a day, and add to that a cough mixture.  This is the first time I been down with flu for more than 2 days,  I always been able to recover by the 2nd day. A little worrying; could this be a sign that my body is starting to show it's age ?

      Had a really weird dream last night. I dreamt that i got an email from my family doctor saying that one of the pills that she gave me was the wrong one, so I had to return it immediately. And it seemed so real that I actually checked my email to see if it was true,  ignoring the fact that there was no way in hell she could have had my email address, or if it was true she would have called me on Monday itself. People can be so irrational sometimes.   My temperature went back up to 37.9 . ARRRGGGH

      Went to watch a German movie (The english title is "Us") on Friday with a couple of friends. It kinda sucked , it was about the life of this group of working adults in Berlin, there was no plot whatsoever. But the really hot German gal in the movie bared her boobs so that was worth some of the 9 bucks I paid. But everyone went back after the movie which was a little disappointing, was hoping to talk cock a bit longer with one of them whom I don't really get to see that often.   Other than that my weekend was a total waste, I spend it at home playing CM4, taking Chelsea and practically thrashing everyone else in the league. Yes I got no life. I was thinking of taking up roller-blading and at least try to get some exercise over the weekends but can't find anyone who would wanna do it with me on a regular basis at East Coast or something. Any takers?  Been really busy this week. No mood to blog.   Today : 4/10

      If you noticed I dun have that emotion crap thingy at the top of my blog (that tells people how I am feeling) anymore; don't know why I put it up there in the first place, I never update it that often anyway as it's too much of a hassle. Instead I am just gonna put like a rating out of 10 for every day. 1 being a total sucky day where i feel like commiting suicide , 10 will be a super happy day, like the day I lose my virginity. But dun expect a 10 anytime soon, for like the next 10 years.    Speaking of days, had a pretty good day ...err..today.  But I just got hold of some information that I am not sure if it was best for me to know. Like I realised recently, sometimes ignorance is bliss. Oh well guess I just have to wait and see how it all folds out.   I been meeting this gal from my workplace a couple of times on the way back home; I was introduced to her once but the problem is I totally forgot her name and I was too embarassed to ask. There was this one time I was talking to her and she had her badge around her chest area, hanging by her neck.  So I tried to sneak a peek at the badge to see if I can see her name while I was listening to her.  The thing is I think she caught me looking and probably thought I was like checking out her boobs or something.  Sigh this happens to me way too often.   Today :6/10  Listened to : Dredg, White Stripes

      Heh as much as I hate it sometimes I tend to make assumptions about people based on previous experiences.  One is that most women are pretty scared when it comes to fiddling with their computers; they get so worried that they gonna screw it up by installing software.  So imagine my surprise when a  urlLink gal  I was talking to couple days ago was actually installing freeware that I was recommending on the spot and trying them out! And heh yeah I never would imagine that she was the type who would be interested in that kinda stuff, that was my mistake. Heh but it was a really pleasant surprise....too bad she's taken.  :( Anyway check out the following freeware that I recommend highly for any PC.  1.  urlLink Irfanview   Free graphics editor/viewer that I swear by.  Allows you to scroll through pictures in a directory, as well as very simple to use resizing functions, even allows batch resizing. very useful when you wanna resize the whole lot of pics from your digicam.   2.  urlLink Mozilla Browser and Email Client 1.5  Much better alternative to Internet Explorer. Kills pop-up windows, password/form manager, tab browsing, loads faster,  bigger screen size.  Email Client is way way better than Outlook Express. Even has a built in spam filter.   3.  urlLink Startup Mechanic   Shows you all the programs that are automatically started when you start Windows and categorises them to different categories (Essential, Useful,Useless, Harmfull) and allows you to disable them.  Recommended if you think your windows is really slow when you boot up.   4.  urlLink Spybot Search and Destroy  Searches for and removes spyware on your computer. Some of which load when you start Windows or go online and are a real resource hog.  But ff you have programs that have ads e.g. Kazaa Desktop they won't work after this.

      Went to a friend's place for Hari Raya this morning; man the food was really amazing! Had ayam masak merah and rendang mutton, tell you I almost orgas on the table. I had like 3 pieces of the chicken , wanted to have more but decided to control myself. Spend the rest of the day re-organising my CD collection, my dad just dumped all the CDs and VCDs together and it was really annoying cos I had my albums sorted out alphabetically. But the good thing is I finally found my  urlLink OK Computer  CD !! Been looking for it like for months so it was a big relief. I first heard this album in 1997 but it still amazes me now.  Oh i finally got my 2 CDs from Borders which I ordered like eons ago . First is  urlLink Things Fall Apart  by the Roots and the other is  urlLink El Cielo  by Dredg. Heh but haven't really heard them that much, cos been listening to OK Computer. Will post reviews when I can. Oh and I also bought Men are from Mars Women are from Venus, "the definitive guide to relationships", thanks to a really strong recommendation from a guy friend. Yeah yeah I am getting desperate ok.    i'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me they'd think that i'd finally lost it completely i'd show them the stars, and the meaning of life they'd shut me away ......but i'd be alright  Subterranean Homesick Alien by Radiohead

      OK my hiatus from online chatting was short-lived. What to do, when you are at home on a weekend there is only so much porn you can watch before you get bored.  So what was the reason for the hiatus you might ask. Well  lately I been sorely disappointed by a couple of my so-called "friends".  And with the really crappy situation that I am in right now I seriously cannot afford to have any more disappointments.  Which was also the reason why I was questioning who my real friends are two posts ago. I think I came to a conclusion today. Friends are friends more for what they do for you rather than what they say to you. Of course words mean a lot as well, but sometimes they aren't enough on their own. Someone can say that they consider me a friend and they actually cared for me, but it would mean a lot more to me if they showed it. And the problem is you can't do that online. And its very easy to type comforting words even if you don't mean them, cos there is no way the other party can tell if you are sincere or not. And I will admit that even I have been guilty of that.   It's getting worse for me now. I am someone who is chatty by nature, and the problem is now I have no choice but to keep silent.  I feel like a bird in a really really small cage who doesn't even have space to extend his wings. This feeling is something I never felt b4,  and its not something I wanna feel again if had a choice. But unfortunately I am going to, and probably really soon. I am not blogging about this cos I am looking for sympathy.  I am blogging about this because I need to. Ok the bird analogy was a little silly.

        You are Form 3,  Unicorn : The Innocent.   "And The Unicorn knew she wasn't meant to go into the Dark Wood.  Disregarding the advice given to her by the spirits, Unicorn went inside and bled silver blood..  For her misdeed, the world knew evil."   Some examples of the Unicorn Form are Eve (Christian) and Pandora (Greek). The Unicorn is associated with the concept of innocence, the number 3, and the element of water. Her sign is the twilight sun.  As a member of Form 3, you are a curiousndividual.  You are drawn to new things and become fascinated with ideas you've never come in contact with before.  Some people may say you are too nosey, but it's only because you like getting to the bottom of things and solving them.  Unicorns are the best friends to have because they are inquisitive.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Well I shouldn't be surprised.

      You know the saying "Ignorance is bliss"? I never knew the full meaning of that phrase until very recently. Yeah sometimes it is much easier when you don't know about certain things, for the simple fact that what you don't know cannot affect you. Of course it might sound like denial, and it probably is in a way. But when there is a certain situation that you have to face very often, it really helps when you aren't reminded of the harsh reality, because when you are, it will affect you no matter how much you try not to let it.   Oh I need to get out of the house this Saturday otherwise I will be forced to assume the role of house mover for a "friend" of my dad. No I am not being selfish, it's just someone I really really don't like. *Refrains from using the word 'hate'*   Lately I been thinking about what the word "friend" means. Looked it up at dictionary.com and there was this 2 meanings.  1. A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts. 2. A person whom one knows; an acquaintance.  Pretty interesting because the first definition automatically implies the second one but the opposite is not necessarily true. And also the know part is ambiguous, how well must you know a person before you can call him or her a friend? Or is it just enough to just "know" of the existence of that person?   The reason why I been wondering about this is because lately, friendships that I thought I had either totally evaporated or weren't as real as thought they were. I have always been really quick to call people friends, but now it seems to me I have to choose who I consider a friend with much more caution. Well when I figure it out you will be the first to know.  Oh and I been reading Sophie's World , "a novel about the history of philosophy". Can't say  I love it, I have to admit some parts of it are really deep and I tend to get lost until I have no idea what they are talking about. But can't really give an opinion until I finish the whole book.

      Some people are just unbelievable. I am talking about the contestants of the reality skin flick "Are You Hot?" that is on Channel 5 every Monday at 10pm. The contestants who got rejected for not being hot enough get so upset about it that they cry. 1 person even while sobbing insists that all her friends and family found her hot. Hey if I cried everytime someone told me I wasn't hot, I would be crying every other day. I mean if you gonna cry about something it shouldn't be about the fact that someone whom you don't even know though your ass was too big. Hope they get teased land ridiculed about it by their peers; cos they really deserve it.   Going over to my sister's place later, it's her mom-in-law's birthday today and my mom is cooking ayam masak merah just for her. Heh if you haven't tried it you have no idea what you are missing; it's like my favourite food ever. Also will be nice to catch up with the sis, but only wish we could have some alone time together, that would be nice cos we haven't really talked one to one for a long time.

      From  urlLink somethingawful.com     Bon Jovi: This Left Feels Right What could be more insipid than Bon Jovis greatest hits? Nothing, right? Wrong! These are acoustic re-workings of their greatest hits. The fact that such a thing exists is all the proof we need that Satan is firmly in control here on Earth. So, maybe you wanted to like Bon Jovi but "Livin On A Prayer" was a little too rowdy for you. This is surely the collection you need!  Tori Amos: Tales of a Librarian Ever wanted to listen to a woman whine about being raped for an hour? Let me save you some money by letting you in on a little secret: lots of support groups are free! Actually, that was pretty cold, not all of Tori Amoss songs are about being raped. Some of them are about having a miscarriage. Either way, this best-of collection is sure to be grabbed up by thousands of brooding teenage girls and their pussywhipped boyfriends.    Heh yes Bon Jovi bashing is one of my fav pastimes. But the Tori Amos bit was a little much though.

      Yes I haven't been blogging. Hmm let's see what I been up to .....spend the whole weekend learning how to use Photoshop, extremely frustrating but now I know what layers are so it was good in the way. I also figured out how to save an image without the damm canvas; just save it as gif instead of jpeg. Ok theres probably a way to do it with jpeg but hell as long as it works right. But still struggling with Flash. Was supposed to watch Spanish apartment with a friend but now it is only showing at GV Grand and at one time slot of 2 pm.  Quite a waste cos I heard from a lot of people that it was really funny.   Haven't been online much as well; kind of lost interest in online chatting recently, for reasons better left unmentioned.

      Last night, I had the most wonderful dream I could ever remember having. You cannot imagine the level of disappointment that I felt when I woke up and realised it wasn't real. Let's just say it's something which I really really want to happen to me in real life, but it has a 0.1% chance of happening. Well just hope I can have the same dream again really soon. If only we could control our dreams; dream what we wanted to dream. Ok ok it involves a gal happy !

      I have a new found hatred for Photoshop 7 and Flash MX. I am trying to do a Flash presentation , and I need to use images in it. But I don't even know how to save the image as a jpeg file without including the damm canvas in the background. Why the hell is there a crop tool when it doesn't even crop !!!!!!!

      I got stood up yesterday. I was supposed to watch Matrix Revolutions at the IMAX Cinema at GV Grand with a friend, we planned it like 2 weeks ago. Then 5 hours before we are about to meet she tells me she can't make it because her boyfriend isn't too happy about it. So that left me little choice but to call everyone I knew to ask them if they are free, even those people who I haven't talked in like years. Hey I was desperate ok. One of them even asked who I was, and I was like "Remember me , Gilbert, the guy who sat 10 rows behind you in primary school?"; she hung up.  Then there were the many others who said they need to wash their hair. Is Monday like a hair-washing night or something? *confused* Anyway finally I manage to get a friend who was free that night, I was so relieved cos I was really thinking of going to watch alone if I couldn't find anyone. I told her I loved her when she said she will meet me, and she almost changed her mind. Gotta be more careful next time. Thank god I didn't offer to give up to her my precious virginity.  Anyway ended up having a pretty good time, we went to Brewerkz for dinner, I whacked a poretty large pizza cos I didn't have lunch and I also kinda took some of her food. Had this beer called Golden Ale, its this really light beer that has very little bitterness, so if u dun like that bitter beer taste you should give it a try.   Ok now about the movie. Matrix Revolutions was a big disappointment. All the questions I wanted answered were either not answered or answered in 2 sentences. For example, I was curious how it was possible for Zion to be destroyed and rebuilt seven times. Who rebuilt it when it was destroyed each time, if all the humans in Zion were killed? That question was never answered. The question of how Neo could stop the machines in the 'real' world was explained in 2 sentences, which would be fine but it was very unconvincing. I didn't really understand the ending as well but will not give any spoilers here. But the IMAX cinema was really amazing, totally big ass screen I am definitely gonna try and go there again really soon for another movie.

      Had a pretty good weekend. Had dinner at OlioDome at Wheelock place with a friend and then went to see the french movie Novo on Saturday night. Oliodome was a pretty nice place, and we got a table by the window which was kinda cool. Definitely wanna go there again. The movie was so-so. The premise was really interesting but the execution was really poor. It got pretty confusing at some points, there were scenes that didn't make sense at all. Anyway its about a guy with short-term memory who hooks up with a gal who falls in love with him, but he can never remember her the next day. She finds its really exciting at first , because when they make love each time it seems like they are making love for the first time. But she finds out about his past history and she realises that she is unable to keep the relationship going because she doesn't believe there can be love without having a history together. Yeah pretty heavy on the romance side. But lots of full frontal nudity, unfortunately that also included the guy. And there was a scene where the guy, totally naked, hugged his son who was like no older than 13, and it really made me uncomfortable. But yeah I guess in Europe, full frontal nudity isn't a big deal, I remember watching 2 other Spanish movies that had those too.   Yesterday I went to see Kill Bill for the 2nd time, yeah in case you haven't figured it out I love that movie a lot. Really can't wait for the 2nd installment, but got no idea when it's gonna be released. Must check that out.  Bought the new Muse album and listening to it now. It reminds me so much of early Radiohead, from the Pablo Honey days, very guitar-oriented and his vocals also quite similar to Yorke sometimes. Sounds really good so far. More comments on it when I listened to it a couple more times.  Skipping lunch today. Suddenly I just lost my appetite. Oh well it's good in a way cos I think I been piling a little bit of weight.   Hmm I wonder, since I work through lunch time would that entitle me to leave the workplace earlier?

      It has been a tough week. Thank god for creating this thing called the weekend. But I still got some stuff to do b4 monday. First somehow I need to come up with a Flash presentation thingy, and I got absolutely no experience with flash so its gonna be really interesting. I borrowed the Flash MX book from library so hopefully that will give me a head start.   Really wanted to go out last night, I was supposed to meet my sister last night but she was too tired.  Gonna meet her next week but today with another cousin of mine. Who is cool but I actually just wanted to spend some alone time with her and just talk, we haven't done that in a while. Oh well.   Nothing much else to update.  Life not very interesting now.

      Been a really tiring last couple of days, was rushing to get a project done due to some external pressure. Stayed till 9:30 yesterday at the office. k maybe not as late compared to other people but it was kinda creepy cos it was so silent; there was no one around. Anyway I also really wanna get this project off my hands, been working on it for way too long and hopefully I get to move on to something else that will have some interest for me.   Heh I been going around asking people about their views on pre-marital sex; was just curious about what other people thought about it. Had some really very interesting opinions on it and some really surprising revelations as well.   Ooh I got tickets to Matrix Revolutions at GV GRAND at the IMAX theatre on Monday. It's supposed to have like a big ass screen but I haven't been there so looking forward to it. I really loved Reloaded, it left me pondering over tons of questions so I am really looking forward to finally getting the answers.   Going to watch another French movie this sat night, its called Novo and it's about a guy who has short-term memory so he keeps forgetting this gal that he fell in love with. And the gal will desperately try and make him remember for good, yeah sounds pretty romantic right eventhough its a tad Memento-ish. And its R(A) so yeah gonna see some French boobs! Woohoo!! Hmm that reminds me of one of my net friends who wore a french maid outfit in a picture recently......damm she looked hot in it.   Speaking of boobs, I kinda offended someone a few days ago by making a reference to their cleavage in a picture. Yeah that's me, always not knowing where the line is. Really sorry. Must tone down the sex jokes.

      Went to see 'The Frenchmen' ,a French movie about 4 middle-aged guys who were having different problems with their relationships. One cheated on his wife repeatedly with different women, another had a much younger gf who wants to settle down but he was reluctant to, the 3rd found out that his wife cheated on him once and the last didnt have a r/s and shags older women.  the movie was so-so , pace was a tad slow for me it seemed like it lasted like 3 hours when it was only 100 minutes long. But I think the movie was trying to show that most marriages have their fair share of problems but the people in the r/s still stay together because of the fear of being alone . The guy who cheats on his wife still does so but the wife accepts that hes screwing other women. The single guy hooks up with a slightly psychotic chick who is like so obsessive over him, the guy with the younger gal ends retiring and up moving in with her , and the guy who got cheated on got back together with his wife.

      Really crappy day today. Few things feel worse than the feeling that you are being pitied.  Even if that was probably not the person's intention.  And I feel like I am in real danger of losing something that I really treasure.  Hope it's just me over-reacting.  But I just can't help feeling that I do not deserve all this.  But hey who said life is fair right.   I was blog-surfing a couple hours ago and I stumbled into 1 which mentioned that she found my blog humorous and insightful.  It really made my (crappy) day. Yeah ok so its a little strange to be glad about being flattered by someone whom I never met or talked to , but with the day I had it was really what I needed.  At least there are still people who think I'm not all that bad. Now I just have to make sure I never meet her so that she will never think otherwise.   I was supposed to go drinking with my bro-in-law and his friends tommorow night , but I changed my mind. They are nice people and all but I can't really click with them. So will probably be staying at home alone.  Not exactly the way I wanted to start my new year but not much choice there.

      OK so it (XMAS) wasn't as bad as I expected. Gotta ogle at some of my really hot cousins (not blood related ok) , and of cos as is customary every year everyone was raving about my mom's ayam masak merah. But I was pretty quiet the whole day, just not very comfortable around people I don't know well, unlike my sis who is like super sociable. But hope my sis learns how to cook it soon, cos my mom isn't getting any younger and its a really tiring dish to prepare. But I don't know if it is me but kids nowdays seem so much older than they look. I was kinda checking out my uncle's daughter who I thought was at least 17-18, turned out that she was only 14.   Went to a pub in Changi on Saturday with a couple of friends and hanged out for a bit.  It was really nice to hang out with them for a while and talk cock, and one of them bought me the Kill Bill sountrack for Xmas. Thanks babe !  Hanged out with my sis at her place yesterday. Been hanging out with her since Xmas eve, and its good cos nowdays its really hard for us to spend any time together, and her living so far away doesn't really help either. But think she really liked my gift, that was cool.

      Ok think it's time to look back at the past year.    Friendship    Probably the most important thing I learned the past year is who my friends are, or rather who isn't. I have always been quick to call people I like my friends, probably because I don't have many to begin with. But events that happened the past year made me really question the meaning of friendship.  And right now I have to admit I probably have like only 5 people I would consider real friends right now. Ok ok 3 if I dun count my 2 dogs.  But I am not on good terms with one of my dogs now , damm asshole peed in my room so I am giving him the silent treatment until he apologizes.     My Lack of Social Skills    Yup ok I known for a while I was socially inept but only in the past year did I realise that my social skills were only slightly better than a horny spastic monkey.  But man this was a really hard lesson for me to learn. ...sniff    Career Goals    I was always sure about what I wanted to work as when I graduated, but now I have no freaking idea.  And it's kinda scary cos I'm already 25.     Women    K I think I need to stop thinking about women who are way way out of my league.  So goodbye Uma Thurman, and hello kopi tiam auntie! Yes she's really not that bad looking, and there's this undeniable sexual tension everytime she hands me my kopi-o in the morning. Think it's time for me to explore that.   Ok so all in all I would give this year a 4 out of 10. It was mostly bad, but there were some good things that came out of it. Met a few really wonderful people that I am really glad to have the pleasure of knowing....err what else.....well i think my dick grew like a cm longer thanks to all that time at home watching porn. Oh and of cos the ability to spend relatively carefreely was also quite nice to have.   Goals for next year   1. Get laid. 2. Lose weight. 3. Get laid after losing weight. 4. Expand my social circle.   5. Watch less porn.

      Really looking forward to Xmas day. Cos every year its the same exciting thing. My relatives whom I never see for the past year come down to eat our food and make boring small talk while pretending to be interested about what we been up to. I seriously do not understand the point of doing it year after year but apparently we are obliged to invite them because they invited us for Deepavali or Hari Raya so it would be rude of us not to invite them. Well I have a brilliant idea, how about we screw politeness and only invite people who we really want to invite? First of all it would save us a hell lot of money and time in terms of food preparation and entertainment. Oh and let me not even get to the xmas decorations my dad puts up year after year. I think he could save a lot of effort by leaving them all year round because it never changes.  Yup really looking forward to Xmas day.

      Just remembered I forgot someone else for my XMAS present list. Damm this is hard. Still not sure what to buy for 3 people. Will be doing last minute gift shopping today and tommorow.   BTW things I would really love to have for XMAS:  1. Take a Look in the Mirror by Korn 2. Tenacious D by Tenacious D 3. Any book on Led Zeppelin  4. Play by Moby  I can't be any more subtle.  A friend asked me to go clubbing with him and his friends on Xmas Eve. Quite hesitant cos I am not really the clubbing type, let's just say that some people are just not born to dance. But the alternative is to stay at home and stare at my xmas tree with my 2 dogs, which i been doing every year. Damm I just hate dilemmas like this.

      Went shopping for clothes on Sunday with a friend. I really HATE shopping. Mainly because I can never get clothes that fit me.  I saw a couple of shirts that I liked but when I tried them on they dun fit and thats the largest size. Is it my fault that I have a bigger stomach bone compared to most people !? Anyway I ended up getting 2 shirts thats it. Gotta get my pants and shoes another day.   Also got a couple of xmas presents from Borders, but just realised I totally forgot to buy a present for one person. I have to go down to Borders on wednesday again.   Just finished watching "As Good as It Gets" on Channel i , i think I watched it like 10 times so far. I am usually not into romantic comedies but this movie is really something different altogether, mainly because the 2 leads in the movie aren't your typical romantic leads, they are both pretty dsyfunctional in their own way and i think this sets it apart.  And of cos there is that scene where Helen Hunt is wet to the core wearing a flimsy T-shirt.

      Had a really long dream last night. I dreamt that I had to go to some European country for work. When I reached there I went to the seaside, there was a waterfall near the shore and I started taking pictures of it. After that I was at some apartment with my boss and another colleague, and we started talking. Then it was time for us to go back to Singapore so we left the house and got ready to take the cab to the airport, but then I remembered I forgot my bag. They waited for me while i headed back, but I couldn't find the apartment that I was in, so finally they left without me to the airport. Can't remember anything after that.  Coincidentally two of my colleagues are overseas right now. Heh I think it's probably a manifestation of my desire to join them.   I read that Saddam's relatives claim he was sedated before he was taken in which was why he didnt resist when they found him in the hole. But I am wondering how is that possible, did they like throw sedatives and a syringe into the hole and asked him to inject himself ? Or filled the hole with sleeping gas before they dragged him out?  Doesn't sound plausible.

      Haven't been online much recently, been spending my time in an alternate fantasy world i.e. playing the Neverwinter Nights expansion, Shadows Of Undrentide. Playing an evil dual-wielding fighter/rogue who so far has robbed dying people, held a woman's baby for ransom after rescuing it, threatened to kill the mayor if he didn't agree to my demands, and back-stabbed (literally) allies. Damm fun when you lay traps on the ground and lead the stupid enemies to them, and then watch them walk right over the traps and dying without me even using my +1 Short Sword with 1D6 Cold Damage and +1 Keen Dagger. Yes I am an RPG geek happy?   Was on leave yesterday, was supposed to go cycling but change of plans last minute and ended up playing pool with my cousin. Still haven't started my exercise regime that I promised myself to get on. Oh well nevermind I will wait for my basketball khaki (pal) to come back from Melbourne on Xmas Eve. *procrastinates*  Was gonna post my favourite 5 albums of 2003 with a short review of each album, but well I found out that I wasn't really the reviewer type, find it very difficult to put into words what I loved about the albums. So anyway here is the list without any comments.     De-loused in the Comatarium by The Mars Volta   Thirteenth Step by A Perfect Circle   Elephant by The White Stripes    El Cielo by Dredg    How the West was Won by Led Zeppelin    Have to give really high praise to Mars Volta, most groundbreaking stuff that I have heard since OK Computer. A definite must-have for any serious music fan. It is so full of emotion, inventiveness and free experimentation that it will make you realize how much all the other bands suck in comparison. Speaking of which I was watching this MTV show where the topic of the day was "your favourite band" and viewers sms-ed their view. The top 2 were Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park. Linkin Park I can at least understand why people like them (as much as I hate them), but Limp Bizkit ??? Can anyone tell me why they are so popular? What am I missing? Ok think it's time for me to get off my high (musical) horse.   Oh ya for the first time I am getting presents for people for Xmas, cos finally can afford to! And also I hope this will allow me to buy their friendship so that I can add more people to my friendster page (so far only 20 something!). You know they should have like a rating system for friendster. People with more than 100 friends should be given special rights to insult people who have less than 30 friends by telling them they have no life etc. by leaving comments on their pages. This will then spur the insulted lowlifes to get more friends so that they themselves can do the same to others once they have 100 friends. In this way everyone will end up with lots of friends (those who don't will hopefully commit suicide) and the world will be a happier place.   Overheard this at the workplace an hour ago, really cracked me up.    "It is not a lie, it is a change in direction"    Heh those ang mohs...have a really good way with words.

      Sigh you don't really know how bad you look till u see yourself in a picture. I saw a couple few days ago and damm I look more like a pregnant mare than a stallion. Damm depressing. The following morning I did push-ups in the morning, which I haven't done like forever. Not gonna disclose how many I did before I felt like fainting, but let's just saymy dog could have done more. Anyway I am going cycling tommorrow at East Coast, hopefully I lose a couple of inches by the end of it. *Hopeful*   I found out about the Asian Blog Awards through some of the blogs I regularly read. Checked some of them out and there was a few nominees who openly critised other blogs that were nominated; either attacking their content, their poor English or their design. Yeah true some of the blogs I read I didn't think were that great. But don't think its necessary to publicly denounce them cos that just seems a little arrogant, not to mention really mean. If you don't like a blog, then don't read it. It is as simple as that. Yeah some of them say it's just a joke but I can't really see that as one; a lot of people take their blogs seriously and they might take constructive criticism, being ridiculed is another matter. Having said that I did make fun of someone's blog a couple months back, cos I thought he was religious to the point of being ridiculous, but yeah it was a tad mean. So if he's reading this , sorry alright!   BTW how come my blog, with all its exceptional writing, irresistable humour and philosophical insights (which has probably changed at least 2 of my 5 readers' lives), wasn't nominated ? I guess some things in life just can't be explained. Or maybe too many people tried to nominate me at once, hence causing it not to be added to the list. Hey I am in computer science, it happens really often ok !

      Yeah nothing to blog the last few weeks, well not really but I cannot blog about work. Oh did go to dinner with a friend at Oliadome on Monday and hanged out at Borders later, that's about it. Heh was reading Dilbert, damm that comic is really funny as hell, and can really relate to the jokes about the workplace. Thought this one was really funny.    1st colleague : I would like you to join the TTP project.  2nd colleague : What does TTP stand for ? 1st colleague : TTP stands for the "The Ttp Project" 2nd colleague : *Groans*    Haha don't you just love recursive jokes ......eh wait a minute... damm I really need to get laid.

      Went to a distant cousin's "coming of age" ceremony. For the unintiated, this is a ceremony that is perfomed for a gal when she reaches puberty and is performed by some Indian families, usually the more traditional ones.  Didn't really wanna go but I had no plans anyway so I did , at least I got to catch up with my sis and a cousin who I recently got pretty close to.  But the father of the gal who was undergoing the ceremony seemed a bit arrogant. My uncle was eating the fruit cake which was given as the door gift , and the guy came over and asked if he liked it and proceeded to highlight the fact that  it was homemade and WAS really expensive.  I was tempted to go "WOW that's really impressive" but didn't, otherwise I probably wouldn't get to bring back the cake, which I have to admit had a really nice homemade and expensive taste.

      Had a really bad day yesterday. The kind that almost makes me wanna pray to God asking him to help me out.  Anyway was watching Survivor yesterday night and one of the contestants, John, won a reward challenge by getting the other contestants to believe that his grandma just died (which wasn't true), so that they will take pity on him and let him win. This week he is making promises to the others by swearing on his dead grandmother's grave.  But it is really interesting how manipulative people can get, almost made me forget the sad fact that I am at home alone with nothing to do on a Friday night.    Today: 2/10

      I am famous !!! I got my letter published in today's Streats, check it out it's at the bottom of page 16. I wrote about measures that could be taken to solve the problem of pet abandonment.  Please spread the word around to all your friends and let me enjoy my 15 sec of fame. But rest assured you normal folks, the Stallion will not let fame go to his head, I am still the same charming, innocent boy I was before all of this happened, only difference now is that I am a writer for Streats !!! Well they did edit out some parts of my letter, like how my dogs help improve my social life by making chicks believe that I am sensitive and caring but hey that's their right. Well at least I found my true calling, I wanna be a writer !! Yup I think should give up on being a porn actor and use my newspaper-worthy writing skills.

      I fell in Orchard a few days ago. I was having lunch with my sis and it started raining really heavily.  And my new totally hip shoes, while nice to look at , are apparently not made with functionality in mind cos I kept slipping. And then I fell. Right at the traffic junction where the pavement meets the road near the Thai embassy. It was so not hip. But I did like jump back up in a totally hip manner and this chick who was staring at me seemed pretty impressed at my fast recovery so it wasn't all bad, hell she was smiling at me !   Oh been thinking a lot during the long Chinese New Year break (hey there is only so much porn you can watch in 3 days)  and I came up with this brilliant extension to Friendster.com that they should consider.  See, what happens when u fall out with a friend, do you delete her from your friendster list? Then what happens if you patch things up with her again cos then its kinda weird to ask for her authorisation again. So I propose a friendster probation list. If you had a falling out with a friend, you can put her on the friendster probation list. The system then sends an email to that friend informing her that she is in danger of being deleted as your friend. This will then cause her to try and patch things up with you out of desperation.  After which you can take her off the probation list and be good friends again! Sigh you know I really should do something with all these ideas and make me some money.   Still on the topic of Friendster, I just added another one bringing my total to 32 !! Yes thats 18 more to 50.  No I am not keeping count.  But one of them isn't really my friend, I don't know who the hell she was and she just added me. I thought she was someone I knew long ago so I authorised her. Then asked her who she was and she told me she didn't know me.  Oh well every new gal friend brings me a step closer to getting laid so can't really complain.    Was watching this documentary just now on this American gal who was given up by her vietnamese mother when she was really young, so she went back to see her.  However, it was not the joyful reunion that she (or even I) expected , her mom and her family had really high expectations of her which she couldn't handle. Add to that the culture shock and the inability to communicate with her mom and siblings, and the end result was that she was overwhelmed. She went back to U.S. very sad and disappointed, regretting her decision to come to Vietnam and wishing that she had just treasured the memories of her childhood instead.  Yup thats life ain't it ,  it's not always a happy ending.

      Installed  urlLink Java Desktop System (JDS)  on my 2nd hard disk a couple days ago. JDS is Sun Micro's implementation of SuSe Linux , it is basically a low-cost alternative to M$ Windows. Comes with Instant Messenger, StarOffice (Office Suite that allows you to open, creat and edit M$ Word/Excel/Powerpoint docs)  and Mozilla browser among other stuff.  But horrible thing is that for some 'unknown' reason they left out MSN Messenger support in the instant messenger.  Big mistake in my opinion and a tad childish. Anyway I had no choice but to manually install it.   Went to watch Stuck On You with an old friend earlier. Really wanted to watch The Last Samurai instead but gave in . Kidna regretted cos the movie really sucked balls, I barely laughed the whole movie.  Highly not recommended.  Recently re-met this NUS schoolmate who was a friend of a friend of a friend , I barely talked to her back then , u know with me being super shy and all back then, but been talking to her online the past week or so , and she is a really interesting person to talk to.  Oh well better late than never right to know someone. Actually theres this other gal, a very bubbly chick that I would have really like to get to know in Uni, she seemed really friendly. Now can't remember her name even....oh well no point regretting.   A friend recommended me this pub called The Crazy Elephant where they have like bands over the weekend. Really wanna check it out. Anyone else recommends it ?  Eh comment ah, if not then I look damm stupid for asking.

      OH David Bowie is coming to town ! think its the first or second week of February. Thinking of going to watch him; ok I haven't heard a lot of his music to be honest, but this was the guy who inspired Manson's Mechanical Animals so thats really something. I am already downloading some of his old stuff to listen to.  Anyone else interested in going ?   OK and also A Perfect Circle is going to be performing in Perth the end of February. I really really wanna go see them, and maybe at the same time take a holiday too there.  But looking for someone to go as well ! But the thing is I don't know that many people who are into A Perfect Circle. It really sucks how no decent bands come to Singapore.

      Weekend was a total waste.  Watched my beloved Man Utd play like crap and lose to bottom club Wolves thats about it. Meeting an ex-colleague for coffee tommorow, looking forward to that. But this big guy from my Company will be here tommorow, and apparently he wants to meet my team at 6:30 pm,  so just for that we have to wait for him. I don't really see the point in it, he will probably just say "thanks for your good work" and so forth.   Oh I finally tested out the microwave oven I bought for my mom couple weeks ago; heh we were all huddling around it and watching while it heated up tuna for a whole minute. Yes we never had one before this. I was a little nervous, was afraid it would explode or something but thank god it didn't.  And the tuna came out all piping hot! Man sometimes you can't help but be amazed by the wonders of technology!

      Yeah haven't had time to blog, mainly because I been meeting friends for dinner everyday this week since Sunday! It's been really fun. I am a sucker for good conversations and socialising, mainly cos I rarely get to have them. Got to meet someone who I been wanting to meet for a very long time on Sunday, and it was well worth the wait cos she turned out to be as fun as hell. Really hope to meet up with her really soon.   Also went out and bought 2 pairs of shoes on Wednesday. Yes this is stage one of my transformation to Hip-Bert. As my mama used to say it always starts with the shoes. Anyway I went into this shoe store near Peninisula Plaza and just asked the salesgal for the hippest shoes she had. She immediately rushed off and after 5 minutes came back with this brown Skechers shoes. I put them on but didn't really think they were that hip, but she assured me that they were hip, hell she told me that they are so hip that no one has dared to buy them so far. Anyway that got me sold and I bought them. The other pair I bought at another store in Peninsula Plaza, the uncle at the shop also assured me they were hip and he seemed like a really truthful guy. I will probably put up pictures of the shoes really soon so you can judge for yourself. But yeah I been asking chicks to like accompany me to go shopping for clothes and stuff recently, I finally decided to admit to myself that my dressing needs a major revamp despite my mom continuing to assure me I look good. Yup thats me , a 25 year old going through a mid-life crisis way too early.

      I won 50 bucks !!! On a whim I bet 10 bucks on the Manchester United - Newcastle match yesterday night , 5 bucks on 0 goals at odds 12.0, and 5 bucks on 1 goal which was at odds  6.1.  Well it was a goalless draw so i won 12 times $5 - $10= 50 bucks. Damm if I had bet 10 bucks I would have won 110 bucks. Eh wait if I had bet 100 I would have won $1200!!  That's it I am going to bet  100 dollars the next time!

      Ok wanna ask a question : Is it weird for 2 guys to go for dinner and ice cream after work ?  I don't see anything wrong with it but a friend tells me he wouldn't do it.  So just wondering what is the general opinion on this.   Speaking of which a funny thing happened at Swensen's yesterday. I and a friend were in the queue waiting for a seat, and there was a guy, wife , a kid and a maid in front of us. Then for no damm reason the kid looked at me and started laughing. I got so pissed off that I remarked to my friend "The bloody kid laughing at me" out loud,the dad heard it and he  turned and apologized.  Thank god he wasn't mad I called his kid bloody. Relly lucky he wasn't the  urlLink ah beng  type.    Ok got trashed this morning again at bball, I lost because of a recurrence of an old sports injury I suffered in kindergarden, otherwise I would have won !  I been in a pretty good mood last week, have to say it was one of the best weeks i had in the past year. Don't know how long it is gonna last but might as well enjoy it while I can.  This is despite the fact I got cancelled twice by friends who were supposed to meet me for dinner!   My song of the week has to be "I Believe in a Thing Called Love" by The Darkness, i been listening to it non-stop. The darkness is a rock band that borrows very heavily from 70s/80s rock , very campy but somehow they pull it off.  Go check it out alright!   Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel My heart's in over drive and you're behind the steering wheel Touching you, touching me, touching you cause you're touching me I believe in a thing called love, just listen to the rhythm of my heart There's a chance we can make it now, we'll be lookin till the sun goes down  I believe in a thing called luuuuuurrrrrrvvveeeee....   Sigh if I could only sing this to a certain gal.

      I am aching all over now. Yes the stallion finally decided to get off his increasingly big ass and go for a game of basketball. After 15 minutes in a 1 on 1 game I felt like dying. Anyway got pretty much trashed despite my attempts at distracting my friend with my between-the-legs dribbles and sky hooks, I guess they can only invoke so much laughter before they wear off. But hell it was still fun to work out a sweat after such a long long time. Gonna be doing it tommorow morning again.

      ROTK: SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD!  Went to watch ROTK yesterday. It was pretty good, and the battle scenes were truly amazing. But had quite a few complaints.  One is how come Gandalf never even used any magic in the movie? I mean like hello, isn't that the whole advantage of being a wizard! And no the light thing from the staff to scare away the flying dragon thingys doesn't count, hell i think that was just luck, it was probably like sunlight reflecting off his staff. I am not asking for much, but a few Magic Missiles, Fireballs or even an Ice Storm would have been really cool. But all I saw was the old man fighting with his staff and sword. Disappointing leh.  Also the ending kinda dragged a little. After the climax involving the ring I was expecting it to end soon but it went on for like an extra 1/2 hour. OK can understand he was maybe trying to be faithful to the book or something but thought he should have speeded it up a little.  Then at the climax I was expecting the bad guy (saroman or something) to come out and start fighting and killing people, instead he was just a huge red eye on top of a tower....ooooh very intimidating.  Finally, I think Liv Tyler should have stripped in the movie, it would have added an added dimension (a sense of vulnerability) to her character which I felt seemed out of place in the movie. Fine fine I just wanted to see her boobs happy !!!

      Read this in Streats yesterday morning, quoted from LeeHL, regarding the possible lifting of the ban on firecrackers. "In the old days it was quite a hassle, people got maimed and some got killed"  Heh really like the usage of the word 'hassle' to describe the maiming and fatal accidents caused by firecrackers. Then in the next paragraph by him again, "It's fun, it's something fresh because it's not been done for over 30 years."  Talk about contradicting yourself. And if thats considered fun and refreshing then he has less of a life than me. Which I assure you is a very bad thing.  Then in today's Strait Times a colleague pointed out something really funny. On the front page is a picture of a few government officials confiscating civet cats in China to be culled, you know due to the whole Sars thing. The funny thing is one official is fully decked in protective gear, complete with the white body suit, mask and hair cap. But the guy holding the civet cat by its tail is dressed in army fatigues and holding the civet cat with his bare hand!   BTW wanna say thanks to C for highlighting in public my inferior spelling skills.  Apparently, I spelled "civic" instead of "civet"!  Hmmph!!

      So annoying , i tried posting an entry earlier today but it screwed up and I lost all of it.   Ok so I spend NYE at home watching the countdown, man Jamie Yeo has a really hot body I tell ya, what I won't give to be foaming it up with her at the ...er...foam party. I could swear that for a moment she was looking at me right through the TV screen asking me to go down and join her. But most of the show was pretty lame, you had the local celebs doing their own god-awful renditions of the biggest radio hits of 03. Evanescene would have puked blood if they saw the rendition of Bring Me To Life , complete with dancers. These idiots don't even know that you do not have dancers for a rock song, thats like a huge no no.   For New Year Day I popped over at my uncle's place with my sis and dad, I haven't been there like for 10 years so it was nice to see them again and talk to my cousins. Then went to buy a Microwave oven for my mom cos she wanted it since like forever. Spending now while I have the chance, there's a very real possibility that in a few months it might not be possible anymore.   Went to watch School of Rock just now, it was funny as hell. There was even one time I was laughing so hard I had tears from my eyes. Jack Black is the ultimate funnyman. And a pretty mean rocker too. Highly recommended!   BTW I have a pretty grandiose plan to change my whole image in the new year  in a desperate and final attempt to score with the chicks. Was gonna change my nick from Indian Stallion to Hip-Bert for starters, as well as change my blog design to something more psychedelic with like swirling colors and stuff. But so far got nothing but negative comments about my idea. Aren't friends supposed to be supportive !!!?  Dun wanna friend all of you anymore!

      Had a pretty nice time yesterday.  I asked a fellow colleague I got to know recently out to dinner, ok so it took me around 5 minutes to finally sum up the courage to give her a call but I did and she said yes.   I just love meeting new people. It's really interesting for me to hear other people's opinions and experiences about life, relationships, career goals etc. etc.  And sometimes the things they say make me look at a certain topic in a new light;   I guess there's a lot of things you can learn from other people.  But I always prefer one-to-one outings to like group outings , the conversations are just so much more personal and involved that way. But the minus side is that it is harder to meet new people compared to like group outings.   After the dinner I met two friends for drinks, we shared a mini-barrel and a jug of Heineken. Got as high as a kite and came back home and puked my dinner out. That kinda sucked.  Oh had a pretty interesting discussion amidst all that drinking, we were talking about how much the government sucked and didn't give a shit about the average singaporean, but one of them was like pro-government saying they had to raise prices of like everything during the recession otherwise the economy would die.  Finally we agreed to disagree on that.  And we also debated on the philosophical topic of S & M and where it was morally and socially acceptable. My opinion was as long all parties involved are willing I dun see a problem with it, which is my stand on most things.  But one of them felt that it was just "wrong".

      Went to watch Mystic River yesterday, didn't really think it was as good as the critics made it out to be.  It just seemed a little too long and the ending wasn't really that satisfying.  But hanged out with friend after that for quite a bit, that was fun.   I am really nervous about work now. Let's just say I can see the train coming from really far away but there is no way for me to get off the tracks. Well we will know if the train hits me in around a month's time. Right now that seems the most likely scenario.

      Ok I wanted to blog about this but I think I forgot (or did I blog about it already?) .  I hate going to my Indian relatives' houses for those special functions like Deepavali or Xmas.  Mainly because for some reason the guys and the gals  are always segregated into 2 big groups. The gals will all be in the house talking among themselves , while the guys will all be outside the house drinking.  There were times where I would be the only guy in the house cos I will be talking to one of my gal relatives ; the other guys probably thought I was gay or soft.  It even happens in my house during Xmas. Yeah it is something which annoys me to no end.  I mean I like to talk to people whether its guys or gals (ok usually i prefer gals cos I got way too many guys in my life already)  but it just seems so damm silly to me.   Oh ya after procrastinating for like so long, here is the letter that I wrote to streats.    urlLink Pic 1   urlLink Pic 2

      Life has been boring the last couple of weeks hence the lack of updates.  My highlight of the day was seeing people run to get into the train that I was in but they didn't make it ; the train doors closed on them.  The look on their faces when the doors close is really priceless I tell ya. I should take a picture next time.

      Bangkok was damm boring. First I found out that I was not going to be at the Grand Hyatt but rather at a damm 4 star hotel located at the outskirts of the city. I mean what the hell , am I some kind of native or something !! I am an employee of   here, at the very least I deserve a 4 and a half star hotel. The hotel sucked, the chicks there were not as hot; the pool was as small as my dick (which means its really really small); and worse of all there was no free porn on tv! Hell you would think that for 100 US Dollars a night that would be at least some basic porn available but no!   Anyway I was so busy that I didn't have much time to go out also, stayed in the hotel room half the time while the other half I was at the institute doing work stuff. Went to this nearby shopping mall for a quick dinner that was it. It was really huge though , much bigger than anything we have in Singapore. I bought a wallet that was it.   But the people there were really nice and the local cuisine for the most part was amazing, throughly enjoyed it. Especially the steaks.  My colleague did ask me to delay my flight to Sunday and tour bangkok with him, but I was going out with a friend today so I couldn't go. But when I came back last night she cancelled on me. So now stuck at home on V day; oh well that's how it is every year ..sniff...all the stallion wants is to be loved is that so wrong !

      Oh ya about the jeans I bought from Giordano last week , it cost me 49.90. As I was about to pay for it the salesgal told me I would get a free huge-ass Giordano umbrella if I made a purchase of at least 50 dollars. So I bought a pair of socks which was like 6 dollars. I would probably never use the umbrella cos its one of those really big ones, but I still bought it. Talk about being kiasu. Spend the rest of the day lugging it around, not hip at all. I don't even know where it is now  I talked to one of my friends in UK at her friend's place and she had a webcam so I could see her and her friends. Of cos me being my usual charming self was making really silly jokes and stuff, but it was really cool to see their facial responses, they were practically giggling away.  It was kind of a nice feeling cos sometimes I wonder if I am just being really corny (as opposed to funny) and their "haha" responses are just obligatory. Should get one for myself soon.

      I will be going to Bangkok next Tuesday and be back on Friday. BTW I really can't stand some sales people. They offer the moon to their customers just to make that sale but they can't deliver and don't bother to after the sale is made. Then its up to the engineers to go there and clean up the mess and face the unhappy customers.  ROAR!   Went to see the Thaipusam festival on Thursday with a friend. Well it was pretty interesting, I am still curious as to how they don't bleed when the hooks and spears are pierced through their skin . And then I saw this guy with a really thick spear (as thick as a small pipe) that went through from one cheek and out the other. I got no idea how he did that .  A friend suggested that they take 'something' before they go through the piercing, but I disagree.  There are some things in the world that just don't have an explanation.   Went to watch Along Came Polly with a friend I haven't seen in a long time and her boyfriend, yeah I met them by accident after I met another friend for dinner and they asked me along. I didn't really wanna go  but they kinda persuaded me so i went and throughly enjoyed it! Well the first hour at least, it was really funny , think of Something About Mary, same kind of toilet humor. But the last 1/2 hour it kinda degenerated to standard romantic drivel where the guy realises that there is only one gal for him blah blah.   Oh and I bought a really hip sling bag , and a pair of jeans from Giordanos.  Yeah just wanted to mention that.

      Yes haven't been blogging. Mostly cos I been meeting friends from NUS after work for most of the past week.  It's kinda nice to catch up with people whom you haven't seen in a long time. Hope it doesn't take another year before we meet each other again.   I have to admit that I am a little disappointed with some of my friends from junior college. I have tried to meet up with them quite a few times but they always seem to be too busy.  And we all live in the east side also so I can't understand why they can't make a day free to have dinner or something. I am really interested to know what they been up to and stuff, but its quite obvious that they don't feel the same way.   Went to watch the Last Samurai on friday, it was ok  i guess , wasn't as good as my sis said it was. But the friend I went with was like practically tearing near the end, it was kinda cute. I love to see chicks cry at movies, dun know why. Next movie I am going to watch is Lost In Translation, read great reviews on it and it has Bill Murray!  Ok going to go shopping in a couple of hours for hip clothes. Was supposed to go last week but it got cancelled. Yes there's no stopping my transformation to Hip-Bert, it WILL happen.

      I found this site called  urlLink  Blogger Idol  . Basically it's some kind of online American Idol for bloggers. This week you are supposed to pretend you are a pageant contestant and answer a question. What the hell, I will take 5 minutes away from my porn and do this.   Question: Do you believe in premarital sex?  Me : No I don't. I think it's totally immoral to sleep with someone before you commit into the holy union sanctioned by the almighty father known as marriage. No this does not have anything to do with me not getting any action for the last 25 years!! How dare you imply that! I am in fact saving myself for that special someone, who hopefully my mommy will find for me before I reach 30. Cos thats when your sperm count and sex drive starts going down the drain.  Yes for me sex should be only used for procreation , cos thats what God intended.  But at least till then there's always anal (which isn't really sex). But ya it's a tad on the painful side. Please hurry mom.

      Oh ya do me a favor and go to this  urlLink  website   and enter your birthday if you haven't done so. But ONLY if I know you , otherwise don't do anything ( unless your life is so sad that you need to get a virtual birthday e-card from someone you don't even know) .  Once you have entered it, I will then be reminded of your birthday 2 days before the date. Whether I do anything about it is another matter. Depends on a lot of factors like whether you are a guy or gal, whether you are single, whether you are hot etc. etc.... nah just kidding . You can still be hot on the inside.   BTW thanks to that gal who send me that e-card on my birthday when I was all alone at home last year. I think Im falling in love with you , whoever you are.

      I have been getting a lot of negative comments about my previous post. About how it sounded like I was gay or I needed to get a life!! Well alright it's pretty obvious where this comments come from. All of you are jealous !!! Jealous of the love that me and *my precious share! Jealous that you don't share the same deep meaningful relationship with your own phone that I have with my precious. Well I'm sorry but I can't be the scapegoat for your own problems. You know maybe if you talked TO your phone as much as I did you wouldn't have this problem. And showed it the love and attention it deserves. Spend a weekend just doting over it, like what I did last weekend. Clean its face with a nice cloth after you kiss it. I am telling you it will appreciate all these small gestures. And for god's sake do get a bluetooth adapter can if you have a phone with bluetooth. It's ridiculous NOT having it, it's like a stallion having a big dick and not using it.    *my precious = Sony Ericsson T610 going for S$138 with a new line with M1

      I am totally in love with my new Sony T610. I wish I could make love to it , thats how much I adore this little bundle of joy that has unexpectedly came into my life. I clean its little smudgy face every hour or so and then proceed to shower it with kisses, upon which i giggle cos it gets all smudged again.   But seriously if you are a computer geek you will love this phone. Just get a bluetooth USB adapter for like around 50 bucks and you basically do all kinds of stuff from your PC. There is this amazing freeware called  urlLink Float's Mobile Agent   which allows you to basically do everything remotely from the PC. (delete messages , upload pics/games/sounds).  I downloaded loads of free ringtones and wallpaper and pictures of my dogs into my PC and just transferred them to phone.  And now I'm using this Kill Bill theme which I downloaded from this  urlLink website  ,  it's uma thurman in that hot yellow suit thingy she wore in the movie. How cool is that !

      There was this group of kids who used to hang out together at this playground where they meet everyday.  Then one day a few of the kids all take a sharp knife and sticked it into the back of the other kid. The kid looked at the other kids in horror as the blood gushed out of his back; he had no idea why people who he thought were his friends would stab him. The kid ends up in hospital for around 2 months. He finds out that his antics in the playground didn't sit well with the other kids. He doesn't understand why they did not tell him or at least give him a kick instead of stabbing him.   When he goes back to the playground he finds the other kids there.  And the kids start to embrace him, as if nothing happened. No apologies are said.  He plays with them at the playground because its the only playground there. Minus the antics. And he always watches for the knife.  At home he looks at the wound on his back in the mirror.  It has healed somewhat, but the scar that is left is really large and ugly.    And it still hurts like hell once in a while, especially when he looks at it.

      Ok part 2 of my transition to serious blogging. 'Serious' meaning superior to most other blog writers out there who talk about mundane things like how hip their new shoes are or how they are god's gift to women, how they got no social life and spent the whole weekend at home jerking off to porn or how they dont know what to do with their lives.  I have actually said this to many women but it's amazing how surprised they get when I tell them the truth. Most refuse to believe it or are totally skeptical,  they would rather take the blue pill and remain in their make believe world. What is it I say that invokes this reaction ? Simple. Just one statement. "All men are perverts".  Yes I am sure most of the gals who read my blog will start thinking "hey that's not true, i know this guy who is totally decent and non-pervertic. BTW this Indian Stallion guy seems to be a totally hunk and I definitely wanna take him for a ride.". Well sorry but you are half wrong; that guy is a perv. I will explain why.   But first I will say it again; every guy is a perv. We all think perverted thoughts at least 90 percent of the time. We fantasise about every gal that we meet, ok almost every gal. If you are half-decent looking (well its actually more of if a guy considers you half decent) then chances are all your straight guy friends have fantasised about you, at least once, probably more. We have also thought of bizarre perverted behavior at least some point in our life. But let me re-assure you, thinking and acting them out are two totally different things. You ain't gonna see me wearing a cowboy outfit and spanking a gal wearing a cow costume anytime soon, but that doesn't mean I haven't thought of it alright. Besides cow costumes are pretty hard to find in Singapore.   There are basically three major type of perverts in existence: the silent perv, the normal perv, and the criminal perv.  The silent perv is the guy who everyone thinks is totally decent and could be the next head of the church.  Basically the silent perv thinks perverted thoughts 80 percent of the time but hides his thoughts from everyone else ;because he either feels guilty about them or doesn't wanna let people think any less of him. Most guys are silent pervs.  The non-silent perv is the guy who thinks perverted thoughts as well as expresses them freely to people. This is me now. We are usually the people with the hippest shoes, don't ask me why. And we usually scare women away with our sexual frankness...sigh ... it has happened one too many times to me....DAMM WOMEN!!! WHY CAN'T THEY HANDLE THE TRUTH??? I HATE THEM!!!!!.....but anyway back to my point, yeah we are not that common and usually isolated and lonely and single.   Finally, you have the criminal perv. The criminal perv is the guy who actually acts out his perversions. We are talking sex offenders and the like. Ok nothing more about them, less said the better.  So there you have it. I hope this post does enlighten women-kind to the mystery that is man. I mean I do know a lot of you see my blog as source of moral compass for your own lives (which I am very honoured to be by the way)  so I am just trying my best to fulfill that role. But a little money would help a long way to me doing that. I'm a couple hundred dollars short of a new Playstation 2 fyi.

      I would like to post something political and serious for a change. A lot of people think I am this joker who just blogs about silly stuff.. Well first of all those people suck ass, and secondly this post shall prove to them that on the contrary the indian stallion can be serious and thought provoking.   Ok there have been a lot of issues that have been discussed in parliment lately , from the dramatic fall in the birth rate to legalising oral sex. But there is one issue that I think that has overlooked and I think should be addressed. Yes you know what I am talking about. I am talking about subsidies for penis enlargement surgery.  Yes I decided to be the spokesman for people who need the surgery, despite being more than adequate in that department. These guys had to go through adoloscence with low self-esteem and the fear of going to public showers. Some of them try and shrug it off when they reach adulthood. Others invent macho sounding nicknames that have animals that are supposedly known for their sexual prowess, just to mislead people about their own inadequecies when it comes to sex. Yes it's sad and pathetic but there are people who do that, believe me. But let us not be judgemental. You can't really blame these people for their shortcomings, is it their fault that they have 1/4 chinese blood and the only chinese feature that shows up physically is the one that counts the most ?? Do you know how difficult it was for them to go through army as a military policemen, having to see naked prisoners day in and day out and feeling so small in comparison?? No you don't ok, you have no idea what it was like !!!!   Ok I am getting a little carried away; what to do, I can't help but sympathise with these guys, eventhough I can't relate to what they are going through because as i mentioned earlier (but just to make sure you understand it) I have no problems with that area. But yeah the problem is penis enlargement surgery is pretty expensive in singapore now, and believe me I have checked every hospital its all the same price. But the government can help by heavily subsidising this surgery for those who need it. And this could help in solving the falling birth rate problem. So please talk to your neighbourhood MP and try and get him to raise this issue. Together we can make Singapore a better place for you and me.   Ok sorry to my 4 regular readers who couldn't see the scrollbars on my blog yesterday. I was testing out how to block the blogger ad at the top and I got it working on the Mozilla browser, but forgot to check IE. Paiseh. But seriously lor, give Firefox and/or Mozilla a chance. Once you import your IE bookmarks, install various plugins for Shockwave/Flash/Windows Media Player/Quicktime/Acrobat Reader and give up surfing sites that don't support non-IE browsers (like launch.com and Microsoft's windows update site) you will never wanna go back to using Internet Explorer. That is my promise to you, i am so sure that I am willing to bet my virginity on it. Not anal virginity though, you pervs.   And finally a joke I saw in a comment at Bibbs blog.  How many times does 44 go into 12?  Ask Michael Jackson.

      I really love Elyse from that supermodel reality show! One gal was bitching that she didn't like her makeover cos it made her looked like a prostitute. Elyse then confessed to the camera that she didn't understand why , but then admitted that she didn't know much about prostitute fashion trends. Funny smartass chick.  Met my sis for dinner at Orchard after going for my pre-employment checkup, yeah I am getting my contract renewed. It was nice; haven't seen her in like 2 months.  Updated her about what I been doing socially , which didn't take too long for obvious reasons. But I realised recently that I don't behave the same way around my sis as I do with other people.  I don't really joke that much around her like I do with friends that I am very comfortable with.  Which is kinda weird cos we are and have always been  pretty close.  Hmm one more question for the shrink.    Oh and also met a gal whose knowledge of music totally dwarves my own! This gal was into everything from Led Zeppelin to Mars Volta and she was recommending me so many bands that I never even heard of. And she even has vinyls and stuff! How cool is that ?

      I procrastinate too often for my own liking. Another weekend spent doing absolutely nothing of consequence except maybe the fact that I did manage to level up my Weapon Master/Fighter/Rogue in Neverwinter Nights a bit. Ya that was fun.    Nowdays I feel that every day I stay at home is one day of my life wasted  and will never be able to gain back.  And that's really depressing. Why don't I ever get to doing the things I know I wanna do? I got no idea.

      I am at home on Friday night. Damm sucky.   Lost my handphone charger a couple days ago; I searched everywhere for it but I can't find it. I suspect it's one of my parents who took it by accident but can't prove it. So I was using my mom's big ass Nokia 3310 phone . But now she wants it back and wants me to use my dad's Motorola Startec phone instead. You know one of those freaking ancient ones. I asked her to use that phone instead and let me hang out to the Nokia one, cos she doesn't even use SMS, but she blatantly refused. And this was someone whom I actually had to force not too long ago to get a handphone. Which I am really regretting like hell now. Oh well I might just head down to M1 tommorow and get myself a new phone with a new line, I been looking to get a new phone recently. Read great reviews on the Sony T616 and LG VX6000.   Just saw the news on TV - The PAS apparently promised the Malaysian citizens that they will go to heaven if they voted for them in the coming elections.  The PAS is an Islamic political party who to the best of my knowledge want to impose hudud  laws (which are ancient Islamic laws practiced by countries like Saudi Arabia) on everyone, including non-Muslims. These laws include a really bizarre one where a woman who wants to report a rape has to have 7 (or 5 I can't remember) witnesses who witnessed the rape first-hand.  Anyway a poll conducted showed that 16 percent still supported the PAS. Thats a whole lot of dumb people.

      Went out with a couple of friends to this Italian restaurant called Mama Lucia at Robertson Road. The food was excellent but the servings were pretty small though, Italians must have very small appetites. There was also this guy who went around the tables and played songs on his guitar, although we didn't really want him to sing at our table cos we were having a pretty engaging conversation. But this group of ang mohs at another table started dancing and singing along to him when he played to them. Well respect to them, I would never be able to do that.  The 3 of us had a pretty engaging conversation throughout the evening. Not intellectual or arty farty, but more towards stuff like why guys find 2 gals making out such a huge turn on, which I couldn't really answer. Can anyone? Then we started about our dream jobs and stuff. My dream job would be working any job that is directly related to music, because that's my biggest passion, as anyone who had to reject mp3s or CDs of my fav bands from me endlessly would know. Maybe something like a journalist for a music magazine. But well not very practical of cos, especially in Singapore. Reality really sucks doesn't it.

      Oh was watching this new reality show on Channel 5 about the search for America's next Supermodel. If you always thought that models were dumb and totally bitchy, then this show is NOT gonna change your mind.  All except one seem to be a little light above the shoulders. There was this huge argument between them and one of the gals started blabbering and refused to stop and then while she was doing that, another model started singing.  And then the singing model kinda forced all of them to hold hands after which she started praying to God and asking God to take away all the hatred and jealousy etc. etc. It was really bizarre I tell ya. But the smart model is probably the hottest, she's ultra thin but there's something about her that is so sexy.  I am such a Beck fan now,  urlLink Odelay  is such an amazing album that I can't believe that I didn't love it before.  Was listening to Antichrist Superstar by Marilyn Manson today as well but somehow it sounded kinda tired. Hate to admit it but my music tastes seem to have mellowed. But hey I still dig Rage Against the Machine !!   Bought Get Born by Jet last Sunday. The song that is played during the commercial for iPod (the rock one) is from that album. Very old school garage rock sound not unlike the White Stripes , sounds pretty good so far.

      If you are ever going to be a unix administrator , remember this : Make sure the root entry is always present in your /etc/passwd file before you save it.  Yeah me and my really itchy hands. Thank god I had an angel to help me out , he probably heard me sniffing away in desperation in the server room.  Man that was a scary as hell experience.   Met an acquaintance from JC (well he was in Tampines JC for the first 3 months anyway) but I kinda forgot his name. I have such a hard time remembering names, its freaky. Especially names of guys, gals I usually have no problem. I wonder why.

      Went to the IT fair again. Quite happening I tell ya, way more happening than that ultra-chinese club Madam Wong the week before. If only they had this fair every week. But I didnt really like the idea of certain companies at the fair like nikon using chicks in really skimpy tops and shorts to like give away pamplets; it smacks of blatant sexism if you ask me.  So NOT toxic.   I bought a Sony Discman for S$160, it was one of the lower range models without an inline remote but the sound was pretty decent and it plays MP3 CDs which was all I was looking for. I have never felt comfortable spending large amounts of money on myself when I didnt need to. Ok ya maybe I am just a really big miser. Speaking of miser I didn't leave a tip when I ate at aa restaurant where a friend was working at. But I didn't cos it just felt weird leaving her a tip at that time, I don't know why, like i would be insulting her or something. Ya sometimes I get all these weird thoughts and voices in my head. Hope she isn't bitter about that. Sorry babe!

      OK been listening to Toxic by Britney like on repeat for like the whole freaking day.  So much so that I decided that I am gonna use the word 'toxic' as a substitute for the the word 'cool' from now on.  This is how you use the word in your everyday conversations.  "That was such a toxic performance." "Dude that gal is so toxic I bet she has a burning sensation when she pisses!" "That guy is like totally greenpeace! Loser!"   Spread the word people. Cos if you don't you are like totally greenpeace !!

      Ok went to the IT fair today with a friend, crowded as hell i tell ya. I was looking to get a discman but the Sony discmans there were pretty limited in selection so I kinda gave it a pass. I will be going down tommorow as well as they have huge discounts for the goods close to closing time as they try to clear their stock. Yes I am kiasu can. Trying to save as much money as possible.   So met 2 of my friend's friends at the fair as well and we went for coffee at Tower Records, had a pretty nice time they were pretty cool/interesting people. Which is much more than what I can say for an outing with another friend and his 2 friends a couple weeks ago. Sorry dude but I was seriously trying hard not to fall asleep that time, Work is NOT a fun topic first time you meet someone.   Oh ya saw a really dumb person today. he jaywalked outside City Hall right in front of a traffic policeman wearing a neon jacket . NO prizes for guessing what happened to him.   And saw something I never saw before : Perpetual lightning storm ! There was lightning every 3 seconds I am not kidding ya, it was really freaky !! I got a little nervous to be honest.   OK hate to admit it but I love that 'Toxic' song by Britney.

      I spent the last 2 days compiling and re-compiling a program with different options to try and make it run faster with a sample data set. The fastest I got so far was 1 hr 6 mins. I JUST got it down to 1 hr 5 minutes a few minutes ago. You cannot imagine the elation and pride I felt when I achieved that; it's times like these that make me remember why I love my job so much. I am gonna call myself the compilation king from now on.   Oh and something only a computer geek will understand : I used vi so much the last 2 days that when I was typing out my report for the compilation results I actually tried to use "x" to delete words. Hahaha.  How funny is that ?  OK I NEED TO GET A LIFE.

I been called everything from arrogant to someone who only goes out with people if there was a woman in the group.  And I don't know, for the life of me, why people cannot realise when I am kidding and when I am serious. Is it so ambiguous?

And also sneaked in 15 minutes of porn, can't do that at work , at least not since the day I got caught at work jacking off to "Snow White vs. the 7 Black Drawfs."   Playlist for today  Mushroomhead - XX Highlights: Solitare/Unravelling, Never Let It Go Beck - Odelay  Highlights: The New Pollution, Derelict, Novocane, Where It's At Placebo - Black Market Music  Highlights: Taste in Men, Special K Rage Against the Machine - Rage Against the Machine  Highlights: Killing in the Name, Settle for Nothing, Wake Up, Bombtrack  Yes I am trying to highlight my superior and diverse taste in music compared to the rest of ya.

      I am really angry. Someone better ask me why I am angry. Nevermind I will just say it ! I am angry at the lack of comments for my last few entries ! Only 1 ! What the hell is wrong with you people?  Don't you know that I bask in your comments to compensate for my non-existent sex/social life !!?  Don't you know that I pretend that everyone who comments is one of my close friends to console myself of the fact that I have no friends ?  Don't you know that in the entry before that (the one with 5 comments), I actually faked the user TIP-OFF !!?  Don't you know that I actually find manties sexy but made fun of them so I won't be thot as gay ? Ok the last one ihas no relation with the lack of comments; I just wanted to come out of the closet.  Anyway this means 1 comment for the last 4 entries.  That just makes my blood boil! The travesty!  Yes I may be a comment slut/whore/gigolo/perv, but before you cast the first stone, look deep into your own hearts and you will find your very own comment whoreling (which is a midget whore for the uneducated)  hiding behind the cold comment-phobic hearts of yours !

      Thanks to the overwhelming response to my call for fellow rock fans to go see Incubus,  I probably will not be going. Sigh it's kind of sad cos I really believe there's a ROCK in every one of us. Just that sometimes it takes a bit of digging to bring it out .  As a acquintance once used to say , "ROCK NEVER DEATH!!!".   Hell look at me, up to Junior College I was listening to and very much in love with Mariah Carey. Ace of Base,  Take That, that kinda stuff. My absolute fav was Mariah Carey, had all her albums till Daydream. But a friend introduced me to the acoustic sounds of Nirvana Unplugged with his guitar and I was hooked. Never looked back since then .

      Was planning to go backpacking in Thailand for a week at the beginning of next month, but thanks to a sucky thing called work commitment I have to give it a miss. Which really blows cos it's something I really wanna do, mainly cos I haven't done it before. I have this urge to do new stuff lately,  mainly because my life has been so monotonous late.   Planning to go to Incubus concert in KL next week if i can get someone to go with me; am not a huge fan but I desperately miss going to a rock concert and just going crazy. So far the 2 major concerts I been to (Placebo and POD) have been really amazing experiences; I totally lose myself in the music and just jumping my ass off like crazy to the music.  Anyway Incubus is like one of the most fav bands of a friend of mine and she has really good music taste so they can't be half bad.  So anyone interested ? Tickets (free-standing) are sold at Ticketcharge outlets for S$55 dollars a pop, in malaysia they cost RM 98 .   But I hope to see Mars Volta at least once.  That would make my life complete. I am praying that they will come to Singapore or somewhere near soon.  If it happens I swear God I will go back to church and sing your praises for like at least a year.

      So went to this pub called Crazy Elephant with a couple of friends yesterday,  they had a pretty decent band playing covers of Led Zep, Hendrix and Pearl Jam buut the crowd there a bit on the old side. After which we headed down to Madam Wong , it was my first time there. Well what can I say, clubbing is definitely not for me. The music was pretty ok at first , they were playing hip hop/r and b songs like 50 cents and beyonce but then it degenerated to Bon Jovi and Linkin Park and then to godawful techo shit.  So I stood at the side leaning against the wall with a beer bottle in my hand, trying to look as cool as possible. That didn't really come off.

      Yes you probably heard about Google's new email service  urlLink Gmail . I first heard about it on April 1st  and I presumed it was a very lame ass April Fool prank by Google. It sounded too good to be true - 1 GB of storage space is unheard of for a free email service. Well I got myself an account recently (it was offered to Blogger users), tried it out and it was pretty nifty. The conversation feature in particular is really cool cos it groups emails and their replies together so you can keep track of what was being said in earlier emails .And you can even use keyboard shortcuts which is another nice feature.   But a very big flaw is the absence of a feature to import addresses into the contact list. It is the only thing that keeps me from using it more frequently cos it's quite a hassle adding contacts manually. I also haven't really seen how it handles spam yet. Hopefully I don't need to.

      I cried for the longest time last night. Sometimes you make a promise to someone but then you totally forget about it. But by then its too late cos the trust that person had in you is gone.  Well i made a promise to someone and I broke it. And now I totally lost the trust of that person and no matter what I do I know I can't have it back.   Yes I am talking about my T610. I promised it I would never drop it but it happened. I was in the bathroom relieving some of my pent-up sexual frustration when someone called. The phone was on my computer table and it vibrated the hell off the table and dropped to the floor. Now I have a big ugly dent on the side of it.  And now I can't even use it anymore, the guilt is just killing me. I wanna give it to someone who can take better care of it than me - I guess I realise now that I am just not ready for this responsibility.

       I just got back from watching Kill Bill Vol. 2. SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD - Su loved it to death, unfortunately I can't really say the same.  The problem with this movie is that it didn't make me go wow like the first instalment did.  And that it seemed a little too silly at times. Ok so the bride beating the crazy 88 in the shophouse in Vol. 1 was a bit far fetched, but it was nowhere near stuff in this movie like the truth serum and the 'attack' the Bride used at the end.  All in all I came away pretty disappointed that it was nowhere as great as I thought it would be.   Bought Joss Stone's The Soul Sessions before the movie.  Heard a lot about this 16 year old British white chick who they say would be the next Aretha. I only heard one song from the album, Fell In Love with a Boy and its pretty cool so I decided to get it. I am just so desperate for good music now, haven't heard any new stuff that just blew me away, not since Mars Volta.

Most of the albums are pretty decent to be honest; I was pleasantly surprised to see Foo Fighters' The Color and the Shape in the list. However, there are also some really horrid selections like Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory at No. 10. Yes yes I know taste is relative but come on, to put that album in front of Radiohead's OK Computer and Rage Against the Machine's self- titled is nothing short of rock blasphemy. And one of the reviewers even had the nerve to proclaim that they were the first band to successfully fuse rock and hip hop together (or something to that effect). Dumbass. But the worst had to be Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill as the No.1 album. If I was her I would be really embarassed.    Watched Secretary on my computer yesterday, a very funny but 'different' romantic comedy. It's about a gal who cuts herself to deal with the problems that she has at home because she gets relief from the pain.  She then gets a job at this law office where the lawyer who himself is kinda weird humiliates her by making her do unreasonable tasks, but she finds pleasure in it and even encourages him on. The ending was a little too nice and neat for me but other than that I highly recommend it.

      System of A Down totally rocks !! I got their album  urlLink Toxicity  like in 2002 because Spin magazine named it their top album of 2001. But then I couldn't really got into it. It just sounded a little way too left field for me back then, it was probably the way Serj Tankian sings, totally melodic one moment then totally zany the other.  But started listening to it couple weeks ago and I finally got it!  Now I can't stop listening to it. I was practically headbanging and tapping my fingers playing air guitar in front of my monitor  and even singing along at one point. Hey you try and NOT sing to "chop suey"!    Just watched this local movie that got some prize in this local film festival called "Running with Scissors". It was about the frontman of a band that refuses to bend to his mom's will and go to UK to study; instead he decides to go down to Kuala Lumpur and do gigs there with his band. The movie would have been decent if not for one major flaw. The band does NOT have a drummer !!

      Read about this gender analyzer at  urlLink Gary Bibb's blog , it apparently analyzes paragraphs and tries to guess if the author is a guy or gal using some primitive algorithm. I copied all my entries since April 1st and submitted it. Here are my results:   Words: 1404 (NOTE: The genie works best on texts of more than 500 words.)  Female Score: 3117 Male Score: 2760  The Gender Genie thinks the author of this passage is: female!   Yeah you got me genie. I have always tried to deny the fact that I was actually a horny lesbian chick stuck inside a man's body. But now thanks to the Gender Genie my worst suspicions are confirmed. But what do I do about it ? It would be nice if the Genie offered advice on what to do other than just bluntly reveal your true sex. You know like maybe recommend sex change clinics or therapists or something. But I heard they are incorporating that in the next version of the analyzer. Sometimes I really can't help but marvel at the wonders of technology. Ok back to Java coding for me.

      A friend I met couple days back told me something that really took me by surprise. She said that the first few times she met me she actually dressed more conservatively than she normally would. And she had one hand on her mace in her purse the whole time. Apparently I gave her this impression of being a desperate perv from our conversations online. Only after the second time we went out did she figure out that I was totally harmless;a little baby stallion just looking for someone to love him. But yeah it's pretty interesting, the first impression I give to some ...ok most women. I think it's a vital clue to solving the puzzle of why I get rejected by chicks as often as I am.   I actually enjoyed my workday yesterday. Why? 1 word. Java. Yes I think I have to accept the fact that it is my calling. I like it because it makes me think. I had to implement a certain feature on a webpage. So I had to think of the best way to implement it, code it and then try it out. And there's this sense of achievement when it works out exactly as planned. Of cos the more complex the feature is the more challenging it is and the greater the sense of achievement. Ok it does zero for my already non-existent social life. I was telling a chick of my above-mentioned achievement yesterday and she didn't seem too impressed. Sigh women ....  I am continuing to watch the worst dating reality show ever. Yesterday the guys all had to do this rock climbing thingy and whoever had the fastest time would get to have dinner alone with the bachelorette. Glad to know that they aren't taking useless qualities like intelligence and humor into consideration. I mean if a guy can climb a wall then that's all a gal needs to decide if he's the one (isn't it?). I was imagining what would have happened if I had joined the show, I would probably be crying my eyes out once I get 3 feet off the ground. Yes the stallion isn't too crazy about heights and walls despite the tough exterior. Hey a little gal tried to push me off the top of the stairs when i was 14 ok! Traumatised me for life.   Oh ya the bachelorette is still struggling to say anything remotely intelligent sounding despite this being the 4th episode. But she did look really really good scaling the wall though. The producers should find more excuses for her to wear skimpy clothing in my opinion. If she can't show her brains might as well show off some flesh.

      Yes I changed my template. Cos I felt like it. Scoured the net for a nice and clean template but it was surprising quite difficult to find, most of the ones I viewed were pretty elaborate with very big images embedded into the template which I didn't like.  Anyway this is the best I seen so far. but still not fully satisfied with it, am probably gonna make a few changes to it in the future.

      Went to watch Skinhead Attitude yesterday, a documentary about the history of the skinhead culture in Europe and America. It was a huge eye opener; I have always associated skinheads with Nazis but I found out yesterday that they are two totally different things. The skinhead movement has its roots in the music of ska and reggae and yes it did stand for rebellion against the government but there was no racism involved.   But then a band by the name of  urlLink Skrewdriver  introduced openly racist lyrics and songs to the skinhead community and it spilt the group into two different factions - racist and the anti-racist.  The band started an organization called Blood and Honor to rally the racist skinheads and that was how skinheads got associated with Nazism. But some of the things that the racist skinheads say in their interviews are pretty scary. One racist skinhead in US was saying how segregation will not work because it didn't work before - so they have to get rid of non-whites by nuking them, and that this had to be done to ensure her kid grows up in a safe enviroment.  Oh and she hates Muslims because she holds them responisble for 9/11.  And she hates homosexuals too, because they spread disease.  All in all a very good movie which I highly recommend.

      Yes I haven't been blogging. Blame it all on sexual frustration. It really kills your creativity I tell ya. Haven't gone out with any member of the opposite sex for the past month. My dogs have a more active social life than me right now. OK and work sucks also. Nothing gets more to me than work. I was thinking the other day about quitting my job and joining borders or HMV. I think I would be really happy in either of those places; well at least happier than I am now. But yeah thinking is one thing, have to I don't have the balls to do it.  Cos I don't think its financially viable too. And mommy wouldn't be too happy about it either. I think the only way I would do it if I win a million dollars or something.   Think my blogging output is going to be minimal for the next couple of weeks. Unless there is someone out there who wants to help alleviate my sexual frustration; preferably a gal but I'm not really picky at this point in time.

      Was in a crappy mood the last 4 days or so; happens to me from time to time when I get reminded of the fact that I have a non-existent social life and minimal chick contact. But yesterday as I was pouring my soul to Bobby I realised that I don't have it so bad. At least I have 2 loving dogs who are there to listen to me when I need a listening ear. Yeah sure they might look like they are asleep 90 percent of the time but I know they are listening. Sometimes I can even see a hint of understanding in those big brown eyes. It's time like this that I realise that I am so much luckier than people who might have a active social life but they don't have any pets. They are probably envious of the huge amount of quality time i spend with them at home over the weekends. Who needs people when you have dogs!! I don't !   Was watching the America's Next Top Supermodel and Elyse's boyfriend got a chance to visit her. Man he looks like crap, my dog looks better. I was expecting some hunky cute guy but well he was the total opposite. But he seemed to be a very nice guy. Nice to know that some chicks still go for personality rather than looks. Gives me hope.  Oh and there was this local dating show which premiered yesterday called "Eye for a Guy". It was so damm boring. Ok the gal had a pretty nice rack but the guys were pretty much quite lame. Them with their bulging chests and well-toned arms and tight butts....pfffft!!!

      A friend was doing a presentation in front of customers for the first time and she was understandably pretty nervous about it. I reassured her and told her I had so much confidence in her that I would bet my virginity that she wouldn't screw up.  She called me a few hours later and thanked me; apparently what i said really motivated her NOT to screw up.   Hey what are friends for right ?

      So today I said farewell to a friend of mine. Someone who really helped me through a really bad patch i was going through  last year.  I seriously have no idea if I would have been able to make it through all those months if he wasn't around.  Ok maybe I would but I would have probably been miserable the whole time. Which I definitely was before he came.   A lot of people just don't understand who I am or what I am about, eventhough they known me for a long time. But I only known this guy for 6 months, and he totally got me.  Have fun in Thailand dude, wish I could have gone with ya! And I will definitely come down to Germany and visit you some time.

      So it has been a rather interesting time so far. While me and my colleagues went around sightseeing, I noticed another group of Chinese tourists (probably from another part of China) staring at me. After a couple of minutes (during which I felt like a piece of meat), this gal came over and asked my colleague if she and a few of her friends could take a picture with me. So here I was thinking that they probably thought I was some hot Bollywood actor and willingly obliged. Only after they left did my colleague tell me that they thought I was some African guy; they had never seen someone so dark.    Just got back from the biggest mall I have ever been to and bought 6 movie posters for only 90 RMB - that's around 18 dollars. After that went to this really run down, back alley place for dinner and I had the best dumplings I have ever eaten I probaly had 15 or so. The kitchen wasn't exactly the cleanest I have ever seen (to put it mildly) but a colleague had eaten there a few days ago without any ill effects so hopefully I have the same luck, will know by tommorow.   Oh they have the cheesiest tourist attraction here - it's a tunnel that goes across the river and it lights up with spacey lights and lasers as the train moves - you have to be there to see how cheesy it is. Anyway I got loads of pictures, will probably upload them when I  get back.   For some reason I cannot access any blogspot site here - I think they might have blocked it or something. Fortunately I can still post. Will reply to your comments (if any) when I get back.

      And so in a few hours I shall be off to Shanghai on a journey of adventure and self-discovery. I would like to thank everyone here who helped me when I needed help. To Y for looking hot as hell for me earlier. To everyone who made me feel like I need to leave this hellhole. Wish me luck people.   Just met this cutest sales person who recently joined one of our partner organizations and  would be working with us closely in the near future. Well to be honest I am really worried for her - she seems so naive and young and cutesy that she's probably going to be eaten by the sharks she's gonna work with - sharks = salespeople. Hope she pulls through it.   p.s. Will be back on Friday afternoon.

      Morale super low now. I would rate it a 2/10. Being sexually frustrated doesn't help. Only good thing was I met a totally hot chick through friendster. Thank god for the internet, without it I would have no social life. Or sex life for that matter. Hey cybersex is considered sex alright.   The Black Eyed Peas concert is in an hour but I ain't going. Cos I couldn't find anyone to go with. Where is the love I ask ya? Cos I definitely ain't feeling it.  Will be leaving for Shanghai on Sunday morning at 8 am on SQ 772. Just in case anyone wants to see me off. Anyone at all. I don't mind. I will be there by 6:30 am.

      Speaking of taking chances, I read in the paper yesterday about a skydiving convention in Singapore that is going to held on the end of August. And apparently, anyone can participate - but for novices the price of a jump would be 500 dollars. This is something I really wanted to do for the longest time so I am really looking forward to it. Anyone wanna join me ?

       My entry for  urlLink Blogger Idol . This week's topic is 'Home'.   I think the word "home" means a place of comfort to most people. It's a place where they feel safe, a place they can call their own.   For me that word carries a much more negative connotation. I have always felt like I never belonged here. I felt like an outsider throughout my entire school life, and now I feel the same way at the workplace. And I find it so difficult to meet people here who I can relate to here, people who share my thoughts,views and interests.   I feel like I need to get out of here really soon. A couple days ago my friend and me were discussing the possibility of going down to Australia and looking for a job there if my contract doesn't get extended in September. Think it's time for me to start taking chances in my life, at least that way, even if I fail, I can tell myself I gave it a shot.

      So it is gonna be a very interesting next few weeks thanks to the little stunt I pulled at work a couple days ago. I feel like Jerry Maguire now. You know, the scene where he gets inspired and starts writing that book about ethics in the sports agent industry. And when all his colleagues read it they start cheering and clapping, commending him for being brave and saying everything that no one else dared to. But as they clap and cheer, one of the colleagues whispers to another - "I give him a week". And a week later he was let go, and was forced to leave the company with nothing but a fish and a hot secretary. I am a little nervous now, we have neither in my company.   On a positive note I am extremly proud to announce that my entry for Blogger Idol entitled "Secrets" was chosen by the Blogger Idol founder as one of his  urlLink top 5 favs . I have slogged so hard on my blog entries - reading the thesarus daily for colourful words to use, combing the papers for blog worthy material etc.  And it has finally paid off. Hey there is no shame in feeling validated by a stranger's endorsement so stop telling me so - you my friends are obviously just jealous of my success. Well here's something that will make you even more jealous - I am now officially in the secret elite blogging circle known as "The Secret Elite Blogging Circle". We get free passes to blogging conventions as well as other super cool events like Star Trek screenings. We have numerous intellectual discussions about blogging - like whose blog entries sucked that day and whose didn't. Yes, I finally found a group that I feel a part of.

      I have been frustrated with work as well as work politics for a while now. Today I finally decided to do something about it. Sent out a few emails that I hope will ring some changes to the way things are run; at the very least it will bring out to the open the problems that have been escalating for quite a while now. I'm just so sick of bitching and complaining about everything - I decided it's time I finally do something about it. I'm pretty sure not everyone is gonna be happy about the fact about what I did cos its gonna stir up a lot of commotion the next few weeks but I have reached the point where diplomacy really doesn't make sense anymore. If nothing changes despite my efforts then I will have no choice but to leave.

      Song of the Day: Auf Acshe by Franz Ferdinand  Sample lyrics:  You see her, you can't touch her You hear her, you can't hold her You want her, you can't have her You want to, but she won't let you    Sigh if I had a dollar for every gal I ever wanted to sing that to...well ....I would have three dollars. Well four if you count Uma Thurman; but that doesn't really count cos she was already married at that point, it was never a possibility. Anyone can tell me what Auf Acshe means ?

      I noticed a colleague of mine watching the video of the Micheal Berg's beheading 2 days ago. Yesterday morning my sister asked me if I knew any links where the video was hosted cos her friend was asking for it.  And just a few minutes ago a friend was asking me if I wanted to see the video, she wanted to pass me the link to it. I told her I didn't want to, and she asked me why I wasn't curious to watch it.  My question is why would anyone wanna see something as sick as that? I mean for god's sake it's a video of a person losing his life in a horribly gruesome manner; it's extremely repulsive (at least to me). OK I'm not trying to be like some kind of moral compass here, (I'm like a huge fan of adult films) but I just can't understand why people would wanna watch it. So if you have looked for it and seen it, maybe you can tell me why you did so?

      OK apparently it's not Britney in that picture. And to think I was vigorously fantasising about her earlier this morning using that pic - I feel so cheap/cheated now. Damm you, you hot Britney lookalike. Damm you to hell for misleading me. Is there no honesty or morality in this world anymore ?  Ok btw this is my first post via email! New Blogger rocks!!! But I can't get the blogger comment thingy to work though.

      Yes rumors have been going around that Britney did a playboy spread for 40 million dollars. Check out the  link  for a picture of her naked. It looks a lot like her. Yes I will readily admit that I have always wanted to see her naked; as much as I dislike the crappy pop songs that she churns out I think she's hot as hell. Well except that Toxic song which is actually kinda cool, love the way she grinded her ass on that guy's crotch in the video. I wish I was that guy's crotch.   Information taken from  urlLink Fat Guy for the SKinny Guy .  It's amazing the  urlLink information  that you get from blogs. I bet you didn't know that the song "There She Goes" by Sixpence None the Richer is actually a cover of a song by a band called the LA's and it's about heroin addiction! The ironic thing is that the band is supposedly a christian band.

      Had a great time last night. Met the sis for dinner and to bitch about my increasingly annoying dad.  After that went shopping for my mom's gift for tommorow - got her this pretty nice handbag. Well she picked it out, I just paid half the dough. Shopping for handbags doesn't really rate highly on my list of fun things to do.   After that I met a friend , we bought a couple of beers from 7-11 and hanged out at the beach to talk and stuff. Had a really good time - we just talked and talked and talked.  I have always preferred quiet places compared to pubs and clubs but  for some reason chicks are hesitant to go to secluded places with me.  What's up with that !?

And btw guys say I'm more sexier when I have no voice. Me : (Laughing) It's not really a compliment when guys find u sexier when you don't speak!  Her: You are an asshole. I meant when I speak really softly and low cos I lost my voice.  Me : Eh you know it does sound kinda sexy. Eh go lower for me please?  Her: Don't make me slap you later.   Yeah that's me - a real ladies man.

      And so it is comfirmed, I will be going to Shanghai at the end of the month. But definitely gonna struggle there due to the language and cultural issues. Have to start learning a few key phrases now just to play it safe.  If anyone can help me out with translating the following, I would be very much grateful.   1. Sorry I am not gay. 2. How much for an hour of pleasure? 3. Hey beautiful, would you like to take a ride on the indian stallion?  4. It looks delicious but no dog meat please, I'm on a strict no pets diet.   5. Please don't hurt me, my grandmother was chinese.   Yes in case you don't know, my grandma really is...or was. RIP granny.

      Today my boss asked me how I was finding the task that I been doing (the Java coding that I am doing for another dept as a side project). I took the opportunity to tell him how much I was enjoying the work compared to the usual stuff that I was doing. And it appeared he got the (really obvious) hint - he told me that if I could find someone to take over my regular work I could concentrate on what I was doing.   So I was feeling pretty proud of myself for finally having the balls to tell him that.... until my colleague revealed to me that she had actually told him the exact same thing the day before  - about how i was enjoying this distraction from my usual tasks that were boring the crap outta me. That was probably why he came up to me today and asked me about it in the first place. I thanked her later for telling him, she didn't need or have to do it. Friends like that are hard to find, well at least for me. I have known too many 'friends' who have a lot of soothing/comforting words when I am in trouble or feeling down, but that's all they offer. Words don't really mean shit to me - actions do. It's easy to say to someone you care. But taking the time and effort to show it is another thing altogether.

Here is part of the conversation:  Sis    : Eh nick celebrating the  1 month naming ceremony of his son.this sat, wana go..around 5pm, u free?  Me : cant i going out. told u mah. u tell me so last minute.   Sis    : nick only called me today la.....where you going  Me : play pool. movie. and maybe get wasted.   Sis : cannot postpone.... ? Me : hmm wait ah let me think. choosing between going out with a hot nubile chick or watching a baby being given a name ...........hmm.   Me: ok it was a tough decision but i think I have to decline. But tell the baby I said hi.   Oh in case you are wondering why the English in the conversation has so many strange words like ah and mah it's Singlish.

       urlLink Blogger Idol 15 - Secrets    This is my secret. I been wanting to tell someone all this while. But i have always been afraid because I didn't wanna be thought of as weird or strange. Although considering the fact that most people already think that of me it shouldn't really matter. Well now I am ready to tell you my secret.  I see humorless people.   All the time. Especially at work. People who go about their lives with utter seriousness. At first I didn't believe it - it just didn't seem possible for anyone to be THAT serious all the time. I would spy on them with the corner of my eye, waiting for the first hint of a smile on their lips or a twinkle in their eyes. But it never comes. The eyes stare blankly at the computer screens without any sign of emotion. The lips remains  unsmiled. And as the months go by I realise these people weren't just figments of my imagination, they really did exist.   But then one day I woke up and it dawned on me. I had become one of them.

      Woohoo just found out that I do not have to go for my military reservist training on the 30th of August. Instead I am going for some Military Intelligence Course on the 29th of Nov. Well the course sounds like it would be less strenerous than the one I was supposed to go - that one went by a codename that sounded like it was going to be a pretty painful affair. Hopefully this new course is mainly classroom stuff. But then again who knows maybe 'military intelligence' could include stuff like sniffing the grass on the battlefield to estimate how long it's been since the enemy left? That would be a pretty cool skill to have too. But yeah I guess I will probably find out what's it all about when I go for it.

      I love Tenacious D!! Got the self-titled CD from a friend last week and man it is really funny. So funny I couldn't help snickering at work at times, my colleagues probably figured I had gone insane or something. But the music is pretty good for a comedy album, hey if you can get Dave Grohl to drum for ya you can't be half bad. If you like the Darkness then I suggest you check this out cos it's much funnier than that album. Sample : There's this skit where Jack Black orders a meal from a fast food joint but he asked the counter guy to remove 2 nuggets from the 6 piece nuggets cos he's watching his calories. The guy gets confused (they come in 6 and 12 pieces) and he gets frustrated and tells the guy to stick the 2 nuggets "up your ass". Ok it's funnier when you hear it.

      Read in the local papers a couple days ago that William Hung's debut album (and probably his last one too) sold 5,000 copies in our beloved country. They even had contests to give away autographed copies of his album. And apparently they are playing his songs on local radio as well. I just don't understand why anyone would buy 1 copy, let alone 5000.  Ok yes I laughed along with the world when Hung shaked his bon bons at the audition, but I can't imagine myself listening to an entire album by the Hungster. So if you bought the album, please let me know why. Maybe it's some kind of "let's support our Chinese breathren" thing? Or do you just have really bad taste in music?   Went down to HMV and got myself a couple of CDs. The Best of the Doors and Led Zeppelin II. Yeah they had a whole bunch of CDs going for 17 dollars so I got them.  Went to watch Dawn of the Dead last Friday. Pretty crappy movie except for the beginning which was pretty scary. It was filled with the usual horror cliches: People decide its a good idea wander off alone by themselves to investigate strange noises rather than stay together in a group. And the ending was so Blair Witch.  Was supposed to go cycling with a friend yesterday but she called me in the morning. Friend: Hey I got my period.  Me    : Oh...*long pause*...congrats ? (Ok I read somewhere that women are really proud of their menstrual cycles so I was thought i was probably expected to say something positive) Friend: No no it means I can't go cycling.  Me    : Oh ok ...why ?   Yeah ok I am not exactly well versed in the the female anatomy's bodily functions. Unfortunately you don't get that kind of information from porn movies. Maybe they should add it in, if they did I would probably be an expert by now.

      I was playing Literati with a friend earlier, I was losing really badly so i typed "SHIT" in the window and it came out @@@@ , they censor the words. So I started cussing like crazy at my friend , using words like cu*t and the f words etc. etc. Then she replied that she could actually see the words at her end, they weren't censored so she was pretty shocked and confused as to why I went all vulgar all of a sudden. I kept apologizing, and I lost the game on purpose just to make it up to her. Ok Ok she whips my ass at that game every time.

      Been playing  literati  again, thanks to  Frinn  who persuaded me to try it out. I don't know why, but I have never been able to say no to a hot chick asking me to play some lame ass online game. Anyway I am now hooked onto this lame ass game, but it has improved my vocabulary tremendously! Just today I have learnt 3 new words - gib, mor and hade. Gib is a castrated cat. I am going use that on someone today the next time I insult them. Thank you Literati.

      Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses - Review  I been eagerly anticipating this album, especially after the hugely disappointing Iowa. The problem I had with Iowa was they took the DJ and his samples out of the equation, and it was a big pity cos he was what made the first album so different and refreshing from the standard metal fare, at least for me. Well they gone back to that type of experimentation in the latest release. They have included acoustic ballads, strings, goth syths, military-styled drumming, classic metal guitar solos and songs that alternate between really heavy screaming/growling and singing. Yep Corey has injected a lot more singing into almost all of the songs compared to the previous 2 albums, and he has a decent enough voice so it works most of the time. The only problem I have with this album is that the heavier songs on the album do not really compare to their best songs from their self-titled or even Iowa. There is nothing as intense as EYELESS or Surfacing or even the Heretic Song (the one that comes closest would be The Blister Exists). Overall I would give it 4/5.   Best Tracks : Duality, Before I Forget, Vermillion

      Freaking Euro 2004. I am struggling to stay awake right now. Stayed up to watch Portugal play Spain but I concussed shortly after half time, when I woke up it was already the post-match conference. Think I need to go to bed early and wake up for the England match today.  Listening to Incubus's Make Yourself right now, cos Su highly recommended it to me. Don't really like it so far, it sounds like pretty standard nu-metal fare so far. But the riff in track 4 (she didn't give me the track list) is groovy as hell.  Watched A Simple Life 2 days ago, the new reality show where they get paris hilton and some other chick (apparently lionel ritchie's daughter) to stay with a farmer's family. Pretty ok show, the best part was at the end when the 2 women were sitting at the porch steps looking rather bored and Paris asked the farmer's young teenage son if there was anything fun that they could do. He said "I don't know". Apparently he hasn't seen Paris's infamous video.

      Yeah haven't been in a blogging mood recently. My posts will probably be less frequent nowdays, just haven't been feeling it. So what have I been up to this past week?  Well first trying to get my regular work done by the end of the month. I told the boss a couple of weeks ago that I really need to do something else altogether; that I was getting incredibly bored with the stuff I am doing now. He assured me that I will be able to do that after I finish my current stuff which is why I been slogging like mad to get it done. SO we will see what happens at the end of the month.   Noticed 2 really annoying trends lately. Was in the train on Tuesday when this chicklet who could not be any older than 15 came in wearing a pair of jeans that were so low that I could see right down her butt. I have heard of hipsters but these were more like buttsters. But seriously, the idea of 15 year olds flaunting off their ass cracks is kinda disturbing.   I was browsing through Friendster one day and I noticed a lot of people typing in AlTeRnATe CaPs in their profiles. If you are one of them, please do everyone a favor and cease and desist. It is NOT cute, it's just plain annoying. I could excuse pre-teens doing it, cos they probably think it makes them cool or something. But not adults.  Have been forcing a lot of my friends to listen to the song "Vermillion Pt. 2" by Slipknot, and surprisingly so far all of them like it. Never thought that it would ever happen. Well I would have never thought that Slipknot would ever release a acoustic ballad either. Go check out the song if you haven't.   Been listening to Icarus Line on repeat for the last couple of days. Trying my best to get into it but it's tough as hell, it's pretty inaccessible. But some of the riffs are pretty amazing though, like the ones in songs "Caviar" and "Spike Island". Critics have hailed The Icarus Line as the saviours of rock, just like they did with At the Drive-In two years ago. They were right that time (well at least till the band broke up), this time I am still not convinced.   Next album I am probably gonna get is Van Lear Rose by Loretta Lynn, a 70 year old country singer. Amazing reviews so far. Check the reviews out under my wishlist columm on the right.

      Funny incident yesterday. I was at this women's clothing store with a friend and she was buying some exercise shorts. As we waited at the counter, the woman in front of us in the queue asked the cashier is she was entitled to a free bra because she was buying 3 as it was stated in the promotion poster. The cashier asked a salesgal to confirm and get the bra. The salesgal came back with a bra and then in front of us (and everyone in the queue) asked the woman loudly whether her size was 72A. I already get embarassed when salesgals shout out my waist size, so can only imagine how she felt. She seemed quite taken aback when the salesgal asked her.   Splurged 80 dollars at HMV yesterday as well. Bought CDs by Rage Against the Machine, Franz Ferdinand, The Icarus Line and Spin magazine. Met up with a friend who is probably the only person I know who is more passionate about music than me, she was working at HMV but she quit last week due to management issues. Kinda ironic cos I was actually contemplating working there for 6 months if I leave in August, just so I could do something that I would enjo. Work politics everywhere. But yeah she seemed pretty impressed that I bought the Icarus Line. Think I will ask her out for dinner or something soon. Hey I don't really impress that many gals alright.

      Went to watch Prisoner of Azkhaban last Friday, and surprisingly I enjoyed it. Probably because I didn't read the book, people who did generally thought that the movie was inferior to the book and that it left out a lot of details like Quidditch. Personally I think Quidditch is a pretty lame ass game - bunch of kids flying around in brooms trying to score by putting balls through hoops,  but all the scores don't matter if someone gets this special ball with wings on it. But yeah back to the movie. I guess I liked it because it was unlike the first one which was way too kiddish for my tastes. And add to that the cute chicklet who is well on her way to becoming a hottie. Ok just kidding alright, im not a paedo or anything. Highly recommended. The movie I mean.

      Got the nicest compliment from a friend last week. She told me that my presence really made her feel better when she was feeling down. And I thought to myself, that I have certainly come a long way since the day when a gal I fancied told me I was invading her space. Then the friend told me that maybe I should make my presence felt to other women instead and make them feel better as well, cos she was feeling a lot more better so she felt I didn't need to be around her anymore. Sigh she's so selfless, gotta love her.

      Went for dinner and drinks with 2 of my friends J and S yesterday, J came back from Florida 2 weeks ago and I haven't seen him in like 3 years. But it seemed like old times, not much has changed - although he did tell me I changed a lot. I think he was probably shocked that I actually talk to women now. But it was really nice to catch up with him, I will probably head down to US someday and pay him a visit. And at the same time go see Ozzfest, the metal festival that they have every summer in US.   So after spending last week in Shanghai it's back to my normal work duties. The last 2 days were a real drag I tell ya, I am already looking forward to the end of the week. Not a good sign.   Is there anyone who hasn't seen TROY yet. I wanna go see but seems like everyone I know has seen it. So if you haven't seen it let me know cos I hate going to the movies alone. Chicks get priority of cos. Speaking of TROY, a pretty funny incident at the restaurant yesterday. I was telling J how much I wanted to see Troy and he was asking me if I really liked Brad Pitt that much. And I said that I did cos he was pretty cute. And the waitress who was serving us grinned when she heard me say it. Sigh why does society frown on men admiring the looks of other men? I mean he is cute and has a really nice body, can anyone (guy or gal) disagree with that?  I think not! I got gal friends complimenting other gals on their looks all the time, no one raises an eyebrow. In fact I even get kinda turned on when a gal friend tells me how hot she thinks another gal is. But yeah anyway my point is guys should be able to compliment each other on their looks. So any guy friends of mine reading this, feel free to tell me how cute you think my butt is. And I will return the compliment.

      Finally got my copy of Slipknot's latest album which I been looking forward to for quite a while now, despite the rather disappointing Iowa. And so far it sounds really amazing, it's very different from the first 2 albums. Firstly, there are actually a few acoustic tracks in here. Secondly, they have actually have quite a few guitar solos that immediately reminded me of those from those 80s speed metal bands. Thirdly it's very prog-ish at parts, they really upped the experimentation on this one. Finally Joey actually sings a lot more - he has always had a pretty good singing voice and he uses it to good effect here.  Still gonna need a few more listens to get into the whole album, but for a sampler check out "Vermillion Pt. 2", a really beautiful ballad.   Yes I am finally back from Shanghai, flew back yesterday afternoon. So what can I say about my experience there? Well for one I love the weather to death, so much so I am starting to miss it already. It's cool the entire day and I didn't even sweat once. The traffic was pretty scary though - I am not exaggerrating when I say I get a little scared everytime I cross the road; in this land vehicles rule, pedestrians only have the sound of a blaring horn to warn them to get out of the way. And add to that they drive on the wrong side of the road (similar to US and other European countries) and it was quite disconcerting.   The food was amazing, I am not really a fan of Chinese cuisine in Singapore but the food there is something else. The best food we had was at this stall down a dark alley where there were cats like sniffing around our table.   Only thing I didn't like was that there were quite a few beggars on the streets and they mainly target people who aren't Chinese looking. I got harassed by quite a few of them, they were pulling at my shirt and pants and followed me for quite a distance. My colleagues on the other hand weren't harassed even once - they could probably wave wads of money around and probably would not still be disturbed.   All in all it was an enjoyable experience, I definitely needed a break from my workplace and it proved to be just the thing, I feel a whole lot better now.

      Had dinner with a friend yesterday at Brewerkz. Was planning to introduce a gal friend of mine to him at the same time but she had plans. But she did call later and this was how the conversation went.   Me to A: Eh wasted you couldnt come, wanted to intro u to my friend.  A  to Me: Is he cute?  I  to Me: No tell her I am not cute.  Me to A: He says he's not cute but he has a really big dick.  *I looks at me horrified*  A : I'm not interested in that ! Me : Well I'm just trying to tell you all his good points, starting from the biggest.   OK might need to work on my matchmaking skills a bit more.   But this waitress there started chatting with me for quite a bit. That doesn't happen very often, I should buy 4D.

      Ok I don't get this. Why are so many people so hadap (desperate) for National Day Parade tickets. Hell they even have contests to give away NDP PREVIEW tickets. That's tickets to the rehearsal it's not the even the real thing.   Yeah I know all the propaganda bullshit about how we should be proud of our country and all that. But seriously any singaporean should realise it's the same crap everyday. The lame ass symbolic attempts at showing how our country is full of culture and how we all live in perfect racial harmony. Then they will get some local Mandarin pop star and/or actress (for whom English isnt even her first language) singing a really horrid english national song that they probably came up with in 5 minutes to commemorate the occasion.  Then you get the four ethnic groups coming out in their traditional costumes, never mind the fact that no one here wears them anymore. First they will sing and dance separately. Then by the end of the performance they will all merge together and dance in one united circle in a show of racial harmony.  Then you get the middle-aged and really old people whom they pull away from their jobs at their factories to take part in some lame ass performance where they spent 4 -5 months to learn how to wave sticks with shiny streamers at one end in perfect synchronization. Hey we gotta make them feel like they are important right.  You know what I wanna see? I wanna see our grossly overpaid ministers (who by the way were the first employees to get their paycuts restored) doing really dangerous stunts for charity like what celebrities do for that NKF show. Heh that will be fun, seeing these pple doing some real work for a change instead of just sleeping during parliment. Or have some free-for-all event like Royal Rumble for the ministers; the winner gets to be the next Prime Minister. Well it does makes more sense than appointing someone just because he's the son of a former Prime Minister. Come on you know as well as I do that's true.

      Checked out a new blog by  urlLink Sara .It's a really good read, especially the "For Men Series" which is a rant to guys about how they do not understand women and includes tips on what they should do to/for women; it's pretty funny and sometimes informative stuff so go check it out. But its supposedly part of a National Day Parade (NDP) thingy so not sure if its permanent though. And to comment you have to register which is kinda annoying. Yep thats the government for ya, you can't say or post anything without them knowing who you are. Sigh times like this I feel like screaming FREEDOM like Wallace did in Braveheart as he died. I love that movie by the way.

      My dad turned 55 earlier this month and as a result got his CPF money. For the clueless, CPF is a fund set up by the government where anyone working contributes a certain percentage of his wage to that fund. The money stays in the fund until 55 when he can withdraw everything. It's basically like a savings plan.  Well since he got the money my dad has been on a spending spree. He has bought a new watch for himself, gold chains and bracelets, furniture, beds, installed ceiling fans with lights for every room in the house, fans, phones ( I now have 2 phones in my room). Oh and let's not forget the huge ass statue of a dog, how can I forget that when it sticks out like a sore thumb in the living room.   And yesterday he bought a stereo system for me, eventhough I didn't asked for it. I guess he was trying to make up for giving away my existing Kenwood Hi-FI in my room to someone without asking me. But it's a really crappy stereo system with a unknown brand name (Wearnes). I checked it out on the website and it's apparently some local brand; the few  urlLink reviews  I could find of its products were pretty awful. The sound is really hollow and the LCD display on the amplifier seems like it was made in the 90s. The volume starts from "-80". But that's not the best part,  The VCD/CD player (no DVD) comes with 2 game controllers. Yes apparently it's some bizarre hybrid CD player/game console. A CD came with it that supposely contains 300 stellar games. Some of the games including "Mteal Gear" and "Rocd Man". Nope those aren't my spelling mistakes, thats what it says on the CD.   I am giving him 2 months before all the money runs out. Cos that was the amount of time he took to finish his $50,000 pension he got 6 years ago from the army.

      Work stuff really got to me yesterday and I really needed to hang out with someone. Called a friend and asked her if she wanted to meet, she told me she had some stuff she had to do, but I could go to her place and hang out if I wanted. And so I did. And I felt better. Friends like her are hard to find. There are times when I get really down and just don't wanna be alone, but couldn't find someone who was free to hang out with. It's a pretty sucky feeling.  Finally finished "Rock and Roll: A Social History", a book I borrowed from the library a few days back. A really intriguing read, it describes the beginning of rock music and the early pioneers (Chuck Berry, Fat Joe Domino) right up to the 80s (Iron Maiden, Metallica, Van Halen). It gets a bit technical at times when the author describes the guitar playing of of certain artists; I really should try and pick up the guitar. But there are quite a lot of intriguing facts in the book, like how almost all the musicians took psychoactive drugs like marijuana and LSD to attain a higher state of creative consciousness; this even included clean cut bands like the Beatles. Highly recommended.  p.s. You know that you are in a rut when a chick ditches you to rush back home to tape Johnny Bravo.

      Reasons why I (and most technical people) hate 99% of sales people.    1. They don't know shit about technical issues yet they feel fit to make suggestions, hell even decisions on such issues.   2. They ignore your existence until they need help with a technical issue.  3. No response from you equates to your agreement to be involved in their money making plan.   4. They equate the value of projects by how much revenue it gets them, screw personal development and other factors.   5. You might be roped in to help out in a money making project, but if anything goes wrong you are held accountable.  6. They would rather force the technical people to take a more difficult and tedious alternative if it saves the cost of a flight ticket from Singapore to KL.  7. They are in love with money, it is their main motivator. Money is the root of all evil. Hence they are evil and should be destroyed. Preferably with the use of multiple hatchets.

      I think I over-exerted my left bicep muscle, it's painful as hell and I can't even straighten my arm without whining like a puppy. That's what happens when you try to do something strenerous with your left hand when you normally would use your right. Hey I was bored alright, just thought I would give it a try. That's me, always experimenting.   Yes I am still alive, despite the lack of updates. Still can't find back the motivation to blog. There were a few days in the past few weeks where I logged into blogger and started typing an entry but gave up halfway, it just seems so forced. I haven't been feeling good about a lot of stuff in my life, including myself. I guess I don't take criticism as well as I dish it out.   My contract at work is ending really soon, and I am still not sure if I should leave or stay. Yes the work sucks ass, but the perks are pretty amazing and not easy to find anywhere else. Have to make a decision pretty soon.  Watched The Birds, an Alfred Hitchcock classic a couple days ago. I wasn't too impressed to be honest. It's supposed to be pretty scary but I found the attacks rather tame and the blood looked really fake. But there are some really great scenes here. Like when the birds amass at the playground behind the woman but she doesn't notice them. And the final scene is pretty amazing as well, Wonder how they got all the birds to keep still. Gonna watch Dial M for Murder tommorow, thats the other movie I borrowed.  Went to watch Mean Girls yesterday evening with D and her sis. I msged D before we met telling her she should fake a stomachache if I and her sis hit it off; meant it as a joke of course but she didn't take it too well. Note to myself: no mention of siblings in future jokes. Anyway the movie kinda sucked, I read pretty good reviews about it but it turned out to be pretty standard teenage chick flick stuff.   Baybeats starts this evening but I can't find anyone to go with so gonna give it a miss. Rock is dead it seems.   Yesterday was a sucky day for me at work. The finance department finally moved in to take over my usual work cubicle. I could feel the hate rising inside of me as I saw the lot of them trotting in and happily putting their stuff at the desks that my department used to occupy. Now I know how the Indians felt when the pilgrims took over their land.

      Yes there have been numerous complaints recently about Google's new email service. The problem most of them have with Gmail is privacy, or rather the lack of it - Gmail has software that scans incoming messages, picks out keywords and displays ads relevant to the email message.

      Well Greece, against all odds, have won the Euro Championships. This was a team that have never won a game in any of the previous championships. A lot of football purists have derided the defensive style of football that Greece have played; Greece won their last 2 matches by defending all the way and scoring through set pieces. However, I was wondering why don't the Singapore government just follow Greece's tactics to achieve Goal 2010 (the goal being Singapore winning the Asian Cup by 2010, it used to be the World Cup until they realised 5 years later that there was no way in hell they could achieve it). This is the plan I propose.  1. Forget about strikers and creative midfielders. Concentrate on training defenders and sweepers. If the opposition can't score they can't win. 2. Train a few wingers, mainly people who can run the ball, they don't even need to cross, just as long as they can win a corner. 3. Import the tallest basketball player they can find from USA or China, give him Singapore citizenship, and get him to solely concentrate on learning how to head the ball from corners.  4. In the actual match, the Singapore team will defend all the way till the 60 something minute, when the opposition will start to tire. Then after that, get one of the wingers to run the length of the field with a ball and win a corner. 5. Immediately, substitute in the basketball player, he heads in the goal.  6. Defend till full time.  7. Repeat 4 - 6 every match until you win the cup.

      Had my first game of tennis with 3 of my friends yesterday. Man it's really much tougher than it looks on television, I spent most of my time picking up balls instead of hitting the ball with my racket. But it was a really good workout, in fact my biceps seem bigger now after all that swinging. Gonna be doing this on a regular basis in an effort to lose some weight.  Audrey came back home with me to see my sister's kid after tennis and after she left my mom asked me if that was my girlfriend. For her any gal I bring back home automatically has to my girlfriend. Then when I said no, she started saying stuff like whether if it was ok if she looked for a girl for me. My response to that is too inappropriate to post here.

      Elliot Smith is slowly growing on me, thanks to the Good Will Hunting soundtrack that a colleague borrowed me. He's very mellow, very unlike most of the stuff I listen to usually, but his voice has this really dreamy quality to it that's just so cool.   Speaking of music, Hoobastank is in town and they will be performing on Saturday at Sentosa. Another generic boring nu metal band hits our friendly shores. Who's next? Limp Biskit?  Sigh is it too much to ask for a half decent band to come to Singapore? Or at least give me Korn, the only half decent nu metal band in the scene right now (despite their really sucky last album).  Went to Hard Rock Cafe on Monday to see Kumar perform, or as he calls it, "Mat Rock Cafe". Heh that guy is damm funny, I was laughing till tears rolled down my face. But he can be pretty mean too. He got one of the dancers to perform for him , and asked her to remove her top before she danced, (she was wearing some sports bra kinda top underneath). But as soon as she took it off, he went "Alamak no tek tek (boobs), put the top back, put it back!". Sigh the poor gal, I so wanted to comfort her at that moment. While her top was still off.

      In the spirit of National Day we now have an online beauty pageant called  urlLink Singapore Face . Basically this is how it seems to work; people send in their pictures, and the public gives them a rating from 1 - 10 based on their pictures.  Gotta give props to the people who sent in their pictures, especially those that aren't that great looking. I mean you have to feel a bit sucky if you get a rating of less than 5 right. Oh Audrey joined as well, think she has a pretty decent shot of winning it.

      Went to watch "The Village" with a chick I gotta know recently. I was a little apprehensive cos it was the first time we went out just the two of us. I was afraid that it was gonna end up awkward, so much so that I even asked another mutual friend to join us for the movie but he couldn't make it. Anyway my fears turned out to be unfounded, I ended up having quite a nice time.   The movie? Well it was a tad slow in the beginning but pretty good overall. I got spooked quite a few times and I didn't really guess the surprise twist at the end. That was the main problem with Signs for me, I spent the whole movie trying to figure out what the twist was - and in the end I was left really disappointed cos there really wasn't one. This time I just watched it without trying to figure out the ending and enjoyed the story way better.

      Just realised it's been 2 years since  urlLink I first started blogging. . As you might have noticed my writing has definitely changed since that day. Man everything has changed in my life since then. Well ok maybe not everything, I am still single and still having trouble getting laid. Well on a positive note, my penis seems to have grown 1 cm longer over the past 2 years. Happy 2nd anniversary stallion.

      A book I found while I was at Borders earlier; it's by the Dalai Lama. If you need advice on dying seems like he's the man to ask. Although I can't really figure out what he would say. Something like "I recommend multiple self-inflicted stabs with a sharp kitchen knife to the gut."? &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Yesterday I typed out my first ever poem for a gal. Here is an excerpt.   Roses are red, Violets are blue, Your top today looks great, That's why I wanna sit beside you.  Not a bad effort for a first timer is it? But judging from her response you would think otherwise!
