      Austria is wicked! The landscape is so strange, and the way things work over here is slightly wack too! This is where I am sitting at the moment typing the basics of the trip in to my blog and wishing I could remember right now every little detail of the trip.  The current city that I am in is nice but again boring without the history, so I think that if you were yo visit these places, you should probbably go on a contiki, especially because they give you the main reason for the current state of affairs owing to the thick and rich history of each place you go to.

      I have said it before, and I will say it again, these people rock my world!  We are all so close, we are all so happy. I can't think of somewhere I would rather be.  and the strange thing is that, even though we have only been on the trip for less than a month, it seems that living so close to so many people like we do, you feel after only a short period  of time that you have known these people for your entire life.  I am not looking forward to the end of this trip very much. I know how hard it is going to be to see these people leave. and i'm not at all looking forward to it.  cest la vie

      Rome, was pretty awesome, the cicstine chapple was definatly a highligh. and our tourguide went that extra little bit of distance for us, and we managed to see all the good things on top of the standard touristy things too. The coloseum, well its pretty big, and I can now say that I have seen it. But the only wonder is really how something like this could have been build all those many years ago.  Highlight of the trip so far, an amazing feat of engineering, and something that is still confusing engineers today - the pantheon. I was truly speachless and the first sighting of this monstrous creation - I really recommend rome for this alone allthough it only takes up about ive minutes of your time. it really is an amazingly beautifull structure, I have photos of it too, but I aren't able to upload them yet.

      Florece was nice but boring, ther was lots to see and lots of shopping, but being on a shoestring budget, shopping was not something I was lookoing for. The food was fairly  mediocre as well. so far as a tourists spot, I wouldn't recommend going for long, but was nice to see David, and a few other works of art be the well known father of david, but all in all I would have been happier either way.

      Wow what an awesome place, it so strange to see a city with no cars, trucks, bikes etc everything is water based like the  (overpriced) gondollas. The church was about as good as the many I have seen all around europe, but the city itself was the most impressive thing. If you should plan to go to venice, I would recommend it, but bear in mind that there is really only enough there to keep you interested for mno more than two days.  Did you know that the entirety of venice is built on top of underwater foundations. There is a lot of history here two, I have been finding out along the way, about how much the nations of europe are intertwined.   Our tour guide is fantastic too, he is really good at giving just the right amount of information along with cutting out  all of the crap, for instance, we went on a guided tour through the streets of florence, with a local guide (because over here it is illegal to be a guide unless you have a permit, and are a local based business) who was crap because she keeped on telling us about how many bricks it took to build a certain church, and how many steps there were to the top, rather than any of the important information about the history of the place.

      It is really hard to get good quality internet time, I mean there are internet cafes everywhere arround europe, but it is just not the same as sitting down in front of your own keyboard and typying away to your hearts content. I would really like to go through and proof everythign that I write, but unfortunatly I can not as it will cost mye extra. so please excuse the bad spelling, and punctuation.  So yes, I am still alive, but I dont often get the oportuninity to updated this blog. =(

      After a over long trip in the bus stinking and smelling from being couped up like chickens in a hatchery, we arrived at an town called Bidot, located in the french riviera a nice little place to hang out, but really a center of operations for our day excursion to Nice (pronounced neese). Neice was okay, quite a lazy wee town really but, it was built along the foreshore of the mediteranian sea, and for that you had all the things you may associate with such a setting. The beach was Awesome, I have never seen such blue water, blue within blue, and crystal clear too. even though it was a working day there were people lazing beside the beach, rollerblading, eating icecreams, drinking coffee, and generally enjoying the sun.

      Cruising around the streets of Paris, Barcelona, Italy, Rome and so fourth there has been one interesting familiarirty between all of these great cities... Sunshine, or perhaps more correctly lack thereof. I have walked the streets of Bueatiful Paris, sauntered along to a street made salsa in barcelona, I have even tasted the pizza's of pizza the one thing that no longer suprises me is a that when it rains there seems to be some strange chemical reaction with the locals. Although I have noticed that about sixty percent of the population are immune to this reaction, the other twenty percent are not. This strange occurance seems to affect their skin color, accent, and cloathes. And the following few lines are basic insight in to the research I have done and the results of this research.  If you are walking down one of these streets and it starts to rain, you will find on every corner of every street and every quarter in-between some of the population the city have turned in to two legged walking umbreller shops. It is a strange phenomenon it is especially strange to see a shop get up and walk after you for three or four paces saying in broken english "ello ello, you wan umbrella.... ellooooo?"  Upon accepting the invitation to buy an umbrella you have the opportunity to become a yobbish loud american with a thick Los Angelese accent and denounce verbally that these "brollies" aren't worth the (self-assumed) price of €30.00 and tell our walking north african shop that you will pay no more than €15.00 for this cheap piece of china crud (yes I kid you not dear friends, this did happen) to which the walking shop will reply with a broad grin that shows off his enormous white teath outlined by thick red lips and a face as black as coal, "yeseir bob, you got me.. fifteen good".   Or you can be a smart contiki kid and haggle them thar umbreller salesmen down to €2.70 (my current best, but someone else was offered an umbreller for €2.50 (my next goal should I get the chance)). So  you can see by the haggled price that taking the road of an american yob in europe could get you broke quite quickly.

      Bar·ce·lo·na    Pronunciation Key  (bäçe-lºna)  A city of northeast Spain on the Mediterranean Sea. Founded by the Carthaginians, it prospered under the Romans and Visigoths, fell to the Moors in 713, and was taken by Charlemagne's Frankish troops in 801. It has long been a center of Catalan separatism and radical political movements. Population: 1,770,296.  Or if you are a local it is pronounced barthelona, accompanied with a thich warm accent. The slums of this city denounce the place to be of less wealth than it is. Thought the streets are not as clean as those in Paris, the full of the rich aroma of life and character. Buskers, beggars and theives walk here, and saw all within my first hour of being let loose on the streets. Though I was a target for none, it was interesting to see the salt-of-the-earth perform here. The bands on the street are amazing, I could not get over how much more alive the music sounds. It is though the very essence of the musicians are eminating from the instruments they caress.  I must sign off quickly now, the bus is coming I think and I need to go and check. ciao for now.

      Wow, what an amazing place, the coutryside here is something that will be etched in to mind for many years to come. The serene rolling lanscape of southern France has grown like sleeping mushrooms the gentle orange earthbrick houses that are apart of the larger wine making community of france. The greenery of the landscape shows many signs of the local culture, wine is such an interwover aspect of society here that the signs of it soon become as natural as the moss covered bolder or the acient trees with finger like roots sprawling across the countryside. the vineyards to crawl like roots, and they cover a large majority of the land that surrounds the chaeau where we are staying. There is little that is not now been converted in to vineyard. Should you wish to wonder to the hills you will also find select areas of the finest crops, in what would surely become some of those rare and cheished bottles of wine so expensive, that only those who have yet not sold their soul, could purchase.  Something interesting to note, fully mature vines are only around a foot off the ground over here.

      The food is simple but satisfying, the Contiki crews are fun and outgoing in general this is shaping out to be a fatastic trip. Not many of my fellow travellers are boozers, or shopperholics. In fact we all seem to be a pleasant mix of what or tour manage Chris (a.k.a neo) has devised as the three sections of contikiers: Boozers, Shoperholics & Thrillseekers.

      Paris wasn´t what I was expecting, I would agree with a lot of people who say that paris has to be one of the most beautiful cities on earth, and it is quite clean! Paris was also one of our first stops where we all spent the night in one of the contiki villiages, and hence we all got a little more familier with one another. Now I don´t know if our tour manager is telling mincie pies, but apparently we are one of the best groups he has ever toured with, and a quick sureptitious word with the bus driver also reveals that he too thinks we are definatly one of the best groups. So I was still a little pesimistic about these comments not being totally true as you could imagin a tour guide wanting his clientelle to be happy. But I must admit that there is not one single person who has issues with one particular person or the entire group, I am totally amazed that such a fantastic group of people would so quickly become those whom I would lable as friends, and this is a fairly big statement, for althought I may say someone is my friend, most of the time I would really regard them as an associate. But all of these people whom I travel with are indeed of the true friend variety. For this I am happy. Trie Bien.  The Effile Tower is not as amazing as had imagined, not at least in the same way that I imagined it, it is truely one of the many feates of wonder that I have and will encounter during my sojourn. During every O´clock in the dark velvet of night, the world biggest radio antennae lights up with thousands of strobes, giving it the effect of a glittering be-jeweled needle that peirces the horrizion. I have photos, and when I get the opportunity to finish wy web gallery software, I will stick them on the net for all to see.  Napoleon has a lot to answer for in frech history and alot of that we are learning during this trip he may be seen as a villian for so many lives were taken because of his desicions. But the nation of france still loves him for what he did and how he was, should you so desire - I urge you to learn more about his amazing deeds for he was truley a remarkable person.  Should you ever visit france you may notice many statues of Napoleon or a large emblazioned "n" on some of the architechture around paris. This is a sign of Napoleon´s passing.

The keys on the keyboards at this workstation are totally different layout from normal.  Banking is hard here I am having dificulty trying to transfer money back to New Zealand, and because I owe some friends money and an overdue to pay it back, I an starting to stress a little.

Everything is getting weirder by the minute and the thought of being on the other side of he world from where you were only 24 hours ago - is not helping, but we only have three more hours to go before we will allow ourselves the blissful, beautiful dreamy, warm, comfortable a much anticipated joy of a good nights sleep. Wish us luck

      I felt like one of the subjects of that much watched Reality TV series "Airport" talking to the customs officer about why I was in London, how long I was going to stay and why I was wearing my pants on my head. I was almost worried when he walked away with m passport saying "Stay here, I just need to nip out and have a word with someone" as luck would have it he didn't come back with a big pale London army officer with a gun bigger than his... did I tell you that all the girls here say the men are quite small? I felt bemused and not a little worried at being deported before the fun even began, at this point I started on my super telepathetic powers of Jedi mind tomfoolery and kept repeating in my mind: "you don't need to see his identification, these aren't the droids you're looking for" Anyway I didn't need to worry at all as my pseudo arch villain became my night in shining armour when he announced that he was going to re-instate my long expired working holiday visa.

      Pie floaters in pea soup is pretty much how one would describe London at first glance, on decent to Heathrow we passed through not less than five layers of cloud, quite surprising considering the fact that as I write this the sun is beaming happily through the slider doors of our generous hosts living room. So the two current most notable things about London are fog so thick you can slice it with Boeing, and size; London is big... no bigger than big its really really big, noticeably twice as big as any of the cities we flew over while travelling to this illustrious destination. You can't see the ends of the city lights, it's almost overwhelming. Especially when you see the mix of industrial areas and suburban slums intermixed like the strands of a flax basket.

      I was aware that I would be flying over some fairly foreign country, and it was quite rewarding to see them the way I did. What I was not prepared for was the most amazing vistas I saw during the plane journey to London. If you have never seen the kiss of dawns child, upon virgin white clouds that surely must be the stairs to heaven; then there is yet another of life's surprises that; should you ever have the opportunity to see 'must not pass on. It is truly a sight to behold when this is all framed by a backdrop bright twilights stars dancing in the heavens like ruby and sapphire fireflies around a gypsy campfire. Mere words have not the capacity to describe what I have seen. I urge you to see it for yourselves. You can truly appreciate the beauty of a city from a-far especially when you are 12 thousand meters up gazing down on such a city taken by night's darkness, marked only by ten million street lights. Yes plane travel can give you a perspective on things that you may never imagine. The things I saw were not expected and so surreal, and this is why I urge you. Don't forget your sleeping pills.

      I will turn your attention to the first section where I took the nicety of sitting behind an exit door for granted. Our second league was not as convenient, not being so horizontally challenged as most; getting good quality shuteye on the thirteen and a half hour flight to Heathrow was difficult and not at all pleasant. However exhaustion and ultimately free alcohol got the better of my sunny disposition and soon I was off to the land of nod, and surprisingly had some good REM time. In total I think Rachelle and I got no more than three hours between the two of us for 36 hours of being awake. (Aaron got the most at one stage he was fast asleep and I needed to make a visit to the bathroom.  I tried for at least 5 minutes to wake him up and of course I couldn't so I called for the stewardess and asked if I could climb over Aaron. Sure not a problem was the answer and she helped me do so (a special note just picture airline seats made for midgets and the near physical impossibility for any normal sized person to sit in comfortably, little own perform amazing feats of contortionism. Oh if only I had been awake to see the fun. - Aaron.)  I even had to climb back, still not a stir from sleeping beauty. ) So as you could imagine as I write this I don't yet think the exciting reality of this experience has surpassed the surreal dreamlike zombie state that we are both in. It's truly amazing how funny the most mundane things become when you are deprived of sleep. I had a dream that I had superpowers if I wore in my favorite underpants on my head.

      The ten and a half hour plane trip was enjoyable and arriving in Singapore airport was very interesting. The departure gates are too numerous to count (hundreds) and up to forty 747's wait in queue to take off, which can take up to an hour of sitting in a plane grounded, waiting for your turn to leave. The Singapore terminal was nice, very tidy and slightly cooler than the 39 degree muggy tropical atmosphere outside. The Black beret topped guards with fully automatic weapons were a comforting sight, quite friendly and not at all intimidating, I had a chat with one and he was very friendly, but politely declined when I asked to take a photo of him. There were more shops in the Singapore terminal alone than there are in any two blocks of Hamilton. Something to laugh at: a small glass room which was one of the few places where smoking was permitted; presided on the first floor where people would go and sit like caged animals puffing on their death sticks. You could just about see the tar floating around inside that room, and the stale rank of cigarette smoke was something that will inspire poets anywhere to write only of death and morbidity if anything at all should they not give up the will to live first.

      Boarding the Singapore airlines plane was a tear filled goodbye for Rachelle and Family, both Sonia and Ron weren't their usual sunny selves as Rachelle and I walked through the departing passenger's gateway to the land of duty free goods. Rachelle had the presence of mind to ask for exit seats - that is seats just behind an exit door where one has the luxury of slouching as much as want and stretching legs out as far as possible, something I had taken for granted on the first league from Auckland to Singapore Airport. Tim (one of my fantastic flatmates in Hamilton) will appreciate the huge amount of people who carried iPods with them, something that was not necessary on the Singapore flight as the place has excellent entertainment facilities. You may watch any number of "Recent" movies from "The last samurai" to "Love actually" The movies are played at your personnel request via a little remote control, and as everyone has their own TV screen in front of them, you have absolute freedom when choosing what to watch and when. The entertainment facilities also has a huge range of episodes from pop soaps like CSI, Scrubs, West wing, Friends etc. along with a built in Nintendo entertainment system there is more hours of entertainment than there is flying time. "Flight also gives you the opportunity to watch on screen your GPS flight information.  Including altitude, time, date, speed, head wind speed and a good idea of who the lights below you belong to.  This did give me the shits a little especially over and around the Middle East countries"  -shell

I spoke to Rachelle the other day, she seems be getting in to the swing of things, and is starting enjoy her job a little more, which is a good thing!  I'm really tired right now, last night I did not get a very good sleep, as I had taken some Gurana (herbal, energy pill, seed extract from caffeine related plant, available from most health stores) but got knocked off early so I had quite a restless sleep.  I went clubbing in reading for the first time the other night, it was a Monday so it was fairly quiet but pretty much the clubs in reading are very similar to those in N.Z I am yet to experience the awesomness of the London City Night Clubs.

      So Anyway, I have two companies chasing after me to do some programming, which is fantastic! I don't know much about the work place or the the work except that I will be working on some top secret projects? And they can't tell me anything until I sign a NDA. One of the companies is a environmental awareness company that hosts huge dance parties in Ibiza and all around Europe, they use the dance parties to get the message out and do advertising type stuff. The Second Company is involved with pharmaceuticals that's about all I know right now. The people that I have spoken to so far all sound fantastic with very positive attitudes towards life and everything else.  Work at the walkabout pub is still pretty fantastic too, even though the pay is terrible (it is still enough to get along and to pay back debts in NZ).

      So anyway My trial at the Local walkabout has finished. I have done many jobs so far: Bar Tender, Doorman, chef, Cleaner and glassy. I think that management a fairly happy with my work. I am quite happy in this job right now!  The staff are all awesome, I have been accepted straight away by all of them with no exceptions, its great! There is quite a family atmosphere here and this is quite amazin for the size of the staff list. There are at the moment about twenty five staff that will be working at any one time the bar is quite large, there is a fourstand bar down bellow and a three stand up top. So it is a medium sized bar. Or small if you consider the size of the Ministry of sound club in London which holds about 7000 people on any one night. Ours probably holds about 900-1000.  I was working in the kitchen yesterday, and the sink got blocked, so I had to go in to the Grease trap room, disassemble the lid of the grease trap, and clean out the rotting food and whatknot - lucky I had a mucusy nose at the time, because apparently it smells very foul indeed. The other chief that was there dry reached when he came near the grease trap room, just to give you some idea.  I am cycling about 50-60kms a day to keep up my fitness, and to get to work. The train to work takes only about 8 mins and costs about £2.40 but that can be up to £8 per day, which can get expensive in the end, and a bit excessive considering I can bike the distance easily.  Te night before last was FANTASTIC! as at this stage I have learned the till system, and most of the little quirks of the bar. I worked hard and fast, and also made about £5 in tips, which is pretty good for a first night I hear. (it was my third night, second night on the bar)  I will probably be staying in the UK a little while longer now, I want to give myself the chance to pay off a few debts in pounds.  Chell is good, she isn't staying in the same area as me at the moment, as she has a teaching job out the other side of London, but She is on good money and is reasonably happy with her current job.

      They're actually quite good, I am quite happy with the level of service that I have received to date. In fact I would go so far to say that there is if any only one small problem with the banks over here. And that would be; the people. But it is not as bad as "obnoxious unhelpful old lady, with no hint of a soul (because she sold it to the devil(her manager) years ago) behind the teller window, who sits there with a permanent sneer, and spits brimstone when she speaks" that your mind is picturing right now. No not at all, infact most of them are middle aged good looking, friendly (though not too friendly) intelligent women. For instance 'Genia'* was a very pretty, intelligent, On-To-It, smartly dressed, helpful go-getter type person with always a brilliant smile upon her face, constantly playing at the corners of her be-dimpled mouth and a spring in her step. It Seems that Genia would just about move hell and earth to get a job done, and make a customer happy. Genia made my banking experience so pleasurable, that I almost didn't want to leave. Well it would have been that way if Genia actually existed.  Genia didn't exist, no but Annmaree* did and I was stuck with her, for the next three eternities of my banking*** experience (more like half an hour - but it felt like an eternity). I won't bother describing Annmaree as it would be like describing a small patch of plain wall, or perhaps a small uninteresting four equal sided rectangleish type shape. However I will mention the efficiancy to which she attached herself to her job, and to what must be noted; (I perceived) must also be the same rigor that she attached to the everyday running of her life too. Which was not much at all. Annmaree successful guessed incorrectly that Rachelle and I were partners (we good friends and both quite happy with this). And and just one of the interesting and totally useless things that came from her mouth; was quite amusing to both Rachelle and I, and it went a little something like this.  Chell: Where's Aaron gone. AnnM: Oh that guy you cam e in with? He's out the back still doing his banking. You should Dump him.  ???  So anyway. After this little experience, I found out latter. About Ten days latter that Annmaree had got my transaction totally wrong and sent the wrong amount of money to the wrong account. I was not a little stressed when I saw that a rather large and most heartbreaking amount of money had left my bank account for no apparent reason or upon any of my authorization, and was on the phone quick smart to the banking hotline to sort out asap what exactly had gone wrong.   Anyway, the best part of this little narrative, is that I actually got to speak to someone on the phone who had a clue, and told me everything that had happened and promptly returned all the money to the right place. I am happy once more! Unfortunately I have to go back to the same bank and order another transfer, this time I will ask not to speak to Annmaree.     *Most names made up** to protect the identity of the people in the story or because I can't remember their real names.   **And some of the Characters too ;-)   ***here's something fun for you to try, first close both your hands in to a fist. Now stick out your pointing fingers on both hands (the ones you use to point at things with**** and say oooooooh with awe, wonder or pity) if you have done this right you should be looking a little like Fonzie when he first sat in front of a computer screen. Now Bend your extended pointing fingers in to hook shapes and insert one finger in to each corner/side of your mouth. The effect will be like that of an unfortunate fish being caught by two brawny anglers with one hook in either cheek. Now Pull outwards a little so as to stretch your lips, you should be pulling hard enough so that it doesn't hurt but any further pulling may actually start to tingle a little. And lastly Say the following line out loud:  "I'm a fantastic Banker!"  Shout it out loud if you want, but make sure that your fingers are still pulling at either side of your mouth, otherwise the general effect will be lost, and people around you will not realize how passionate about it you are about it.  Feel Better? You can remove your fingers now.    ****Like three legged birds and United states presidents

      Well Contrary to my beliefs it is actually extremely easy to get a job over here in London. The first Job I have already mentioned to some of you, I was in Reading (pronounced redding) with Rachelle we were just cruising around doing banking and window shopping things etc. At the end of the day we both decided to go and have a well earned beer. Lydia our first contact and fantastic host in London had mentioned to Rachelle the location of a certain Walkabout* pub in Reading to which we casually made a way towards. After the first Guinness I decided I like the layout and feel of the local and approached the friendly bar attended with the question in mind "do you need staff"; "Yeah probably" was the reply. I was asked to write down my details on a piece of paper and that the boss would get to back to me on this one, I feared the worst (the ole don’t call us, we’ll call you scenario). But as I was half way through getting my details down on paper, I nice Australian popped up in front of me and said "so you looking for work then eh" the conversation is condensed in to the following:  Yep Can you cook? Yep Really? Really good How much bar experience do you have? Twoish years Can you start on Monday?  So Now I have a Job working in an awesome Pub famed for having 3 month long waiting lists for staff wanting to work in one of the most casually prestigious watering holes in London area. Today I have my trial night, I have absolutely no reservations about not getting the job, I love the social atmosphere of bars, and I think I am a fairly efficient, happy, intelligent worker.  This morning I got a call from a company asking me if I would set up a Linux server for them. One day worth of work for no less than £24.00 per hour. Yet another job that I am totally stoked to be doing.   Iife is good!  *Famed throughout the world as one of the likely watering holes for Aus/NZealanders to meet up, hook up or generally just have a good time.

      Over the period of this trip I have gotten to know many people very well. Two people I have had the privilege of having deep friendships with, and of those two one has enlightened me through no conscious effort of her own will. Just her being has given me so much more in life, we have established some sort of heartfelt communication between us.   And now she is leaving England, perhaps forever.  Even though I know; I will see her again: a statement of absolute truth, I can not find the words to put to my melancholic feeling of loss. It is not loss that she is gone because our paths will cross again. It is not because I am not whole, because I am. But perhaps it is because I have had a mere glimpse of something great, and yet it is gone before I could acknowledge it fully.  Sometimes sorrow is exquisite, and goodbye seems like forever.

      Travelling around Europe you tend to notice things that are similar as well as those which are different. In Barcelona I noticed that it rained, quite a bit actually. In Paris, I noticed that there too, it also rained. I could say the same for Rome, pizza and well the list goes on but I think that you get the general idea. Not exactly a ground shattering discovery as it rained in a lot of places that we went to, which was quite a fantastic thing; as I really got to appreciate the times when it didn't rain, at those times when the sun was smiling down upon the earth, one could be truly thank-full that one has dry feet.   So at this point I would like to make a suggestion to travellers going abroad to European countries during springtime; take some hard wearing waterproof shoes, and many pairs of socks.   Last night I stayed at a friends place in Fulham Broadway, which is quite weird as I was just there the night before visiting some friends from the Contiki tour, even weirder was that I stayed fairly close to the pub where I dined* the night before. Actually my trip here as just been one long series of coincidences (see yesterday) I really don't know why, but it has been very enjoyable.   *dined is a subjective word in this case. It is correct in the sense that I had quite a superb Guinness served extra cold, and that although Guinness is served in a drinking vessel, one tends to find that our beautiful thick black beverage is more a meal** than a refreshment. I wish as much could be said about the actual food.   ** An outdoorsy type person (perhaps a farmer) once told me their thoughts on Guinness, I think it went along the lines of: "Too thick to drink, too thin to plow".

      I was playing the TUCS game (see previous post) today and an interesting coincidence occurred. I was bored and being one in the possession of a whole lot of free time, I invented a new game (Don't get your hopes up its not that great), The details are explained in the last post, so if you haven't read them yet please do so as you may find enlightenment, the answer/question to the meaning of life, inner peace or perhaps just understand what I am dibbling on about in this post. So anyway here I am playing this brand new soon-to-be-the-next-biggest-fad-since-the-big-bang-game when I decided it was time to visit my old friend from New Zealand; Michael C. (or Chaps as everyone else calls him). So I sent him a txt message via the marvels of cell phone technology saying that I was keen to come visiting and what was he up to. At that point the rules of the TUCS game took me underground to the tubes yet again and I would not receive Chaps's reply txt message for some time latter when I finally re-emerged at my next destination.  So here I am sitting on the tube cruising down the Jubilee line when I noticed that I was heading in the direction of London bridge, at that point I decided to give up on my target and the just recently created TUCS game and travel to London bridge to basically check it out and see what all the fuss is about anyway. But again at that point something intervened and it may have been the random nature of my overused under abused mind or it might have been that the walls in the current tube terminal looked interesting, or it could have even been because I saw a pretty girl out side, I'm not sure but whatever the reason, I decided right then and there not to go to London bridge at all, but instead to get off at this particular station instead. Upon emerging from the station and coming back up in to the fresh vitalizing air of London I then received the txt reply from Chaps, on my cellular phone. After reading the message and glancing at the station name where I had just come from, I realized one of two very important things; 1) I had to take my glasses off because they had fogged up from the change from warm cosy air inside the station to cold frigid air outside and 2) once I had done this, I also realised that I was in the exact same location as Chaps - Westminster.   How weird. There is more to this coincidence too, as Chaps eventually offered me a place to stay for the night thanks to his temporary sub letting kiwi flatmate Nadia. And out of the thousand or so destinations by tube and overland train that Nadia could have lived in, it was in the exact same place where I had been one night earlier.

      I found an interesting new pastime that costs about £4.70 and is harmonious with owning a London underground tube "travel card". I shouldn't say I found it as I really just made it up due to boredom and an being the proud owner of a slight used but still-in-good-cond, overactive imagination. The pastime or game - if you will; is basically a good way to increase your local knowledge of tubes and streets and general London area knowledge. It also will give you a good sense of direction once you have done it enough times.   Here's how it works:  Rules  1) You should have in your possession a Travel card that does at least Zones 1,2,3 & 4 this usually costs (as mentioned above) around£4-5.  2) You shouldn't in any hurry to be anywhere.  3) You should be in possession of a relatively open mind.  4) You should probably give yourself around 4 hours to complete this pastime.  5) You should also be prepared to feel a little like a stalker.   Method  1) Locate the nearest tube entrance. Enter tube and locate a suitable target commuter that is not you*.  2) Choose one aspect of target that will be to some degree easily found on more than just this target commuter. E.g. slight limp, brown hair, round spectacles or gold cuff links etc etc. in my case white shoes with black stripes was a good initial starting attribute, choosing someone that has a facial scar in the shape of Jimmy Hendricks is probably not a good first choice as you will soon see why in the next step.  3) Follow Chosen target on to tube and ride the tube with them until they get off.  4) Follow target to next tube ride and repeat step 3 - 4 or  5) If target moves to exit. Follow target out through exit.  If your target eventually goes out an exit way -give yourself one point. Remember what the attribute was for latter on but for now:  Take a look around enjoy the sights, though try not to wonder too far from the tube or get lost, you lose 1 point for this. Familiarise yourself with your surroundings, take note of any landmarks and memorise** the name of your current station.  6) Once you have had enough go back to the station entrance and wait inside the gates until a new target commuter walks in with the same or very similar attributes as the last target. And move on to step 3 and repeat process again.   The game or pastime was just recently invented there will probably be flaws in the rules or the method. And there are a few warnings associate with playing this game.   You can find yourself in the middle of nowhere sometimes, so make sure you play this game during mid dayish, as you may find that you have caught the last train to the end of line station, and in this case you are fairly screwed.  People don't like being followed and usually get a little suspicious if you get close enough to count the pimples on their neck, so make sure you are discreet -target commuters are only used for randomness, the goal is not to scare the bejesus out of anyone; especially yourself.  Like with all things in life, you should use common sense at all times; if your target commuter is bigger and hairier than a gorilla and looks like the kind of person to whom the word friend is a one starting with the letter d then this is probably not a very good target commuter to follow as he probably isn't going to grandmas for tea and cookies.  Take good walking shoes -preferably water proof ones.  If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, smile at someone with a kind of lopsided grin and stare fixedly at their left ear; this usually works quite well and people tend to get a little nervous and walk away.     *You can choose yourself if you like, but this is a bit pointless as you may find yourself walking in tight concentric circles all day.   **Memory is a funny thing, but I find that if you associate the name of the station with something tangible, then it is usually easy to remember. E.g. yesterday I stopped off at a place called Swiss cottage, and immediately I thought of the Swiss and Cottage cheeses. So there you go I stopped off at a small round plastic tub filled with something smelly and curdled.

      Unbeknown to us Amsterdam was preparing one hell of a European send-off for our last day in Europe.  It was a magical day; I awoke in the blissful haze of a good nights sleep mixed in with the feeling of being mugged by several glasses of fine Dutch beer. The was a strange sense of anticipation in the air, a kind of reserved excitement it rolled through the corridors of the hostel where I was staying, you could hear it, as faint as a whisper on the wind. You looked into peoples eyes and could see it playing there around the laughter lined wrinkles. You knew it before it were even a spoken word. Queens’s day is here… It was like a million tonnes of anti-silence colliding with 5 hotdogs and a side show preacher, something that will never fit any description you ever give it. It was a festive holiday and an excuse to have as much fun as possible. Anyone and everyone spent the entire day sampling the delights of queen’s day, some of us ran half way across Amsterdam that day, and others walked no more than fifty meters. But everyone had a good time.  For those of you who don’t know about queen’s day, here is what google has to say about it.  Where would you find a Labrador begging for money while sitting patiently on the corner of a crowded street with a notice tied around his neck reading ‘nearly blind dog, please give'? Or multi-millionaire and former CEO of Europe's largest broadcasting production company squatting on an old rug selling discarded children's toys and general household bits and pieces for no more then a couple of guilders? Welcome to Koninginnedag (Queens Day) April 30th.   The formula for celebrating Queens day is unique to the Dutch. You rummage through your house gathering all the artifacts you want to get rid of, haul them into the city or local village, find a suitable place where you can display them to passersby, and sell it for as much or as little possible. But there is more to Queens day then selling your past, creativity can play an important roll in the pursuit of profit.     Queen's day was first celebrated on 30 April 51 years ago.  "Koninginnedag" exists in its present festive form only since 1980, when the current Queen, Beatrix, chose her mother's birthday as the day for her inauguration. She also declared that in future, 30 April would stay Koninginnedag, as a mark of honour to her mother. Beatrix herself was born on 31 January, when it is too cold for open-air festivities.      Mind Games  For instance, you could have your palm read or your fortune told for 5 guilders. Sounds simple, but modern deception can make it more fun. While your friend is in the tent getting his/her fortune told, you are being quizzed by an assistant about the others personal life – which is all fed into a hidden microphone! The person doing the fortune telling is listening to every word you're saying and relating that to the person sitting across from them. Astonishment, amazement and utter bewilderment can only ensue – and the laughter when the cat is out of the bag.   Another money spinner to be found during Queens Day is three or four oranges in a bucket of water. You place a coin on the orange, if it stays there for more then four seconds you get double the money back. Be warned, the orange rarely loses!    Music in the Air  More human talents can also be displayed, for instance in the couple of square miles covering the ‘Jordaan' in Amsterdam you can easily find as many as nine or ten bands playing to beer drinking crowds in the narrow streets, thereby slowing down your exploration of Queens Day considerably.   Adults do not only have the upper hand in entertainment on this day. The Vondel park, a large city park in the centre of Amsterdam is only open to children looking to make an extra guilder. The music teachers tyranny finally reaps its fruit when children finally get the chance to play to a public other than their family or friends. Violin's, Cello's and a large percentage of typical wooden flutes (blokfluit) drown out the usual sounds of  birds singing in the trees, or rather they have fled the sound of horsehair bows and catgut strings crying for mercy.    The Day After  The aftermath of Queens Day is one of disbelief and utter shock for tourists arriving in any of the major cities. Tons of rubbish such as cloths, clapped out hi-fi equipment, furniture, bottles, toys, beer cans, plastic cups litter the streets, all the streets. One would think a war had been fought. A battleground would look more organised, although the only wounded are those nursing a hangover, or disappointing takings from a hard days work.

      First up, I'm impressed with the size of Rachelle's last post, not only that but I quite enjoyed reading it! I'm now not surprised as to why I got a call in the middle of the day, by a panic stricken Rachelle saying "it won't go throught!!! it won't go throught!!!" meaning that the post mechanism of my blog wasn't working, and that Rachelle though she was going to lose all her work =)   I am still working at the Walkabout   searching for "the perfect job" is long and arduous, there is so much work out there to choose from. I have found one very likely job, that I like quite a lot - but the pay is crap and I'm having to negotiate that today.  Lastnight was a depressing one for England, For after the most epic game of football I have ever seen, England lost by the smalest of chances. And forever dashed their lonely hearts against the rocks of dispair, for they will never have the opportunity to win the Euro 2004 football.

      Hey ya everyone! First of all after re reading my first blog I have realised that I am travelling home on all three dates mentioned the 16 17 and the 18! I leave here at 4pm on the 16th and arrive in Auckland at 5:15am on the 18.  Shit what a long bloody flight. It is one thing I am not at all looking forward to.  THE GEORGE AND DRAGON Last Friday I headed down to Basingstoke which is not that far south of Reading, South West of London to visit two girls from the contiki, Jennifer and Sunny.  It was a great weekend and topped off by another ass whipper of a game by the one and only All Blacks!!  On arival at Basingstoke a guy called Richard picked me up, after about half an hour of, 'hmmmmm is that the guy?' .... 'hmmmmm is that the girl? we realised that I was who he was meant to pick up.  Richard drove a nice big Ford Discovery which was definately an improvement on all these bloody hatchbacks that they drive over here. And even though it was a Ford I will say it was quite nice.  Richard is one of the many 'Local's' that frequent the George and Dragon and it was awesome that he picked me up.  Even better than that was that he bought me a shit load of drinks! Just what I needed.  A group of us sat at the bar, while Sunny pored the drinks and Jen worked in the Kitchen, and got totally sloshed.  The stress of the city disappeared totally.  Not a late night but definately a good one.  Retired at about 1am back to Sunny and Jen's room for a hot chocolate and some Dark Chocolate Toblerone.  Yumm.(problem is I can't really remember what it tasted like.)   Slept with Sunny and surprisingly enough, after her sprawling effort on Contiki, she kept to her side and we all slept like logs.  Up at the bloody crack of dawn to watch the All Blacks play, which was great. Then it was time to get the bar and rooms cleaned ready for opening at 12. It is amazing how many locals can turn up for the short bracket from 12 to 3pm for lunch and a few pints.  Yum.  At 3 we headed back to the girls' room where we looked through a bunch of Contiki Photos! It was great to see most of them, unforfunately Sunny managed to get some terrible photos of me, pissed as.  I didn't realise I drunk that much on Contiki.  But I do not remember the photos being taken! Anyway the pub opened for dinner again at 7 and I was disshy for the night, which was good cause I felt like I was earning my keep.  Bed at 12 after one of the bussiest nights of the year.  Sunday Morning Jen and I went for a lovely walk around the countryside, even saw a deer cross our path as we wandered through a wheat field with Buddy the Golden Lab.  Jen also showed me in amongst all the huge manor houses that were randomly placed along our stroll a Cute little cottage with a thatched roof even.  Soo Cute.  When the bar opened again I met up with a few of the locals who had been in before, during my stay, and they unfortunately kept filling up my pint glass with halves for gods sake, how are you meant to keep track of how much you are drinking! By the time I got picked up to go home after a huge yummy lunch I was still pissed.  Another Local dropped me off at the station,  Andrew I think.  He drove a huge landrover, lovely. All the trimmings too. Had only done 5,000 miles. I can not believe that there is this much money in selling toilets, but then again, both my rides were from toilet sellers, so  there must be! Lovely of them both to put themselves out, otherwise I would still be walking!    On to a stuffy train I hopped and unfortunately just got more and more sickly feeling. Yuck, had to go to the guard's quarters to stick my head out the window to get some fresh air.  This however is hard on the Tube but luckily, my smints and water, along with a better ventilated cabin helped settle my tummy and I didn't puke on the train.    Other than that, a bloody nice weekend. Absolutely wonderful to see the girls. Strange how they seem like family.  The 300 year old pub blew me away, along with the friendliness of the Locals.  Unusual, considering the rude, snobbish people at my school.   This weekend will hopefully be heading to the Natural History museum in London.  I hope to bury myself in it for a day!  Might even get to Wimbledon Thursday.    Hope you are all well.  Thats news till the 22 June.  :)  Rachelle

      I am the Human Cuckoo clock the time is now ... Because I was late twice last week, I am now the human cuckoo clock for the Walkabout Inn Reading, a decision made by the Manager(s) means that every hour on the hour during the times when I am working; I have to get the clock from downstairs in the kitchen off the wall and then stand on the ground floor bar and say "Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo, I am the human Cuckoo clock. The time is now   o'clock". Its an interesting disiplinary action which I don't have too many issues with - I find it quite enjoyable. But I do wonder about the validity of punishment by means of repeating the crime. I mean really, what I have to do is a bit of a time waister, think about it, it takes about a minute or two out of my regular work activities to get the clock and stand on the bar and say my lines. I also have to disrupt other peoples time by asking people in the kitchen to send the clock up in the food lift. Other bar staff also stop what they are dong and watch me do this thing, which is probably on average wasting about two minutes of work time every hour, probably for the next week. were to work  for 50 hours in a week, that 100 minutes where time is being wasted - almost two whole hours a week.  Oh well, cest la vie.  I'm going for an interview tomorrow for my new job too. Perfect timing!

      I'm in the library again, I noticed a girl walking down the street before, she was quite pretty. On her person was a shirt with the word "mature" blazoned accross her chest.   I thought about this I looked at her and decided that she was probably not, yes a steriotypical judgment of a un-likely steriotypical person. But it did get me thinking about how we (or perhaps only I) perceive people by what is written on thier chests sometimes. You can see a geek walking down the street with "1337" written on his chest, and if you are of the same peruasion, know exactly what it means, and that he probably isn't. Sometimes you can see someone else simply with the word "lost" and know that is most likely true. But in general I think that perhaps people wear such shirts becuse they want to describe perhaps something that they want to be, or be seen as. I know for a fact though that there is no person that can be summarised absolutely in little less than novel little own a word.  Another thing I have thought about is what I want on my shirt. I personally don't think that it is very ground breaking or exiting, or anything really, its just my own thoughts, and hey you've read this far so I can guarantee that you are going to read the next last 69 words of this post to hear what I have to say anyway. If not  urlLink tell me why?    I want a tee shirt that says, "yeah like hell a few words on a tee shirt will give you any indication of who I am". By the way, this statement and any other that may say the same thing or something to the same effect is now &copy; Copyright 2004 Aaron Chilcott.

      I experienced hooliganism for the first time lastnight, not a personal disposition but of a second hand nature. Being in one of the many pubs around reading where they show the footy on the big screen (specially ones like lastnights Poms Vs. Frogs match) you should expect to see a nominal amount of high strung emotional tension throughout any particular game that involves the country where you currently reside. For me and the other staff of the Walkabout Inn - last night was no exception.  You could not imagine how charged the atmosphere was - like Jew in the belly of a zeplin trying to decide weather or not to play with the book of matches in his/her pocket.  And when the French won in the final seconds of the game it was like the floodgates of hell were let loose! The Jew struck a match.  I heard rumors about some of the bars around town being totally trashed, ours was okay - as our manager is quite picky about who we let in and who stays outside. There was a small amount of violence directly after the final whistle but the only things broken were a few plastic pint glasses, and about 700 peoples worth of pride. The bar staff were told to stay behind the bar, and behind Big Dave (door security) who's massive bulk covered one of the only entrances to our nice safe cozy bar area.   After the match during the walk home, the trail of devastation was quite evident, cars were kicked punched or generally mangled in many different ways and rubbish bins that are literally cemented in to the ground had been pulled out and tossed around like children toys.   The Mob, when many minds become one and the only thought that can possibly traverse them is one of destruction and chaos.

      I was trying to think of a good description of the housing around the area in which I live, after reading  urlLink Rachelles first input ! I was struck dumb by the simplicity of the description that she gave. Sometimes I think too many steps ahead, and latteral thinking is not always linear. Thankyou Chelle!  I live on coronation street, well not literally but very close to the same look and feel of it, but the thing is you can be anywhere in London - perhaps Enlgand and still see the same style of housing: Cramped, dirty and sometimes derilect at some points. But as I said before the area that I am staying in is not so bad. and the street is a lot wider (five lanes) and there are only houses on one side, however you will find that the houses are still quite cramped together in that notoriously english way.

      Would you believe it Aaron! I finally made it on to this site.  So here goes... what have I been up to?  I am living in East London, Seven Kings, Essex and I am teaching at a school in Emerson Park which is further out of London.  Well most of you probably know that anyway.  The house I am living in is a Typical 4 bedroom house which is joined to another house on both sides.  The street looks kind of similar to the Street on the closing of Coronation Street.  From here it is pretty easy to get anywhere as less than two minutes walk away is the Seven Kings train station.  From there it takes half an hour to get into central London through either  the Liverpool Street or Stratford stations.  To get to work I catch a train to Romford and change to another that heads to Upminster via Emerson Park, I then have to walk 20mins before I arrive at school, good for my fitness, but I miss my car! One hour to get to a place that would take about twenty minutes to drive is ridiculous! Anyway, school is getting better, slowly, as I train the students to the behaviour that I expect in my classroom.  It is taking extra long as most of the other teachers do not expect anywhere near the same behaviour as I do!  I have heard some awful teaching, I heard one teacher telling his class to SHUT UP over and over again, and this teacher has been there all year! Surprisingly enough the  Last Friday we had the Annual Athletics day that I looked forward to all week only to be left supervising a couple of hundred bored students on the outside of the running track where they could see nothing and they were not allowed to move!  No house colours or spirit anywhere to be seen.  It was also bloody cold and windy which did not help at all, definately the most bored I have been for a long long time.  Oh well, at least I will get paid for it.    At present I am planning a trip to Italy to meet up with my Aunt, Uncle and my cuzzies at the end of July.  I will leave here on the 25 and return on the 30.  Will be nice to get back to Italy, and since my cousin is right into all the history it should be very informative also.  This means that I do have to work for the last week of this term that I really wanted to avoid.  But shit happens.  400 is a fair bit to brush off.  Then I will be moving out of my flat :( and moving back to Lydia's before we head off to Ireland and then on to Scotland!  We are going to do a road trip which should be a heap of fun and hopefully a little cheaper than a tour.  It will be nice chosing what we do and when.  I am not sure at the moment how long this trip will be for but I spose it doesn't really matter.  While in Scotland I hope to catch up with Cara(a Kiwi girl I met on Contiki) and I might even be lucky enough to stay with her for a while.  Then back to Lydia's in Reading and then I would like to cruise down to Cornwall for a week and catch up with a girl from there I met in NZ.  And IF I haven't seen enough already I want to go see a few castles, which is the only thing I haven't seen yet!!  Then.....yeah I know another then but then I will be heading home on the 16 or 17 or 18 of september.  I cant really remember when.  Really looking forward to getting back although I know not much would have changed except I would have missed out on Winter.  I have been siting outside today in my bikini sunbathing and reading!  It was lovely!  Well hope that was OK I know it doesn't measure up to Aaron's standard but it will do!  Cheers Everyone

      I am staying in a newly decorated, slightly refurbished, five bedroom house with about 8 other people, I have my own room because I'm special and have a penis unlike all the other flatmates - who don't, though some of them should. The house is located in a posh part of town, it - like most of the other houses in England is quite thin and long (get your mind out of the gutter) and has room for one rooms width and a hallway and that's it. But it does stretch all the way back close to the end of the section, which is not grass like the last house I was staying in but is actually made up of paved square concrete stones that I think are older than the Queen E (number 1). Like I was saying before, I have my own room which is swell but I only have a single bed and I like to stretch out when I sleep.  I like the people I stay with, and it is a good thing that we all do random hours at the same pub, as we get the feeling of family and closeness but without the problems that you face when you pack seven girls and one guy in a small space then add P.M.T. So once again I find myself quite happy with my living arrangements i.e. Power, Water, Gas and a few other things including a bed and a roof over my head (with washing powder and a machine to use it in) all for the low low price of two tenners a week. Yes that's right dear readers, only Â£20 a week and all I have to do is work my ass off!  Well according to some of the other employees, the arse part is optional. Not that I know this through conversation, as actions speak louder than words. But I prefer a good bit of ass than not and working my own off is a bit like masturbation - that is, it seems a bit silly and pointless when you're engaging in the act - and if you actually imagine what you look like doing it, rather humorous too. But Just like masturbation, it the feeling at the end that counts, and I always get the sense of a job well done, and often have people thanking me for my effort!  Anyway, The area we live in is only a nice ten minute walk from work, and you get to pass some of the local landmarks, like Harry the flute playing bum and his two friendly dogs that do more than Harry does, mainly lying around all day and taking in the lovely English weather. But the Bum area is all over reading central, and not on the nice side of the tracks where we live, so we are quite lucky to be living in (and I really mean this) a slightly upmarket area of town.  The pub that I work in, Namely the "Walkabout Inn" is of good nature, and has a excellent social status in the student and older crowd markets in town, the students come for the cheap liquor, and the older people come for students, who usually come for the older crowd along with the other students (but perhaps a little latter on). So I work in a fairly typical pub but one with a wicked atmosphere and great group of employees, who most of the time mesh quite well, and all carry the load. The actually pub itself is quite old, and is probably one of the oldest Walkabout Inns in England, the building and the pub would be described as sporty type bar with older style "Australian Outback" and Australian "aboriginal" design and decoration. Complete with corrugated iron shanty roofs over the main bar area - to old windmill pumps and ye olde worldy decorations from times in Australia's history where most people were just leftovers from an intolerant English society, and Ned Kelly was a household name... mate.  The only thing that doesn't really fit with the theme is the plasma TV systems that jut out of the wall above the bar and show the latest crazy shots available for purchase, along with latest promos and other interesting activities relating the walkabout brand. Along with the fifteen or so odd TVs that surround the bar area displaying the latest on all the sky sports channels for the customers entertainment should they get sick of looking at the slap.... er students.  Okay, so I have made an effort, and will write more detailed information about other areas in my life latter on. For now, enjoy and I hope to hear from you soon!

      One Week to go!! &nbsp; I am soo stoaked.&nbsp; I am at school at the moment and I am lucky enough to have this last period free and I can't be bothered doing anything! I just walked up to my classroom and found another class using it, which is fine, but all my gear was left out and now they are using this for their lesson.&nbsp; Not that I mind, but it would be nice to be asked.&nbsp; I have remembered a couple of my end of year activities which involve a lot of&nbsp;coloured pencils and paper.&nbsp; Couldn't believe it last week when I woke up to the huge revelation of memories of folding paper!&nbsp; Strange....&nbsp; I am sad.&nbsp; Anyway after a week of trudging around the school trying to find some coloured paper, I now have enough to do the first lesson of two for next week! Yippee.&nbsp; The kids are keen too which is a bonus, both my year 10's REALLY want to have a go at it which is cool.&nbsp; Speaking of year 10's.&nbsp; One of the classes I only see in one out of our two week timetable so I do not know them very well.&nbsp; They are a low set and do not usually work,&nbsp; I won though!!!! Today  everybody  did  everything  I asked of them, and I didn't even have to raise my voice.&nbsp; Shame that it was their last lesson with me...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;(&nbsp; not really, I won't miss them, there are other classes though that I will miss.&nbsp; Some of the kids have&nbsp;come a long way in our short time together and I can be proud of what I have done.&nbsp; Even though it did not seem like this most of the time.... I have been a grumpy teacher.&nbsp; Had to laugh yesterday though when a boy admitted videoing me teaching using his phone, I looked so bloody serious.&nbsp; It is quite strange seeing what you look like, when you didn't know you were being taped.  &nbsp; The kids had a teacher called Mr Knight at the start of their school year last September, and unfortunately for him he had a lazy eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the kids came up with quite a funny joke here it is........... &nbsp; You know how Mr Knight had a lazy eye?..... &nbsp; &nbsp;  He couldn't control his pupils.  Ha ha.  &nbsp;  Anyways, was hoping to go on a round London bus tour with Aaron this weekend(or last) but he is unable to make it.&nbsp; Ah well, will see what the weather is like then decide whether I will go it alone.&nbsp;   Next Sunday (25 - 30 July) I am off to Italy to meet up with my Aunt, Uncle, and Cousins, we are staying in Perugia, and I have heard that is very nice.&nbsp; Hopefully during my stay I will get down to Pompei.&nbsp; Then on the 2 Lydia, another friend, and I are off to Ireland for Two weeks on a road trip.&nbsp; Can't wait. We should be getting back on the 19 of August.&nbsp; After that I want to visit Cornwall and Gloucester before I head up to Scotland, hopefully with my flatmates.&nbsp; Pretty busy time.&nbsp; Hope I have enough money to get me all these places.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Cheers everyone!

      Ok So Finaly I have found a real job, and in London too. Someone has been hounding me to update my blog because everyone has been wanting to know what I am doing right now. I have very little time at the moment, because I have dropped in the deep end and have to get more work done than I have hours. Obviously updating my blog is not one of the most pressing engagments I can think of right now - this is going to be a quicky and dirty post... So here goes:  I am working for a young company called Utopia, they have several business objectives: "Make money", "show people a good time" and "combat the forces of evil around the world by helping the general public become more aware of the inequities and tyrany of global corporations such as large oil companies, huge ever expanding fastfood chains (who harness the power of billions of McChildren; to do thier dirty work for them) and crooked governments"  I am the knight in shining armour for this companies money making vehical, I am the mechanic that will finish off a three year Behemoth of a project that has been dragging along in a perpetual state of unfinishedness for quite some time. They need expertese in quite a few different areas of IT and I am able to provide most of it. I am their swiss army geek.  So what do I get for all of this? lets see what's behind door number three!  For four days work I get the following: 250.00p/wk in my rocket (tax free), free accomodation all expenses paid, no bills, nice comfy double bed and fully furnished/decorated room in a upmarket apartment on old street (know for its exceptionally good knightlife =)), sky tv, a computer in my room that I can work on, broadband internet, the list goes on...  At the moment the project is so intense that I am actually working way more hours than I am supposed to but we have a agreement that I will get paid for as many extra hours that I do. Suits me.  So I hope this is enough to whet your apetite.  Take care, I will write soon about the area I live in.
