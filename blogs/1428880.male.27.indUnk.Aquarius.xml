       A Downey Deal   Part of the fun of having digital cable is watching local advertising from affiliates across the country, in different time zones.  Last night I saw an ad for " urlLink Downey Ford in St. John, NB ", which asked viewers "Why did you buy your car at Downey Ford"?  Was it because of the attractive sales staff?  (Pan across a series of small town faces.  Many with mullet and moustache combinations.) Was it because of the fast paced sales pitch?  (Clip of a hilariously sped-up version of a salesman showing a car to two people) Or...was it because you got a " DOWNEY DEAL !!"?  I laughed and laughed and laughed.  Partially at the Sony Handi-cam quality of the commerical.  But mainly at "The Downey Deal".

       Time to shift the War   So...in the last 20 or so years we've endured the Cold War, the War on Drugs, the First Gulf War, the War on Terror, the Second Gulf War, and now....The War on Potholes.  You may remember that Edison, NJ is the  urlLink birthplace of recorded sound , but what you may not know, is that it is also ground zero for the  urlLink War on Potholes .  I challenge any pothole to test the resolve of Edison Mayor George A. Spadoro and the people of Edison, New Jersey on this issue.    Potholes can be eliminated, from Edison in our lifetime.    I would further propose that after filling each pothole, the works crew recite the  urlLink Pledge of Allegiance  and insert a small flag into the soft, warm  urlLink asphalt .  This will send a message to our enemys that even on the homefront, we are prepared to go the full distance, and make the ultimate sacrifice to protect the integrity of our suspensions, and our senior citizen's ankles.  Goodnight, and may God continue to bless America.

       Chretien's Father    urlLink Chretien agrees that posession of pot shouldn't give someone a criminal record  which is, a step in the right direction.  It would be a leap in the right direction for people serving 10 year prison sentances in the States for posession of pot; but they're not the ones living in Canada.  Pity.  Here's the most intriguing statement from Chretien's address at a Liberal fundraiser last night:  Chretien said that, in his youth, marijuana wasn't known. "I never tasted it." But he smoked cigarettes, when his father told him not to. "When he gave me permission at 16, I stopped." Who's father "gives them permission" to start smoking cigarettes?

       The Gaberdeen Army   I took a different path to work today.  For those who don't ride the streetcar in the east end, I'll let you know that the 504 now takes Broadview to King, then King to Church.  It's at this point that the streetcar embarks on a magical mystery tour of the downtown core, making lefts and rights on Richmond, Victoria, and Queen.  That little "jog" takes about 10 minutes, and as I found out this morning, it takes exactly the same amount of time to walk from King and Church, get a coffee and a muffin, and arrive at work, as it does to keep my fat ass in the seat and ride it out.  Walking up Bay, with the flood of passengers from Union Station, was a new experience.  I suppose I had done it before, but I don't think I was ever "on my way to work" with the rest of them.    There's a certain militaristic feel to the march of the upper middle class.  I thought "If Canada was ever at war, and the Lawyers, Bankers and high level Sales Associates of the world were called into service, this is how they'd march".  Cell phones in hand, the soothing swish of gaberdeen pant leg on gaberdeen pant leg.  With designer shoulder bags containing freshly laundered workout clothes, and hands filled with coffee purchased from suburban Tim Horton's on the way to the GO Station.  No guns of course, just a frightening litigous stare.  And running shoes over socks and pantyhose.  And for the record, here are the phrases I typed into Google this morning alone:    "gaberdeen wool" "litigous" "running shoes over socks and pantyhose"

       A thought   When was the last time you pressed the button on the bottom of your stapler, and unfolded it?  I'm trying to remember when I did it last, and I think it might have been in grade 5 when I had to put the Thanksgiving decorations up on the big cork board.  I don't really have much use for a stapler that unfolds these days.  Partially because I don't have a big cork board, but mainly because I don't have cardboard cutouts of Turkeys and leaves and pie.    I think I'd like more cardboard cutouts of pie.

       Yet another reason to live in Canada   This City heald it's annual "Community Clean-Up Day" this past Sunday.  Community groups met in parks and public spaces to help clean up the litter and trash that had accumulated through carelessness, or wanton disregard.  Bags of collected garbage were set out at pre-approved points, and City trucks were routed to collect all of the bags at the end of the day.  Simple, wholesome, and somewhat universal.  As Sunday was "the end" of earth week, communities all over the world participated in similar events.  Some with  urlLink deadly results .  Does anyone remember what childhood was supposed to be like?

       Oil and Chemicals   If you were looking for the rest of the story from this morning's  urlLink This Modern World , it can be found here, in a report from the Institute for Policy Studies, called  urlLink "Crude Vision: How Oil Interests Obscured US Government Focus On Chemical Weapons Use by Saddam Hussein" .  Look for the pdf link on the page.  The report is only 18 pages long, and worth the read.  The  urlLink Institute for Policy Studies  is a progrssive think tank that attempts to advise US government of their research.  It has, among others,  urlLink Harry Belafonte  on it's  urlLink board of directors.

       The sign lied to us   What better way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon then in a movie theatre watching political documentaries.  This weekend we watched "The Trials of Henry Kissinger" based on the  urlLink book by Christopher Hitchens.   And "The Power and the Terror" based on  urlLink transcripts from Noam Chomsky lectures, and Q and A sessions .  Both were very good.  For those who have seen or read the former, here is the essay mentioned entitled  urlLink "The Pitfalls of Universal Jurisdiction"  by Kissinger, and a  urlLink critical response by John M. Forbes.   Both are fun reads for the streetcar ride in.  On our way out of "The Trials of Henry Kissinger" we walked past two old women who were asking for directions at the ticket booth.  They had tried to go down a hall to an exit door, that was locked.  Said one woman to the other "That sign lied to us.  Just like Henry Kissinger".

       Equal time for the Crazy Guy   I have realised that I am one of the privileged many who has a voice louder then my own.  I can phone, I can email, I can post.  The crazy guy outside, only has a voice as loud as his own to broadcast his message to the world.  Or the other corner of the street.  So...I have decided to include his repetitive rant here, this morning.  Imagine a man, dressed in a filthy bedsheet, with a dishtowel wrapped around his head.  He's holding a stack of 6 - 8 loaves of pita bread.  He rips chunk after chuck of of the bread and roughly tosses it in the air behind him.  Naturally a Hitchcockian flock of pidgeons riot on the ground behind him.  This is what he shouts, over and over:    SARS!!  SARS!!  Enjoy it!!  You've worked hard for it!!"   I think that gives us all, something to think about.

       Further Discussion   Dr. Basrur  urlLink released a video clip  to the media reminding the world that Toronto remains a safe and healthy travel destination.  The  urlLink newsrelease  includes this note to Television and Photo Editors:  The wearing of masks outside of hospital settings is virtually non- existent in Toronto and medically unnecessary. Editors should note that images they use of individuals wearing masks in Toronto should be accompanied by the appropriate context: these are hospital settings, not public spaces.

       Finally   The  urlLink CNN Transcript of the the April 24th Edition of Newsnight  with Aaron Brown.  Here's the full transcript of the Brown/Lastman interview:   BROWN: Mayor, you're obviously disappointed in the WHO advisory. On the facts, though, where is the WHO mistaken?  MEL LASTMAN, MAYOR, TORONTO: They don't know what they're talking about. I don't know who this group is. I've never heard of them before. I had never seen them before. Who did they talk to? They haven't even been to Toronto. They're located somewhere in Geneva. And they haven't talked to us all. They read the papers and sometimes the papers exaggerate. And that's what's happened right here. And I want -- I invite them. I want them to come to Toronto this weekend. I want them to see what we've been doing, like the CDC were here.  That's the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. The United States are our direct neighbors. And the CDC said Toronto is doing -- you're a model for the world in what you're doing.  Look, we have 1500 people in quarantine at one time. We're down to 180. We haven't had one people -- one person get SARS in the last seven days. And if we go 20 days, we've beaten it.  BROWN: Well, and that -- isn't that exactly what the WHO is saying, is that they need to see three weeks of no new illness before they will reevaluate the advisory?  LASTMAN: They want to wait three weeks. In the meantime, they're hurting Toronto badly. We depend greatly on tourism. We get 22 million tourists a year. And it's hurting. Yes, our city is continuing. They're moving the way they always do. They're working. The malls are jammed. But the hotels aren't doing much business. And the restaurants aren't.  We need the tourists. And they're hurting us. And to wait three weeks is ridiculous, when they haven't even been here in the first place.  BROWN: How many SARS cases do you know of in the Toronto area right now?  LASTMAN: Well, you see what we do is, we don't take any chances. We play it safe. Like 500 people went to the Philippines, Manila, Hong Kong, and back to Toronto. We -- and one or two of them had it. We took all 500 and we quarantined all 500.  There have been in total about 8500 people who have been quarantined, but not all 8500 had SARS.  BROWN: Do you know how many...  LASTMAN: Only a fraction of them had it -- SARS.  BROWN: Do you know how many?  LASTMAN: I'm not sure the exact amount, but it's a fraction of that.  BROWN: Do you have any feel yet for how much this has cost the city government or the provincial government?  LASTMAN: Well, I know at the end of the 20 days, we will be coming out with a $25 million advertising campaign to let the world know, and that's only phase 1, to let the world know that Toronto is safe. You know, if it's safe enough to live here, it's safe enough to visit here. And let me tell you, it is safe. And people are not -- there's not that many people walking around wearing masks, surgical masks.  BROWN: Would you say that the people -- that the residents of Toronto are too nervous about SARS right now, that they are too afraid?  LASTMAN: Some people are, yes. But most people aren't. You got to the malls, the malls are jammed. You use our city transit system, there's a  million people a year using the transit system . We're -- people are still working, and they're still doing everything that they always do.  BROWN: Just two other things on that. Major League Baseball said yesterday that they recommend their players not use the public transportation system. I gather you're not very happy about that either?  LASTMAN: No, that's ridiculous. I use it. And I'm going to be using it. And I'm going to be staying at a hotel in Toronto with my wife. And I am going to be going to -- I got to restaurants in Toronto. And I'll be going to more restaurants. I'll be doing a lot of this all next week.  BROWN: And just -- are you at all concerned,  you must be somewhat concerned, that you might lose the All-Star game this summer ?  LASTMAN:  Yes, I am .  BROWN: Yes.  LASTMAN: Toronto is a sports city. And in the past, we've won quite a few championships. And I want to keep winning more. And I want this All-Star game. And we are going -- we are beating this. You know, it's almost gone. We've turned the corner. Our medical officer of health today made a statement, we've turned the corner and all we have to do is go two more weeks and we're all set.  BROWN: Well, that seems to be what the WHO is saying, whether they've been there or not. This is a most difficult time for your city. We appreciate some of your time to talk with us about it tonight. Thank you, mayor.  LASTMAN: Aaron, I thank you.   BROWN: Thank you, sir.   For the record, and for what it's worth....  1.  urlLink The TTC claimed  about 415.5 million passenger trips last year.  Is that "a million people" using the transit system?  Toronto alone has a population of 2.5 million.  Does this mean that only 40% of Toronto's population uses the TTC?  I don't mean to nitpick, but my point is that the knee-jerk overuse of superlatives is better left in a 4th grade show and tell session.  Mayor Lastman is a big boy, and he's the spokesman, to the world, for a big city.  We've all apreciated his passion for the issues of the day, but please...  Down one notch, that's all Im asking.  2.  This year's  urlLink MLB All-Star game will be held in Chicago, not Toronto as Mr. Brown and Mr. Lastman both claim .  I just walked past Yonge and Dundas Square.   urlLink Kyle Rae  was giving an interveiw with CNN in front of the Eaton's Centre.  Let's hope he can wipe some of this Lastman egg off our collective faces.

       Not the CNN transcript that I promised, but it will fill the void   Remember that Simpsons' parody on 'personal interest stories'?  It was "Kent's People" and the subject matter "tuggs at the heartstrings and fogs the mind..."  Here's exactly what they were parodying.  From a  urlLink report on CNN yesterday :    VICKY DUNCAN, WRTV CORRESPONDENT: This Muncie Burger King's been here 35 years.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tom Ray's here.  DUNCAN: It's safe to say this is Tom Ray's favorite lunch spot.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's done been about the most consistent customer you can imagine.  DUNCAN: Consistent is an understatement. Mr. Ray doesn't have to even order.  TOM RAY, BURGER KING CUSTOMER: Oh, no, I never order.  DUNCAN: Because everyone knows he always gets the same thing.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cheeseburger, ketchup and mustard, apple pie, a handful of French fries and a coffee.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We just like to get it ready for him by the time he gets in here so he can go ahead and go set down.  RAY: That's service. Why would I want to go other places?  DUNCAN: And he hasn't. Mr. Ray's had lunch here Monday through Friday for the last 27 years.  RAY: But I figure it must be something close to 7,000 identical meals. There are a lot of people in this world who like variety. And I'm not one of them.  DUNCAN: Mr. Ray's routine is about to change. No more burgers or fries will be served here after Friday. The restaurant is closing.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It has been a very good restaurant.  DUNCAN: But the owners say it's time for change.  RAY: Unfortunately, about the only thing in this world that's for sure is change.  DUNCAN: And change is what Mr. Ray will do. Come lunch time on Monday.  RAY: A different way of life. But, I'll survive.  DUNCAN: In Muncie, Indiana, Vicky Duncan for CNN.   (cue "Turn Turn Turn".....'This is Kent Brockman......Reporting")  It will be "A different way of life.  But I'll survive"....without a BURGER KING!  The really sad part, is that as stupid as this story was....it still doesn't beat Lastman anouncing that he had never heard of the World Health Organziation, on CNN.

       Mayor Mel   This is completely incomprehensable.  I cannot understand how this City could allow that man to speak for us to the world.  My mind was blown twice last night.  First, as I watched the Daily Show, and John Stewart ended the half hour with Lastman as "Your Moment of Zen".  And then again when I heard Aaron Brown's CNN interview with Lastman.  This high quality brand of ignorance made it into a number of different national papers as well.  This quote, from the  urlLink Ottawa Sun , kind of sums up Mr. Lastman's preperation for the interview:   "I don't know who this group is; I've never heard of them before, I've never seen them before, they've never talked to us," Mr. Lastman said. The Mayor indicated he had learned a little about the WHO in the day following his Wednesday news conference that denounced the organization's travel warning, saying it is "located somewhere in Geneva."   I'll post the full CNN transcript if I can ever find it.

       10 Telltale Signs Your Wife or Girlfriend is a Secret Lap Dancer!   Here,  urlLink from experts , are 10 signs that your lady is a closet lap dancer:   1.   VAMPISH WALK. A once-awkward, wholesome, girl-next-door type who now swivels her hips in an exaggerated manner -- and has no trouble strutting about in six-inch heels -- fits the profile of a stripper.   2.   COARSE LANGUAGE. If your lady starts cussing like a sailor, it's a good bet she picked up the bad habit from her low-class "colleagues" backstage.   3.   FAVORS SEXY UNDERWEAR. A gal who used to complain about how "uncomfortable" she felt in thongs and suddenly has an undies drawer chock full of them may now be used to wearing a G-string hours at a time.   4.   SLUTTY BODY LANGUAGE. When your mate has to pick up something from the ground, does she kneel like a lady -- or bend over, flaunting her wares?   5.   SUDDENLY HAS MONEY FOR "LITTLE EXTRAS." She starts showing up with fancy earrings, designer shoes and other items you didn't pay for.   6.   OVERLY FLIRTATIOUS WITH YOUR PALS. You may spot her perched on a buddy's lap at a cocktail party, making small talk. This could be a position she's grown very comfortable with.   7.   ALWAYS HAS PLENTY OF DOLLAR BILLS ON HAND. Or when she gets change back at the supermarket, she may reflexively tuck it in the band of her underwear.   8.   DANCES DIRTY. A gal who wiggles around in the laps of strange men for cash is likely to fall into raunchy, groin-to-butt moves on the dance floor.   9.   WON'T TELL YOU WHERE SHE WORKS. Says she has a "great new part-time job working as a cocktail waitress," but won't tell you where she works.   10. ODDLY IMMODEST. In the past, she never even undressed in front of the dog, but now she waltzes by the window nude without a second thought.  I'll be honest.  My favorite?  "Won't Tell You Where She Works".

       Tea Time   I just emptied out 2 half full paper cups of coffee.  One, I purchased this morning on my way in and drank half of it, leaving the other half to go cold and filmy.  The other, I bought on my way back from a field trip to the site of our non-existant press conference; drank half of it, and left the rest for the squirels.    The natural reaction to all of this of course, is to boil some water and make a cup of tea.  And since this tea will be my lunch today, I might as well add a few words here.   urlLink Leafs Fight.    urlLink Ray Charles is coming to the Jazz Festival    urlLink The Sun has another  inane  headline.   And of course...the U.S. remains steadfast that "Freedom ain't Free", and that the  urlLink wadges of that freedom must be payed by 16 year old Afghani children

My first thought was honestly: "Oh man, the security guards finally got together and hauled them away".  Then it occured to me: "Wait....There's really nothing to protest anymore is there".

       Update to the Shift Article posted earlier    urlLink Here it is again if you missed it.   This little gem made it on to the House of Commons Hansard a couple of months ago.  The Prime Minister is speaking:    Mr. Speaker, democracy is a living thing. The history of the world teaches us it is a fragile thing, as well. To be nurtured. To be encouraged. To be promoted. And to be defended. I know philosophers say that there is no such thing as a "perfect democracy". Of course that is true. Any society is a work in progress. But the truest test of a living, growing democracy like Canada is the extent to which our institutions strive to live up to our ideals. For it is in continuing to measure ourselves against our ideals that we reaffirm their power to inspire....In the United States the fitness of a candidate for office is judged first on his or her ability to raise huge sums of money. Rather than on his or her brains or ability to lead. They call it the "money primary", Mr. Speaker. And it takes place in the shadows. Long before an idea is expressed. Before a speech is given. Before a vote is cast.     urlLink Read about how Canada is changing its campaign financing rules.   Now....why is this a good thing?  Why is it a bad thing?

       Props from David Suzuki   There's been a report released recently from the  urlLink Union of Concern Scientists  and the  urlLink Ecological Society of America  entitled  urlLink "Confronting Climate Change in the Great Lakes Region"   (from the  urlLink press release )    "The Great Lakes area as we know it will change forever," said David Suzuki, scientist and broadcaster. "I grew up in this region and have fond memories of paddling and fishing in the lakes and watching birds from farmers' fields - climate change is altering the area's natural spaces dramatically. This research illustrates just how serious a problem we've got."    The cool part is that Toronto actually got some praise from the legendary scientist.  (from page 72 of the 108 page  urlLink full report )     Toronto: A Leader Among Cities in Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions     One of the first local governments in the world to commit to voluntary cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, and one of the most successful, is Toronto. In 1990, Canada's largest city committed to a goal of reducing its emissions 20 percent below 1988 - 1990 levels by 2005. By 1998, Toronto had already exceeded its 2005 goal more than three times over, achieving emission reductions of 67 percent below 1990 levels. That represents a drop from 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere to 765,000 tons released, one of the largest reductions achieved anywhere in Canada. Toronto used a wide range of measures to achieve its emission goals: improving the energy efficiency of city buildings and streetlights, improving energy efficiency and switching to alternative fuels for its vehicle fleet, procuring and developing "green" power sources, and capturing landfill gases for use in power production. The latter strategy, in fact, produced the greatest reduction in emissions and also generates $2.5 million (Cdn) in yearly income for the city. Although energy efficiency measures resulted in much smaller emission reductions, they save the city $10 million (Cdn) in energy costs each year.    More good news is on the way.  The specific reduction in methane emissions from landfills will be  even greater  as the City moves to a full organic processing plan.  A huge strategy (mentioned in the report as well) is to increase diversion of all materials.  The organic material diverted would be processed, and any methane would be captured and used for power production, thus preventing the release of that portion of greenhouse causing gas.  Finally...climate change and waste diversion can sit at the same table.  Thank you Dr. Suzuki.

       The Most Important Article You'll Read in '03   I seem to recall a weird print run statistic: The best selling National Lampoon issue of all time was one where they had a dog on the cover, and a man's hand holding a gun to the dog's head.  The caption read "Buy this magazine or we'll shoot the dog."  Dark and funny, just like it should be.  This month's issue of Shift (yeah, aparently it's back) is dark brown with title of this entry, written in big white letters.  While it's not earthshattering news, it is a very good  urlLink article .  I encourage you to read it.

       Ah, this still makes me laugh   There was a kid in my grade school who was constantly on the verge of being  urlLink homeschooled .  In retrospect, it was never  his  fault that his parents wanted to pull him out of our little public school.  It seems (generalization) that homeskool'd kids are home schooled, because their parents disagree with how, or what, their children are being taught in public schools.  This particular kid didn't have zelotous parents per se, but he did have hippie parents.  The kind of hippie parents who would send him to school with things like "carob chip cookies" in his lunch.  Naturally he was a thin, humourless, sickly child; as 4th grader's go anyway.    I just always remember him talking about how his parents wanted to take him out of school, and teach him at home.  And now, I wonder what their  urlLink motivations  for wanting to do this really were....

       A Passover Game for all you kiddies out there   It's late I know.  But a good friend sent me a link to  urlLink  this site.   The PKs in the audience will recall similar fun-tyme activities that kept idle hands busy, and wandering minds fixed on the Lord.    Let's be clear here: This is a site, intended for the homeschooled children of Christian parents, and this particular activity is intened to teach children of Christian parents, what the 10 plagues in Egypt was all about.  Right?  I mean....I've never heard a Jew use the phrase "you can witness to them!".  I didn't investigate the rest of the site, but I can't find anywhere that it says "Remember to check with Mommy and Daddy to make sure it's ok to do all of these things".  Especially the witnessing to neighbours activity (#10 at the bottom).      A fun activity to represent the ten plagues can be reenacted. Ten days before Passover begins, do something in your home to represent each one of the ten plagues. Here are a few examples. Be creative and make up your own symbols.   1. Nile waters turning to blood --put red food coloring in the water glasses at the dinner table, in the bathroom sinks, in the dog's water bowl, and anywhere else you can think of.   2. The frogs--Use green construction paper to cut out roundish frogs with thin green legs. Bend the legs to make the frogs look as if they are jumping. Put them everywhere, in cereal boxes, in the shower, refrigerator, drawers, etc.   3. The lice--Use a hole punch to make many small white "dots" out of plain white paper. Scotch tape them on your body and leave them on for a few hours. The appearance and irritation will make you think of itching lice.   4. The flies-- Use clear scotch tape to tape pepper or small "dots" of black construction paper in different areas of the house, the windows, the bathroom mirrors, etc.   5. Disease afflicting the Egyptian livestock--put stuffed animals in different areas of the house, upside down.   6. Boils--Use a hole punch to make many small red "dots" out of red construction paper (or cut out circles). Cover each other with boils by scotch taping them on your body and leave them on for a few hours. The appearance and irritation will make you think of the boils.   7. Hailstorm--Put ice cubes around the outside of your house, the porch areas and on the outside window sills.   8. Locusts-- Use brown construction paper to cut out oval-looking locusts. Put them everywhere as you did the frogs (you'll even think of some new places to surprise your family).  9. Darkness--Tape brown paper bags over all the windows, draw all draperies to keep it dark in the daytime, or don't turn on any lights in the evening.   10. Put red ribbon on the sides and top of door post of your house to avoid the death plague. When the neighbors ask what the ribbon is for you can witness to them!

       Low pressure   They must be fighting a fire somewhere in the City.  There is no water pressure in the bathroom on the 25th floor of this building.

       TAMPON WARS!!!    urlLink Tampax and Playtex  fought in court, and Playtex won.    Seems Tampax claims that its 'Tampax Pearl' tampon is superior in both comfort and protection, to the leading 'Playtex Gentle Glide'.  Now, I am a loyal user of the 'Tampax Pearl'.  As soon as I saw the advertising I went right out and bought 3 cases of them, figuring that, with its superior comfort and protection, I could either sleep on, or stop bullets with them.  But now that a court has ruled that Tampax does NOT offer greater comfort and protection, doesn't that mean that the 'Playtex Gentle Glide' actually offers the comfortable fit, and force-shield-like protection that I deserve?  I think it does.  So, Im stuck with about 200 boxes of these crappy 'Tampax Pearl' tampons which, by U.S. District Court standards, are rough as Tobasco soaked sandpaper and as absorbant as fine Corinthian leather.    If anyone wants them, you know where to find me.

       Municipal Fitness and So-Called Rights   I've subscribed to the daily mail lists for the major mayoral candidates.  Here's a little snippit from Mr. Nunziata's most recent mailing: The problem with our criminal justice system is that the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of assisting criminals and protecting their so-called rights.  For example, parents do not have the right to know if there is a convicted sex offender of pedophile living next door.  He has the right to privacy, says the law, notwithstanding the fact that the safety of children is at risk.  The Holly Jones case illustrates what is wrong with the criminal justice system, specifically   -Lack of an effective sex offender registry -No national DNA data bank for sex offenders -The high number (approximately 1000) of sex offenders living in Toronto.  All of that aside, Im afraid that if I vote for Nunziata, he'll pass some kind of council motion to make me  urlLink run marathons with him .

       26 to 16   That's the margin of vote that banned cosmetic use (read:  "frivilous and unnecessary use" ) of pesticides in Toronto City Council yesterday.   urlLink Here's the story.   Said Rob Ford (Ward 2, Western Suburbia North)   "This whole city is going to be weeds, mice, rodents. It's already dirty as it is. We have to clean it up.  We're losing our rights in this city. You can't do anything and it's your property. That's dictatorship."   Councillor Ford seems to have a funny idea of what democracy is.  It also seems that he didn't read my post from yesterday.

       Pesticides.  Again.   I forgot to mention one of the anti-pesticide-ban protest slogans from yesterday's demonstration in Nathan Phillip Square: "Our Lawns, Our Choice".  Seemingly a slant on the abortion slogan "Our Bodies, Our Choice".  Does anyone else think the individual rights movement has gone a little too far here?  Smoking is banned in public spaces.  Why?  Because an individual's right to smoke, is negated (or over ruled) by the public's right to not ingest second hand smoke.  The whole notion of "banning" smoking hinges on the argument that second hand smoke is a cause of cancer, and an individual who is smoking is then infringing on another individual who chooses NOT to smoke.  Back to pesticides.  An individual home owner's right to use pesticides on his property, would be over ruled, by the public's right to have an environment free from persistant chemicals.  Right?    So where does "Our Lawns, Our Choice" come in?  The whole notion of banning pesticides hinges on the fact that someone  else's  lawn, drinking water, pets, body fat, may be affected by your decision to use pesticides.  If it is decided that pesticides are environmentally persistant (that is they are chemicals that are not metabolized and therefore stay in the food chain), then there is motivation to ban.  It is no longer just an individual choice to use pesticides, because your individual choice infringes on my health.  Your right to swing your arms ends when your fist touches my nose.  Here's another piece to the puzzle:  Yesterday while observing the protest I saw what everyone else saw.  A big circle of people walking around, chanting slogans, wearing identical t-shirts that sported their message.  What most people  didn't  see, were the jackets and hats that were in various piles around the circle.  Jackets and hats that said "Green Machine" and "Weed Man".  Jackets and hats, that were taken off prior to the protest, and prior to the protest moving into the City Council Chamber.  So "Our Lawns" quickly becomes "Our Client's Lawns"; And "Our Choice" quickly becomes "Our Client's Decision to Contract Us to Spray Their Lawns".  Not as catchy of a slogan.  Certainly one that doesn't tug at the heartstrings of people who can identify with their cause.  Why the deception though?  Why wouldn't lawncare companies simply come out and say: "A decision to ban cosmetic use of pesticides would adversely affect our business".  Why would they pose as home owners?  Council wraps up tomorrow.  Ban or no ban.

       Prepare to humble yourselves   There's a protest happening outside of City Hall right now.  There is a proposed by-law that will ban residential pesticide use in the City of Toronto.  As people are inherently abhorant to change, there are loud and sometimes low-brow arguments from both camps.  As an example....both use  children  in their protesting.   Anti-pesticides  (Pro pesticide ban):  Pesticides are environmentally persistant.  We are spraying chemicals on the lawns and fields that our children play on every day.  Why do you want to poison our children?   Pro-Pesticides  (Anti pesticide ban):  Most of the "ban pesticide" arguments are based on faulty science.  Without proper care and control of lawns and fields, our children will have no place to play.  Why do you want to take these green pastures away from our children?  Much of this harkens back to the "this union hates children" argument from our colourfully, ignorant mayor.  Personally I think anyone who envokes children to deliever their side of a debate are petty, pseudo-child pornographers, who aim for the lowest common denominator of uninformed public opinion.  But hey...that's just one blogger's opinion.  You can find out what all the fuss is about by  urlLink checking out the motion  from Economic Development and Parks in the agenda for today's City Council meeting.  You'll note that item (c) is the one pertaining to the potential pesticide ban.  Item (a) of course is the one pertaining to the   2004 visit by the Dalai Lama to the City of Toronto  .    Yeah...THAT Dalai Lama.    Yeah...THAT Toronto.  Man.  I stayed out of town during Pope-a-palooza last summer, but next year?  I'll go and see that.

Mr. Bush has said nothing about a U.S. citizen being killed by a U.S.-made bulldozer bought with U.S. tax dollars. A congressional resolution demanding an independent inquiry into Ms. Corrie's death has been buried in committee, leaving the Israeli military's investigation - which conveniently cleared itself of any wrongdoing - as the only official probe."

       When it rains it pours   I guess that high IQ wasn't enough to prevent Jakobek from covering up his involvement with MFP's sales staff.  A flight to Philly, a free hockey game, dinners.    I think it's fairly clear the  urlLink Star doesn't like Jakobek .     "There are no  urlLink tears for Tom Jakobek today . What he sowed, he's reaping. The guy who told the inquiry yesterday he got tired of cutting throats at city hall and wanted, instead, to cut ribbons (as mayor), has cut his own electoral throat. Always ruthlessly efficient, this Tom."    "After this  urlLink week's admissions , Jakobek should do the right thing and voluntarily remove his name from the list of contenders for the mayor's seat. He will only embarrass himself - and this city - by staying in the race."

       Just to keep you all in the loop   There's this  urlLink little gem  from this morning's Star, and the companion story in the  urlLink Detroit Free Press .  Aparently Toronto Garbage is "cleaner" then the locally produced garbage that's going into the Michigan Landfill.   "Waste industry experts have long pointed out that Canada imposes stricter limits on waste generators than Michigan or other states. Waste from Ontario is sorted more thoroughly for recyclable material than in Michigan"   That's right.  Now...it doesn't change the fact that we should be diverting as much of that "garbage" as possible.  It doesn't change the fact that we should go ahead with the current proposal to have an organic's recycling program for the entire city by 2005.  It doesn't change the fact that we should be looking at new and emerging technology to deal with the portion of garbage that cannot be recycled or composted.    What it does change is the argument of the ban-toronto-trash camp across the border.  I doubt they'll be able to claim that Canada is sending truckloads of glowing radioactive waste across the border and dumping it into their children's cereal every morning.

       Wait a minute, wait a minute....   Are you telling me, that a municipal politician, accepted favours from a bidding vendor, in exchange for potential influence,  urlLink and then lied about it ?  Here?  In Toronto the Good?  Ok, it's not like he  urlLink killed the woman he was having an affair with  and then hid her body.    But let's be clear.  This is a man, who is running for mayor of the largest city in Canada;   who spent his time on council as budget cheif cutting and eroding the budgets of some of the most basic programs;   who, in  urlLink a front page interview  with the Toronto Star quoted the man administering his IQ test as saying his results were: " High Tom, very high ";   and who, in the same front page article showed contempt for the inquiry which he now bows before, indicating that the MFP inquiry hasn't " got anything " on him.  This is a man who, when asked by several media outlets whether he was on a private flight to Philadelphia to see a Leafs game, payed for by the computer leasing firm MFP, said over and over again " I was not on that flight ".  Keep in mind that this is the same flight that Dash Domi said he was "fairly certain" Jakobek was not on; this is the same flight who's manifest records list Jakobek as on the plane.  When it was suggested that his failure to come forward with the truth actually cost the municipal taxpayers a lot of money, Jakobek replied " I will agree with you that I may have indirectly caused an expenditure which may be picked up by the taxpayer ,"  Indirectly folks.  Indirectly.   This is Mayoral candidate number one.  We have 4 other "serious" ones and a multitude of transvestites, buskers, and assorted licorice to wade through  urlLink before November .

       Defunct Comic Book Heroes    urlLink Gone and Forgotten .  It was mentioned in  urlLink an episode of This American Life  called "Superheroes"  It's a website filled with comics that publishers started and never finished.  Superheroes with superpowers that were not uh...useful (see  urlLink "Captain Marvel"  who had the power to have his arms, legs and head fall off his body).  It's worth a read.  Here's something else that was mentioned in that same episode:    You are allowed to choose one superpower; Invisibility or Flight.  You would be the only person on earth with the power that you choose, and you can't have both.  If you choose Invisibility, you can wear your clothes while invisible, but anything you pick up will be visible.  If you choose flight you can up to 100 m.p.h., only within the earth's atmosphere and only you can fly, you can't pull a Superman and hold hands with someone while you fly.   So.  Which do you choose?

       The McSweeney's I like   McSweeney's.net publishes a new piece every day.  There's a lot of fluff to sort through.  Most are pretty abstract, conceptual; most border on being funny.    But every so often there's a theme that strikes me as very funny, and the author actually thinks it through, expands on it, and produces something that's part parody, part satire, part social commentary.    They're never the end-all-be-all of writing, and often the subject matter is so esoteric that it's off-putting.  But for a site that is as prolific as McSweeney's, they're bound to get it right sometimes.  Here is  urlLink part 1  and urlLink  part 2   of a pretty funny concept that plays out.  If you have a while to dig in the  urlLink archives , try and find "the minutes from a yearbook committee meeting" and "a band meeting with AC/DC to discuss the title of their new album"

       Garbage   One has to start wondering why garbage is such a keystone issue.  It's a concept that's referred to again and again by city dwellers and city leaders alike.    The "city worker's strike" (Locals 416 and 79) in the summer of 2003 is  regularily  referred to as "The Garbage Strike" in the media, and by city councilors.  Even in  urlLink this story  (the possibility of calling a "single number" for all city services) "missed garbage collection" is used as an example; twice.  Don't get me wrong.  I love the idea of a single line for anyone to call to report or request city service, but Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.....  You'd think we were hauling truckloads of gold around the city.

       Think Hard    urlLink Somehow this girl  got from her home near Dundas West station, to being dismembered and thrown in Lake Ontario, some time between 6:30pm on May 13 and 11:00am May 14.  Read the story.  Think about the area.  If you can contribute useful information to the police, or know someone who can help call 416-808-8390.  There's someone in this City who committed this crime.  And until the police find them there's a little girl killing freak in our midst.

       The Believer   The good people at  urlLink McSweeney's  have released 10 fairly good literary journals over the past couple of years.  They have started a monthly magazine called   urlLink The Believer   which is available at a few places I've visited.  Here is the  urlLink manifesto article  from the March/April issue.    There's a new issue out for May.  I think I'll wander up Queen to Pages after work.

       Fake Terrorists   The Fake Terrorists  urlLink in this case , are the United States federal government and agencies.  The fake terrorist targets are Seattle and Chicago.  The idea is to test the response of various levels of service, and government, a fake terrorist attack will take place in two cities this week.  One will be a "dirty bomb" incident.  The other will be a "bio-terror" incident.  The planners (from the Dept. of Homeland Security) have dubbed the fake terrorist organization "GLODO", which aparently stands for "Group for the Liberation of Orangeland and the Destruction of Others".    Does this feel tacked on to anyone else?  I have a sneaking suspicion that "GLODO" is closer to "Global Domination", then an english speaking terrorist group who is liberating a fake country and detroying "others" as part of their mandate.  I figure they must have started out with GlobDom, but that probably just made Ashcroft giggle.  Im glad that a drill of this size, importance, and cost ($16 Million) is using a terrorist group that is essentially modeled after a James Bond villan.

       So which part of this is democracy?   The speaker of the Ontario provincial legislature has decided that  urlLink the ruling Progressive Conservative party acted in contempt  of the legislature by releasing their 2003-2004 budget at an Ontario autoparts manufacturing facility, instead of in the legislature.  Was it democracy in action when protest about the budget presentation erupted, and was then ignored by the majority party in power?  Was it democracy in action when the legislative procedure showed that the majority party was in contempt of the process?  Will it be democracy in action when the majority party votes in favour of themselves, in order to not be censured by the house?  The Ontario PC Party has clealy flouted parlimentary procedure.  The speaker (a former PC MPP) has ruled that the party decision, flys in the face of procedure, and is tantamount illegal.  Will the majority government censure itself?  This may be one for the ethics books.

       Ah. Sweet fan-fiction   Something Awful included this  urlLink rules list for those attempting to write fan-fiction .  Perhaps a hilariously satirical twist on the genre will help wash the taste of " urlLink Roy Orbison in Cling Film " out of our collective mouths.  1. Thou shalt not be afraid of the taboo. Inflation, cripple and amputation fetishes, cannibalism, and even child rape can all fit into the framework of your 300 page novel about Penny from Inspector Gadget.   2. Thou shalt not ignore the obscure. The Sentinel, Nightman, and MANTIS, are all perfectly viable choices for erotic fanfiction despite the fact that they were cancelled almost immediately. Your obsession with rejected TV shows should know no bounds.   3. Thou shalt always include thyself. Self-insertion fanfiction makes the world go round. After all, who wants to jack off to Lara Croft and Xena having lesbian sex when they could instead jack off to Lara Croft and Xena tag-teaming some anonymous dork from the Internet? Don't be afraid to include friends and relatives as well. Try to work all of your social issues into the story.   4. Thou shalt arbitrarily continue your story until you die from eating too many Cheetohs. The greatest stories ever told didn't have a beginning, middle, or end, they just kept going and going and were filled with seemingly random plot twists and the inclusion of the entire TGIF lineup.   5. Thou shalt grow angry at the slightest criticism for thou art a true artist. Your work is genius and there is no reason to be ashamed. Those who dare to criticize your Tifa genital torture sequence are simpletons who fail to comprehend the gravitas of your work. One day ten thousand years from now alien philosophers will ponder the meaning of your Trunks/Cloud mutual masturbation sequence, and then your existence will be vindicated.

       I won   We have an intranet webpage here, which features a "mystery photo" contest.  Each week they post a section of a new picture of some place around the city, and slowy add sections to the picture.  The first person to guess what the photo is, gets "a small token of our appreciation".  I won last week's contest by correctly identifying the inside of Union Station.  I received a letter in the interoffice mail today from Corporate Services.  Here's what it says:  Congratulations  It is our pleasure to present to you this small token of our appreciation for participating in the mystery photo contest, and for being the first to correctly identify the featured photo.  Regularly, winners receive a corporate pin and a second gift.  However, since we only have pins at this time, your additional prize will be forwarded to you as soon as we have received the new items.  Thank you Corporate Services   I put the letter up on the fridge in the office kitchen, with the note "I am awesome!" written in pencil at the bottom.  Am I the office hero?  Perhaps.  What will my "second gift" be?  Why is it on backorder?  Will there be third and fourth gifts after that, making this a Chanukah-esque prize contest?  I'd like a coffee mug.  Or Etobicoke.  You know...whatever.

       The Office   I am realizing that this forum is partially about silencing the voices in my head, and partially about maintaining an account of my first office life, which actually began almost exactly 2 years ago, but I can now articulate the initial observations here.  I moved from a small office (of about 8 people) to a significantly larger office (40 people).  The beauty of the small office, was its familial atmosphere; if I was struggling with a deadline, I could easily pass off work to my colleagues for help.  The small size also meant that we were more integrated in each other's personal lives, which translated to:  having something to talk about besides work .    There's the rub of a large office.  There are people on this floor that I only interact with on a professional level.  Only to ask "Did you see this report?" or "Are we budgeted for that?".  But....even though it's plain that we have  nothing  other then work to talk about, it doesn't disuade these people from trying to have a pseudo-personal conversation.  Which leads to situations like this:   I get on the elevator with a faceless colleague   Me:  Hey. Him: So....how do you like working here? Me:  Oh well, it's great.  I like being downtown.  It's a shorter commute. Him: Yeah.  The commute is great. Me:  Yeah. Him: Yeah. Me:  So how's your commute? Him: Oh, pretty good.  I take the train in from out of town.  It's nice.  'Bout an hour. Me:  Nice. Him: Yeah.  See?  Nothing to talk about.  I've worked here for about 6 months, and people are still asking me if I "like it better here".  I thought for a while it was me, being the new guy and all.  Turns out it's just a weird symptom of working with people from different backgrounds.    I know two people on this floor who only talk about beer.  New beers they've tried, old beers they have tried, imported beers they want to try.  That's it: Beer.  It's a knee-jerk response they have to each other, and if they catch each other in the hallway one will always start out with "I tried a Belgian double bock at the Biergarden that I think you'd like".  The old standards are there too: Golf.  Golf swing.  Golf score.  Hockey.  Baseball.  I've noticed that it's only men that seem to have this problem.  Women seem prone to chatting about whatever comes up, but guys are genuinely uncomfortable in off the cuff conversations.  If we, as office drones, are resigned to talk about inane, superficial topics that require no emotional investment, then at least we should be creative about the topics.  No more "Did you catch last night's episode of 'Popular Reality Show'?" or "Wow, that weather outside is something else huh?".  We should start conversations like:  "Did you happen to see the architecture of this building?  Kinda Neo-Classical don't you think?" "I saw a dog outside.  It was small." "I like bright lights.  It makes me feel like I am awake"  Or I could just get fired.

       The Level I Am At   Without going into too many specifics, I'll try and describe the situation that a colleague and I have had to resort to:  This colleague...let's call him "Paul", and I are responsible for creating a map to describe areas of responsibility between various managers.  By definition, there are boundary lines between areas of responsibility, and these boundary lines are often streets.  We have been playing phone tag, email tag, and various impromptu meetings in the hallway, all in an effort to understand exactly where the boundary lines are.  Naturally, once we think we have an accurate description, we check with another manager who says "that's not part of my area there!" and proceeds to unilaterally redefine his area of responsibility.  These are grown men I'm talking about.  Grown men who get compensated fairly well for their efforts.  Paul and I have decided to crash the manager's meeting tomorrow.  I've done it before, he hasn't.  I just set up a "time" with the AA in charge of the meeting, and tomorrow morning we are marching in, to get some final answers.  I'm supprised that it's come to this, but it has.  We have to sit a bunch of people down at a table, and let them argue to each other, instead of through us.

       England gets all the nuts   Come on.   urlLink A masked, cape-clad mystery man  is performing good deeds, and scaring off bad guys in a small english town.  I've actually been to Tunbridge-Wells.  Think suburbs.  So, there's one guy, kind of mixed up, living a fantasy life based on comics and superheroes.  There is semi-praise for him now, but what happens when he starts rubbing his crotch on telephone poles in front of the old ladies that he's claiming to protect?  I mean, this little experiment can only go so far before it sours, and I believe the souring will come in some sexual-gratification form.  I can't accept that this guy would do this out of pure altruism.  He's getting something out of it, and I don't think it's as pleasent as the satisfaction of a job well done....

       In which the author, eventually, makes a shocking admission   If you live or travel by the lake you've probably seen the gigantic wind turbine that was installed on the CNE grounds as a "demonstration project".  The new federal NDP leader was instrumental in lobbying to have that turbine installed, and now you can  urlLink own some of the power that is produced by it .  Plus, if you're like me and you like cool stuff to put on your desk at work, you may want to enter their contest to win a model Wind Turbine.  I hope it'll fit on my desk.  It will look nice beside my  urlLink Falcon Waterfree Technologies  model urinal, which I scored at a Public Works Tradeshow in the winter.  If you've never listened to " urlLink  This American Life", you're missing out.  There are a number of programs produced by the CBC which are similar (pointless documentary features), but This American Life is somehow unique.  Last week's episode was a repeat, but one of their better ones: A live show called " urlLink Music Lessons ".    Each week the producers choose a topic and 3 or 4 contributers submit audio interviews or monologues, to fill out the hour.  Sometimes an entire hour is devoted to a single story.  As much as I play up a general distaste for America and it's current state of drift, I do have a soft spot for a certain aspect of the country.  I think Americans have enshrined "small town life" better then Canadians have.  We all joke about growing up in a small town (some smaller then others), and regale each other with tales of hicks, and white trash, and church, and daily hour long rides on a school bus through the concession roads of the county.  But the Yanks have distilled the experience into very attractive, soul seducing, ways.     urlLink Garrison Keillor ways .     urlLink Norman Rockwell ways .     urlLink Aaron Copeland ways .  It's a universal experience, and even if you grew up in a harsh urban environment, there's still an invitation to claim "small town roots" through summer camps, or fishing trips, or visiting relatives in the country.  Even failing all of those things, the experience is still available vicariously through the culture of Anytown USA.  Canadians have the same small town love, framed in authors like W.O. Mitchell or Farley Mowat, but it doesn't seem to be as universal as the Yanks.  As though small town life in Nova Scotia is  vastly  different from small town life in Alberta.  As though we can't speak on the same level because one set of stories must include the Cod harvest, and another set is balanced  on wheat farming.  I think part of the appeal of the Anytown USA version is the universal nostalgia.  Canadians seem to have difficulty accepting nationally universal traits, and that may be a part of the lack of a country-wide discourse on our common past.  I don't like feeling part of the American version of small town life, but it's the only place I can get the fix I need.

If I can figure out how to put pictures up I will but I think I'll just be linking to the stories in the papers in a few hours.  Global made a story out of it (I watched the camera crew as they waited for 10 minutes before they could get footage of someone littering across the street).

       Another Canuck Makes Good   Specifically: Another Canuck Makes a new Word that is then incorporated into Webster's Dictionary 10 years later.    "McJob" is among the new words that are included in the new  urlLink 11th edition  of the Webster's Dictionary.  Douglas Coupland coined the term in his novel  Generation-X .  This is actually my second Douglas Coupland reference in 4 days, what with my use of the term "veal fattening pen".  If you've actually read  Generation-X  you shouldn't be surprised that Coupland's resume includes both "author" and "coiner-of-terms".  He spends most of the space in the book creating faux-terms that either, he used among his circle of friends, or terms that he hoped would become incorporated into the lexicon.  Quite a few of them did.  Including "Generation-X" I believe.  What story about the new edition of a dictionary would be complete without the following statement: "It is a reflection of society's changes".  Well, no schitt Sherlock.  A boring child, I used to listen to the CBC whilst delivering the Hamilton Spectator in  urlLink Millgrove  Ontario.  Every year Arthur Black (of "Basic Black") would devote 30 minutes of his radio show to the new words that were going to be incorporated into either the Oxford Standard, or the Merriam-Webster dictionaries.  Every year he would read out the list as though it were a comedy routine: E-mail.  CD-ROM.  Web Browser.  Generation X.  Prozac.    He and a small panel of English-major types would laugh and laugh as the words were read out, and he would obligingly ask rhetorical questions like "Now why would 'Homies' be included in the dictionary.  It's a colloquial urban term for "close friends", is it even a word?" and every year the representative from the dictionary would say "Well Arthur these new words are a reflection of society's changes".  After the segment, a contest would be introduced where Canada's curmudgeons would be invited to phone in and either suggest new words for the dictionary, or suggest words to be banned from the English language.  New words would be delightfully banal,  urlLink Sniglet -grade suggestions like "Mallmanac - The board in a shopping mall that tells you the location of all the stores".  Words to be banned, would include new words that old people didn't use or find any value in, like the overuse of the word "like".  This would be accompanied by a rant about how young people don't appreciate language and use words out of their intended meaning (See numerous 'Cosby Show' references including "Bad = Good").

       Mayoral Notes   There were 3 mayoral candidates in the Pride parade on Sunday.  In order: David Miller; John Tory; Barbara Hall.  Hall had a float, a DJ and the largest throng of supporters, including Toronto Centre-Rosedale councillors Pam McConnell and Kyle Rae.  Rae's Executive Assistant Chris Phibbs is running for a seat in Ward 30 (Riverdale South), and was heavily endorsed on stickers proclaiming "Dykes Lyke Phibbs".  Tory had a group of supporters around him who were all wearing orange t-shirts.  I'm not sure if it's just because "Orange is the new Black", or if Tory is trying to pass himself off as left wing.  Miller had a large group of supporters, most of whom spilled back into the OPSEU crowd sporting "I support Miller" on rainbow backed picket signs.  I don't belive Tom Jakobek, John Nunziata or Don Andrews were present in, or in attendance at, the parade.  Ever wonder what a "Nationalist" campaign platform looks like?   urlLink Here's one .  Most notably (I've added italics):  - Will introduce a motion to officially declare and proclaim European Heritage Week in the City of Toronto;  - Will set up an educational program to keep the city sidewalks clean,  especially in selected ethnic neighbourhoods;    - Will introduce a by-law to have English translations provided on all commercial signs in all parts of Metro Toronto;  - Will establish a special fund to aid homeowners to preserve the cultural integrity of their neighbourhoods;  - Will work to increase the size of Toronto's police and work with them to establish a New Immigrant Crimes Unit;

       It begins   Watch for a flood of  urlLink these stories   stories and commentaries coming from the right-wing side of the American pundent pool. The same people who endorsed the President and the invasion of Iraq will now argue, with a straight face, that we have no business being over there. They'll argue that American tax dollars should be spent helping American families, and not a bunch of Afghani and Iraqi people who are too lazy to get up and work the land to make a life for themselves.   The scary thing is that people will believe them. They'll rally around their President's cry that "American troops should not be used for nation building" (remember his statements during the 2000 Presidential campaign?). I'm not sure if it's a country with the shortest attention span in history, or if it's just a bunch of people who are so easily manipulated that they'll believe anything you tell them.

       One step forward, and a few leaps back   My girlfriend and I went to  urlLink the Pride parade , on Sunday in Toronto.    I think my favorite moment was when the "Pride in our Bodies" group marched in front of us; They were 8, completely naked men, some of whom had fanny packs and water bottles tied around their waists.  It was a little breezy out there on Bloor St., so it came as no surprise to anyone when the metal cart they had constructed to carry their belongings (as they had had no pockets) blew over and crashed to the pavement.  So here's 8 naked men who had to first, jump out of the way of the collapsing, oversized metal rickshaw, and then try to figure out how to put it back up.  That's part of the problem with being naked: if a big metal cart blows over and catches you on the way down, chances are it's going to leave a scuff.  No one was hurt of course, but there was a lot of squatting and bending during the gathering up of the promotional pamphlets and the righting of the cart.  Men will apparently continue to be men, even when they're standing naked in the middle of a major downtown arterial.  On that subject,  urlLink there is this reaction  from the States to Canada's endorsement of homosexual marriage.  So if it is formally proposed, and passed, it would make homosexuality essentially illegal in the United States.  That is to say if it is  unconstitutional  for two men or two women to be a recognized couple, it is the penultimate step towards making homosexuality illegal.  Someone once told me that I complain too much about Americans.  I'll promise not to complain, but just line up the evidence and let it rest.  How can I make fun of a country that lives its own hypocrisy every day?

       The dwindling of memory   No melting clocks here.  Just a simple statement:  I can't remember doing laundry in first year university.  Seriously.  I know I didn't bring it home with me, because I didn't go home all that often.  I know I  did  laundry because I managed to find a girlfriend who's opted to stay with me for 6 years now.  I just can't recall a time when I did laundry.  I can't recall packing my laundry up in order to take it somewhere to wash.  I remember that I had a big canvas bag that I stuffed all my dirty clothes in, and I remember that I had a box of laundry detergent in the cupboard under my bed.  I remember the layout of the building that I lived in, and I am sure there was no washing machine on the floor.  I remember putting clean, folded laundry back into my drawers.  I remember there was a combination for the laundry room lock that was posted on our common room bulletin board, and that we were encouraged to keep it secret from others; But I can't remember ever entering that combination on a door, or even the door that may have lead to the laundry room that I can't remember.      The most troubling part of all of this isn't that I am slowly loosing my memory; I figure that is just part of life.  My brother and I joke about becoming more and more like our father every day, and that our respective girlfriends are learning to adapt by answering our puzzled looks with "You met him two months ago at a party" or "We're here to get scotch tape so you can wrap your mother's birthday present".    No, the most troubling thought is: "what if there was a whole system of leave-your-laundry-outside-your-door-and-someone-will-wash-and-return-it-the-next-morning". What if I had once lived in a building with such a luxurious privilege and I can't recall it now? What if there were eunuchs or elves, that went from room to room secretly gathering up student's clothes in the night and taking them to a river to wash and beat them against alabaster stones? What if I had had a midnight fling in the laundry room, and now can't recall it because I can't remember the room itself? What if I can't remember winning a servant in a poker match who would go on to make my coffee and wash my clothes for 8 months?  These are the kinds of questions that will haunt a man.

       Is it clear by now?   There are 11 people on our floor today.  11 out of about 40 or so who would normally be milling about.  This should explain the sharp spike in blog posts from yours truly.  If I stand up in my little veal fattening pen (thank you Douglas Coupland), I can see 6 offices all with their lights out.  On this floor that means that no one has been in to that office in the past 20 minutes or so, to trip the motion sensor that turns on the lights.  It's a very special time of year in the City.  It's the time of year when nothing gets done for 2 months solid because everyone is on vacation.  It's not to say that everyone takes vacation at the same time; that would be much more efficient.  Everyone takes a week here and there through the summer which means that everytime I make a phone call to move a project along, or get approval for something I'm met with " Actually I'm just filling in for her, you'll have to wait till she gets back.  I can't really say 'yes' or 'no' to that ".  It's doubley special this year, because even after people get back, City Council disolves after it's September meeting in advance of the November 10 municipal election.  This means that no new committee reports can be drafted, considered or passed until the new Mayor appoints the new committees, and until they meet for the first "real" time in February.  Don't look for any change to the complex issue of litter jurisdiction untill next March or so.

       So much Bush this morning   This one from Memory Hole (and from TMW where I first spied it).  It's a  urlLink video that shows Bush  on the morning of 9/11 in a classroom in Florida promoting reading.  He's told first that a plane hits the WTC and then that a second plane hits.  He sits in his chair.  He doens't call an end to the photo-op, or ask to be involved in what is happening to his country.  He just sits for 5 minutes.

       Bush at War   It's Bob Woodward's book.  It also puts Bush in an interesting light.  The book follows the Bush administration through the first 100 days after September 11.  Where each of them were, what they were doing, and how they handled the crisis, and subsequent retaliation on Afghanistan.  What becomes clear through the book, is that "advisors" like Karl Rove, and Paul Wolfowitz are always in the shadows directing policy both foreign and domestic.  What becomes even more clear is that Bush's war in Afghanistan was just that:  Bush's war.    The war in Iraq.  The policy of pre-emptive striking.  The arguments about WMD.  All from Wolfowitz.    So  urlLink this little tidbit  in today's news is all the more striking.  Wolfowitz will be running the secret trials, and ultimately executions of prisoners from the War on Terror.

       Oh thank God   It's OK folks.  The US government is going to use the same method of regulation for themselves, that they have proposed for keeping Corporations from cheating the system: self-regulation.    The argument is "Who knows the markets, and the economic rules better then the corporations themselves?  So if we let corporations police themselves, then we can free up our own time to worry about other things like whether consenting adults should be allowed to sodomize each other."  The government swears on a stack  urlLink of bibles that they won't torture  their detainees in Cuba.  That's OK right?  We can trust them to lead by example in the global fight against torture?  I can't think of any other time that the US government swore on a stack of bibles about something that later turned out to be completely false...

       The things Eves says   In honour of this latest Ontario/Califonria style heatwave and power crisis, I thought I'd post a comparison between two statements.  The environment minister said on Tuesday that we should cut back on outdoor barbeque use in the midst of the heatwave.  He claimed that barbeques contribute to the smog problem, so we should all cut back.    Premier Eves lent his support to the confusing request,  urlLink  quoted in the star : Meanwhile, Premier Ernie Eves said he is doing his bit to reduce smog by not using his barbecue. "I happened to order in Swiss Chalet last night instead of barbecuing," he said.  There were a lot of statements made (in the same article I think) about how it's not in fact barbeques that are contributing to the smog problem, but say, the Lakeview coal fired generator that's belching out tonnes and tonnes of particulate matter.  Or maybe the amount of cars that flood the road every day on the way into work, and every evening delivering roasted chicken to our Premier.  I would argue that based on Swiss Chalet's own  urlLink description of how their chicken is made,  that Premier Eves' choice of meal on Tuesday night was in direct contravention of his Minister's policies: Our signature Rotisserie Chicken is slowly roasted over an open flame so it can baste in its own juices until crispy and golden on the outside and tender and moist inside, just the way you like it.  So we can either barbeque our own chicken, or have someone else do it, and then drive it to us.  The Premier prefers the latter.  Perhaps the Premier believes that there are some atmostpheric clensing properties inherent in Swiss Chalet's famous tangy dipping sauce?

       Oh Lord but it is hot out today   Mercy.  Gary Benner (Toronto Mayoral Candidate) has added the song "Just the Start" to his long flash intro.  If you listen to it, that's actually Benner  urlLink playing guitar on the track .  MFP scandal aside, I am working on a shitty computer.  400 MHz Pentium 3 processor.    I use a GIS program called ArcView, which routinely crashes my computer.  I told my boss about it and he kind of laughed at me, and pointed to a co-worker's computer and said "His is even older then yours, and he doesn't complain".  Lovely.    We have been experiencing a very slow network server recently as well.  It took 5 minutes (seriously) to save an 11 MB file to the shared drive here.  Any other organization would identify this as a serious problem and acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable.  It's a loss of productivity and it's a complete waste of time.    But here?  It's acceptable; partially because everyone is scared to death about MFP, and partially because the employees in this organization are generally ignorant when it comes to technology.  So where other employees might complain, and indicate that a slow server is slowing down productivity, employees in our organization seem to simply take it in stride and work slower.  Insert civil service joke here.

       Ah the famous JDBGMGR.EXE virus   I had temporarily forgotten the panic that  urlLink hoax virus warnings  can create in an office filled with people who are generally unsure about computers to begin with.  For those of you who haven't received this one yet (and I find it hard to believe that you haven't), it's the one that tells you about a virus that has infected your Windows operating system, and will unleash it's terrible fury after 14 dormant days on your machine.  The hoax lays out careful instructions on how to find the file (type the file name into "find" and there it is).  The icon that you find, is a little teddy bear icon, and is an *.exe file that is actually a java debugging program.  The email tells you that the teddy bear is actually a virus, and must be deleted from your machine.  Oh, and forward the email to everyone in your address book, because the virus has already forwarded itself to them ahead of your warning.  This one takes an interesting turn however as it was originally forwarded by an IT staffer who does a lot of programing for our databases, and even caught the eye of our resident computer expert on the floor.  It also made its way to the masses, including one Chicken Little who marched down the floor from cubicle to cubicle telling people about this virus that had mysteriously infected everyone's machine, and left nothing but a cute teddy bear icon behind.  The Chicken Little in question had already phoned the person who forwarded it to her, the IT help desk, our departmental IT staff, and of course, the General Manager.  It remains to be seen as to whether all of these people have deleted the file or not.  I suppose I shouldn't be so critical.  After all I am the man who was convinced that "whitehouse.org" was the actual White House web page, and proceeded to  urlLink forward this , ensuring everyone that it was a legitimate questionaire from the American government.

       All across the world, men are checking out women's wiggles   I took the streetcar in this morning.    As I was heading down Broadview, I noticed two old (old) men sitting on a bench in front of a store.  An old (old) woman, dressed in a tattered fleece pullover, tights that her legs didn't quite fill out, slouch socks and a fanny pack, came walking down the sidewalk.  The two old men, paused in their conversation as she passed, and both, as if she were the hottest thing they'd ever seen, turned as she walked past.  They kept staring, slack jawed until she got to the corner and disappeared out of view.  One can only assume that she will be in their collective dreams tonight.

       City Hall Jazz   This is really why I love working here.    Every day, for the next week, I get to come to work at the Jazz Festival.  I get to walk through the little Jazz Festival arch, past the Jazz Festival tents and tables, through the Jazz Festival food court, and beside the Jazz Festival stage, before I can get to the front door of City Hall.  And to top it all off, each night, after work, there's a free concert at 5:00.  I can assure you they didn't have such festivities in Scarborough.

       God I love this   There was a canadian group back in the 70's and 80's called the Rhino party.  It was told to me (because I can't remember back that far) that the Rhino mandate was to get apathetic voters interested in politics.  They did this by running candidates in federal elections, on crazy platforms: "A national bake sale to eliminate the debt" or "Raise all streets 30 feet off the ground to prevent pedestrian fatalities" or "Build a bridge from the mainland to PEI".....  The candidates were usually younger, but the point was that through humour, they raised the interest in political issues from apathy to "I wonder how the other candidates would deal with the issue".  I can only assume that  urlLink Simon Shaw  was either a former Rhino party member, or someone who admired their style of campaigning.  Here's a quote from his website under the section titled "Environment": Wind turbines by the 100's located approximately .5 km south off the shore of Lake Ontario.  No eyesores close to shore with environmentally friendly energy generated by wind.   Now...I'm no physicist, but I think if you put "100's" of wind turbines approximately 500 m south, off the shore of Lake Ontario, they might sink a little.  Just a little mind you.  Perhaps Candidate Shaw was considering building an island or draining the lake enough to give them stable footing.  I'm also unclear how putting hundreds of wind turbines 500 meters into Lake Ontario, would  not  be an eyesore.  He also states: I want our beaches back.  For my entire life I have been told not to swim in lake Ontario.  Will it be ok for my grandchildren to swim in it.  The answer will probably be the same if we do not act now.  We must push ourselves and our neighbors to the south to act with environmental responsibility.   Well.  If the lake is filled with hundreds of wind turbines, im not sure where our grandchildren are supposed to swim.

       Aren't there laws against this?   Driving a car, or say a motorhome, naked I mean.    For the record, I grew up just south of where that "naturist" camp is north of Hamilton.  While I'm sure it was a huge fantasy of the boys in the area to visit the site, I have a feeling it would have been filled with men just like the one featured  urlLink in this story .

       The List   Here's the full list of 28 registered  urlLink candidates for Mayor .  And here is the list of 13 candidates that have websites (that's 46% by the way):   urlLink Don Andrews  - Click on "Media Centre" then on Ernst Zuindel -Globe and Mail.  There you will find this letter to the editor written by Don Andrews, Registered Candidate For Mayor, 2003 Toronto Municipal Elections:   Regarding your article in today's Globe, ""The Wives and Marriages of > Chameleon Ernst Zundel":  Could you explain the use of the word 'chameleon' in your title, as it doesn't seem to fit at all a man described as 'steadfast', energetic and 'a man who can dig in his heels'.    urlLink Gary Benner  - Because what you really want, is a long flash intro to your Municipal election platform.  On the issues, Benner supports an incinerator to handle Toronto's waste   urlLink Jaime Castillo  - Favours a more diverse City Hall.  Nice site, but I'm not sure what Calde Cast is.  Perhaps if City Hall had a higher degree of multiculturalism, I would know.   urlLink Barbara Hall  - You know her and love her.  And while it is maddeningly slow to listen to her, she does have a lot of content on her site.   urlLink John Jahshan  - Thinks he is running for Provincial or Federal office.  Check out his "issues" page: Health Care, Education....  He does have the very Orwellean quote: Facts-Not Phrases Solutions-Not Slogans Reason-Not Rhetoric    urlLink Tom Jakobek  - Check out the site to see Tom talking to a homeless man.   urlLink Paul Lewin  - This guy totally stole my domain name idea.  Mr. Lewin has extensively researched reasons why it is legal for Toronto to become a  urlLink seperate province .   urlLink David Miller  - For a man who has lots to say in Council and in front of cameras, he has a lousy Mayoral candidacy site.   urlLink John Nunziata  - Nunziata has a great site.  And there's plenty of pictures of him all sweaty after running 10K.  He favours a strong connection to the federal, and provincial governments.  Check out his site to learn about his "Group of 89" suggestion.   urlLink Simon Shaw  - Has one of the most distrubing candidate-posing-with-child pictures I have ever seen.  He does favour stronger methods of child protection from predators.   urlLink Luis Silva  - Is the man with the plan.  His opening remarks make his candidacy sound more like he's trying to win a bet: "What possessed me to run as mayor?" some people have asked me. Well, like most individuals, I criticize government. I have studied the issues that affect Toronto, and I have solutions to address those social problems that continue to plague our city. However, unlike most people, I decided to put my money where my mouth is and run for public office. After all, it's a free country, and I'm free to run for elected office like any other candidate.    urlLink John Tory  - I think Tory has a great site.  I'm not sure why I would want to donate to his campaign though.     urlLink Mehmet Yagiz  - Counts among his goals: - Increase public trust in the city administration. - Place missing street names and road signs. - Establish brotherhoods with other cities around the world. - Make the new gas stations not so close to the buildings and houses.

       WMD found.  By Bush aparently.    urlLink Ah Bush .  He and Mayor Lastman should get together and discuss how to behave in front of a camera.  (from a Washington Post story, Dated June 15, 2003)  Of course, weapons of mass destruction may yet be uncovered in Iraq. But in Poland last month, President Bush startled observers by saying on Polish TV: "We've found the weapons of mass destruction. You know, we found biological laboratories . . . . And we'll find more weapons as time goes on. But for those who say we haven't found the banned manufacturing devices or banned weapons, they're wrong. We found them."   If you're keeping score, you'll probably want to note that the biological laboratories that Bush is referring to are the trailers that Powell claimed were mobile labs.  The US in fact found them, but they turned out to be mobile hydrogen fueling stations for artillery balloons.  They were also sold to Iraq by a British company.

       A project for tonight   Well.  I just took a few moments and visited the websites of some of the lesser known candidates for Mayor.  There's about 10 that have websites, so I'll make sure to include them off to the side, in alphabetical order of course.  If you're a connoisseur of poorly designed webpages, heavily laced with content about municipal and civic decline, then be sure not to miss these.  It'll take me a little while to assemble them all, so look for the change tomorrow or tonight after dinner.   urlLink Here's one  to whet your appetite.

       One more from Tommy   Tom's spin on his own testamony at the MFP inquiry:  Jakobek Finally Testifies at Inquiry  Tom Jakobek finished four days of testimony as a witness for the Toronto computer leasing inquiry. While most of the media hype focused on Tom admitting that he was not being truthful to reporters about attending a hockey game, the most important evidence to come out of the inquiry was:  -  Jakobek was not responsible for the city's leasing problems   because he was not part of the original tender process  -  Jakobek was not " frequently entertained by the computer leasing   company, like some of the city staff  -  Jakobek was not a member of City Council when some of the   issues developed  Tom has now publicly apologized and knows that the people of the City will focus on his outstanding record during his twenty years of service at City Hall.   You'll do that won't you people of the City?  Focus on his outstanding record during his twenty years of service?  Something like that I'm sure.

Police and lawyers have a rich glorious history of assuming a woman just "changed her mind" after consentual sex and then claim rape.  It's not a friendly past.  But then  urlLink there's this .  I'm not really sure why a crazed, kidnaping-rapist, who has access to intravenous sedatives, would kidnap a City alderwoman and take her to Vegas, and not say, to an abandoned parking lot or distant dark woods.

       Oh Christ, my head hurts   I've got to stop looking at this guy's site.  In the "Tom's Views" section he tells us that  urlLink Toronto is Bankrupt .    He's got a good point, but wait, wasn't he the   fucking budget chief of this city for 4 years!!!    From the Toronto Star biography of Tom Jakobek:  "Jakobek sponsored the council motion in July, 1999, which allowed city staff to extend its lease agreement with MFP Financial Services from three to five years. Costs mushroomed from $43 million to more than $80 million."  Do you suppose that we could have shaved off a few dollars there Tom?  I mean, I know we're bankrupt and all but maybe we should reconsider your offer to have those who were responsible for bankrupting the City, running the fucking City!!  Now my head hurts.  Cognitive dissonance is the leading cause of sinus headaches....  That and smoke being blown up our collective asses.  I need a drink.

       Jakobek on the Issues   Folks, it's become pretty clear that I work in the municpal service delivery business.  To be specific, I work in the Garbage collection service delivery business.  One issue I've touched on before, is "Garbage Collection as a metaphor for Municipal Service".  Every grievance that someone has with public service comes back to garbage collection.  I've seen it as a metaphor for social decline, over taxation, under taxation, and civic apathy at both City Hall, and in your next door neighbour's house.    Tom Jakobek knows what lurks in the hearts of men.  Here's a block from Jakobek's speach to a "throng of supporters":  Service Delivery   We also need to re-invent how we deliver services to our citizens.  I'll give you one example - garbage collection. Some on Council believe we should simply privatize the operations. Others talk about reducing the garbage we have. Both sides have excellent points, but neither solves the systemic problems and additional costs associated with old methodologies and poor management.  Every week I put out my Blue Box, Grey Box, yard waste, and regular garbage. In some places, the city has added the "Green Torpedo". The result? Once a week, two, three or even four separate rear-end loaders, each with a crew of two, travel the same streets to the same houses. Talk about waste! That isn't efficient or sustainable.   When I become Mayor I will advocate for a single garbage pick up and central sorting plants. That will maximize our recycling, and thereby minimize the amount of garbage we produce.   This is integral to the health and future of our city, and I intend to make sure we do it right. It will also create jobs, rather than shipping money and our garbage south to Michigan.   We need to re-design our system, regardless of who picks up the garbage, and get rid of our antiquated system of collection.   I honestly have no idea what he is suggesting we do.    He would like a "single garbage pick up and central sorting plants"  I don't know what that means.  Is he suggesting we put all of the products into one vehicle and then sort it out later?  Is he suggesting that we buy a fleet of trucks that have 4 or 5 compartments in them to keep the recyclables seperate from the garbage?  I had to read this paragraph over 3 times looking for what his suggestion for improvement was.  It's not only unclear what a "single garbage pick up and central sorting plants" are, but also unclear how this suggestion would result in maximized recycling.  I'm sure glad he's running for mayor and not me.  I don't even speak the language.

       The Hulk   Over the course of the last few weeks, you may have noticed that a movie called "The Hulk" is coming out in theatres.  Soon.  My Girlfriend has noticed this movie coming out as well.  In the promos that we've watched on television and in the movies, she always has the same comment: "When the Hulk gets all angry, and beefs up, his shirt rips off.  Why do his pants stay on?"  I can't begin to speculate on my Girlfriend's facination with the Hulk's pants, or genitalia for that matter,  urlLink but I did find this , that should answer the question.

       Today at City Hall   If you were planning on stopping by Toronto City Hall today, or even Nathan Phillips Square for that matter, change your plans.  Now.  It is, as I found out when I went for a leisurely stroll at lunch, seniors day at City Hall.  There's 1500 geriatrics down there moving park benches into the shade, and complaining that the healthcare system that they gutted in the 80's is drastically underfunded now that they need it.    There is free food (for seniors), free tote bags (for seniors), free samples of products (for seniors), and free music (that only seniors would find entertaining).    The rotunda at City Hall is filled with information booths which feature seniors-versions of the services and communities that we all know and love.  There's: Senior Services from both the provincial and federal governments; the Toronto Association of Jewish Seniors; the Seniors Singles Association; the St. Clair West Seniors Association; the Canadian Seniors Advocacy Group....  and so on.  Even City Hall has opened its information and business counters so that seniors can wander up and complain about whatever their barely functioning hearts desire.  I listened to a woman standing at the "Pay Water Bills Here" counter as she rambled on and on about the park that's close to her house and how they should, in the wintertime, clear a path through the park where she walks every day because that's her only exercise you know, she doesn't get out much anymore and that little park is the only thing that she has to look forward to in the spirngtime, but in the winter it would be nice to walk through there too, but the snow is so high sometimes, I can't get out to shovel it anymore because my husband passed away and he usually did part of the driveway and now that I have to do it all its so tiring sometimes....  I think we all know how to make City Services better for seniors:   1.   Cater immediately to whatever their rotary-dial demands are, and do it with as little change as possible.   2.   Large, and complex ideas (like provincial and federal downloading of services) are difficult to understand, so they don't exist. 3.   Garbage should be collected at the same time every week.  If it's gone by 9:42 one week, it should be gone by 9:42 the next week. 4.   CFRB should be the national broadcaster. 5.   Teenagers are frightening.  They shouldn't be allowed to ride on buses or on the subway.  They're young, they can walk. 6.   The City shouldn't waste money on things like internet access in libraries, because no one uses those damn things anyway.  Even the cafeteria was filled with old people.  An entire line up of seniors buying small coffees and date squares.  "Do you have any squares that are smaller then that?  Those are so big!  No?  Why not?  Those are so big I don't see how anyone could finish one of them.  Well you should have smaller ones then."  Even stranger requests: "Could I have a small coffee please.  The mild, decaf roast.  And only fill it up halfway, and fill the rest of it with hot water".  I figure Starbucks could have that as their special Seniors Blend.  "It's Mild enough for what's left of your tastebuds, and won't irritate your colon".  Yes it was surreal.  Yes it was funny.  But what was most funny was the private security company, rent-a-cops that the organizers of the senior's event chose to hire.  Each of the two of them was clearly labled "Securcorp" on their chest and guns.    Guns.    Each of the two private security company personel had, presumably loaded, side arms.  Should there be a riot over the free Scotiabank totebags in Nathan Phillips Square today between 12:00 and 2:00, you can rest assured that old people will feel the behavior modifying sting of hot lead.  I like the idea.  Keeping old people in check ensures the saftey of all of us.

       Big Blogspot Brother   Whoa...The advertising that you see above this is completely dependant on what I am writing down here.    Not too long ago I had more then a few posts about the Toronto Mayoral election; the advertising above was for Barbara Hall, John Tory and David Miller mayoral websites.  My most recent posts have been about Iraq, WMD, and Guantanamo; the advertising is now links to "The Iraq Reconstruction Report".  I wonder, if I posted about nothing but marmalade for the next week, what would the advertising be?

       And Finally   The US might start trying and executing its disappeared prisoners in Guantanamo.  I say "might" because they have published their protocol for how trials would take place for the  urlLink prisoners .   urlLink This story  was linked on the Drudge Report this morning.  I don't think they really need to worry about building execution chambers for these people.  All they need to do is wait.    Apparently the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have been  urlLink trying to kill themselves .  Why?    Is it because they don't want to give their  urlLink American captors  the satisfaction of trying them?  Is it because their crazy religion believes there is glory in  urlLink self inflicted  martyrdom?  Is it because they hate freedom?  I doubt it.  I think it's because when you've been arrested and held without charge, and without any belief that you will ever get home, or see the world outside of your cage again, you tend to want to die.  I don't mean in the suburban teenaged angst, Morrissey-listening, pseudo-depression, random Emo band, kind of want-to-die.  I mean, want to die.    Funny.... urlLink Stockholm Syndrome  doesn't seem to be setting in with these people.  I can't imagine why.

       You guys remember this right?   Sort of interesting that it's happening now.  Remember when the US attacked and destroyed two Iranian oil rigs in 1987?  Neither did I.  Below is a rough breakdown of the case.   urlLink Here's a more thorough  breakdown of the case.  In 1992 Iran  urlLink applied to the International Court of Justice  to rule on an incident that took place in the Persian Gulf on the 19th of October, 1987.    Does the date sound familiar?  It should.  It was "Black Monday" in the Western world; the 1987 stock market crash.  Iran claims that the United States Navy, contacted the oil rigs after one of their ships had been hit by a mine.  The navy gave the rigs 20 minutes and then open fire with torpedoes and large bore guns.  Two oil rigs were destroyed.  The US claims it had a right to act in self defense after being attacked by a mine that was in the water.  The US claims that Iran mined the water.  Iran claims that Iraq mined the water during the Iran/Iraq war.  The case has bounced around alot.  There have been orders, and counter suits, and statutes of limitations, and time restrictions.  In the last few weeks of February of this year, the court finally heard the case.  As of March 7th, the court has been in deliberations about the case.  That was 3 months ago, and there will be a decision soon.  Just thought you should know.  I'll post the judgement when it happens.  Do a straw poll of those around you.  Do they remember when the US destroyed two Iranian oil rigs?  I mean....I was 10 years old at the time so I don't recall if it was a big news event or not.  But you might think that it would be referred to every now and again.  The annexing of Poland, and the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand seem to pop up in conversation fairly regularily, you'd think this would too.

       A Digitally Enhanced Photograph   Here's your weekend homework assignment:  Write a short fan fiction piece using the people below as characters.      I'll get you started:   Erik knew about the competition.    The night before, he had dramatically hung Pavla's picture just behind till number 3.  He glanced knowingly at each of his counter crew: Jan, Radek, Ivan, Jarka and then back to Jan.    Erik knew, when Pavla died the way she did, that one or all of them, were somehow responsible.  He had employed a highly competitive counter crew; carefully selecting each of them for their pitbull-like taste for blood.    Now that Pavla had died, or more accurately, been murdered, he knew that the competition was in full swing.

       Well at least they've got their priorities straight   The Americans complain that Canada's policies, and  urlLink Canadian governmental agencies  are anti-american.

Sure there may be international terrorist organizations out there, but that's not the real problem....it's those damned hippie, punk, KIDS, who we have to watch out for.

       The good people at McSweeney's   Specifically in this case John Warner, has provided a few tips to make us all better writers.     Tip No. 1: Make your characters round, not flat.   It's important that we recognize the complexity of the human psyche when we construct our characters. Rare is the person who is all good, or all bad for that matter. The truth is, we are a mix of many different, and oftentimes contradictory traits that are in constant conflict with each other.   Consider the following two passages, and how seemingly slight changes can add nuance and mystery to a character.    "Sister Jane walked down the alleyway. Her habit scraped the filthy ground as she grasped hands with the tiny street urchins, giving them her blessing. At the end of the block, she knelt down, bowed her head and prayed to God to deliver sustenance to these poor souls."    Vs.    "Sister Jane walked down the alleyway. Her habit scraped the filthy ground as she grasped hands with the tiny street urchins, giving them her blessing. At the end of the block, she looked both ways before driving a boot into the ribs of a passing stray puppy."    Now, honestly, which of these passages makes you want to read on?

       Read this one all the way through   Each line  urlLink provides a little bit  more information, and the last line is a really strange punchline to a twisted joke.  I guess I was just supprised that someone could be charged with "outraging public decency and public morals" in Oklahoma, let alone  anywhere .  Is that the most subjective sounding criminal offence in the book, or can you be charged with "doing something that isn't right" in Oklahoma as well?

       Found   I'll keep an eye on  urlLink this one .  It's good enough right now, but it looks like they update it fairly regularily.  It might deserve to be over there in the "Other Routes" section...  I think this magazine's existance is the very definition of "Postmodern".  The "Notes" page is probably the best.  Nothing encompases emotion quite as well as a hastily written note, stuck under the wiperblade of someone's car.  "You get  one  more shot at this Blane.  You  ever  hang up on me again and you will  never  see me again.  Be a man."

       Enough time has passed, that I can finally talk about it   Something happened to me about 2 weeks ago.  It affected me deeply, and may have changed my life forever.  I had hoped to block it out, but since my girlfriend keeps asking me to tell the story, I might as well recant it here.  Perhaps this will finally clense me of the horror that wakes me from my sleep even now.  We were driving up to her cottage, on a moonless spring night.  It was about 11:00 and we'd been driving for 3 hours. We needed to stop and get a coffee.    There's an intersection where two lonely Ontario highways cross, and at that intersection there is a "Coffee Time".  Anyone living in Southwestern Ontario knows as true as the sun shines outside, that Coffee Time is the shittiest of the 3 regional coffee chains; this story only adds to its list of misdeeds.  I noticed the empty parking space by the door first.  It was late so I was supprised to see 3 other cars in the unpaved lot.  As we pulled into the space, I turned to notice the car beside us had two people in it.  A young couple like ourselves who had purchased their food and had chosen to eat it in the car, instead of in the brightly lit resturaunt.  One could only wonder why they had made that decision.  I looked at the window of the coffee shop.  Then I turned to my girlfriend.  "I'm not going in there".  Puzzled, she finally saw what what had caught my gaze, and frozen my body.  It was a clown.  It was 11:00 on a Saturday night.  At a crossroads in the middle of absolutely nowhere.  An hour to the nearest town in any direction.  And there, in that Coffee Time, sat a man with a bright red wig, full face paint,  urlLink colourful  overalls, gigantic red shoes, and a red nose.  He was  urlLink overweight , and the sweat from his hard,  urlLink clown , life had begun to run the black and white makup from his forehead.  He knew I was staring in horror, so he  urlLink stared at me  from his table under the unnatural flourescent lights.  I hadn't just pulled off the road and into a parking lot, I had made a left turn out of reality and into the horrors of a childhood  urlLink nightmare .  We walked in.  Naturally I let my girlfriend open the door and go in first, I followed her in, always keeping her between the clown and myself.  If he was going to jump up from the table and rip one of us apart with his greasy clown teeth, by god, it was going to be her.  The only trace that I would leave would be a thin puddle of urine, and the faint sounds of my screams in the distance.  As we stood at the counter and ordered I could feel his dark, makeup covered eyes boring through my spine and directly into my soul.  I could hear his wiskey tainted voice in my head: "Hey kid.  Try the Boston Cream.  I made them myself..."  The most terrifying part of the experience, was simply not knowing why he was there.  Any kid's party that he would have been at, must have been over by at least 3 hours.  There were no other clowns, so there was probably no convention, or circus in the area, and any man who would have had a clown at his bachelor party, probably shouldn't be getting married.  No.  The only explaination was that we had stumbled upon the restaurant, where children's nightmares have their coffee before heading off to work for another night.  If we had stayed longer a big hairy monster, a school of phiranas and Colonel Sanders would have shown up, ordered double doubles, and sat with the clown to "talk shop" before their shift started.  But there was no way that I was sticking around to watch that.

       Nunziata thinks you are too fat   If you could write an opinion column for the Toronto Star, what would it be about?  City Hall scandals?  Declining civic pride?  Federal and Provincial downloading of services?  What if you were also running for mayor?  What would your opinion column be about then?  Your vision for the future?  Your plan to address various problems?  How about something specific like "We must develop the waterfront" or "Public Transit needs to a priority"?  If you were John Nunziata, you would use that  urlLink unique opportunity  to wax holier-then-thou about marathon running, weight loss, and your pathetic baby boomer mid life crisis.  I dare you to read it.  It was published on  urlLink Wednesday  in the Toronto Star.  The rantings of a reformed fat person aside, where does this misuse of public soap boxes end?  If Mr. Nunziata discovers the spiritual awakenings of Scientology, or miraculous increase in sexual potency provided by shark cartilage, will he thrust that upon us as well?  Will there be a "Wonders of Ginseng Root Festival" in the City of Toronto.  Thanks for sharing John.  We're all just proud as pickles that you've decided to be heart-smart.  I suppose when you become mayor and make homelessness illegal, you won't have to jump over anyone in the gutter during your morning jog.

       The Johns talk trash    urlLink Nunziata  on Waste Management (for Toronto Community News).  Question 1) As mayor, would you support the use of the Adam's Mine in northern Ontario as a means of managing Toronto's waste? Why or why not?   Answer: If it were a choice between Adam's Mine and continuing to ship our garbage to Michigan, I would choose Adam's Mine because we need a made in Ontario solution. I do not support sending our garbage out of the province. The incident earlier this year when the "mad cow" disease scare closed the US border to our waste for a day, and the fact that several environmental groups in Michigan don't want our waste, clearly shows that we can't be sure that the borders will remain open. Besides, polluting our air and clogging our highways by sending 180 trucks a day down the QEW simply doesn't make any environmental sense.    Question 2) What are the most practical and affordable improvements to the system you see being implemented in the next term of government?   Answer: The green bin program is a huge success in Etobicoke. We should accelerate the roll out of this program throughout the entire city as soon as possible. The city has embarked on a process to assess new waste management technologies. Companies have been invited to submit proposals. I support this process. We should incorporate the best practices from around the world in the Toronto waste program. We should also increase opportunities for owners and tenants of apartment buildings to participate more fully in recycling efforts. As mayor, I will also lead the effort to enact long overdue regulations to reduce excessive packaging. I support the goals and initiatives of the Waste Diversion Task Force.     Question 3) Please share your long-term vision regarding waste management for the entire city. Where should we be in 15-20 years?    Answer: By 2010 we can and must achieve the goal of the Waste Diversion Task Force to divert 100% of our waste from landfill. This will be one of my top priorities as Mayor. I will appoint a senior person in the mayor's office to be responsible for making sure that everything the city can do to meet our waste diversion targets gets the priority it deserves. This is the kind of legacy we need to leave for our children and grandchildren.  (Prepared for Toronto Community News July 14 2003)     urlLink Tory  on Waste Management (for Toronto Community News)  Q. As mayor, would you support the use of the Adams Mine in Northern Ontario as a means of managing Toronto's waste? Why or why not?    A. It's time we stopped talking about dealing with our waste problems and started doing something about them. Other major cities in the world deal with waste, we should, too. I will not send our garbage to Adams Mine nor am I in favour of trucking it down to Michigan. These are not long-term, responsible solutions. I support new technologies and rolling out recycling programs faster as a made-in-Toronto approach to dealing with waste.    Q. What are the most practical and affordable improvements to the system you see being implemented in the next term of government?    A. New technologies. Cities around the world are using new technologies as a way to deal with waste and it's time for Toronto to catch up. We need to adopt and adapt what others are doing and get moving. We also need to look within our borders. The Etobicoke green bin program is a great example of a program that works. It is exactly the type of thing I support and believe should be implemented citywide.    Q. Please share your long-term vision regarding waste management for the entire city. Where should we be in 15 to 20 years?    A. In 15 to 20 years, we should not be shipping anything outside the City of Toronto. We should be dealing with our waste right here. Toronto should have a leading-edge recycling program and be a centre for green technology. I look forward to the year 2015 when we will have people coming to Toronto to study the world's most effective waste management system. For that to happen, we need action now. It's time to get moving.

       Ben and Jen    Does anyone know the plot of "Gigli"? I was watching the previews on TV and I couldn't exactly pin down what the movie was about. I got the feeling that J-Lo was some kind of gangster woman, maybe Al Pacino's daughter, and that Ben was a hired hitman, or possibly mob enforcer.   Apparently, J-Lo plays a lesbian mob assassin. Ben plays a hired hitman.   I'm genuinely torn as to what the funniest part of this movie will be:   1. That they digitally un-hanced J-Lo's booty for the promotional pictures. Her ass is represented as significantly smaller then real life.  2. Ben and J-Lo fell in love during the filming of this thing. This love resulted in their marriage and guaranteed sexual performance (on Ben's part) pre-nuptial agreement.  3. Al Pacino is in it.  4. J-Lo plays a lesbian who turns straight for Ben.  5. J-Lo's character attempts to  urlLink seduce  Affleck's character by lying on the bed, legs open and saying: "It's turkey time. Come on. Gobble, gobble."  6. Christopher Walken is in it.  7. Gigli is the name of Ben's character, not J-Lo's.  (This post was edited.  I found out how to spell "Gigli" properly.  Haven't seen it yet thought....)

       Whoa!   Let's settle the fuck down here people.  No one needs to bring a gun to a  urlLink City Council  meeting, let alone shoot it.  What was he pissed off about?  Municipal zoning ordinances?  Harmonized property assessment proposals?  Library funding?  Seriously, I get all excited about municipal politics (I watched an hour and a half of live City Council debate last night after I got home).  But after all the debating is done; after all the lobbysts have gone home; after all the clerks have tallied the votes, ammendments, and referrals back to staff; there's nothing  really  that exciting.  Well....not exciting enough to bring a gun to the festivities.  I guess what really blows my mind is that a guy, in the States, not only after 9/11 but actually  in  the city that was the target of the 9/11 attacks, managed to get a gun into a public building.  I was under the impression that casual body-cavity searches are an American staple in this era of every-one-is-a-suspected-terrorist-untill-they-prove-themselves-patriotic.  But then....in a land where carrying a loaded firearm in public  is  patriotic, how else could this scenario possibly have played itself out?  I suppose I shouldn't be so dismissive about how passionate people get about local issues.  Not too long ago, this City banned grass clippings from transfer stations and from the residential waste stream.  People who, for years, had set out 8-10 plastic bags a week, filled with the grass, were asked to leave the clippings on their lawn.  Most residents caught on fairly quickly and realized that it was for the best.  One short sighted individual, packed up his 8-10 bags of grass clippings, put them in his pick-up truck, and drove them to our office, where he proceeded to yell at the receptionist about how he thought the ban was stupid, told her that he had nowhere else to take his grass, and left them at her desk.  He left shortly after that.  I'm sure on the way home he realised what a futile and pointless gesture that was.  I'm sure he meant to appologize for his childish outburst, but probably forgot.  I'm also sure that, given the choice, he would have preferred to bring a gun to our office to prove his point.    Thank God we live in Canada.

       David Miller   It's been a couple of weeks since I have been to  urlLink his site , but David Miller has redesigned, and generally improved his mayoral website.  I hope that his  urlLink Policies and Issues  section will grow over the course of the campaign.  Miller is clearly the "TTC candidate", and I think he'll be recognized for that.  I just hope that he doesn't pigeon-hole his campaign to that issue alone.  He's got 3 councillors who support him directly (Bussin, Johnston, and Pantalone), and a few others who have written letters of  urlLink recommendation  and support.  Most notably, famed  urlLink urban planning  theorist  urlLink Jane Jacobs  who writes:   Jane Jacobs  Letter to supporters January 2003  I'm working for David Miller because I believe this is the most crucial election in Toronto's recent history. Left and right stereotypes are irrelevant because David understands that, as he says, "the city can't work socially unless it works economically". What he has already accomplished tells us how much David can achieve in the years ahead:  - David Miller fought for the public inquiry we now have into the scandalous MFP computer leasing deal.  - David Miller is a leader in the campaign against the Island bridge and expanded airport, which will destroy this City's waterfront heritage.  - When TTC fares were raised, David Miller came up with a plan for companies, hospitals, and schools to get cheaper rates when they buy TTC passes in bulk.   The time has come for new ideas, a new way of conducting business, even for a new generation of politicians. I support David Miller wholeheartedly and with great personal enthusiasm. I believe he is the only person with a coherent vision of Toronto's future, with the ability to do what needs to be done, and the energy and will to do it.

       Guess the Spin   Here's  urlLink the story :    MOSUL, Iraq (AP)  - Saddam Hussein's sons Odai and Qusai were killed in a six-hour firefight today when U.S. forces, acting on a tip from an Iraqi informant, surrounded and then stormed a palatial villa in this northern Iraqi town, a senior American general said.    The story goes on to describe how the four individuals that were in the house (all of whom were found dead after the fight), were: Odai, Qusai, Qusai's teenage son, and a bodyguard.  I can't exactly put money on the following statement, but it'll be interesting to see if I'm right or wrong.  I believe, at the time of this writing, that it will soon be revealed that either Qusai or the bodyguard, shot Qusai's teenaged son.

       Whoa!  Hey Now!   Now, far be it for me to drag up the past (reprint from a story in February about OMG media being linked to  urlLink Montreal mobster Vito Rizzuto ).    At the time, in this City, the OMG contract was slated to be the next MFP scandal.  Who would have thought that organized crime would be involved in waste management.  I think all bets are off today.  Torstar, the publishing group who owns the  urlLink Toronto Star, announced that it would buy OMG  and all assets.  Torstar owns toronto.com, workopolis.com, regional papers like the KW Record and the Hamilton Spectator, and of course Harlequin book publishing.  Check out  urlLink eharlequin.com : "Your online destination for all things romantic".  So what are the implications?  Torstar indicates that the deal is attractive because it is essentially an advertising contract.  The City, however, still needs to maintain a contract with a company who will install, repair, and sell ad space on, these bins.  More details about the deal should be released in September.  Perhaps they could rebrand the OMG containers: "Your curbside destination for all things trashy"

       The Rogue vs. The Daughter   So it's  urlLink down to two .  Martin vs. Copps.  As much as I love comparing Shelia to a horse, I don't think she has any chance of being recognized as a dark horse in this race.  Actually I kind of get the feeling that it was either her or Manley that was going to bow out; Manley just got to it first.  Aparently Manley, and Copps, are both in financial trouble in this campaign.  Both have had to make cutbacks to staff and spending in order to get themselves to this point.  Martin however has raised about  urlLink 6 Million  so far, according to the National Post.  It's about 10:00 now so Manley should just be finishing his statements.  I'm sure the online papers will have more details soon.

       They do it in Vancouver   It's the new  urlLink alchemy  I suppose.  Turning anything into oil.  It's  double  alchemy to turn something  into  oil AND make garbage disappear.  The other "new alchamy" is making oil disappear.  I know that one of the main pushes in microbiology research is to find bacteria that will metabolize crude oil.  So perhaps, one day, we'll be able to produce garbage, turn it into oil, load that oil into barges, and when those barges break apart at sea, we can unleash bacteria to eat the oil.

Maybe I'm a lazy little computer snob, but I really believe that ALL candidates who are running for any post should have a website.  It doesn't have to be updated on a daily basis, or even at all.  Just give me a place where I can go and read about your platform, read where you stand on the issues, and read how you express your ideas.

       The litter alphabet   I just finished writing a lengthy memo to my director.

       Oh thank God.   Frequent  urlLink masturbation  you say?  Particularily in the early 20's?  When studies like this are released they're usually something like "Red wine lowers your risk of heart attack if consumed moderately".  It leads to people, like my parents, to say things like "Well, that IS good news.  We should make a point of drinking a glass of red wine each night at dinner."  Now....I can't imagine a guy, particularily in his early 20's, saying: "Frequent masturbation will lower my risk of prostate cancer?  Wow, I guess I had better start masturbating more".  What would probably leap to mind is "I'm not sure how I can, without injuring myself or my loved ones, masturbate  more  then I do now."  The study could not have come at a better time of course.  This summer is apparently one of the worst in years for youth employment, which means that there's a lot of guys out there, in their early 20's, who have nothing to do all summer but watch " urlLink The View " and jerk off.

       Heh    urlLink The Bush administration  predicts record $455,000,000,000.00 deficit.  In words that is "a four hundred and fifty five billion dollar deficit".  The funny part is that, that is the amount they've over spent  for this year alone .  By next year they say it will be up to $475 Billion.  Naturally they have a fiscal plan to reduce the deficit to $226 Billion by 2008.  It might be worth it to suggest at this point that the Bush administration's financial strategy for the US is flawed at the absolute best.    They cite "the war on terrorism" for the massive overspending.  If the American people buy that argument, they'll easily be led to believe that the Bush administration's hands were tied, and they had no choice but to go to war with Iraq.  I can hear Bush at the podium now:  "We didn't ask to be attacked on 9/11.  That's when this all started.  We had a financial plan that set the country on a track of prosperity, but because they attacked us, we were forced to defend ourselves.  Defence costs a lot of money, but we had no choice but to spend it.  Iraq was simply an extension of the war on terrorism.  We weren't even given the choice 'should we attack Iraq or not', that choice was already made for us on 9/11 by those terrorists.  It's the terrorists' fault that we are overspent."  And of course there's this.  "We gave him a chance to allow the inspectors in, and he wouldn't let them in."  From an  urlLink article in Salon  today.  The author points out that Bush thinks the world gave Hussein a chance to re-admit the arms inspectors to Iraq, and it was Hussein who refused to admit them to the country.  Remember when that happened?  I know it was a few months ago but surely you remember when Hussein made his impassioned speech to the world, defying the United Nations and insisting that any UN weapons inspector who set foot on Iraqi soil will be shot dead and publicly eviscerated on the spot.  Remember that?  Remember when all that happened?  Yeah,  urlLink neither do I .  But Bush remembers.  His memory is quite clear "We gave him a chance to allow the inspectors in, and he wouldn't let them in."  Which leaves the question open: "What does the world look like through George Bush's eyes?  What does George Bush believe happened in the world over the past year?"  The American people are the first people in history to elect a semi-retarded man as their representative.  They should be commended for giving mentally challenged people a chance to step forward and show that they can do a super job.

       Rankings   Our email/calendar/scheduling application at work is a product from Novell called  urlLink Groupwise.   It's pretty handy, and it does the same stuff that things like Outlook do.  In the address book feature, there's a list of "frequent contacts".  People you write to, copy to, or receive email from often, are all tallied with the number of "references" that they generate.  I write to my girlfriend alot, so after 2 years here, it's not supprising that there are 3090 references beside her name.  I've either writen to, copied, or recieved email from her about 3100 times over the course of 2 years.  Here's the breakdown of my top 5 most referred people in my frequent contacts list:  1.  My girlfriend (3090). 2.  Her sister (375). 3.  A friend of mine from highschool (215). 4.  My mother (117). 5.  Me (160).  Me.  I have written to myself more often then I have to  anyone  that I actually work with.    To be fair, it's my address at home that I've written to so many times.  I forward emails home to answer them there, or email spreadsheets or documents that I'm working on home.

       Treasonous Dogs!!     urlLink LONDON (AFP)  - Two thirds of British voters feel Prime Minister Tony Blair misled them over the case for launching a war in Iraq, according to a poll in the Daily Mirror newspaper.   Sixty-six percent of those questioned in the ICM Research poll said the prime minister had misled them -- whether on purpose or not -- over the reasons for going to war.   Twenty seven percent said they believed Blair knowingly misled the British people, while 39 percent said the prime minister had misled them, but not knowingly.   Over a third, 35 percent, said that their confidence in Blair had decreased as a result of his handling of the the confrontation with Iraq.   How can they possibly say this?  This must mean that 66% of Britons are "with" the terrorists.  How could they not support their Prime Minister in a time like this?  How could they question his authority and call for him to be accountable in this, a time of war.  Dissent happens, it just happens way too late.

       Summer Employment   I think things are as rough up here as they are in  urlLink the states  with respect to finding a summer job.  The City got some money through a federal "SARS relief" grant to hire summer students with.  I've just finished hiring a small group of students to help out with some departmental policy change shenanigans.  I wasn't looking forward to interviews because we were hiring to start in the 2nd week of July.  I thought "What kind of 'quality' of student are we going to get for this job?  Surely all of the 'good' ones will have found jobs about 2 months ago".    I asked each one as they came in "how's the job market this summer" and every one of them said it was the worst they'd seen in a few years.  One said she'd been to a number of interviews already and had even had potential employers phone her back and tell her "the positions have been canceled".  Everyone seems to be chalking this up to SARS.  I hope that's the only reason.

       Another John   This space will generally refer only to mayoral candidates with websites.  I think anyone running for mayor  should  have a website, but what do I know.  As such, I should have let the third John running for mayor weigh in on the subject of crime in our City.  He has a "website", and if  urlLink you go there now , you'll understand why I used the quotes.  John Jahshan on crime:  Our crime rate is increasing, the morale of Toronto' Police Officers is at an all-time low, and cheap handguns are killing kids. To reverse this trend we should: - Ensure that our firefighters and police officers are equipped with state-of-the-art technology.  - Promote community-policing programs,   - Promote domestic violence rapid response teams.  - Support zero tolerance policies for guns and drugs on school campuses.  - Toughen penalties for domestic violence.   I like the "state-of-the-art technology" thing.  Perhaps if he's elected he'll buy me a computer that doens't crash every time I try to load a GIS program.

       Playing to Emotions   John Nunziata is  urlLink leading a protest  outside a halfway house in the west end of Toronto.  Both he and Tory are strongly advocating  urlLink crime prevention  by "kicking out" criminals.  This from John Tory's statement on his " urlLink Criminals Out " policy: Tory will put 400 more police officers on the street in order to reverse the personnel shortage, to mount an effective broken window strategy and to address a number of specific crime problems. He will lead a campaign to let police make more effective use of DNA samples of convicted criminals, including sex offenders, on file. He will seek a national sex-offender registry with teeth, one that requires offenders to wear GPS bracelets during their parole and possibly even longer. He will call for a moratorium on the placement of sex offenders in Toronto. And he will work with police and other local agencies to shut down the crack houses, dope grow houses and fortified buildings that are at the heart of the citys drug trade.   Other elements of the Criminals Out plan include inisisting   on the enforcement of deportation orders against people who have committed crimes, increasing school and schoolyard safety, curtailing panhandler and squeegie activity, curbing dangerous driving and rolling back the fee increases charged to community groups for the use of playing fields and other public spaces.   Nunziata wants to keep criminals out of Toronto as well.  Two  urlLink press releases  which outline his  urlLink feelings  on this issue.  He  urlLink even hopped in a police cruiser  for the night shift at 42 Division, "one of the toughest in the city" according to his website.  I'm sure both Johns have some suggestions as to what to do with criminals instead of integrating them back into society, which is the function of a halfway house.  Perhaps they advocate leaving them in prison for the full duration of their sentence?  Perhaps they will bar anyone with a criminal record from living or even entering Toronto?  Either way, the message is clear: They do not want the people of the City of Toronto to pay for, or deal with criminals.  What a wondrous utopia we have waiting for us if we only vote "John" in November.  Don't get me wrong, I'm worried about people like Holly Jones' killer living in, and killing in, our City.  It would, however, have been an equally great tragedy if he was forced to live outside of the City limits and found another little girl to kill and dismember.  But then, it would have been another City's problem, and not ours.    I find both of the John's policies, regarding crime prevention, lacking in their explanation of the long term strategy.  Both policies raise additional questions.

       Another Candidate for Mayor   Do you know Bob Kerr?  You probably do if you've ever been on the sidewalk at Yonge and Bloor.  He's the guy standing infront of a small amp, microphone in hand, singing about whatever comes into his head.  He's running for Mayor of Toronto, again.  CityPulse did a story on him a couple of nights ago for their Livable City segment.  Here's the introduction:  Ben Kerr Singer-Songwriter Aired: Wednesday, July 9th   Let's make Toronto number one ... sing along ... you've heard the song. The singer-songwriter is Ben Kerr, the busker who's been a fixture on Yonge and Bloor AND on the campaign trail for Toronto Mayor since 1985.  He's called a fringe candidate, but it doesn't bug him because Ben Kerr is still confident he can sing his way to City Hall.  One thing he insists can help get him there is cayenne pepper. Ben says it really is the spice of life: a true pick-me-up and good for the sex life. In fact, if elected, Ben Kerr says he'd serve it at council meetings AND would spread the word about cayenne to Toronto, making it the sexiest city in the world.  We caught up with Ben Kerr, where else ..., at Yonge and Bloor.

       Motive   Time for blame again.    Why would people want to go into their workplace and  urlLink kill their co-workers ?  Why would children want to  urlLink kill other children at school ?  Who would want to  urlLink kill a family  and why?  Video games, race, movies, money, emulation, hate, love, apathy, mental illness, world events, divorce, children, secrets, television, latent homosexuality, blatent homosexuality, isolation, heavy metal music, religion, sociopathy, misunderstanding, theft, anger, desire, greed.....  Pick one.  Any one you pick will make as much sense for explaining these stories as any other.

       My 26th Birthday   "The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb. The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant  urlLink quantities of uranium from Africa . Our  urlLink intelligence sources  tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities.  urlLink He clearly has much to hide ."

       The Jehovah's Witnesses   I received a call tonight as I was watching television.  The man on the other end of the line asked for my name, and I assured him that he had the right person.  He then asked "Are you the same man who was in the Jehovah's Witnesses in London, Ontario".  Now, what you have to understand at this point is that I am good friends with two twin actors from London, Ontario.  One or both of them usually start their phone calls in character, and then ask leading questions like "Sir, I am calling from the League for the Appreciation of Young Sheep.  We have you in our records as the longest serving member in your district.  What time would you be available to accept your award?  Then wed laugh and laugh, and have a grand old time.  Naturally I assumed that it was one of them on the other end of the line.  Grinning away I listened as he asked me "Sir my name is Herb Evershed and I have your records here from your church in London, and I was wondering if I could forward your information on to the Bishop whose ward you live in...."   I couldn't wait any longer.  "WRONG!! I yelled, Bishops don't have wards!!"  Clearly doing his best job of acting surprised at my outburst he said "Uh....I see.  What do Bishops have?"  Giddy now, I giggled "They have......conferences!"  He said "Well, um, no you're wrong on that matter.  They do have wards.  Are you currently interested in being affiliated with the church?"  Surprised at how long he was willing to carry the joke I rolled my eyes and said "Yes??  He then told me that he'd be happy to send some missionaries around to my house to talk to me about my interest in membership.  Gradually it started to occur to me that it might not be a flaxen-haired twin actor on the other end of the line.  Missionaries?  It was carrying the joke even far for their taste.  And did I hear children in the background?  "I can send a pair of Missionaries over sometime this week if you'd like.  Can I have your address?"  "Uh....no, I am not willing to provide that information"  "Ok I see then.  You are interested in being affiliated with the church though right?"  I took a long pause.  "Yes?"  Sheepishly this time.  "Ok then, I do hope you will be patient with them and that you are willing to speak with them....Thank you."  I did something I haven't done in a while: I pressed *69 on my phone and scrambled for a pencil.  If it was their phone number I could start planning my revenge.  Perhaps calling their work, looking for the twins who screwed my girlfriend at a party they were catering.  The robot at Bell gave me the phone number that had just called me, and I did a " urlLink reverse telephone lookup " online.    Turns out, the number is listed to an Evershed, H.  He lives in Etobicoke, with what are presumably his wife and children.  He has a record from a church in London that bears my name.  If this is indeed a prank, it's a very elaborate one that involves either, a fake entry in the Bell database, or a fake church record in London, Ontario.  If not, then I may be visited by two Jehovah's witnesses some time this week.

       Now let me tell you a story   'Bout a man named  urlLink Jed . Poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed. Then one day while he was shootin' at some food. Up from the ground came a-bubblin' crude.  Oil that is. Black Gold. Texas Tea.  Well next thing you know old Jed's a millionaire. Kin-folk said "Jed move away from there" "Californiee is the place to be" So he picked up his family and he moved to Beverley.  Hills that is. Swimming pools. Movie Stars.  I'm proud/embarassed to say that those lyrics came straight from memory.

       The internet   There's a statement about the internet that has stuck with me:   "The internet is a place where people can bask in pure, unadulterated earnestness. "    The link that followed that statement was  urlLink this one .  I'm sure you've seen it, or seen parts of it before.  The long and the short, is that it's the webpage of a man who likes to dress as Peter Pan.  Would we have access to this man's obsession in any other form?  Without the internet he'd have to have a TV show, or write a book, or be featured in a magazine article; and even then we'd only have him for 15 minutes of his fame.  But now, what would have been done in private for most of his life, can be displayed prominently for all the world to see.  He can now take pride, and bask in the earnestness of his creation.    For all the "bad" comments about the internet, the one, general "good" comment, is that it's a global forum for the exchange of ideas.  Here's a site that breaks that down to its most basic structure.   urlLink Halfbakery.com  is (I presume) a site for "half baked" ideas.  You can post your own idea, and the viewers will discuss improvements or criticisms of your idea.   urlLink I've linked to  one of the best ideas I saw on the site.  A friend and I once decided that the term "fuckin' a hole in her leg" is a phrase that  sounds  like a metaphor, but really isn't at all.  Kind of like "Well....That's the Pope for ya." is the ultimate punchline to a joke that doesn't exist.  There's another statement about the internet that's stayed with me a lot.  And while I won't transcribe it here, you can  urlLink watch it for yoruself  anytime.  "I mean James, the internet is a place where absolutely nothing happens.  So you need to take advantage of that"

       The dark ages    urlLink Bush says  that he supports the "notion that marriage is between a man and a woman."  He would like the lawyers to take a look at the recent US Supreme Court ruling that struck down State "anti-sodomy" laws, before he will decide if a constitutional ammendment is necessary to prevent homosexual unions.  The Supreme Court has essentially said to the States "it is unconstitutional for you to legislate what occurs between two consenting adults in the privacy of the home".  For the States to punish offences like "sodomy", the States are essentially legislating morality.  One has to consider 'What is the greater public impact of two adults engaging in consentual anal sex'.  Is the public adversely affected by two men or two women having sex?  What could the argument be?  "If two men engage in sex with each other, they are not engaging in reproductive sex, and therefore not furthering the population"?  "Two men who engage in sex are more likely to rob a bank when they're finished"?  We don't live in the dark ages any longer, so the argument can't simply be "We don't want men having sex with men because it's wrong and God doesn't like it"?  The most confusing thing about this debate is that one side's argument is missing.  On the contrary, one could argue that when a majority elects representation, they then allow that representation to both govern, and apply morals to the whole.  So regardless of the arguments for and against, one could say that the American people have already chosen how they wish to be governed (both temporally and morally) because they chose Bush, and also a Republican congress.  The American system is set up to allow for previous administrations to continue to apply morals, and direct the course of the country's laws.  Chief Justice Renquist, and Justice Scalia were appointed by the Regan administration.  Clarance Thomas, by the first Bush administration, and Ginsburg and Breyer were appointed by the Clinton administration.  The effects of previous administrations are felt for decades after their departure from the platform.  There is a lot of talk now about who the second Bush administration will  urlLink choose to replace  "soon-to-be-retiring" justices O'Connor and Renquist.  Now the final catch, is while the Supreme Court decisions can change the laws in a country they can be later reviewed and possibly overturned (most recently has been the possibility of revisiting the Roe v. Wade decision which allowed abortions to be performed).  What are the implications if the Bush administration actually decides to interpret the morals of the Constitution of the United States.  If Congress, the Senate and the President are all of one mind then they might change the constitution to "clarify" the definition of marraige.  There'll be lots more to watch for.

       A Job from my Boss   I just about sat on a piece of paper that my boss had left on my chair for me to find.  It was a job posting, and he had written "M.  Please See Me. N."    I should clarify:  He actually wrote "M." and "N." for our names, I wasn't just censuring the script to keep these postings anonymous.  I kind of like this idea of shortening our names to a single letter.  It makes me feel like I'm working with the Men in Black.  I knew about the job opening, because it's in the office where I first worked in the City.  The "budget analyst" is leaving, and they are re-classifying the job (something he'd campaigned for while he was in the job).  My boss said "I would have no problem if you'd like to apply for that position".  Now there's a pickle.  What the hell is my boss trying to say?    "Please apply for the job because I think you'd be better suited for something else based on the work you've done here?"  or "Don't feel like I am trying to hold you here, I'd like you to apply for any job you wish without fear that you will receive a poor reference from me?"  I'm pretty sure it's the latter, but there's a lot of second guessing...

       911   The telephone number, not the infamous date.  I've called 911 every Saturday for the past 3 weeks.  1) Automobile accident.  A woman involved asked for an ambulance.  It was the first time I'd ever called 911.  2) Litterbin on fire.  On the corner of the intersection where I live, one of the metal bins was smoking.  I called and waited, and watched as people would touch the hot metal after I told them "it's on fire".  At least 3 people touched the bin, all men, all after I'd said "Careful buddy, it's on fire".  3) Drunk suicidal woman.  She was lying in the middle of Dundas trying to get hit by a car.  She asked me "Do you think it'll hurt when the car hits me?"  I figure if I don't witness anything this coming Saturday, they're going to call me just to make sure everything is fine.  I know none of those things are frivelous but there's still a little bit of second guessing that goes along with a 911 call.  I thought "Is this really an emergency?  Does it warrent tying up the line?"   urlLink This guy  called 911 about 900 times in 2 months.  I'm not on track to beat that record, so I guess I'm safe.

       Did you just hear someone whispering?   This is a compare and contrast post.  I'm not trying to prove anything here.  Medical studies, especially those picked up by the press, are generally of two varieties:   a) "This thing that you, and thousands like you do, every day will kill you very shortly"; or   b) "This thing that you thought was really bad is actually OK, or even good for you".    Both of those statements are usually the product of the publication, and not of the study itself or the research conclusions.   urlLink This one  is just another to add to the pile.    But you know what they say:  "At least when you're Schizophrenic, you have the humid encompasing love of Jesus Christ who fenulcates all of the growing sides of wonderment to the glorious level of the patriots who only listen to the cries of the smallest of the creatures who walk the sidewalks and sidewinders of the planetary injuncturement"

       Who will champion the concrete?   Which of our mayoral candidates will step up to the task?  Which one of our mayoral candidates will stop talking about intangible ideals like "integrity" and "cost cutting" and actually examine how City services are provided to citizens?  This City has ageing infrastructure.  There are pipes and sewers under your feet that are a hundred years old.  There are light standards that are crumbling.  There are TTC tracks so warped that streetcars crawl through sections to avoid being derailed.  Which of our mayoral candidates will address these issues?  Here's John Tory:  Decline of Toronto  Im running for mayor of Toronto because I am sad and angry about the physical decline in our city. I believe this decline is caused, in part, by a dysfunctional system of government at all levels. We need new arrangements, new action and new leadership if Canadas cities are to remain our countrys engine of growth.   City Infrastructure  "If people who need it can't find affordable housing, if adequate public transit isn't available, or if sewer and water systems and other vital infrastructure are allowed to crumble, it will ultimately lead to a breakdown of our cities." He's angry (and sad) about the physical decline of our city.  He doesn't happen to mention how this physical decline will be rectified.  He doesn't mention how he will replace pipes and tracks that are still in use even though they are long past their life expectancy.    Here's Tom Jakobek on why the Waterfront initiative hasn't happened: "Tom Jakobek knows why nothing has happened. The reason isnt because of the environmental difficulties with the soil, or because there isnt enough infrastructure for water and sewage all problems nonetheless. The problem is too many independent government agencies or levels of government involved in the ownership of the waterfront lands. Think about it: 8 different Boards of Directors, 8 different administrations and 8 different official plans." I should be clear here.  Im not talking about new infrastructure Im talking about existing, crumbling, infrastructure that is at the end of its life.  Key components for delivering water to your home and light to your street, the replacement of which is often viewed as an extra cost.   A City council, by its very nature, is short sited.  Its a group of men and women who meet together for 3 years at most.  Contrast the life of a City council with the life of an iron pipe underground.  While new councils come and go, and talk about tourism and conferences and major public attractions, that iron pipe continues to corrode and eventually breaks down.  Whose fault is it that it wasnt replaced?  Is it the current councils responsibility?  Or is it the responsibility of the council who put that pipe in the ground 75 years ago?  Or is it, as is often the case, the  next  councils responsibility?  Out of sight and out of mind in this case contains frightening possibilities and very real financial burdens.  Heres David Miller on TTC infrastructure: In my Toronto, the TTC will once again become a transit system we can take pride in. Ridership will increase because the system will reflect user needs. All three levels of government will once again participate in a sustainable funding model that achieves a balance between fare box revenues and government subsidies. We will invest in infrastructure improvements in the form of subways and bus ways. System improvements and state-of-the-art technological applications will reduce the cost per rider. Like Tory, Miller looks to the future, but they both look to the future in terms of Capital improvements.  Making things new and better.  But the investment in infrastructure in this case refers to new busses and trains, with little mention of the concrete and metal that those buses and trains operate on.  If Im being curmudgeonly and not seeing the big picture or the vision then I apologize.  Like any citizen I want an amazing waterfront that I can bring my children to, I want a safe Toronto, and I want pretty trees to look at.  But I need water, I need to get to work every day in the subway, I need my pee to go away when I flush the toilet.    Councils have put off major repairs and component replacements for years and years.  This City is coming to a crisis point and if none of the leadership candidates will recognize that, then we will be heading into serious financial and operational trouble.  We need an aggressive program of infrastructure management.  One that ensures that we have the money to monitor and replace sewers and tracks  as they reach the end of their life  and not simply rushing to put out fires when things are out of control and falling apart.    Not  next  council,  this  council.  You must ask your mayoral candidates to address these issues.

       Fun on Whitehouse.gov   " urlLink First , some ask why Iraq is different from other countries or regimes that also have terrible weapons. While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq stands alone -- because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place. Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people."  "We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas. Saddam Hussein also has experience in using chemical weapons. He has ordered chemical attacks on Iran, and on more than forty villages in his own country. These actions killed or injured at least 20,000 people, more than six times the number of people who died in the attacks of September the 11th."

       Combative Bush   For those of you who missed it (this is a week late, sorry).  From the  urlLink Washington Post : In an interview with the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service given on Thursday and released by the White House yesterday, Bush interrupted the questioner when asked about his announcement on May 1 of, as the journalist put it, "the end of combat operations."   "Actually, major military operations," Bush replied. "Because we still have combat operations going on." Bush added: "It's a different kind of combat mission, but, nevertheless, it's combat, just ask the kids that are over there killing and being shot at."   If you're not scratching your head, then here's why you should be.  In the first sentance of his  urlLink May 1st address  to military personel on the USS Abraham Lincoln Bush said, in so many words, "Major combat operations in Iraq have ended."  Right.  It's combat, just ask the kids that are over there killing and being shot at.  "Bring it on"

       Dude are you being sarcastic?   Ok.  Here's the scenario:  I'm on the streetcar and two guys get on.  They are both wearing the same red t-shirt that hangs down to their knees.  In iron-on letters both shirts proclaim identical messages: "I've got the bling".  The gentlemen are wearing red white and blue baseball hats (with the NBA logo if I'm not completely mistaken).  They've got baby blue warm ups, big-ass shoes, and yes....bling.  Gold chains, pendants, possibly a watch.  One is white the other is possibly Hispanic.  Both are well mannered, save their loud conversation, even pausing before boarding the street car to help two mothers carry strollers out of the car.    It was their conversation that had me wondering "Are they two actors in character, or are they for real?"  It was what they spoke about that had me confused.  I'd always figured that "real" ganstaz wouldn't be loose charactures of the stereotype.    Here's a verbatim sample: " Yo check it.  I got this sick chain 'aight, and I'm lookin' for some mad bling to hang it.  There's this pendant yo, this sick pendant, and I'm like 'Isat real gold yo? '"  They were just two young men talking about accessories on the streetcar ride home.  I listened and listened and tried to hear if they dropped out of character, to see if they would deny their appearance and confer about delivery, or style, or costume.  We were on our way up to Broadview station, which is close to an improv theatre company.  I smiled as I thought "They're just getting ready for a show tonight".  But were they?  That's what's got me all befuddled today.  Were these two guys wiggers or were they  urlLink Fubar -esque charactures of wiggers?

       Seabiscuit: An American Tail   We went to see it on the weekend, and it became clear about 20 minutes into the movie, why it is such a critically acclaimed film: Making fun of Seabiscuit is like making fun of a little retarded girl.  A friend, who saw the movie with my girlfriend and I, noted that all the reviews of the film were grudgingly positive.  Kind of like: "Ok fine.  It's an amazing movie.  Are you happy now?"  The problem is that it is filled with so much aspertaine that people walk out of the theatre on a fake sugar high, and somehow go into a fake diabetic coma when describing the movie to friends.  "It's just an amazing story about 3 people, and a horse, who overcome adversity in their lives, and go on to save America."    In the theatre where Seabiscuit first touched our lives, people were clapping at the end of the showing.  The audience in the Varsity theatre at Bay and Bloor were so pleased with the movie that they applauded in order to show the screen their appreciation.  One woman even squealed and clapped as Seabiscuit won the big race, though she may have been the aforementioned little retarded girl.  "See, all this time we thought we were teaching Seabiscuit.  Turns out, Seabiscuit was the one teaching us...."  That's not an actual quote from the most inspiration film of 2003, but it's damn close.  Normally in a situation like this, we could all pick away at the  other  terrible parts of the film: the acting, the actors, the direction, the anachronisms, but the unfortunate part is that they were all fairly decent.  All the performances were reasonably on the believable scale and there was nothing really wrong with the movie.  Except the story.  Except this saccharine series of really obvious connections that brings everyone together in the film.  Horse owner looses his son.  Horse Jockey looses his parents.  Horse owner and jockey learn to love each other like a father and son.    I love you papa Homer.  I love you too Pepsi  Horse trainer/whisperer cant bear to see a horse shot: You don't throw away a whole life just 'cause he's banged up a little. But doesnt think that Horse jockey should ride the horse when the jockeys leg is broken.  Horse owner/jockey-father-figure reminds Horse trainer/whisperer: You don't throw away a whole life just 'cause he's banged up a little.  Audience nods knowingly, noting out loud Remember, because thats what the Horse trainer said before.  He got his own words turned around on him.  One of the central pillars in Seabiscuit is the fact that Seabiscuit saved America.  Remember when that happened?  Remember how all the people who lost their money in the stock market started to gamble as a desperately illguided attempt at living out the American dream?  Theres even a Gatsby-esque struggle between Old Money and New Money, which Seabiscuit wins using a combination of hard work, stick-to-it-ivness, and a whole lot of moxie.  Go ahead and watch it.  Its only a few months until the next time a movie changes the way  urlLink we think about ourselves .

       CBC Documentary    urlLink The Current  is replaying a documentary series from earlier this year.  " urlLink Water for Profit " examines the effects, positive and negative, of privatizing the delivery of public water supplies in cities and towns all over the world.  Hamilton's experience with privatization of water treatment is the focus of a section called " urlLink Hamilton's Crown Jewel ".  Listen to find out how famously bankrupt Enron was involved in Hamilton's water wastewater woes. In the past ten years, three giant global corporations have quietly assumed control over the water supplied to almost 300 million people in every continent of the world. A 12-month investigation by journalists in Canada, the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America shows that the results range from questionable to disastrous. And it shows how well-meaning municipal governments in the U.S. and Canada can become vulnerable to the persuasive techniques of these high-powered corporate giants.

       New section   I'll put up a new section of links off to the side there.  This one will feature other GTA bloggers who are following the Mayoral election.  Lord knows that democracy as we know it would crash into the mountain if this site is the only source of anyone's opinions.  Here's our first selection:   urlLink Andrew Spicer's Weblog .  Mr. Spicer follows the election coverage with a little more seriousness then I do sometimes, so if you're getting sick of my goofy jokes then he's probably someone to turn to.  He's also developing his own blogging tool using MS Access which I will tentatively call "SpiceType".  We'll let marketing worry about the rest.

       Barbara Hall responds   Let's read Babs' letter to us all, shall we?  >   Dear Friend,    Aww.  That's nice of you to say.    >   Were now in the Dog Days of Summer but things have been hectic out on the campaign trail. Ive been very busy recently. Ive attended many wonderful events like last Sundays Pakistan Independence Day celebrations, where more than 6,000 proud people celebrated the anniversary of their countrys beginning.     Wow.  All those people huh?  So how's that investigation into your campaign fundraising going?  >   Everywhere I go, your support has been overwhelming. I thank you for that. I also wanted to contact you to let you know that my lawyer, David G. Boghosian, today commenced an Application to Quash the charges laid against me by Tom Jacobek.     Got a new lawyer huh?  What happened to Jakobsh?  So...what did the new guy say about the case?  >   After reviewing Mr. Jacobeks allegations, David concluded that there were sufficient grounds to have the charges dismissed. This Application to Quash is scheduled to be heard in Superior Court on Monday, September 8th.     I'll book it off.  >   My lawyer believes that Jacobeks case is seriously flawed. We will argue that the Justice of the Peace should never have let these charges go forward. The evidence put before him was far too flimsy, he said. It appears that the information and resulting summons are flawed in a number of respects.     Yeah, lawyers tend to talk like that.  What did you expect him to say: "Sorry Barbara, looks like we're goin' down the shitter on this one.  As your attorney I'd advise you to throw in the towel"?  >   The allegations are improperly vague and ambiguous, and the proceedings before Justice of the Peace Bubba were highly irregular. The proceedings were dominated by Mr. Jacobeks lawyer urging that charges be laid, rather than the usual process of questioning the informant on the source of his information and its reliability.     I'm sorry...did you say "Justice of the Peace Bubba"?  Oh..you probably mean " urlLink His Worship Justice of the Peace James V. Bubba ".  And yes, I would imagine that Mr. Jakobek's lawyer would be a pushy fellow.  >   I want to assure you that I will not be distracted by Jacobeks attack. My support continues to grow in all parts of the city as I stay focused on the issues that matter most to the people of Toronto.     Well it's sweet of you to think of us.  >   I have every faith that this matter will de dealt with quickly by the courts and that we will go on to victory Nov. 10.     You have faith in speed and efficiency of the provincial court system?  Are you feeling ok Barbara?  Would you like to sit down for a minute?  >   Thank you for your continued support, Barbara     Yeah, we'll be watching.

       Found a new one   Ladies and gentlemen: Mr.  urlLink Durie Naimji   Mr. Naimji's site is the only one that features the mayoral candidate  urlLink topless .  I'll just sit back and wait for Barbara to up the ante...  He's a cheap chap!  Heh..that kind of rhymes....wait.  No it doesn't.  Says Naimji: Dont all citizens of Toronto have a right to a new mayor whose steady study, constant concern, daily duty, and major business are to ensure each citizen and resident is; treated fairly, sheltered warmly, working proudly, enjoying a free, fearless, peaceful and happy life?   Don't we?

       Garbage smells   Here's the gist:  A transfer station is a big building, usually in an industrial area of a city, where garbage trucks go to dump out their load so they can get back on the streets and get more garbage.  Bigger trucks come into the transfer station and "transfer" the garbage from that site to another site; usually a landfill and in this case, across the boarder into Michigan.     urlLink The article  is about a guy, who owns a reception hall close to the Bermondsey transfer station (close to Eglinton and the DVP).  He's complaining that garbage smells, and that the "new" garbage (the 'wet waste' component of garbage that the City is now collecting in Scarborough and Etobicoke).  This story from the Star today works well on so many levels.    First of all it showcases a City staff member actually acknowledging plain fact, and not trying to dance around the issue:  "Bacopoulos readily admits that the wet waste, which collects in a homeowner's green bin for an entire week before being picked up by a garbage truck, smells terrible.  "When you lift the lid off on that fifth or sixth day to put material in there, it is raunchy, there's no doubt about it, but it's a small price to pay to divert material away from landfills and for a better environment," Bacopoulos said."  Yes.  It is a  minute  price to pay for diversion and fewer trucks going across the boarder.  There was an editorial a month ago, and since the Sun doesn't seem to archive it's content I can't link to it, where a Toronto Sun columnist railed about the new Scarborough Green Bin program.  She complained how difficult it was to use, how it would smell, how rats would infest her home, how relatives wouldn't want to come visit....  She finished her column by suggeting that her olfactoray inconvenience could have been avoided if we'd just gotten our act together and shipped our garbage north to Kirkland Lake when we had the chance.  I'm not sure how the logic works.  Can we demand an effective solution to a problem, but negate that solution if it is found to inconvenience a single person?  A group of people?  Obviously the organics collection program isn't going to grind to a halt because this resturaunt owner claims to have "lost half his business", but how far will his complaint go?

       Gay in North Bay, but stay the eferendum-ray   Ok, that was pretty bad.  I apologize already.  Chretien has said that there won't be a  urlLink referendum on the issue  of same-sex marriage in Canada.  He says that the majority should never rule on the minority because the minority will always loose.  So when are referendums valid?  When are they a valid reason to bring the country to a halt for a few months while whe all debate an issue?    Succession?  Constitutional ammendments?  Whether the CFL is still a viable organization?

       Gay in North Bay   The federal liberals are in North Bay for a caucus meeting on the  urlLink same-sex marriage  issue.  Some MPs are planning on confronting the PM about massive constituent opposition to gay marriage.  Some MPs are ready to defend the resolution.  Chretien is busy preparing a speech to try and sway his party's favour, and we'll hear the results soon enough.    I think it's important to remember just what is going on here.  There is an effort to change one of the most deeply rooted beliefs of humanity.  It's been done before in other countries, and now it's our turn to sit down and have a serious look at what we believe, why we believe it, and whether we're strong enough to do both of the aforementioned.

       A dark day in the office   In an effort to conserve power there are almost no lights on in my office.  So I'm writing this by my monitor's warm glowing warming glow.  I noticed a press release on John Tory's website.  Current chair of the Works Committee Brad Duguid has announced that he'll be  urlLink putting his support  behind the Tory for Mayor campaign.  It's a nice fit on a number of issues, but one in particular.    Duguid, who for some reason has a MIDI version of the  urlLink theme from Mission Impossible  on his website, recently announced a plan to reduce litter in the City.  That alone fits nicely with Tory who (so far) is the only candidate who's layed out an anti-litter plan as part of his platform.  It will be interesting to see if Duguid does any campaigning for Tory, or if he will leave his support at the press release alone.

       This is pretty much it   As far as I can tell, Hall's launch speach contained the only reference to garbage, or waste diversion:  "Another issue where we must get our own house in order is garbage. The first principle is clear: we must divert more of our waste from landfill. Only then will we have a broader range of choices."  This statement was sandwiched between "eliminating waste and inefficiency" and "I will assemble our most talented marketers to work with Tourism Toronto", so it looks like it was an after thought on the word "waste".  Barbara Hall want's us to recycle.  That's pretty much the end of her stated strategy so far.  Wednesday's press conference in Riverdale park revealed her "green" plan for the city.  Lots of tree planting (a million by 2010), and lowering of sulpher in fuel (can we do that at a municipal level?), but nothing about waste, landfills, or composting.  Perhaps Ms. Hall is taking the Arnold Schwarzenegger approach to campaigning by remaining silent on major issues and simply relying on name recognition.  Seems to have worked so far as she's consistently the front runner in the polls, but doesn't that mean we should be pressing her on the issues  more  then the "fringe" candidates?

       Oh now you've got to be kidding me   Yeah, yeah, fine.  Jackobek started proceedings against Hall for violations of the Municipal Elections Act.  Specifically calling her fundraising into question.  That's not the strange part.  The strange part is that Hall's lawyer is named "Tom Jakobsh".  I figured it was a typo but aparently not.  For the next few weeks we'll be reading about how Tom Jakobsh and Tom Jakobek will be squaring off in court.  Here's the  urlLink Star's take  on the inital proceedings.  Here's Babs' statement about "The Friends of Barbara Hall": Dear Supporters,   I wanted to contact you personally to tell you that yesterday Tom Jakobek attempted to use the courts to derail my campaign for mayor. Let me assure you, he will not succeed with these outrageous political games.   My integrity is important to me. I would never do anything to compromise my reputation or undermine your trust. I take my responsibilities to you very seriously.   I want to be very clear: my actions, and those of my supporters, The Friends of Barbara Hall, have at all times been entirely within the law. I'm proud of how my supporters and I have conducted ourselves.   Over a year ago, the Friends of Barbara Hall sought and obtained a legal opinion from a senior member of the municipal law bar and former professor of municipal law, Stanley M. Makuch, BA, MA, LLB, LLM (Harvard). This legal opinion outlined what types of activities were permissible under the Municipal Elections Act. Friends of Barbara Hall relied on this opinion and used it to guide their activities at all times.   Not only did Friends of Barbara Hall comply with the law, they went far beyond what the law required, in terms of disclosure of information and limiting the size of donations. In order to be fully transparent, the Friends of Barbara Hall have also made full financial disclosure on their website.   I'm pleased that we can now have an opportunity to address the allegations that have been made. Instead of responding to Mr. Jakobek's outrageous innuendos, we will now be able to have a court of law bring this matter to a resolution.   This will not distract me from my campaign. I will continue to address the issues which are important to you and our city. And with your support, I will continue to campaign vigorously and to present my vision and ideas for Toronto's future. I look forward to seeing you at the hundreds of events I will be attending between now and the end of the campaign.   Sincerely, Barbara Hall   So there you have it.    If anyone knows where Barbara's statements on garbage, litter or waste management are could you please send them to me?  I haven't been able to find anything on her site.  She does mention that she will "continue to address the issues which are important to you and our city", but hasn't posted anything on those issues that I can locate.

If I've helped you research about tampons, I should caution you: "I am not an authority on tampons".

       Heh    urlLink Nerd pop.   I first heard these guys on " urlLink Le Show " hosted by Harry Schearer (the very same).  I love the customer reviews on Amazon.ca.  They're pretty useful when you've "kind of heard good reviews" about something but still don't know much about it.  "See all customer results" and pick "Lowest rated first", then see if you can live with the faults of your potential purchase.   High Rating   "Fountains of Wayne are todays only masters of the three minute pop song. Welcome Interstate Managers is 16 tracks each with a sweet hook. I was singing along to songs the first time I heard them. The bands songwriters Adam Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood are a bizzarre modern day version of Lennon and McCartney. They pay homage to sounds of the past while putting their own stamp on each song. With their intelligent/funny/sweet lyrics and endless melodies Fountains Of Wayne should be one of the biggest bands around, but since the charts disagree they can just be your secret."   Low Rating   "After hearing Stacey's Mom and Bright Future in Sales, I rushed out to get this cd. Unfortunately, I was disgusted after hearing the rest of the tracks. This is a joke. There is no seriousness at all to this album. The songs are so corny and such jokes that they sound like Weird Al Yankovich. This is definately one of those albums with two good songs and the rest god awful."   So, to review, I looked at the "faults" of the potential purchase and decided "Yes.  I can still enjoy a CD even if it sounds like Weird Al Yankovich".

       JFK   John F. Kerry (Democratic presidential hopeful) ordered a Philly Cheesesteak in Philadelphia with  urlLink Swiss Cheese , instead of the more traditional Cheez-Whiz or "American" cheese.  Now, the papers will cover this (already are), and they'll do it in a way that is clearly ironic (like having a food critic lisp "It will doom his candidacy in Philadelphia").  They'll mockingly gasp that a  president  should know that you should eat a cheesesteak by "Throwing fistfuls of steak into the gaping maw, fingers dripping -- that's the proper way." and not in the dainty "upper-class" fashion that Kerry was observed doing at the photo-op.  A  president  should eat a cheesesteak the same way that his people do: wolfing down 3 in a single sitting and polishing it off with a half gallon of Mountain Dew.  The funny part, is that for all the sarcasm, all the ironic shaming, this story will probably hurt Kerry more in the long run then any policy announcement, or platform position he makes.  I guess the other part is that a media, who is preoccupied with telling a nation that it is fat and a burdon on the healthcare system, is now equating eating Cheez-Whiz with patriotism.

       Hall marks   Hang on to your socks (hats?) people.  Babs will be announcing her "Environmental Policy" tomorrow morning in Riverdale park.   On Wednesday, August 13, 2003 Barbara will be making an environmental policy announcement. The announcement will be made at 10 am at Riverdale Park.

Seriously, I'd love to hear what she has to say because her current " urlLink on the issues " section is severely lacking in the garbage/litter/water/labour department.

       Politics & Science   A good friend informed me of this site, and I urge everyone to take a look and evaluate some of the accusations made.    Take your lack of WMD, take your inflated case for war, take your absence of any real link between Iraq and 9/11, and look at them in the context of these findings.  The larger issue isn't that the Bush administration is lying, it's that they're manipulating sound reason and science in order to prove an alternate or sometimes opposite point.  What results is an argument that sounds scientific, but is wrought with private interest and skewed conclusions.  The real scary thing is that the public believes the Bush version findings (and in some cases events), more then the  actual  findings.  Cognitive dissonance seems to be the disease of the day, and unless the American's give their collective heads a shake, they'll be stuck with Bush for another 4 years.    urlLink Politics & Science    "The report Politics and Science in the Bush Administration finds numerous instances where the Administration has manipulated the scientific process and distorted or suppressed scientific findings. Beneficiaries include important supporters of the President, including social conservatives and powerful industry groups."

       Something to chew on this morning   "Dude, are you being sarcastic?" "I don't even know anymore."   What is  urlLink postmodernism ?   Firstly, postmodernism was a movement in architecture that rejected the modernist, avant garde, passion for the new. Modernism is here understood in art and architecture as the project of rejecting tradition in favour of going "where no man has gone before" or better: to create forms for no other purpose than novelty. Modernism was an exploration of possibilities and a perpetual search for uniqueness and its cognate--individuality. Modernism's valorization of the new was rejected by architectural postmodernism in the 50's and 60's for conservative reasons. They wanted to maintain elements of modern utility while returning to the reassuring classical forms of the past. The result of this was an ironic brick-a-brack or  collage  approach to construction that combines several traditional styles into one structure. As collage, meaning is found in combinations of  already  created patterns.  Following this, the modern romantic image of the lone creative artist was abandoned for the playful technician (perhaps computer hacker) who could retrieve and recombine creations from the past--data alone becomes necessary. This synthetic approach has been taken up, in a politically radical way, by the visual, musical,and literary arts where collage is used to startle viewers into reflection upon the meaning of reproduction. Here, pop-art reflects culture (American). Let me give you the example of Californian culture where the person--though ethnically European, African, Asian, or Hispanic--searches for authentic or "rooted" religious experience by dabbling in a variety of religious traditions. The foundation of authenticity has been overturned as the relativism of collage has set in. We see a pattern in the arts and everyday spiritual life away from universal standards into an atmosphere of multidimentionality and complexity, and most importantly--the dissolving of distinctions. In sum, we could simplistically outline this movement in historical terms:  1. premodernism: Original meaning is possessed by authority (for example, the Catholic Church). The individual is dominated by tradition.  2. modernism: The enlightenment-humanist rejection of tradition and authority in favour of reason and natural science. This is founded upon the assumption of the autonomous individual as the sole source of meaning and truth--the Cartesian cogito. Progress and novelty are valorized within a linear conception of history--a history of a "real" world that becomes increasingly real or objectified. One could view this as a Protestant mode of consciousness.  3. postmodernism: A rejection of the sovereign autonomous individual with an emphasis upon anarchic collective, anonymous experience. Collage, diversity, the mystically unrepresentable, Dionysian passion are the foci of attention. Most importantly we see the dissolution of distinctions, the merging of subject and object, self and other. This is a sarcastic playful parody of western modernity and the "John Wayne" individual and a radical, anarchist rejection of all attempts to define, reify or re-present the human subject.

       The cool menthol flavour of Marxism   When I take the 505 into work I usually grab a coffee at the Timothy's on Dundas across from the Eaton centre.    On the walk into the office this morning, I passed a rather pale looking guy, with a nicotine yellow moustache, carrying a sweater or perhaps his dialysis equipment in a plastic shopping bag.  He was wearing a white T-shirt with those black iron-on letters that said:   No Smoking Laws Is Communism   I tried to catch his eye and give him a big ironic thumbs up, but he stared at the concrete as he walked.    The really funny part was how white the shirt was.  Everything else about him was either unwashed or stained yellow, but that T-shirt was springtime fresh and winter white.  Perhaps he had it on order for weeks and finally got to pick it up from that T-Shirt place when it opened this morning.

       Bloogle   I just figure that's what they'll eventually call it.    A little while ago  urlLink Google bought Pyra Labs  (the company that owns Blogger).    If I understand the issue correctly, Google is looking for a way to reduce the "noise" created by blogs in their search results.  If 3000 idiots like myself complain that "Gary Coleman running for Governor of California is proof that society is in an ireversable downward spiral that will only end with the physical destruction of the planet", then all of those comments may show up in people searching for "Physical" "Society" and "Gary Coleman".  Opinion laden blogs are seen as "noise" in the vast, completely accurate, landscape of internet publishing, and therefore would need to be filtered out.  Soon aparently.   urlLink The Register  has a story (from a couple of days ago) about Google's efforts to categorize blogs as blogs and not webpages.    I'm actually really looking forward to it.  I'd love another tab on Google.    We'll be able to search for "Gary Coleman" and get a list of fan sites, and various  urlLink "Gary Coleman Ate My Balls"  spin-offs.  Then, after clicking "image" we can get pictures of Gary, then news references about Gary, and finally blogger opinions about Gary.  Cheap target I know, but it was the first thing that came to my mind.  And believe me, that alone is scarier then any suggestion that I'm a pop culture hack.

       Recycled News?   How many times are we going to  urlLink get this story?     Didn't they do the "thermostat-in-your-office-is-fake" story a few months ago?  The big reveal with all of the contractors saying that most of the thermostats they install are just there so office drones can have a feeling of control of their environment, but that the pannels aren't actually hooked up to anything?  There was a component of managerial involvement if I'm not mistaken; something to the tune of "most building managers know about the fake thermostats".  I'm not sure if this is real news or just fodder for Train 48 tonight.  Why would they play the story again though?  Were not enough people outraged the last time?  The only thing I'm sure of is that I'm going to have to listen to a group of menopausal, running shoe wearing, pant-suits on the subway tonight complaining about how thier office is way too hot/cold and someone should really do something about it.  I think I'll walk home.

       Oh I get it   Apparently  urlLink John Manley  is in the running to replace Lord Robertson as secretary general of NATO.  I posted a couple of weeks ago about Manley's withdrawal from the Liberal leadership race. I drew the uninformed conclusion (by some standards) that it was just a crapshoot as to whether Copps or Manley would pull out first. A relation of mine, who has been known to play football with the Minister of National Heritage, noted that "Copps is a gritty woman and is in a fight till the end".   As I have never attempted to block a full body tackle from an unpadded, cleat-shod Ms. Copps, I suppose I have no claim to authority in the matter. It's just as well as I really have no claim to authority on anything that I write about, but that's another issue.  I've got no real point here, except to mention the reason that the story caught my eye in the first place. I read the headline as:    OTTAWA - John Manley is being considered as a candidate to replace Loyd Robertson as secretary-general of NATO.    I just couldn't remember when Loyd Roberston became such a diplomat. I mean, he's got great hair and a voice like hot buttered sex, but Secretary General of NATO?   After realising that is actually "Lord" Robertson who is in charge of the organization I decided that it wasn't going to be a funny post, unless I made you all picture Sheila Copps levelling a shoulder into my brother's sternum during a quiet Sunday game of touch.  Heh.   "hot buttered sex" and Sheila Copps in the same post. Let's let the search engines try to sort this out.

It makes the State Department of Environmental Protection out to be a bunch of 8 year old boys:  "Ew, what is it?"  "Dunno.  Poke it with a stick"  "Ok."  "Oh gross, it smells like barf."  "We'll put that in the report.  Any other observations?"  "It's way gross."  "Make a note of it: 'Reminicent of barf', 'Gross'."  "Eat it."  "You eat it."  "How are we going to determine if it's not toxic?"  "It may be an algae growth that lived on the bottom of the lagoon and after its life cycle ended, gases brought it up to the surface."  "Hmm...good point.  We'll add that to the conclusion."

       An explanation of the previous post   But Armchair Garbageman, do you support Tory's plan?  Do you agree with his assertion that bureaucracy at City Hall is partly to blame for the City's litter problem?  Yes on both counts.  To be perfectly frank, a single arm responsible for litter collection is the only way to reduce litter clean up costs, and increase the efficiency needed to handle litter quickly and consistently in this city.  When you put garbage out at your curb, there's a truck from a City department who comes by to pick it up.  When you stroll through a park and admire the freshly cut grass and beautiful flowerbeds, you know exactly which department to thank.  When you turn on your taps you can rest assured that the water that comes out is clean and ever present due to the diligence of workers in a City department.  These are well defined, departmental responsibilities.  When you notice a piece of litter on the ground however, there's a complex algorithm to determine which City department is going to pick it up.  Is it on the street?  In a park?  On the sidewalk?  In a stream bed?  In a parking lot?  There are at least 5 different departments who  might  have to be notified to clean up a single, hypothetical, piece of litter.  It's inefficient, and there are rumblings going on right now to change it.  Rumblings that are coming from within committee rooms, and rumblings that are coming from political platforms.  To be fair, much of what Tory is proposing has already begun.  Our litter committee is already comprised of representatives from business and industry (including the fast food chains that Tory mentions in his release), as well as councillors and staff.  A key part of Torys proposal is to hire 1500 students to assist either, current City departments, or a new litter department during summer litter peaks.  At least one other candidate, Tom Jakobek, is proposing a similar idea but with different numbers; he suggests hiring 5000 students for the summer season, at a cost of $13.5 Million ( urlLink quoted here , down at the bottom of the interview).  Jakobek is unclear as to whether the $13.5 Million is the total budget for litter removal or the cost of the wages of the students alone.  Tory has really siezed on this, and other "garbage" issues, and I think he'll be the one to push that agenda in debates.  It sounds like he's willing to work and address the problem, but that remains to be proven.

       Tory thinks you're a slob   From the Tory press release dated August 5:  Pick Up Toronto!   Tuesday, August 05, 2003  Toronto mayoral candidate John Tory today announced his Pick Up Toronto! initiative that will clean up the citys streets, parks and public places with the help of students, the public and private sectors.   As mayor, I will declare war on litter, garbage and graffiti, said Tory. Pick Up Toronto! means dramatically reducing the garbage, litter, posters and graffiti in our public spaces. It involves City Hall, schools, businesses and citizen volunteers. And it will combine public and private funding.   We now spend about $16 million a year managing street waste, and yet, youd hardly know it from the litter in our public spaces and the graffiti on our walls.   Tory plans to hire 1,500 students next summer to clean up garbage, litter and graffiti. Pick Up Toronto! will engage the private sector (including fast food chains whose product wrappers are a major source of litter), to play their part in cleaning up the city. Citizens will be involved through Adopt-A-Park initiatives. Tory will also cut bureaucracy at City Hall and make one city department responsible for garbage, litter and graffiti, instead of the current five.   As mayor, I offer new leadership for Toronto, and an action plan to clean up the city, and clean up City Hall, so that once again, Torontonians can hold their heads high and know that they live in the city that works.   I will lead by action and example. I do not offer endless consultation and dithering and I do not offer grandstanding and confrontation. I offer action and results.   Pick Up Toronto! is John Torys third major policy statement and follows Criminals Out, a plan to protect our neighbourhoods, and A Clean Start, a plan to restore trust in government.

       Call and Response   You've got to feel for Nunziata on this one.  It looks orchestrated.  Lets go back to the springtime in the tunnels under the City.  David Miller posters were all the rage back then.  In April of this year,  long  before the election, David Miller put up ads in the subway stations indicating that he was the TTC candidate.  It might be argued that it wasn't a "campaign" poster, but merely an "information" poster, but lets face facts; it had  urlLink millerformayor.ca  at the bottom of it.  A few weeks ago John Nunziata launched his "Stand up for Toronto"  urlLink posters in the TTC .  A friend of mine insists she'll vote for him simply because his posters make him look like a giant, looming tall over the city.  While away on vacation, my girlfriend and I sat in a "Chicken and Fish" (that's the name of the chain) restaurant in Bancroft Ontario, and read  urlLink this article  in the Star.  Here's the gist: Under the City of Toronto municipal code, campaign signs are not permitted on public or private property until 25 days before election day.  Based on the city's legal opinion, subway advertising had been permitted because it was not visible from the streets. That has been the accepted policy until a new ruling was suddenly issued yesterday.  In recent weeks, some candidates have taken issue with former MP John Nunziata's subway ads, and others pointed out that Councillor David Miller ran similar ads in the spring.  "There were enough questions raised that I sent the original interpretation for review," said Blakes. "It's now come back saying, (subway advertising) will be viewed as violation."  As a result, Blakes said he issued a letter yesterday outlining the new rules to mayoral campaigns, adding he expects all ads to be down within a week of receipt of the letter."   Would you take your campaign poster down after another candidate's posters got to run their length?  I wouldn't either, and  urlLink Nunziata's office  is kicking back with all force.    We were back in the city and back in the TTC on the first Monday after the ruling.  Obviously no posters had been removed.  Two days later on the way back from Downsview park we transferred at St. George and I watched a group of 5 TTC security officers discussing the ruling and pointing out that "That guy's poster's should be down already".  This morning, while enjoying a stranger's elbow between my ass-cheeks, I took pause to notice that yes, Nunziata's posters are still up.

       The City recognizes its own language   I know, I know.  You can't have by-law officers who speak  every  language, but for the amount of people in this city who speak Cantonese, you'd think that we would have  urlLink hired this guy , or someone like him, alot earlier.  Of course, if you decide to elect  urlLink this guy  mayor, we won't need Cantonese, or any other "immigrant language" speaking by-law officers.

       Sorry Folks   I'm back from a week long absence.  My commute in on the first day back was delightful.  A stuck train at Summerhill meant that I was in store for a 15 minute wait at Bloor station, and then, in the ensuing sardine like subway car, I had the pleasure of having a woman's elbow jammed up my ass from Bloor to Dundas.    Those... Aren't... Pillows!!!

       Residentially Evil   I really should be in this movie.  The shooting schedule alone seems to be following me around the city.  Or perhaps it's just that I live and work in very photogenic/terrifying locations.  A few Sundays ago it became apparent that my apartment was under chopper attack.  I thought I was back in Da Nang for a few moments, until I shook my head and realized that the gooks weren't charging up the stairs, but rather Resident Evil 2 was in town filming on the Bloor/Danforth bridge ('Prince Edward Viaduct', for those in the know).  They shut the bridge down for 10 minute stretches (and stopped all traffic underneath on the DVP) while black SUVs were chased by (or were chasing) a helicopter above.  It was pretty cool to catch a glimpse of "Hollywood" film making while it was in the process.  The most recent shooting location will be....City Hall.  There are massive floodlight trucks, and production trailers everywhere outside.  Cable and hookups are scattered, but neatly organized, all over Nathan Phillips Square and there's a memo to all City employees in the elevator which indicates that October 1st at about 7:00, Nathan Phillips Square will be used to film more "helicopter" scenes, including a landing in the square itself.  From my vantage point I can see the top of the "pod" (that thing in the middle of City Hall where council meets), and they are setting something up down there for tomorrow night.  There's a big, three pronged sculpture down there now, which is slightly less attractive to look at then Henry Moore's "The Archer" which is located two floors below in the square itself.  I've seen other things filmed or photographed up there in the past.  The deck around the pod was turned into, presumably, the top floor of a parking garage for something recently, complete with yellow parking lines, directional arrows, and skid marks.  There's just something about watching a movie filmed in a City you know really well.  That aspect alone makes bad movies watchable.  I watched X-Men partially because I really wanted to see X-Men but partly because I really got a kick out of elbowing the stranger beside me and loudly whispering "That's inside Casa Loma" or "I'm pretty sure that's in Burlington down by the Lakeshore at the south end of Brant St".  I didn't see the first Resident Evil, but I'm pretty sure I'll go out and see this one, if for no other reason then to watch virus infected zombies wander around City Hall.  (!!Note to self: Insert joke about Council here.  Try to work in Rob Ford, if possible.)

       Loophole for your H2   The Bush administration, as part of it's economic stimulus program, has included a section (intended for farmers presumably) which allows for an business to claim the cost of a piece of equipment as a deduction on its taxes.  The Hummer, land behemoth H2, actually qualifies for this tax credit where other cars and trucks don't.  Why?  Because the under the guidelines of the tax credit the Hummer's gross vehicle weight of 6,000 lbs counts.  In Alaska, SUV dealers are gladly  urlLink informing citizens  of the tax credit: Mercedes-Benz of Anchorage on East Sixth Avenue has run newspaper ads showing the luxury automaker's gigantic M-Class SUV. The ads read, "Attn: Business Owners. This Year's New Tax laws allow you to WRITE OFF 100%." The ad encourages buyers to "act now" before the law changes.  The state's only Hummer dealership, across from Merrill Field in East Anchorage, recently sent out thousands of fliers to doctors, lawyers, construction company owners and other well-paid entrepreneurs, to let them know about a "fabulous opportunity."  "Imagine being able to purchase the #1 large luxury SUV in America today, the Hummer H2 with its incredible styling, bona fide off-road capability and awesome driveability and receive a deduction for the entire purchase amount from your taxes this year!" wrote Chris Thorpe, sales representative.  "We wanted to use it as a sales tool," said Roger Swanson, account manager. "It piques the interest level."  The strategy appears to be paying off. Sales have been strong at the Anchorage dealership, according to sales representatives. Thorpe said he's sold 10 H2s in the last month alone. I'll be willing to give the Bush administration the benefit of the doubt here, but what this comes down to is shoddy writing of a bill.  If the stimulus package was meant to encourage farmers or others who  need  large pieces of equipment for their livelyhood, then the legislation should have been written more specifically.  What this is basically doing is encouraging people, who would have bought a large vehicle anyway, to buy an even larger vehicle because they can deduct the purchase price later.  Doctors and lawyers don't need H2s, let alone SUVs, to operate their average practices.  I'm sure there are some keener doctors up in Alaska who will off-road to make a housecall, but I would imagine that the vast majority would use them to drive, on the road, to their office and back home.  The Hummer as you know, gets 10 miles to the gallon.

       Rough day for Jakobek in the Star   From this  urlLink morning's editorials : Today is the last day that candidates in the municipal election can quit and have their name dropped from the Nov. 10 ballot.  One candidate, in particular, running to become Toronto's mayor, should heed that deadline and go.  Tom Jakobek, it's time to bow out.  urlLink Royson James'  column today is also about the former councillor from the Beaches: In the end, Tom Jakobek may be proven correct that rival mayoral candidate Barbara Hall violated election spending rules. But few want to hear it or even consider it.  And Jakobek faces an uphill task to get the judicial system to take his charges seriously. Jakobek has no credibility with the public after he admitted he lied to reporters about a hockey junket he took to Philadelphia, paid for by a private firm seeking city contracts. And this may just save Hall from a most embarrassing situation and leave her campaign for mayor unscathed.

       Spam   Spammers just aren't trying anymore.  We all get spam, and we all delete spam.  Normally I don't even open messages that aren't from a definitely recognizable name, but I clicked on this one because it was small (1K) and had no attachment.  Here's an example of the full text (minus the link of course) of an email I got from "John" under the subject " Forget it ": You have to look at this? We hunted high and low through messenger and yahoo chat who are open to misbehave as wickedly as you wish I mean...that's not even proof read.  Hell, it doesn't even have correct punctuation.  Whither the days of catchy subject lines like " Nubile Naked Nymphs Beg To Get On Their Knees And Worship Your Cock " or " Increase your bust by 3 cup sizes in a week!!!!! "?  Those are pretty specific, but in "Forget it", I'm not really sure to what "it" refers.  I remember the days when a real, structured discourse would arrive in my in-box, outlining the most convincing arguments for why I needed a 12" cock.  But now?  I can't even figure out what they searched high and low for in "messenger" and "yahoo".  Was it bacon?  MBA students?  Who knows.

       In which the author makes another shocking admission   So I'm watching WWE Smackdown on Thursday night...  The " urlLink A-Train " comes out and does what a lot of heel wrestlers do: He badmouthed the crowd.  Now other wrestlers stoop to insulting the local hockey or basketball teams, in who's stadiums they are currently performing.  But that wasn't for A-Train.  He grabbed the mike and marched around the ring proclaiming that he could beat, in order:  Brock Lesner (current champion)  Kurt Angle (disputed champion)  Or any one of you (points to the crowd)  The crowd naturally reacted to each of his statements.  The crowd does not like A-Train.    The crowd's reaction was, in order:  Loud booing, some shouting (Him? he's 20 times better then you!!) Louder booing, more yelling (the crowd really likes Angle) Screaming and Yelling from every individual in the stadium.  From the platinum blonds wearing the bicycle shorts, right through to the 300lb trucker wearing the "Fuck Fear:Drink Beer" t-shirt in the front row. Like for an instant every one of them would have lept into the ring with the 6'7" 350lb wrestler, simply because he said "I can beat you".  Now I'm not down on wrestling crowds and, as I can testify, most of the fun of being at a live wrestling show is cheer and boo along with everyone else.  It's just that it was such a funny pantomime-y thing for the crowd to react so much more emphatically when this en-masse challange was made.

       Ah crap   From the Toronto Star  urlLink last night . DETROIT (AP) &#8212; U.S. customs inspectors arrested the driver of a Canadian garbage truck today after they discovered about a tonne of marijuana concealed behind trash he was transporting. Look.  It's hard enough trying to dispose of Toronto garbage without this happening.  At the end of the story there's this comment from a clearly terrified American: "A ton of marijuana in one truck!" Michigan State representative Kathleen Law exclaimed after being informed of the discovery.  "This just underscores that trash from Canada leaves us open to this kind of illegal activity. We must pass legislation and we must regulate the bridge.  "It's just out of control," she said.  "This is scary." Yeah, it's really really scary.  You want to know how scary?  If the U.S. closes the border because of this, or delays Canadian garbage trucks with more inspections as they try and cross the border, then we'll see just how scary it really is.    Let's go over the facts:  All Toronto owned landfills are closed. GTA and Southwestern Ontario landfills are filling up quickly. While 100% waste diversion (away from landfills) is an attainable goal it cannot be met under current recycling conditions.  In other words there is a huge component of waste that cannot be processed as recyclables using the markets that we have available to us presently. Locating, testing, building and commissioning new landfills is a process that takes  years  of impact assessment analysis. As far as we know, there is no process currently underway to locate new landfills. The last time the border between Michigan and Ontario closed (because of that one Mad Cow in Alberta) it caused far reaching delays and backups at city transfer stations. In the event that the border closes, City staff have told us that they have a contingency plan to "hold" garbage at transfer stations until a dispute can be resolved.  That is far from an long term solution.  My point is that we are teetering on the edge of a major financial and environmental crisis every single day.  The U.S. congress are already making motions to restrict Canadian garbage from entering the U.S. and we still have no clear long-term solution for what to do.  Enter the mayoral candidates.  Barbara Hall has indicated that if we simply increase our diversion efforts we won't have to rely on the landfill in Michigan.  John Nunziata has indicated that he'll re examine Adams Mine in Kirkland Lake as a solution for Toronto's non-recyclable waste.  John Tory has suggested that he'll take a close look at incineration, gasification, and other "New and Emerging Technologies".  None of these potential solutions are overnight fixes, and none of them are without serious negative arguments.  Increasing our diversion efforts (green bin programs, expanded blue and grey box programs) only resolve a component of the waste stream.  There is still a large component that is simply not recyclable right now.  The sticking point with diversion is the markets to process the material.  Recycling potato chip bags and clear plastic film is possible, but expensive to do and therefore no one buys those materials from municipalities.  Simply including these and other materials in the recycling program isn't enough.  There has to be a place to put them, and if there's no place to put them they need to be landfilled.  Adams Mine is a ridiculously difficult process to reopen.  Apart from the environmental activists, native bands along the route to Kirkland Lake, and angry municipal councilors who all vowed to block any reopening of the debate, there's still environmental impact assessments and hundreds upon hundreds of deputations that the MOE will have to consider before they approve anything.  If it were to become an option again, it would be  years  in the making, and not simply a place to re-route the trucks.  Incineration is always met with protest.  Tom Jakobek says that he's seen "too many cases of childhood asthma" for him to consider incinerating Toronto garbage.  What Mr. Jakobek and Ms. Churley (Toronto-Danforth MPP) seem to forget is that incineration wouldn't be a gigantic pile of garbage doused with gas and set aflame.  The same intense scrutiny that would be applied to potential landfill sites, would be applied to both the location of an incinerating facility as well as to the proposed process of incineration.  It's not an overnight solution, and there is still the question of what to do with the minimal ash residue that would be left over from the process.  What's become clear is that trucking our garbage across the boarder to Michigan is a volatile solution at best.  The moment relations between our countries change, the moment "terror" levels increase, and the moment some dumbass decides to smuggle a  tonne  of weed across the border, we run the risk of having essentially no where to put our garbage.  The border can, and has been, closed at the drop of a hat with no warning at all.  Marijuana may scare the hell out of the Americans, but their response to it should scare the hell out of Torontonians.  This isn't an issue that affects "trade" or "business" or some other "not me" organization.  It's a very real issue that is facing residents of this city who will have to pay dearly to dispose of the mountains garbage that they produce every single day.  How will your normally silent mayoral candidates deal with the Province, Michigan, and the American government on this issue?

       Child Sex   Here's the story headline from the Star:  MSN to shut chat rooms over child sex fears  Was "pedophilia" or "pedophile" to big of a word?  Was it too confusing of a word?  I can never tell if these headlines are structured simply to "catch the eye" or if they're meant to convey meaning in a short space, and therefore must use short words.  The issue here is that Microsoft is ending a free "chat" service, to help curb online pedophiles from luring young chatters into a situation where they can be taken advantage of.  "Child sex" doesn't exactly convey that meaning, and it's hardly a term that's used often.

       Paper Colours   Perhaps the blue box should turn itself red, and the red box should turn itself blue...  Here's an clip from the Sun's editorial this morning: Eves showed guts and tenacity in the televised leaders' debate, competently defending the Tory record, clearly explaining why tax cuts are important for ordinary Ontarians and concisely arguing why keeping kids in school by outlawing teacher strikes, work-to-rule campaigns and board lockouts is sound public policy.  And here's a clip from the Star's Editorial this morning: The real contest was between McGuinty and Eves, and in that arena the Liberal leader looked poised, confident and was quick on his feet. Gone, for the most part, was the hesitancy that left him looking out of his depth in the 1999 debate with former premier Mike Harris and Hampton.  At the same time, Eves, who has been premier for almost a year-and-a-half, appeared grim, testy and aggressive in trying to attack McGuinty's platform while avoiding questions about his own record and where he would cut more programs and in defending his fiscal record.

       Dumbass question   From the  urlLink Star's lightning coverage  of the provincial debate: The only televised leaders' debate of the Ontario election campaign kicked off tonight with a pointed question about the mudslinging that has so far characterized the campaign.  I DON'T CARE!!   The point about being pissed off that mudslinging occurs during a political campaign, is that it  wastes time .  The time that candidates are using to personally attack, or discredit other candidates is time that they could be debating their position on the issues.  The fact that someone asks a question about  whether  candidates are leading mud stained campaigns  wastes even more time!!

       Lastman on the TTC   Well, that was quick.  Yesterday I asked if anyone had ever actually seen Mel Lastman riding the TTC in a non-photo op situation.  David Artemiw saw not only Lastman, but his wife Marilyn as well, on the Yonge line at Eglinton station.  Artemiw recounts the oddly  urlLink mundane incident here .  As Mel departs, and as the retrospectives start, it's good to remember that while he used his  urlLink privilege in office  to the fullest, he still took The Better Way after hours.  As you may have guessed, I've never actually seen Mayor Lastman riding the rails.  In fact the only politician, local or otherwise, I've ever seen in the TTC was Brad Duguid coming up out of Queen station on his way to City Hall, and let's face it: that's hardly worth writing about....  Now if I were to see, say....Rob Ford on a streetcar you can be damned sure I'd take a picture.

       Remember him, as he was   Today marks the beginning of the final City Toronto council under Mayor Lastman's reign.  Over the next few days, and weeks, the media will be awash with pictures of Mel, both young and old.  There will be parties, final interviews, and events in his honour.  You've really got to hand it to him, he is one of the longest serving mayors in North American history.  He will be remembered as the mayor who fought for improvements in North York under the old metro council.  Some will remember him as the mayor who lost Toronto the summer Olympics after his natives-boiling-missionaries-in-a-pot comment.  He was the mayor who was photographed shaking the hand of a Hell's Angel.  He was the mayor who pushed the TTC to build the Sheppard subway extension.  He was the mayor who announced to the media that locals 416 and 79 are unions who "hate children", after a municipal worker's strike closed pools during the summer of 2002.  He was the mayor who asked for help from the Canadian military after a major snow storm, and was laughed at by the rest of the country.  He was the only Canadian mayor to be lampooned on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.    My favorite Lastman moment was immortalize on April 24, 2003 during CNN's "Newsnight with Aaron Brown" when the following exchange took place between the American host and our mayor: BROWN: Just two other things on that. Major League Baseball said yesterday that they recommend their players not use the public transportation system. I gather you're not very happy about that either?  LASTMAN: No, that's ridiculous. I use it. And I'm going to be using it. And I'm going to be staying at a hotel in Toronto with my wife. And I am going to be going to -- I got to restaurants in Toronto. And I'll be going to more restaurants. I'll be doing a lot of this all next week.  BROWN: And just -- are you at all concerned, you must be somewhat concerned, that you might lose the All-Star game this summer?  LASTMAN: Yes, I am.  BROWN: Yes.  LASTMAN: Toronto is a sports city. And in the past, we've won quite a few championships. And I want to keep winning more. And I want this All-Star game. And we are going -- we are beating this. You know, it's almost gone. We've turned the corner. Our medical officer of health today made a statement, we've turned the corner and all we have to do is go two more weeks and we're all set. For those who missed it, the Major League All-Star game was held in Chicago during the summer of 2003, and if anyone has ever seen Lastman using the TTC in a non-photo-op situation, please email me.  God I'm gonna miss that little pisher.

       Dave?  Would you like fries with that, Dave?   If you watch television, you may have seen commercials for McDonald's "Fries Surprise" game.  I didn't pay attention to the full details but I think its the standard "Buy fries, pull a game piece on the box, possibly win a truck" type game.  The more observant folks out there will notice an URL popping up at least 4 times through the commercial:  On the park bench, on the license plate of the prize truck, and on the TV screen featured at the end.  The URL is  urlLink dugg.ca , and the  urlLink Globe and Mail  noticed it too.  Play with Alex for a while and you'll get a contest form.  As McDonald's isn't promoting this URL, or contest for that matter, in any other way, it seems that they're relying on the all powerful internet blog and forum communities to spread the word.  Seems like a contest, that's actually a test marketing scheme.  Yeah, but you get to win a deep sea fishing trip in Mexico.  Or a trip to the NHL all star game...

       Komedy with Kafka   The good people at McSweeny's have another amazing piece available for your consumption.   KAFKA AT CAMP: THE LOST DIARIES.  June 16, 1897First night at Camp Schelsen. Underneath my top bunk, as I write this, Herbie Willenberg is looking at naked pictures of women with names like Helga and Ute. I loathe his very existence, but at the same time the sight of the women without their clothes fascinates me. Herbie breathes heavily. He struggles ambiguously underneath the covers. The counselors, with their muscles and their short shorts, giggle knowingly. They don't care. That's what boys his age do. They look at me with much heavier gazes. My existence perplexes them. Throws off their sense of the universe. I understand how they feel. The rest can be  urlLink found here .

       Rumours   I thought  urlLink this  was kind of funny: "I know the other camps would like to see me not be in the race. But I can give you my unqualified, solemn commitment that my name will be on the ballot; I will be there," Nunziata said, adding: "And let me tell you another thing: The Nunziatas are not quitters. I'm not a quitter." There's just something very white trash about envoking your family name to emphasize the abstract.  Is there something inherently "un-quitter" about Nunziata?  Does it imply that other families quit on a regular basis?  Perhaps it's YOUR family that are all quitters, but it's certainly not the Nunziatas; The Nunziatas are not quitters.

       Disconnect   When did " urlLink Disconnect " become a noun?  I've heard this term a lot recently, and I'm not sure when it became so popular.    I've heard it in the context of civic pride: "There's a disconnect between 'wanting a clean city' and 'throwing litter on the ground'", implying that the people who litter are the same people who complain about litter. In a political context: "There's a disconnect between 'tax cuts' and 'putting money into social programs' in the recent provincial election campaign." Do we have a definition for this term?  Is it the same as, or is it a bastardization version of, "cognitive dissonance"?

       Attention.  Attention.    urlLink Sounds Like Canada  (CBC radio one 10:00 till 11:45) is running a Bernie St. Laurent piece about the lack of youth interest in politics. Sounds Like Canada's Bernie St. Laurent presents a special piece looking at why there is such low voter turnout amoung young people in Canada. If you miss it, email  urlLink Sounds Like Canada  and ask them to post the file on their website.  The study that was mentioned in the piece can be  urlLink found here .  And a return to one of my  urlLink first posts here .  Shift (who I think are out of business again...)  urlLink ran an article  on youth political apathy back in April.

       Nunziata gets all paranoid   First there was  urlLink the story  about John freaking out on City councilor Peter Milczyn at the Taste of the Kingsway a few weekends ago.  Then at the "Your Next Mayor" CBC debate, Nunziata drew open laughs from the live audience in the Glen Gould studio when he announced that "I don't think this audience is representative of the residents of the City of Toronto".  At last night's  urlLink mayoral debate held at Osgoode Hall , Nunziata again showed his comedic talents when he suggested an unholy alliance between Barbara Hall and David Miller.  Suggesting that a Machiavellian agreement had been formed which would result in Miller pulling out of the election, running for councilor, and then being appointed deputy mayor under Barbara Hall.  John, buddy.  Just calm down, and listen to the sound of my voice, ok man?    Maintain......Maintain.....What you're seeing isn't real.....You're safe....Maintain....Drink some water.....

       Still confused about blogging?   Perhaps Paul Martin can  urlLink explain it to you . What is a blog?  No, its not a swamp creature. Its a term used to describe an internet trend that has exploded over the last decade. A blog is a small web page made up of short, regularly updated messages that are arranged in chronological order  like a whats new page, or a journal.  The man credited with inventing the World Wide Web, Oxford scholar and research scientist Tim Berners-Lee, is said to be the first to keep a blog back in 1992, although he didnt realize it at the time. It wasnt until five years later, in 1997, that a man named Jorn Barger actually coined the term weblog, which has since been shortened to simply blog. (Get it??) Barger is said to have paved the way for most bloggers, as the authors of these sites are known, and his blog site, Robot Wisdom, is considered one of the most visited and comprehensive individual blogs in existence. (Netscape also introduced a Whats New page in 1993 that would later be identified as a blog. It also exploded in popularity).  The authors and purposes of blogs vary. A blog could be Joe Citizen  or a group of Joe Citizens  simply wanting to vent about something. Or it could contain commentary and links about whats on the web. It could be ongoing news about a person or idea, or it could even be a photo, essay or poetry blog. Whatever the purpose, they are characterized by the fact that they are typically focused around a single subject, an underlying theme or a unifying concept, and have a high concentration of repeat visitors.

       A rip in reality   Where is reality at it's thinnest?  Here's the situation.  This morning I was in a meeting, in a room with tile floor and chairs with little plastic casters on the legs.  While someone was speaking a chair slipped back and made a noise that was identical to the noise my alarm clock makes.  For a split second I had no idea whether the meeting would dissolve and I would wake up in my bed.  If you had been in the meeting, you'd have understood my silent desperation to have it dissolve, but unfortunately it didn't.  It's so strange that a little sound like a chair scraping across a tile floor could cause me to question whether everything around me was real, or simply a construct of my mind.  The philosophers in the audience will be quick to remind me that I should always be questioning whether everything around me is real or simply a construct of my mind, but that's a debate for another post.

       The Motion of the Ocean   Like every good Canadian, I was tuned to CBC Newsworld for an hour and a half yesterday afternoon.  The  urlLink CBC muppet  was reminding viewers that a vote on the Alliance motions regarding the definition of marriage would begin in a few minutes, so my brother and I watched the vote.  For those of you who missed it here's the original Canadian Alliance motion tabled in the House yesterday afternoon: "That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of public debate around recent court decisions, to reaffirm that marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, and that Parliament take all necessary steps within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to preserve this definition of marriage in Canada.'' Later in the day, the Alliance tabled an amendment to their own motion, creating this text: "That, in the opinion of this House, it is necessary, in light of public debate around recent court decisions, to reaffirm that marriage is and should remain the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. Why?  The rest of the text of the original motion: "..and that Parliament take all necessary steps within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to preserve this definition of marriage in Canada." implied that the House should use the  urlLink Notwithstanding clause   even if  the Supreme Court of Canada allows the constitutionality of same-sex marriage.  The Alliance was essentially asking the House to overturn the Supreme Court's upcoming decision if they ruled "in favour of" same sex marriage.  It was a pretty impressive move on the Alliance's part.  Their amendment basically removed the potential use of the Notwithstanding clause, and simply asked the House to vote on whether they believe that marriage is an exclusively straight institution.  The Alliance "softened" the motion by removing the use of the notwithstanding clause, in hopes of swaying any members who were in favour of exclusively straight marriage, but against the use of the controversial clause on this matter.  Then came the vote.  The first vote was basically asking 'Are you in favour of the amendment to the motion?'  The house was divided 134-134, and procedure gave the tie breaking vote to the Speaker of the House, who voted against the motion.  If I understand correctly, the speaker basically "hardened" the Alliance motion.  He made the house decide on both their stance on same-sex marriage AND the possible use of the Notwithstanding clause on this issue, in the same vote.    The next vote was on the original text of the Alliance motion (as the amendment to the text was defeated by one vote), and that's the one that came out 132-137.  For someone who barely understands Parliamentary procedure, it was quite an entertaining hour and a half.

       Last night's debate   A friend of mine was asking if I attended the mayoral debate last night at the Harbourfront Community Centre.  I did not attend, but Mr. Andrew Spicer did, and here is his  urlLink very thorough review  of the proceedings,with a great quote from Miller as Spicer remembers it: At City Hall, Jane Jacobs was shouted down. David Crombie was heard, and he said that he doesn't blame the workers because they are fighting for jobs, he doesn't blame the airline promoters because they are trying to make a business, but it is the job of the city councilors to protect the public interest.  Tonight, it was hard to stand up against the people here fighting for their jobs and their union. But, the public interest is for everybody. There are only so many opportunities to make a city great, and our opportunity is here.  This issue is not just for downtown voters. Anyone who will sell-out the downtown neighbourhood will sell-out any neighbourhood. I spent my evening star-gazing at a local bar.  Two good friends had their reality show hosting debut, and I couldn't miss it.

       Differences of Opinion   Provincial Liberal advisor  urlLink Warren Kinsella  posts his thoughts about politics, and world affairs.  His blog is certainly worth reading during this, or any, election.  You may recognize the name from the  urlLink media allegations  that it was Kinsella who phoned TCDSB chief Joseph Carnevale and told him to rip up his Liberal membership card.  Kinsella (as you can see from his most recent musing) vehemently denies the allegation.   urlLink David Artemiw  takes a gander at the issues from the right side of the stage.  Also worth a read, and I must say I like the colours on his page.  Enjoy.

       The Lexicon   I've heard the following term at least 3 times today for some reason:   "It's currently with legal"   The broader defintion is that the report, code, or by-law is currently under review in the legal department of an organization.  I think that it should be a euphamism, on par with "the cheque is in the mail" or "Thursday is the deadline for submissions".  It has universal appeal:  "My car is currently with legal" - I lost my licence/car was impounded.  "Where is it?  Well it's currently with legal" - I know it's late and I haven't even started it.  "I believe it's with legal" - I have no idea where it is.  "His mind is currently with legal" - absentmindedness.  "I'm currently with legal" - I'm really stoned.

       Remembering John.  Forgetting Irony.   Below, the readers of the  urlLink Toronto Star , remember Actor/Comedian John Ritter:   "He was good entertainment for everyone, especially in the times we are facing."  "I will always remember John Ritter best for his brilliant performance on Three's Company. I also enjoyed the movies that he did and also thought that 8 Simple Rules was a great comeback for him. Most of all, I will remember John Ritter for his kind eyes and gentle smile. Today the world has lost some of the laughter it so desperately needs at this time."  "He made us laugh, he made us smile; but no one is laughing or smiling now without his company on our television sets. God Bless him, his family, and friends."  "He was good entertainment for everyone, especially in the times we are facing."   It has become clear that:  a) We are living in difficult/chaotic times. b) We need humour to help us feel better about the world. c) John Ritter, apparently, made us feel better about the world.  Seriously now.  John Ritter.  The guy who played Jack Tripper on Three's Company.  The guy who starred in the Problem Child movies.  The guy who was third in line behind Howard Hesseman, and Drew Carey any time ABC needed a host for a TV sitcom retrospective show.  Will there be an equal outpouring of grief for Problem Child co-star Gilbert Godfried?  Will Pauly Shore be remembered as "one of the greatest comedians of all time"?  Says one reader "Three's Company was just one show that people tuned in to in order to escape from the politics of the day. It was the age of innocence."  Yeah.  The late 1970s was truly the age of innocence.

       Well isn't this nice   Yesterday's  urlLink press release  from John Nunziata indicating that he'll spend the night in a homeless shelter.   urlLink Today's story  that indicates that homeless shelters aren't to be used for political campaigning.  I love this quote though:   "Frankly I don't know what they have to hide here at Seaton House,"  Nunziata said.  John's right.  They wouldn't let him sleep there so they must be hiding something.  Government waste perhaps?  Proposals for property tax increases?  Perhaps Barbara Hall was spending the night there.....  Come on Seaton House.  What are you hiding?  So John didn't get to sleep at the men's shelter.  He got to sleep at home, in bed, with his wife.  Maybe Mr. Nunziata would offer a sort of homeless exchange program where he'd get to sleep in a shelter, and some guy would get to sleep the night in Nunziata's bed?

       The Red Box   Our Sun has quite the selection in their news index this morning.   urlLink Check it out  today on the 12th, because it won't be there tomorrow.  Let see....we've got a few stories about 9/11 ceremonies, a story about a dog who was shot at a resort, and this excerpt from the coverage of Eves' assertion that McGuinty's Liberals voted against the Taxpayer Protection Act: MIXED MESSAGE   Both parties supported passage of the Taxpayers Protection Act in 1999.   The law requires that budgets be balanced and any proposed tax hikes (other than tobacco tax) be put to voters in a referendum or prior to a general election.   But former Tory finance minister Jim Flaherty dismissed the significance of yesterday's event, saying McGuinty is giving voters contradictory messages.   "Dalton in one breath is saying 'I won't raise taxes.' In the other breath he has a platform that requires he repeal tax reductions that are already the law in Ontario," Flaherty said.   Williamson conceded he'd rather see McGuinty go ahead with the Tories' planned tax cuts, but said the Liberals are obeying the act by announcing their plans prior to an election. The contradictory message that McGuinty is giving to the voters of the province is that he supports the Taxpayer Protection Act, and on the other hand, that he supports the Taxpayer Protection Act.  Broken record?

       Ernie Eves   "I find it very intriguing though that Dalton McGuinty, who voted against the Taxpayer Protection Act and has fought it tooth and nail every step of the way, today apparently now says he'll sign a pledge that says he'll live by the Taxpayer Protection Act,"  That bastard McGuinty will raise our taxes and put sugar in our gas tanks.  Not only did he vote against the Taxpayer Protection Act, he did it while voting in favour of the Taxpayer Protection Act.  I know you don't believe me.  urlLink  Look it up for yourself .  Take a quick scan of the "aye"s.  Can you find Ernie Eves' name?  Cognitive dissonance comes home to roost in Ontario.

       In tune with the universe   I was a tuba player in highschool.  I still am, but I don't do the in-unison warm-up scales anymore.  Any tuba player will tell you that their tuning note is B flat, usually 2 octaves below middle C.  If only I had referenced  urlLink this article  in my band-camp years, then perhaps my "I am in complete harmony with creation itself" pick up line would have gotten me more chicks.  Or any, for that matter.  57 ocatves below middle C huh?  I'm pretty sure I can hit it.

       Dueling Editorials   Take the  urlLink red  pill.  "Eves is right on immigration"  Take the  urlLink blue  pill.  "Immigration plan ill-advised, hurtful"  It's always fun when one level of government campaigns on issues that are not within their jurisdiction.  Like municipal candidates talking about health care, or provincial candidates talking about immigration.

       A mayoral debate   Who brings their children to a municipal debate?  Honestly.     We attended the CBC Radio One mayoral debate: "Your Next Mayor" at the Glen Gould studio on Monday Night.  The audience included a lot of tweedy intellectual-types, old people, us, and a 10 year old kid sporting a note pad, sitting beside his old, tweedy, intellectual-type parents.  My girlfriend noted "Oh, he's probably doing a report or something for school."  I thought "Man, that kid's gonna get beaten up at school tomorrow".  The outcome of the debate?  Have you ever heard Barbara Hall speak?  It's not an entertaining event.  In my humble opinion, Miller came out ahead.  He answered questions in a fair and reasonably straightforward fashion.  He did what candidates are supposed to do in a debate, and that's to clarify and defend his position on the issues.  Tory was also a high point of the evening.  The only candidate (at the debate) who has never held a political office, Tory seems to clearly understand the process, the issues, and can provide reasonable arguments for why his solutions will solve our problems.  Jakobek and Nunziata stood their ground firmly on some of the "unpopular" platform planks, and should be commended for their resolve.  The problem with these two candidates in particular was their tendencies to wander away from the question, speak on a campaign pillar, and then loosely tie their answer back to the original question.  Nunziata for example was asked about how, in practical terms, he would increase affordable housing in the City.  He spoke about homelessness, and how he would provide compassionate care to people who need our help.  Which brings us to Ms. Hall.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and compare her, to George W. Bush.  We may have to evoke an adjusted clause of Goodwin's Law....  Hall speaks, like Bush speaks.  There was an observation (in this  urlLink book  if I remember correctly) that all of those little "Bushisms" were caused because Bush was speaking on a subject that he had no interest in or didnt fully understand.  Bushisms like "Reading is the basics for all learning" and "You're working hard to put food on your family" only seemed to occur when Bush spoke about "compassionate" things (family, education, social services, etc).  But when he spoke about a subject that he was passionate about, invading Iraq or corporate tax breaks for instance, all those little flubs and "Bushisms" seemed to disappear, and he spoke like a statesman.  Suddenly he could think on his feet, and answer novel questions.   Hall seemed to suffer from the same problem on Monday night.  When asked how she will deal with the provincial government, she had party line statements like "I will fight for a new deal and I will get that new deal from the province".  When pressed for specifics, it was as though she lost her train of thought mid-sentence and filled her answer with random statements like "red tape" and "work with council" and "look at alternatives".  However, when asked (the final question of the night) about racialized poverty in the city, suddenly she became passionate again and delivered a clear answer.  My girlfriend noted that Hall and Miller generally phrased their responses using terms like I will work with and examine all positions on the matter, while the other candidates used more individually decisive terms like I will make and I will change.  This morning Star columnist  urlLink Royson James  analyzed the debate and noted an issue that wasnt addressed in the debate to any satisfaction:  The fact is, Toronto faces a fiscal nightmare scenario that will greet the new mayor with a budget shortfall approaching $100 million. It has debt levels that are too high, reserve funds that are too low, infrastructure that's old and crumbling and is underfunded by as much as $300 million a year.  Yet, to hear the candidates, they'll just march into city hall and uncover waste and inefficiencies worth millions.

       Geek Speak     Goodwin's Law of Usenet    Professor Goodwin, U of I, in 1981 made the observation that Usenet discussions gravitate downhill.   He postulated that as the length of a discussion thread grows, the probability approaches one (1) that one participant will introduce the terms "Hitler" or "Nazi".   The custom has evolved that the first party to utter "Hitler" or "Nazi" has lost the discussion, and the thread terminates.    Wow.  We should keep note of that one for the two up coming elections in this province.  Any candidate that compares another, or another's policies to Hitler or the Nazis must drop out of the race.

       Babs has to hang on   680 News is reporting that a Superior Court justice is reserving his decision on whether Barbara Hall's campaign "friends" broke the law by raising funds for her campaign.  The decision will be released September 19, and (as 680 News puts it) may cause Barbara Hall to resign from the campaign.  680 News is, as listeners are reminded 8 or 9 times an hour, "a division of  urlLink Rogers Communications ".

       Now I'm all dewy...   If you ever need a reason to love this country, it can be summed up  urlLink here .  The link goes to the online version of Charlottetown P.E.I's daily newspaper "The Guardian".  You will notice, that the motto, or mission statement, or whatever, of the paper is: " The Guardian: Covers Prince Edward Island Like the Dew ".  Can someone tell me why the Toronto Star doesn't have a sentimental motto like that?  Any attempt I can make would just sound cynical: "Covers Toronto like a thick blanket of mid-August smog", or "We're all up ons Toronto".

       Yet another Mayoral Candidate's Website   Ladies and Gentlemen:   urlLink Sexy Alexy.   Aleksandar Glisic (aka  urlLink Aleksandar G. Iceburg ) made his way onto the candidate's list (as well as the links list to the right of these words).  He's a "full blooded  urlLink Icebergman ", and he "has credentials that very few, if any, mayoral candidates may have".  Mr. Glisic does not elaborate on what either of those satements are meant to imply.  Paradoxically Sexy Alexy seems to support Barbara Hall for mayor, as his many  urlLink collages  seem to indicate.  He does, however, have a campaign slogan that all Toronto communities can rally behind: " Mega Toronto Mayor - Teenager in LOVE with Toronto - G. Aleksandar ".  While he may not be Toronto's leading candidate for mayor, he just might be Toronto's only schizophrenic candidate for mayor.  Or at least, the only one with a website.

       Let my proclamation go forth   I formally call on Donald Sutherland to be our national voice-over.  Have you seen that Mike Wier Bell commercial on TV?  That's Donald Sutherland's voice filling you with a sense of national pride.  It would start subtly enough....   2004-5:   Sutherland does further work for Bell, recording his voice for all Bell teleprompts.  A 3 month promotional campaign for a "Donald Sutherland will record your outgoing message" contest, sends residential customers into a frenzy.   2005-6:   The CBC hires Sutherland to be the voice of the 1:00pm national time signal synchronization.   2007-9:   Sutherland 's voice goes national again, when he's contracted by the government to do the voice-over work for various federal department television commercials.  Heath Canada in particular.   2010:   Donald Sutherland replaces Paul Martin as the Member from LaSalleEmard, after Martin dies from a heart attack in his sleep.  At a hastily assembled convention a week later, Liberal party members unanimously elect Sutherland the leader of the party and thereby Prime Minister of Canada.   2011:   After calling an election a scant 5 months after being appointed to the PMO, Sutherland hits the campaign trail.  Canada is the subject of international attention when it is swept into what supporters call "Sutherland-o-rama".  Notable campaign slogans include "Canada's Voice" and "Voice of Reason", and help the Federal Liberals clinch another majority government.   2011-5:  Donald Sutherland serves as Prime Minister of Canada.  Canadian Industry and Culture thrive in harmony.  An aggressive health care initiative takes hold, after Sutherland's first task as Prime Minister, was to enact a law that automatically diverts %50 of all government surplus into social services.  Donald Sutherland's voice will save our country.

       TTC Driver   A little while ago, when King Street track reconstruction was still underway, I caught the 504 in front of my building on Queen Street. As it was a typical downtown rush hour situation, traffic was pretty heavy and it took us 3 lights to move to the corner of Queen and Bay.  The streetcar driver announced Bay street in a unique fashion: Here we are at Bay street, servicing City Hall, and Old City Hall court houses. Parking permits and marriage licences on the left. Parking tickets and divorce court on the right.

       The litterbug's last refuge   Man, smokers really get a bad rap these days....  Smoking,  urlLink littering , spitting, and increased health care burdon.  A  urlLink friend  pointed out  urlLink this article  about smoking at his alma matter.  Seems if you attend or work at Dalhousie University in Halifax, you are now required to leave campus to smoke.  We had a similar policy at my highschool, but then Parkside didn't exactly take up much real estate in the neighbourhood.    It comes down to "smokers out".  Perhaps Johns  urlLink Tory  or  urlLink Nunziata  would adopt a similar policy to compliment their "no criminals in Toronto" policing plans.

       Yet another election   God knows you people don't want to hear about ANOTHER election, but I thought I'd throw this one out in the media awareness file.  Actually I guess it would be in the "logical consistancy" file.  I just got "MSNBC" on cable and I celebrated by watching " urlLink Buchanan and Press " last night when I got home from school.   urlLink Pat Buchanan  was interviewing  urlLink Pat Robertson , and thanks to the good people at  urlLink The Drudge Report  I have a small excerpt of their conversation:   Pat Buchanan:     LET ME TAKE ANOTHER PROMINENT CANDIDATE, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. HE IS PRO ABORTION HE IS PRO GAY RIGHTS, HE'S GOT A LIFESTYLE WE COULD CALL BODYBUILDIER LIFESTYLE THAT YOU'VE BEEN READING ABOUT PAT ROBERTSON SHOULD CHRISTIANS IN GOOD CONSCICENCE, CAN THEY VOTE FOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER?     Pat Robertson:    WELL YOU KNOW, I'M A BODY BUILDER. I DO SOME PRETTY HEAVY WEIGHTLIFTING, SO I THINK THE WEIGHTLIFTERS OF THE WORLD NEED TO UNITE. I TELL YOU WHAT THOSE GUYS IN CALIFORNIA COULD USE A BIG BRUISER TO KNOCK SOME HEADS TOGETHER. I MEAN THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL OVER THERE. SO WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? I MEAN YOU GONNA HAVE BUSTAMANTE WHO IS SORT OF THE GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS LITE? THEY DONT WANT ANYMORE DAVIS, SO WHO ELSE YOU GONNA PUTT IN? I THINK YOU DONT HAVE ANYBODY ELSE THAT'S COMING UP ON THE RADAR SO THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS JUST STAY HOME   Some things to keep in mind:  1)  Pat Robertson is a body builder.  2)  Arnold Schwarzenegger has not identified himself as "Christian" in this campaign at all.  3)  Pat Robertson identifies himself as a Christian, as well as a spiritual leader to Christians.  4)  As a Christian Pat Robertson would normally condemn Schwarzenegger's past, personal behaviour, and would normally continue to condemn Schwarzenegger should he refuse to confess his sins and show remorse for them.  5)  Pat Robertson endorses Arnold Schwarzenegger for Governer of California.

       For the love of Cancer Research   If you're in Toronto, and you are a fan of  urlLink Derringer  in the Morning on Q107 you may have heard an interview yesterday morning with two representatives from the Terry Fox Foundation plugging the Terry Fox run on the 14th of September.  The  urlLink Terry Fox Foundation  has a really convenient online pledge form, so as long as a participant is registered in the system you can donate to their total online.  If you know someone who's running, check if his or her name  urlLink is on the list .  If you're not going to collect pledges yourself, you might consider donating to this very worthy cause.  Fans of  urlLink Derringer in the Morning  can choose between  urlLink Ryan  and  urlLink Craig.   Fans of this blog might consider donating to the pledge total of a  urlLink cancer survivor  who has been part of  urlLink Terry's Team  for about 7 years now.  He ain't heavy.

       The Armchair Torturer   The text from the "Speak Out" forum on  urlLink thestar.com  today:    Musical torture  First they used heavy metal to rattle Manuel Noriega. Now there are reports that U.S. forces have used the Sesame Street theme - played over and over at excruciating volume - to disorient Iraqi prisoners prior to interrogation. The moral implications of this practice aside, what song or music would you use to irritate your enemies? Just so we're clear, we're not talking about playing music at high volume and shining bight lights into a compound in Waco Texas here.  We're talking about playing loud,  urlLink crappy music to prisoners of war  prior to their individual interrogations.  The Toronto Star is asking for your input.  They're asking how you, the reader, would torture someone.  I'm all for pushing the envelope, and being a little controversial, but really.  Torture?  Just try to remember this little tongue-in-cheek forum topic the next time the editors express their moral outrage over something that's meant to be a joke.    If I know the Star's  urlLink Speak Out  section there will be a few responses from people who think the Eves' government is going too far with cuts to education, some who include unintentional irony in their statement, and at least one guy who thinks that welfare recipients should "get off their collective duffs" and earn their cheques by torturing Iraqi prisoners.

       Trashy Column   If you accidentally dropped your four bits into the red box instead of the blue one this morning, you may have noted Sue-Ann Levy's column about litter.   urlLink Here's the link , but because the Sun chooses to not archive it's content, I doubt you'll be able to find it in a week or two.  Levy concedes improvement in the City's response to litter, noting clean sidewalks and increased fines for "littering swine".  But what would a columnist be without grandstand complaining, and misattributed blame?  Says Levy: Last week, I noticed trash bins supplied by OMG Media filled to overflowing in Yorkville and a general state of filthiness throughout downtown - as if the recent power blackout gave everyone an excuse (city workers included) to let our streets slide. I'm not really interested in much of that.  Here's the part that I am interested in though: In a campaign that has so far been short on good ideas and long on trash talk directed mostly at the present regime, only one candidate - John Tory - has come up with a well-thought-out plan to clean up Hogtown.   To his credit, Tom Jakobek has addressed the issue although not in as detailed a way as Tory. Barbara Hall, the frontrunner, has talked vaguely of a spring cleanup and her leftist opponent, David Miller, keeps yapping about wiping the City Hall corridors clean of lobbyists and special interest groups (it seems the unions he's cozied up to are not in the special interest category). John Nunziata's proposals are yet to come.   Tory's plan - called "Pick Up Toronto!" - has legs, in my view, because it operates from the premise that if the city is clean, residents (and visitors) will be less inclined to litter (a concept that seems to have eluded the present regime at City Hall).   "The most often mentioned issue (as I campaign) is the lack of cleanliness of the city," Tory told me in a recent interview. "People feel if the city looks like a pigsty, it's probably run the same way ... the books are not in order." Let me type that out so everyone gets it:  " People feel if the city looks like a pigsty, it's probably run the same way ... the books are not in order ." - John Tory  That's good quality logic there.  That's the kind of logic that should be running this City.  Here's how it breaks down: If "A" then "whatever the hell I feel like saying".    Folks, litter is truly a non-issue.  It's political smokescreen.  It's the "tax cuts" and "Jobs Jobs Jobs" of municipal politics.  Let's say that a new council is elected and tough-on-litter policies are enacted and enforced.  Let's imagine that these new policies are so effective that Ms. Levy and her columnist colleagues are duly satisfied with the results.  What then?  Will an administration that campaigned its way into City Hall on litter be willing to act decisively to resurrect a financially embattled TTC?  Will they provide solutions to calls for safer communities?  Will they commit to an effective long-term infrastructure maintenance plan?  Will they have any idea where to put the litter once its been picked up off the ground?  Probably not, but the sidewalks will be pretty.    Maybe I'm completely misguided.  I'd ask my fellow city residents to carefully examine all of the issues in the campaign and decide what they'd like answers on.  If litter is at the top of that list then hell, lets go for it.  Let's pour effort, manpower and money into the problem until we've got it solved.  Let's host that International Litter Conference that Brad Duguid is going on about.  Let's employ 1500 students next summer to clean up this one horse town.  But if we dont ask our leadership candidates for real, practical solutions to our Citys problems, then how will we know which of them to put in charge?  If we listen to mayoral candidates droning about ethics and leadership and integrity and refuse to ask them about their plans for our City then we can have Jesus Christ himself chairing council meetings, but it doesnt necessarily follow that hell know how to run a City effectively.  I tend to agree with Levy on this one.  This is "a campaign that has so far been short on good ideas and long on trash talk".  We need to decide the issues that are important to us, and demand real answers from our mayoral candidates before November 10.

       Are you ready??!!   Break out the spreadsheets and lawn signs because we've got a  urlLink provincial election , y'all.  Man, I'm totally gonna vote for that guy with the tie because some of the stuff he says, really speaks to me.    And also, I don't like the other guy.  You know, the one with the weird look on his face all the time?  I don't think the stuff that he talks about will be good for the Province at all.  He'll probably want to raise taxes and stuff, and that's not good because taxes take money away from the people.  And the other guy.  I don't know much about him so I'm not going to vote for him.  He should do a better job next time about getting his name out there, because lots of my friends don't even know who that guy is, so he's not getting our vote.

       Welcome to September   I flipped my  urlLink NOW  magazine calendar this morning at my desk.  I won it, while standing in line for opera tickets last January.  The pictures on the calendar are all NOW cover images from 2002.  All celebrities, local or otherwise, and all black and white photography.  April was Woody Allen.  August was Sam Roberts.    September is Ron Jeremy.  Wearing a white suit, with windswept hair on the top of a building in Toronto.  Holding a fake, plastic rooster in his left hand.  At the bottom of each calendar month is a quote from the currently pictured celebrity:  " Let me see John Gielgud do Hamlet with a boner.  It's not easy. " - Porn actor Ron Jeremy.  My closest (geographically) colleague's desk calendar features sad looking, adoptable cats and dogs for the SPCA.  Another has a Gary Larson calendar because "That guy is so funny.  I don't know why he ever stopped drawing cartoons.  He's so funny".  Over the course of a month colleagues, and managers drift to my desk to ask about work, or input on projects.  Each month, when met with yet another featured celebrity that they've never heard of, I am required to explain.  "Him?  Oh he's Sam Roberts.  He's a musician from Montreal."  "Oh.  Ok.  Why do you have a calendar of him?"  "It's a calendar of cover's from NOW magazine...."  "Wow.  That's weird."  I may deny knowledge of the current celebrity, and see who recognizes him over the course of a month.  The hedgehog continues to headline, on floor 25.

But I must revisit it now, to appologize to whoever typed " urlLink prostate armchair " into google and found this blog in the top 6 matched sites.  I am forced to imagine a kindly but serious man who is dealing with the fear and pain of prostate cancer for the first time.  He's probably also dealing with the internet as a valuble resource for a wide variety of medical advice, for the first time.  I am sure he'd just heard about a new, more comfortable, livingroom chair designed for people undergoing radiation therapy.  He must have thought he could find some advice about his afliction.  I am ashamed to say that he saw this:       urlLink The  Armchair  Garbageman  ... Now....I can't imagine a guy, particularily in his early 20's, saying: "Frequent masturbation will lower my risk of  prostate  cancer ... posted by Armchair | 9:09 AM ...   armchairgarbageman.blogspot.com/ 2003_07_01_armchairgarbageman_archive.html - 70k -   urlLink Cached  -  urlLink Similar pages        I'm sorry.  I'm sorry if you were shocked.  I'm usually a nice guy.

       Whack the mayor   The good people at  urlLink "The James Gang Inc."  have blessed us with a flash game to " urlLink ward off election night boredom ".   urlLink Whackthemayor.ca  takes some (slightly modified) candidate's answers to popular questions and asks the player to "Whack" the one with the wackiest answer.  They say the game's participants are "whacking" mayors in order and mirroring recent polls for the top job.  The stats of who gets whacked last are  urlLink here .  Something to do on lunch hour I guess....

       The Nun speaks out   I'm a little confused this morning.   urlLink Here's Mr. Nunziata's  (edited) comments to the Star editorial board yesterday.  I've picked out a couple of Q and As just so I can spread the confusion around a little.    Q: Don't you think that at this point in the campaign the public deserves to know which campaign made the approach?  A: Yes, it was the John Tory camp, I was told. I have no direct knowledge of that.  Pardon?  So if he says it was the Tory camp, then how does he have no knowledge that it was the Tory camp?  If he's relying on someone else to identify the source of the bribe offer, then shouldn't he make damned sure he has first hand knowledge of the subject of his accusation?    Q: And what about the offer to be deputy mayor?  A: That was before that date, that was before the 25th -- actually, that was conveyed to me after, but the request was made of a friend of mine to convey a message to me, and he didn't, until after the fact.   Wha....what?  Jesus, I need a flow chart or something here.  If anyone needs an example of poli-speak then I'd offer the Nun's answer to that question.  This guy is a lawyer right?    Q: How do you draw the line?  A: I'll let others draw the line. It's quite one thing if you're a leadership candidate, or you're a candidate in the election and there's a debt afterwards that people help to retire the debt as a magnanimous gesture, for whatever reason. ... The timing of this is no accident. ... I'm not alleging criminal wrongdoing ... I provided this information to the police for them to make an assessment ... This was clearly an inducement. I've never categorized this as a bribe.  Ok, he's not alleging criminal wrongdoing.....and it wasn't a bribe.  It was an inducement.  Clearly.    Q: You are responsible for the timing. You waited three weeks.  A: Did I deliberately wait three weeks? I mishandled it. Mea culpa, mea culpa. What more do you want me to say?  God, he's sounding more and more like Lastman every day.  Or at least Jakobek....    Q: Can you elaborate?  [on whether Nunziata thinks that his ethnicity works against him as a result of the power structure in this city.]  A: Geez, you guys really want to ... It's funny, I was asked at the beginning of the campaign by a journalist, "Do you think Toronto is ready for an Italian mayor?" and I laughed. I mean, I saw what happened last week with this situation. There appeared to be a closing of the ranks. I heard the phrase several times about a "powerful family," trying to take on a "powerful family" in Toronto. I was at the Rosedale ratepayers meeting and outside I had a conversation with a judge ... we talked about whether the crowd reflected the new face of Toronto, and it clearly didn't. And I think my comment was that the group in there was in the minority, and he looked at me and shook his head and said, "Yes, but a powerful minority."  This isn't 1930s Toronto here.  This isn't the frickin' Christie Pits riot.  Is Toronto ready for an Italian mayor?  What kind of question is that?    What kind of message is Mr. Nunziata sending by perpetuating the  relevance  of his ethnicity?  Does anyone in this city give a flying rat's ass about whether this guy is of Italian decent or not?  His sister is from the same family and she's been on council for years.  We just had a Jewish man as mayor for the past 2 terms, so should we be nominating ourselves for a Peace Prize because we're so bloody tolerant?  We had two women serve as mayor in back to back terms, so should we be falling over ourselves about how progressive and inclusive we are?  I'm floored.  I think I'm going to go back to bed.   Update: The Star's Royson James examines Nunziata's wandering narraitive in his  urlLink column today .  It's a great column, but after Nunziata's comments one has to wonder if Toronto is ready for a "black" columnist....  (Just in case there's any doubt, that comment was intended to be ironic.  God help me, but irony doesn't always translate well in text.)

       If you missed it yesterday   John Tory's statement before the  urlLink Canadian Club  (the prestigious old boy's hangout, not the rye): "If the police find that there is any evidence that anybody in a position of responsibility in my campaign or me had anything to do with any amount of money being offered or with any appointments being offered, I will step down from the race," So who would be in a "position of responsibility" in Tory's campaign?

       Springfield's "Mayor" "Diamond" Joe Quimby promises an "Animated" campaign   How do you put a tongue in cheek on paper?    Use quotes.  Lots of them.  Like in this press release from the Comedy Network: TORONTO, Oct. 23 /CNW/ - "Diamond" Joe Quimby flat-out denies being the individual that allegedly offered a six-figure bribe to opponent John Nunziata to withdraw his candidacy for Toronto's mayor, he announced today.     "Hey, I'm in the business of taking bribes, not making them," the "colourful" candidate said.     In the same breath, Quimby announced his last-minute candidacy for mayor. "Better late than never, huh?" Quimby's Web site, www.votequimby.ca, will go live tomorrow and will offer platform information as well as free campaign buttons to supporters.     A mayor of Springfield for at least nine terms ("Hey, who's counting?" he says), Quimby promises to make his run for the big show in Toronto an "animated" race.     Forget about incinerators, island airports and highway tolls ("Bo-ring," says Quimby), the mayoral hopeful's platform rests on putting the "O" back in "Toronto" (whatever the hell that means). Quimby supports a casino in the city ("So I can grow fat off kick backs and slush funds"), a gas tax to fund a City Hall happy hour, and a registry for lobbyists ("It's always good to know where the money is.")     Known to viewers of The Simpsons as "an illiterate, tax-cheating, wife- swapping, pot-smoking, spend-o-crat," Quimby says he has cleaned up his act. "I am no longer illiterate," he said.     Knowing that he won't be invited to any all-candidates debates, Quimby has purchased airtime on The Comedy Network in the days leading up to the municipal election. His "Vote Quimby-a-Thon" will air during Friday, Nov. 7 through Monday, Nov. 10 at 9 p.m. ET on The Comedy Network. More information can be found at  urlLink www.votequimby.ca .

       What is the attraction of public life?   You know, there are times when I have to scratch my head and ask myself what I'm doing.    You know, it's tough being in public office.  Especially if you're the type of person, like me, that wants to make a decision and wants to do things differently, and make things better.  You have the media to contend with.  You're supposed to be a perfect person, even though you're not.  And you're not allowed the simplest of mistakes; And let me tell you, I've made mistakes.    No I think the attraction of public life isn't to get a better job.  It's a calling.    It's something inside you that says "I've got to do this because it needs to be done", and because you really believe that you're the person who can make it a better place.  I think that's what has lured me into it.  I think that's what's kept me busy for 25 years.  I think that's what's going to motivate me to be mayor of Toronto.    Vote Tom Jakobek for Mayor on November 10, 2003.  (You can watch Mr. Jakobek speak these words by clicking  urlLink here for Windows Media Player  or  urlLink here for Quicktime Media )

       Big Week in the Tory Camp   Watch it  urlLink closely here .  His press announcement today specified that Tory "will fulfill a series of commitments as mayor or not seek re-election."  So basically, if we elect him mayor, and he doesn't do what he said he was going to do, he promises that he won't try to trick us into re-electing him mayor again, in 4 years time.  But what if we like being lied to and abused by our mayor?  Can't we please, please re-elect him?  No.    That's John Tory's solemn promise.  If he doesn't fulfill a series of commitments (that will be released over the course of this week) then he won't give Torontonians an opportunity to vote for him the next time round.  He simply won't run.  Seems like a good idea.  I mean a politician who will self-evaluate his own actions and decide whether he will bless us with the opportunity to vote for him as incumbent...    Shouldn't that choice be up to us?  Shouldn't we decide whether an elected official has fulfilled his commitments in office, and shouldn't we then decide whether he will represent us again?  No.  John Tory will make that decision for you.  He's smarter then you are anyway.

       31 minutes, 33 seconds   That's how long it took this fat ass to climb to the top of the CN tower.  There are 146 total stairwells in the part of the tower that we climbed (the distance between the ground and the main pod of the tower).  Once you get to the "top" there's volunteers and someone who will stamp you time card.  Everyone is panting and thanking Christ that it's all over, but it's not.  To get to the elevator you have to climb 10 more sets of stairs....  That alone was a kick in the balls.  The more athletic types on my team climbed it in times between 16 and 28 minutes.  I was the slowest of the group.  The record is something like 7 and a half minutes or some other ungodly number.  I think I'm going to have a nap.....

       Highway Robbery   Ok this is getting  urlLink a little weird ...  Is there really nothing in Miller's actual platform that Tory can pick at?  Are we really reduced to bad photoshoping techniques and phrases like "the man behind the mask and his Saturday night at the saloon approach to spending your hard earned tax dollars."  Is Kinsella thinking this stuff up?  Or is it Tory himself?

       If the first story wasn't garbage enough, here's more for you   Great, now Ashcroft's involved.  apparently Toronto garbage is a  urlLink terrorist threat .  Or at least a threat to American Homeland Security.    Michigan legislators drafted a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking them to investigate the process by which garbage is imported across the boarder.  They cite recent "drug" and "medical waste" shipments that were hidden in Canadian garbage trucks.  Once again, we are coming to a crisis point with our garbage.  2 of the top 3 candidates insist that we can divert our waste to the point where virtually no landfill space will be required.  Neither of those two candidates indicate how long it will take to ramp up their diversion efforts so we can begin a "phase out of garbage to Michigan".  No word yet if Nunziata was offered a sum of money to dispose of Toronto garbage himself...

       Mr. Nunziata   He says that members of his campaign team were offered a six figure sum of money to have  urlLink Nunziata withdraw from the race .  The offer was alegedly made 3 weeks ago (before the deadline to withdraw from the race) and the offer was made by representatives from another mayoral candidate's team.  As part of the deal, Mr. Nunziata was offered the deputy mayor job.  How much money?  Six figures.  Who offered your team the money?  He's not saying.  He's waiting for those people to come forward.  Why did you wait 3 weeks before saying anything?  He's not saying.

       A story I've been following for a while   I'm torn about linking to myself, but I already wrote out the synopsis  urlLink here .  As of this morning, the  urlLink International Court of Justice  has set the date when it will announce its ruling on Iran v. USA.   urlLink November 6 , which is two weeks tomorrow, will close the case that was originally brought before the court almost 11 years earlier.  We will finally get to hear whether these judges believe that the US was aggressive in its actions on the 19th of October 1987 in the Persian Gulf.  I'm interested in the outcome of the case, but I'm more interested to see what, if any, coverage the story gets in the American media.  Just keep an eye out for it.

       The red box   John Tory's meeting with the Sun's editorial board yesterday sealed their endorsement of his candidacy.  If you love the Sun, you'll love John Tory because the Sun LOVES John Tory.  Here's the text of the editorial this morning  Take a look at John Tory   In the race for Toronto mayor, John Tory has proven that you don't have to be a career politician to mount a credible campaign.   The former Rogers Cable CEO, chairman of the United Way, commissioner of the CFL and principal secretary to Tory premier Bill Davis, is right in the thick of this race.   As the only businessman facing a field of four politicians, he's running, as he himself has put it, to do a job, rather than just to have one.   In his meeting with the Sun editorial board yesterday, Tory also demonstrated that he's actually developed a personality over the years - something he wasn't known for in the past.   We believe his platform is the best of the three main contenders - David Miller, the new frontrunner according to an Environics Poll released yesterday, followed by a fading Barbara Hall and then Tory - in many areas. We like the fact he identifies real waste at City Hall and his commitment to freezing taxes in the second and third year of his mayoralty, while holding them to no more than inflation in the first.   Tory has a realistic plan for getting rid of Toronto's garbage, which includes safe, modern incineration, an idea 70% of the public supports, according to a recent poll. This despite the constant anti-incineration hysteria generated by city politicians who failed to address this issue for years and who absurdly argue we can recycle virtually all of our garbage by 2010.   We agree with Tory's pledge to put 400 more cops on our streets. He's the only one of the top three who isn't anti-car - although he's not pro-road enough for us. We support his idea of private-public partnerships to improve public transit and deliver reliable, efficient services.   That said, we disagree with his refusal to support a bylaw to make it illegal to live on our streets. We worry about his reluctance to prioritize his goals. We fear he has little appreciation of how intransigent the city's powerful trade unions will be to change. And he's far too naive in assuming Liberal PM-in-waiting Paul Martin and Ontario Premier-designate Dalton McGuinty are about to shower Toronto with cash.   Tory now says he would never set up a "kitchen cabinet," even though he was part of one that privately advised Mayor Mel Lastman. Fine by us, but we're alarmed when he says he'd consider advice from the City Summit Alliance, in our view an elitist group with little understanding of the concerns of ordinary taxpayers.   Tory has good political instincts. He needs to trust them more. They like him except for his easy-on-homelessness stance.  If only the two Johns platforms were a little closer, the Sun might be endorsing Nunziata's push for the mayor's office.

       That's a classic stakeout scenario...   Where there's dismissive hope, there's Barbara.  "Statistically, it sounds like a dead heat to me,"  The quote was lifted from a  urlLink Toronto Star  article this morning which looks at yesterday's poll results.  Here's a couple of other choice quotes from the article:  "My ethnic constituencies, Italians, Portuguese, Somalis, Muslims, Catholics, are people who will get out and vote," [Nunziata] said.  "The silk stocking socialists Miller purports to represent just won't be there."  Silk stocking socialists?  His 'ethnic' constituencies?  Come on all you ethnics out there, get out and vote for John.  Put down your pasta forks and skip evening prayers....John Nunziata needs your vote.

       Poll Results Today   Miller has popped out ahead of the decided vote.  Asked "If the municipal election were held today, which ONE of the following would you vote for as mayor of Toronto?", the decided voters (71% of those polled)  31% said Miller  29% said Hall  23% said Tory, and...  11% said Nunziata  2% said Jakobek  4% said someone other then the top 5  A whopping 29% of those polled haven't made up thier minds yet.  Here's the  urlLink Environics release , and here is the text:  Miller pulls ahead of Hall in Toronto Mayor's Race       With 31 percent of decided voters saying they'll vote for Miller, Barbara     Hall's early lead has gone - John Tory remains in third place      TORONTO, Oct. 21 /CNW/ - The results of the latest Environics poll shows that David Miller has edged out Barbara Hall in the race to be Toronto's next mayor. If the municipal election were held today, 31 percent of decided voters would cast their ballot for David Miller, 29 percent would vote for Barbara Hall, and 23 percent would choose John Tory. John Nunziata is a distant fourth, at 11 percent of decided voters, and Tom Jakobek is barely still in the race, with just two percent of the decided vote. Four percent mention other names.      "Clearly, David Miller is the candidate with the most momentum," said Jane Armstrong, Senior Vice President at Environics Research Group. "When we last asked about support for these candidates, Barbara Hall had a commanding lead and David Miller, John Tory and John Nunziata shared a distant second place. However, the race is not over yet. The gap between Mr. Miller and Ms. Hall is still within the margin of error and 24 percent of Toronto residents are still undecided as to whom they would support."      Ms. Armstrong went on to say David Miller's support does seem to be firmer than that expressed for Ms. Hall - his supporters are more likely than are hers to say they are totally certain of their decision and he has a wider lead among those who say they are very likely to vote on November 10. At the same time, however, about half of all decided voters say they are still considering other candidates. Environics' results also indicate that this past Sunday's televised debate among the four leading candidates did little to shift votes in any one direction or to solidify votes for any one candidate.      The above results are based on a survey conducted by telephone between October 17 and 20, among a probability sample of 700 adult residents (aged 18 or older) of the City of Toronto. The sample, which was stratified by gender, is estimated to be accurate within 3.7 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.      The question asked was:     If the municipal election were held today, which ONE of the following would you vote for as mayor of Toronto? READ AND ROTATE David Miller ...Barbara Hall ...Tom Jakobek ...John Tory ...John Nunziata There are still 20 sleeps until voting day.

       If I had a mayoral website   I'd have altered it slightly yesterday afternoon to include the Police Hotline for information on  urlLink the disappearance of Cecilia Zhang .    416-808-8390    I mean, a situation like this should be completely free of politicking and lobbying, but it should also be a situation where every stitch of information available can easily get to the authorities on the case.  I know there's nothing that any of the candidates can actually do to aid in the search, but a little show of support and hope is all I'm asking.  Maybe I'm being too petty, and too "baby boomer" with my choice of argument this morning, but there's just something about this that scares the hell out of me.   Update :  urlLink Kinsella  has the right idea.

       416-808-8390   That's the hotline that the Toronto Police have set up for anyone with information on the  urlLink disappearance  of Dong-Yue (Cecilia) Zhang.  If you have any information, or think you have anything that may aid the police in their search for this girl, do not hesitate to call right now.  This is the third time in Toronto's history that an " urlLink Amber Alert " has been issued in the City.  If it means something to you, start praying now.

       Amber Alert?   From the breaking news section of the  urlLink Toronto Star website :  Police launch search for girl, 9   CURTIS RUSH STAFF REPORTER, THESTAR.COM  A 9-year-old North York girl has gone missing and police have set up a command post to conduct a door-to-door search in the Finch Ave.-Highway 404 area, Toronto police said this morning.   Cecilia Vang-Dong, an Asian girl who stands 4-foot-11 and weighs 70 pounds, was reported missing from her home at 33 Whitehorn Cres. at 8:27 this morning.   She has brown eyes and shoulder-length straight black hair with blonde highlights.   She is a Grade 4 student at Seneca Hill Public School.   Police wouldn't confirm reports that there was a broken window at the girl's home. Let's hope this one turns out differently.

       Still asleep   I should try to wake up before heading out into public.  I walked into my TTC station this morning ready to get on the subway.  Every morning I take out my Metropass, slide it through the reader and return it to my breast pocket, in one fluid motion.  This morning I forgot to do all of those things before walking, at full pace, into the locked turnstile at Broadview station.  The metal bar, placed at the level of my testicles, broke my stride so violently that people around me stopped in awe of the guy who looked like a crash test dummy; a body that snapped forward and jerked back suddenly.  The TTC ticket taker stoped filling the order that the customer at the window had placed.  The transfer that was requested by the gawking woman at the machine lay unclaimed in the tray.  I'm pretty sure, for a few moments, that the trains in the system stopped running, and an announcement went out across the city's subway platforms:  This is a message to all commuters on the Bloor Danforth line.  We are currently experiencing a guy who slammed his nuts into the turnstile at Broadview station because he forgot to swipe his metropass through the reader.  A psychiatric crew has been dispatched to the scene and we hope to have scheduled service resume momentarily.

       Debate Deconstruction   Well maybe not so grandiose as that, but at least a few comments.  Why does the only candidate on stage without a chance of winning this office get to yell the loudest?  I know Jak's known as a bully in the office and on camera, but could none of the candidates shut his shrill little yap up?  "Why does it take a 10 page form to get a lottery licence in Toronto?" - John Tory.  Perhaps we should ask the Provincial Lottery and Gaming commission about that John.  Do you have anything municipal to talk about?  Jak would reduce child poverty in this City.  That's awfully nice.  Barbara Hall said the words "New Deal" 9 times over the course of the evening.  Ms. Hall must be paying royalties to the Roosevelt estate...  City hall is "frittering" money away according to John Tory.  John Tory want's you to continue to  urlLink dream ....  I'm all for getting as much discourse out of an evening as possible but even when the candidates are on topic, 30 seconds is not long enough to answer a question.  Holy crap, I feel like I just ate a box of Captain Crunch....

       And a rebuttal   The reply to Tory's calls of "highway robbery" the Miller camp put out the following press release that "clarifies" David Miller's  urlLink position on toll roads  in Toronto.  It is copied here on  urlLink Andrew Spicer's  site.  October 17, 2003, Toronto, Ontario  Â&#150; Mayoral candidate David Miller responded to a series of news stories regarding toll roads this morning with the following statement:   "A number of media stories have mischaracterized my position on toll roads. Some have stated that tolls are part of my economic platform, which I released yesterday. That is false. Others have stated that I support tolls. That is false.   What I said and what I believe is simple. We will not solve the transit challenges facing this city without the active partnership - and financial involvement - of Ottawa and Queen's Park. They have a responsibility, and they must be held to it. Rebuilding public transit has been my priority all along, and my track record on this is clear.   I've made it a point to talk straight and be open with Torontonians in this campaign. And I'm not about to stop now. I did so yesterday in response to a question about tolls. The fact is that if the other levels of government, for whatever reason, fail to make their proper contribution, Toronto would be forced to look at a range of other alternatives. That's not a platform position. It's not an opinion. It's a fact.   After years of sweeping problems under the rug, Torontonians deserve the truth. My commitment to them is to fight and work hard to make sure that Toronto's public transit is well-funded, and that we don't have to turn to toll roads. And to keep on speaking the truth, because that's what leadership, real leadership, is all about."  For more information about David Miller's policies and his economic platform, please visit http://www.millerformayor.ca. (truth be known, I think this rebuttal was actually the subject of Mr. Kinsella's rebuttal that I urlLink  pointed out yesterday .)

       Mr. Kinsella   To his credit, Warren Kinsella does not sleep.    Kinsella, who some of you will recall was at the centre of the Joe Carnevalle "rip up your Liberal membership card" media fodder during the provincial campaign in September.  By my calculations Kinsella finished his work on the McGuinty rise to power, had two working days off, and then joined the John Tory camp as a communications advisor.  You can follow Kinsella's comments about Tory's effort on his website under " urlLink musings ".  It may very well have been Kinsella who phrased Tory's arc for Miller's jugular on the toll-roads story earlier today:  Toronto, October 17, 2003  - Veteran NDP politician David Miller knows he's in trouble following yesterday's revelation that he'd slap tolls on the Gardiner Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway. His solution? Blame the media.   In a statement Miller's mayoralty campaign released a few minutes ago, the long-time tax-and-spender attacked the media for having "mischaracterized" his wacky $1200-per-driver highway robbery scheme. Said Miller, sounding increasingly desperate: "[The media] have stated that I support tolls. That is false."  Wrong, David. It isn't false at all. You're playing fast and loose with the facts - just like you play fast and loose with taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.  Proof is found in David's revealing performance on radio station CFRB this morning. While being interviewed by Bill Carroll, Miller was repeatedly asked whether he would take the opportunity - then and there - to withdraw his support for tolls on the Gardiner and the DVP. Each time, Miller refused. Said he: "I think you have to be honest with people. There aren't very many options if people don't fund public transit."  No option, David? You have an option, sir. Just say NO to tolls on the DVP and the Gardiner.  The highway robbery controversy erupted yesterday when Miller unveiled his voodoo economics plan, and had the following exchange with reporters:   Miller : "...if we do not get a new deal that fully funds transit, I WOULD CONSIDER TOLLS."   Reporter : "On existing roads?"   Miller : "ON THE GARDINER AND THE DON VALLEY."  David Miller: an old-style, tax-and-spend NDP politician. John Tory: the man of action for a city that needs it.

Mr. Spicer does volunteer for the Miller camp, but adequately disclaims his opinions from those of his chosen candidate.  Also: Andrew, I was at the TEA debate in the balcony too.

       Let's bring that back up   Similar table, different numbers:      MAYOR, City of Toronto         1992 of 1992 Polls Reporting          Category      Result         Total Votes      604,394        Toronto's Population in 2000      2,481,495        Percent of Population who Voted      24.36%      &nbsp;  &nbsp;    So in the November 2000 vote 1 in 4 eligible Torontonians bothered to show up at one of the 1,992 polls in the city.  1 in 4.  Remember, in that election the top 3 finishers were:  The Incumbent Mayor  A Pro-legalization stoner  A Transvestite who calls herself a Supermodel.    Little to nothing of any merit was discussed during the campaign, so why bother to come out and vote?    This time around there are heated, animated debates on everything from the perceived lack of safety in our neighbourhoods to the condition of our waterfront.  If we can't do better then 1 in 4 people in Toronto voting, then nobody is allowed to complain about  anything  after the election.

       It's down to two   Folks I'm going to do something uncharacteristic here, so purists and rational consistency nerds better cover their eyes.  Here's the mayor's job as I see it:  Build a platform of your position on current issues, and defend it for 3 months prior to election day.  Compare and contrast your opinions to those of your opponents.  Get elected  Examine the new council and see who's values and ideals match yours closely, and fill committees and various posts with those councilors.  (Posts like "Works Committee Chair" or "TTC Chair" or "Budget Chief").  Chair council and committee meetings  Speak on behalf of council and the City to the media and to the world  I don't really see the mayor's job as being much more then that.  Proclamations, announcements, leadership in a crisis, and welcoming dignitaries are pretty much the day-to-day.  The part of the job that we're watching now, the campaigning, is very very important because it lets us choose who's "vision" for Toronto most closely matches our own.  After election day, after the committees are set with like minded councilors, then we're back to smile-and-wave-for-the-cameras.  Which brings me to last night's Toronto Environmental Alliance (TEA) debate at the Great Hall on Queen West.  Hall started by announcing her solemn pledge to not support any further development on the Toronto island, in her halting, broken style of speech.  She stumbled through her questions, avoiding answering anything, adding buzzwords like "work with council", "prioritize", and "New Deal", before ending her statements.  It hit me like a ton of bricks.  Hall speaks just like Lastman.  When she has a speech or statement typed out in front of her she reads it but it's never clear if she knows what she's saying.  Like Lastman she includes faux passion with every statement she makes, starting out by shouting "We must..." or "This City needs..." and trailing off before remembering what it was we must do, or what we need.    That alone is annoying, but when it comes to a question that she must formulate an answer for, it's like listening to someone read randomly from a dictionary.  Barbara Hall cannot think on her feet, she cannot be put on the spot, and as such she can't perform well in front of the media.  What a glorious train wreck it will be when Adam Vaughn interviews Hall on an issue that she doesn't know much about.  We may even get some tears out of it.  She gets flustered, she stammers and she can't put a sentence together under pressure.  It was such a stark contrast between Hall and Tory, or Hall and Miller.  Hall's broken, stumbling speech was followed by a clear well paced statement from Tory that included refutation of Hall's comments and promotion of his own ideas.  At times Miller and Tory wouldn't even acknowledge Hall's non-answer to a question, and would simply carry the debate on their own shoulders, barbing back and forth and even getting genuine laughs from the audience.  My point here is that the next mayor of this City must carry on Toronto's image to the world.  The SARS crisis brought CNN trucks to our streets for the first time in years.  We became a laughing stock when Lastman bumbled his way through press conferences, publicly noting that he'd never heard of the World Health Organization.  Do we want to elect someone exactly like that again?  Do we want to put Barbara Hall in front of the cameras as the representative of the largest City in Canada?  Miller and Tory are both articulate and they can form novel answers from spontaneous questions.  It's a skill, and it's a skill that Barbara Hall has not demonstrated.  On style alone I'd pick  anyone  over Barbara Hall.  Even Jak.

       Unfortunate   All the joking and sophomoric criticisms on this page must be put away for now.  No matter how you slice it,  urlLink a story like this is so sad .  So hard to believe that the risks of the job can be fatal.    The operator was trying to dump a load of sludge at the Michigan landfill.  When the door of the truck didn't open, the operator got out of his truck and fell into the dump pit.  I've heard similar, but not fatal, stories about a number of different landfills.  Working in that environment is very risky, and I'm sorry that it happened to yet another operator.

       Bags and Brooms   From Jak's  urlLink garbage platform : We need to re-design our system, regardless of who picks up the garbage, and get rid of our antiquated system of collection. If some of our systems are antiquated, so is some of our thinking. We need better management practices and my plan gets us there. Followed closely by: This City has lost the touch of good old-fashioned sweeping. Brooms have been replaced with sweeping machines. These machines do not have the finesse of an individual with a broom and often miss key parts of our City. Motorized sweepers are limited as to when and where they can be operated. A person with a broom can work anywhere, anytime. Now I don't want to get into a whole rational consistency thing here....  The policy first claims that curbside recycling (the blue and grey boxes filled with recyclables) is an antiquated system and should be eliminated.  Recyclables will be picked out of the waste stream at a central recycling facility.  Instead of you sorting out your recyclables and packing similar materials same truck, Mr. Jakobek will pack all waste into a single truck, and let a staff of processors (who "would kill to get one of those jobs") sift through your garbage.  They'd dig around and pull out cans and bottles and paper and organics, and all other compostable or recyclable objects.  Since Mr. Jakobek refuses to consider incineration as an option, the remaining material will be landfilled in "existing landfill space".  Mr. Jakobek doesn't mention where that landfill space is, but it certainly won't be in Michigan.  Bringing up the rear on his garbage plank is litter.  Jak says he'll hire 5000 students to be "environmentalists" (presumably summer students, and therefore, we would have a spanky clean city 3 months of the year).  They'll patrol parks and ravines and pick up litter and junk.  Jak will hire 88 litter pickers who will work exclusively with bags and brooms.  He'll hire them because they're not part of an antiquated system,  urlLink representative of our antiquated thinking .

       Found Objects   Items to consider this morning.  The following is text taken from a publication called " urlLink How to Read the Daily Racing Form ".  The site which published the booklet is not a racing site, or a handicapper's resource, but rather a company called Carlson Online Design.  The opening text outlines the author's choice of subject and form.  There's something deeply convincing about this argument that I can't put my finger on.  Suffice to say, if I need a manual written, I'm going straight to Carlson Online Design. This document is intended to provide the reader with a brief example of my writing skills.  Many readers will be unfamiliar with the information contained in the Daily Racing Form. That is the primary reason I have selected it as the subject of my manual.  Because this document is intended solely as a writing sample, it has some unique qualities.  Incorporates the components of a typical policy and procedures manual in a small amount of space.  Shows my ability to organize any type of information.  Displays a format that I have designed specifically for this purpose.  Respects the confidentiality of material I have developed for previous employers.  Presents information for an audience with diverse backgrounds.   Our next item comes from a self-published book of menopausal poetry called "Carole's Secret Garden of Rhymes Volume 3" by Carole Kerr-Iacobucci.  The poet appears to be a woman from Smith Falls who has published at least 3 volumes of poetry.  In the forward, the publisher notes that writing is like therapy for this, and many, writers and poets.  He notes that Ms. Kerr-Iacobucci's poetry in particular is very personal, and reading it is like reading a diary of intimate thoughts and feelings.  Here now is "All Tickety-Boo" by Carole Kerr-Iacobucci:   All Tickety - Boo   The minute I opened my eyes, I knew that something Terrible had happened. My eyes felt heavy, As though I'd been crying and my body ached. I lingered in that comatose state Between sleep and waking, Trying to forestall the dreaded knowledge As long as possible.  I pulled the covers up to my chin, and looked at the clock On the Colonial night stand. It was seven-thirty, time to get up, Put the kettle on, brush my teeth, do my exercises... Gary's face came into view. I now remembered the terrible Thing that had happened, Gary had died, leaving us to grieve. I frowned thinking of the Days ahead.  Then I remembered That Gary was in heaven with God where everything is All Tickety-boo.

       What were you looking for?   Pages like this get a lot of hits from google searches.  With the eclectic topics and general wordiness of the site, phrases that are mentioned in passing get picked up on for search terms.  Terms like "Tampax Pearl Tampons" and "Casino Jakobek 2003 Mayor" pop up as referers to this page.  Then there are the strange ones.  Like the following search term, typed in (or pasted in) to the German version of Google: aparently you'd like to see that I participate with that debate, I took a quick look and noticed that the writings posted are too written according to perception and not very elaborate where really needed, for instance, No quotes of course, but that's quite the incoherent statement to thrust upon Google first thing in the morning.

"Histories" was the preferred democratic word: it was an experience that belonged not only to one city but to a whole nation; not to a single nation, but the whole world. There was diversity in grief that gave it unity, and most agreed that diversity should be recognized. Osk. W., Encyclopedia Legenda, September 11, 2525

       Cultural Theory takes a Hit    urlLink Neil Postman  (72) died on Sunday from lung cancer.  My grade 12 English teacher had us all read " urlLink Amusing ourselves to death ".  I remember it being an incredibly difficult book to read, filled with academic language and, then, foreign concepts like "epistemology".  As difficult a read as it was, I think that was the first book that lit a critical flame under me.  I read others by him ( urlLink Technoploy , The  urlLink Disappearance of Childhood , and  urlLink Building a Bridge to the 18th Century ) but after those, I just started to believe that Postman was a ludite, who blamed all of societies faults on the invention of the printing press.    Guttenburg as Oppenheimer.    It was a little hard to swallow.

       Royson James    urlLink The Star's City columnist  boils the field of 44 candidates down to 3.  Hall, Miller and Tory are the names that James believes make up the viable candidates for the 10th of November. Miller, Hall and Tory have strengths and weaknesses that will be exposed in the crucible of a campaign ?&#151; especially in the next three weeks as the attacks intensify at mayoral debates. Each defy stereotype, so voters looking for easy answers will be frustrated. Good point.  There's no easy answer for the top job.  Last time round the top three were: Mel, a Stoner, and a Transvestite.  This time round the top three are all lawyers.  Lesser of 6 evils I guess...  Who will work best with council?  Miller and Hall both have council experience, and reputations built on consensus.  One has "mega city" experience but should that really be a deciding characteristic.  Miller and Tory have spelled out their platforms in great detail, while Hall has lagged, producing platform planks it seems, only when others have shown their stance on the issues.    Tory has a plan for garbage, but is it the right plan?  Can he work in a council environment, and not simply get his way, a luxury reserved for CEOs and not mayors.  Hall has the experience, but does "old Toronto" leadership compare to "new Toronto" leadership.  And what of leadership in general?  Will we allow the notoriously boring Hall serve as our spokesperson to the world?  Miller, like Layton, served as the automatic "voice of opposition" for just about anything council did while he was in office.  He is an eloquent speaker, and puts forth powerful arguments for his interests.  Will he serve as well in the top job, where he will be called upon to represent  both  sides of any given issue?  The choice isn't easy, and I'd argue, a deeply personal one.  The candidates themselves (the 3 that James identifies) differ on so many issues.  This is an amazing campaign to watch simply for that fact alone.  This isn't a "Jack Johnson vs. John Jackson" campaign where identical platforms and candidates differ on minutia.  This is a very real, very difficult choice for some people, and shouldn't simply come down to "Well she was mayor before wasn't she?"

       The Geeks are Giggling   John Tory has a favorite word in this campaign: "Dithering".  He's used it hundreds of times in press releases, policy statements and on stage.  He usually uses it when he points to Barbara Hall (during her time as Mayor) or when he speaks of the previous two councils.   "After years of dithering at City Hall".  "Barbara Hall's dithering on the issue of homelessness caused two homeless men to freeze to death on our streets, while she was mayor"  "After years of dithering and delay, Toronto has still not figured out how to dispose of its garbage."  Things along those lines.  Dithering, according do the  urlLink Merriam-Webster  dictionary, is "to shiver or to tremble" or "to act nervously or indecisively".  Dithering according to  urlLink whatis.com  (a tech dictionary of sorts) is defined a little differently: dithering  Dithering is the attempt by a computer program to approximate a color from a mixture of other colors when the required color is not available. For example, dithering occurs when a color is specified for a Web page that a browser on a particular operating system can't support. The browser will then attempt to replace the requested color with an approximation composed of two or more other colors it can produce. The result may or may not be acceptable to the graphic designer. It may also appear somewhat grainy since it's composed of different pixel intensities rather than a single intensity over the colored space.   Dithering also occurs when a display monitor attempts to display images specified with more colors than the monitor is equipped to handle.   Dithering is rather easy to confuse with antialiasing. I'd say dithering is rather easy to confuse in general.  So come clean Mr. Tory.  Tell us what you mean!  Are you suggesting that City Hall has acted nervously and indecisively over the past 8 years?!  Or are you suggesting Sir, that City Hall has attempted to approximate a colour from a mixture of other colours when the required colour is not available?!  The voters of this City want, nay,  demand  that you clarify your position.

       Miller picks up the pieces   David Miller has announced his plan for a "Clean City".  The plan has the usual aspects:  Advisory group made up of reps from all areas of the City (TABIA, TDSB, Citizens, Staff, etc)  Quick response phone number (like say...39-CLEAN)  Deposit returns on soft drink bottles (Which the Province would have to agree to)  Annual liter audits  And continuation of existing initiatives (like Adopt-a-Bin for BIAs)  His final statement is encouraging We can't let Toronto get dirtier and shabbier in order to keep spending down. It's a false economy. The Mayor and the new Council need to increase the energy, effort and resources we devote to keeping our city clean. We need to have effective and sustainable services in place. Our economy depends on it and our pride in our city depends on it. I promise that I will make sure we have a 'Clean Toronto' a Toronto we can show off proudly to the world. What's different about the Miller plan is the students.  Tory says he'll hire 1500 students each summer to flesh out the litter-picker ranks (those guys in the bright yellow shirts).   urlLink Jak says he'll hire 5000  students every summer.  Miller steps back from the extra hiring and suggests that we can do it better with the current resources.  Babs is in on the litter bandwagon as well.  Her plan is to, in part, encourage Torontonians to actually use litter bins instead of throwing garbage on the ground and then complaining that the City is dirty.  She's behind a single department for litter responsibility (the problem is briefly  urlLink outlined here ), and will also "urge" the Province to institute a bottle return policy.  We've chatted about  urlLink John Tory's  plan in  urlLink previous posts .  Jak and the Nun haven't filled us in on their litter proposals quite yet.  Most of the candidates call for better  enforcement  of the $305 littering fine, but none really mention how that will happen.  Will they have by-law officers patrolling the streets looking for litter bugs?  When a by-law officer witnesses an offence, what then?  What if the individual decides to not provide identification to the by-law officer?    On a similar topic, Tory has released his plan for what to do with the litter, and the  urlLink rest of our garbage , once it's off the ground.  Hopefully I'll write more about it later.

       Missed Jak's Casino Press Conference   Sorry folks, but I actually do work during the day.  I couldn't tear myself away from all these pretty lines long enough to go downstairs and listen to Tom tell the City that  "Casino's will be the catalyst that brings excitement and cash flow to this City. Guaranteed!"   He's starting to sound like Mel don't you think?  Chirping about how awsome something would be, without examining any other aspect of the problem.  Personally I'd love a casino in T.O.  I'd love to be able to watch Americans stream in and out of its doors, emptying their pockets and leaving their children locked in overheating SUVs for hours at a time.  I think the fines for disorderly conduct alone would help pay for infrastructure improvements.  Says Jak's  urlLink website  "Jakobek's plan will create jobs, provide added revenue to the City and boost Tourism."    You know what else would create jobs, provide added revenue and boost tourism?  Whorehouses.  Hundreds of them.  Hell you don't even need to build actual whorehouses, he could just make it legal for university students to "go into business" right out of their dorm rooms.

       Attention Women   June Callwood commands you to vote for David Miller.    Actually I think the implication is that women should not automatically vote for Barbara Hall simply because she's a woman.  I really respect how Callwood phrased her voting choice, in the  urlLink Star article : If "the candidates are equal, I would vote for a woman. But these candidates are not equal," When would the candidates ever be equal?  Never.  Candidates in elections are never equal and the reason that they are running against each other is because they're different.  Callwood's implication is that she will not simply consider the gender of a candidate when making her choice.  Well who would do that anyway?  "She will be a good leader for our City" does not necessarily follow from "She's a woman".  I'd go so far as to liken that stream of logic to "I'm voting for her because she did the job before, and I'm not voting for him because I really don't know much about him."  June Callwood could be voting for Schwarzenegger for all anyone cares.  The point is that she actually took a look at the candidates and didn't simply vote for the one she recognized.

       Word   Bless the CBC.  I went to  urlLink Word on the Street  a couple of weekends ago.  Crowded as all hell, and not really that much fun.  There was an entire booth set up just for the  urlLink CBC.ca archives .  The site itself is pretty cool, with lots of footage of famous Canadian moments, and news items from back in the day.   urlLink Peter Gzowski interviewing Marshall McLuhan  is definitely worth a watch.  There was also a ballot box filled with eager CBC fan entries hoping to win a "CBC.ca prize pack".  I won.  The prize pack includes:  A cbc.ca zip front shirt  A cbc.ca water bottle (with bendy straw)  A pair of cbc.ca workout wristbands  A cbc.ca pen  A cbc.ca letter opener in the shape of an "@" symbol  It's this last item that has me confused.  Well I'm a little confused about the branded wrist bands as well, but that's another post.  I think it's probably best filed under the "unintentional irony" column when you use a symbol of paperless comunication as a letter opener.

       Vote.  Now.   Today is the day.  Pick a candidate and go out and vote.  You're not too busy to do it.  The polls are open today from 9:00 am until 8:00 pm.  Generally on election day I  urlLink turn on the CBC  around 6:30 or 7:00 and watch the coverage gear up, and I encourage you to do the same.  If you don't know where to vote, you can find it at the  urlLink elections Ontario  website.  If, like myself, you did not receive an elections Ontario card it means your name won't be on the list when you go to vote.  You can still go to your polling station but you must bring the  urlLink information outlined here .  I will be bringing my driver's license.  You can also bring a pair of items that show both your signature and your residence (like a water or telephone bill,  and  a credit card or passport).  If you don't know who's running in your riding you can find out at the  urlLink election prediction  website, which has the added bonus of telling you what others in your riding are saying about the candidates.  Currently electionprediction.com shows the Liberals with 69 seats, the PCs with 26, the NDPs with 8, and 0 for any other party (Green included).  The site shows that 0 ridings in Ontario are too close to call.  We'll have to see what the final tally is tonight, but all predictions and polls seem to point to a massive Liberal majority.  Massive.

       Yeah but, who are you voting for?   0k ok.  I started this campaign displeased with the Torys.  I don't believe that giving tax cuts to corporations will stimulate the economy.  I view that as a throw back to voodoo economics (Reganomics in the 80s), and I don't buy into the idea that helping corporations flourish actually translates to those corporations hiring more, and making more jobs.  I believe that government has a role to play in our lives, and part of that role is to provide and preserve services like health care, education, and social assistance.  I also believe that government cannot do all of those things alone, and that ballancing government provided services with privately provided services is a fine line to walk but is better in the long run.  Government cannot rely on its own agencies to spend tax money wisely.  It must regulate and control, encourage and sometimes force, those agencies to be efficient and reduce wasted spending.  But simply pitting one group against another (like unions and management) and forcing them to come to a conclusion isn't the best way to acheive those goals.  The Liberals urked me during the campaign.  I still think McGuinty is a bit of a tool in front of the camera.  The Liberals constantly used strange numbers (like assuming a 5% growth statistic, when the PCs used 3% growth) on which to base their financial figures.  God help us all if those assumptions turn out to be overestimated.  I had not considered the NDPs until the campaign swung completely towards the Liberals.  In my riding I'm not a fan of the incumbant MPP, Marilyn Churley (NDP) who cried and cried that the City of Toronto was trying to "ram through" an incinerator in a "back room deal".  It was a complete lie, and most of the media bought it as fact.  It didn't help the currently on going discussions around new and emerging technology for waste disposal, and it set a generally uninformed public against the City, so (in my opinion) she could get her name in the papers.  But with a massive Liberal majority set to take the stage this evening, I believe I will vote NDP to, as my girlfriend eleoquently phrased, "spread the love around".  Huge majorities, like the one being predicted, aren't always the best way to run a government, and a strong opposition is what democracy is all about.  So.  In answer to your question: I will be voting for NDP candidate for Toronto-Danforth, Marilyn Churley.  You may adjust your votes accordingly.

       Buttah   We just visited a supermarket in town.    Apparently no one in the United States can believe it's butter.  Seriously, there's like 30 different varieties of "I can't believe it's not butter".    Also, chocolate flavoured whipped cream in a spray can.  I know I shouldn't be so amazed by this stuff, but really...  I can't believe it's not whipped cream.

       In the belly   Well, Massachusetts isn't exactly the belly of the beast but it's within.  We hit the border around 7:30 and met a young border guard who questioned us.  Rapidly.  I think the technique was to ask loosely connected personal questions to see if we could answer them without uncomfortable pause. We've got our passports ready to hand over...  Citizenship? Canada.   Canadian .  Sorry. Where are you traveling? Fammingham. (The guard rolls his eyes)  Where's that? Oh, it's in Massachusetts. Why are you going there? Oh, to visit friends. How do you know them? Through school. Where did you go to school? (I'm actually starting to get thrown off)  Uh...Waterloo. Where do you work? I work in Toronto. What do you do in Toronto.....? I'm a garbage analyst.... (pauses and stares)  Welcome to America.  Please drive through. I was out of breath, and confused when we finished.  I felt like a real citizen.  The drive was about 8 hours pausing for gas, urine, and a deeply fried meal at a Denny's.  Seriously, the salad has fried chicken on top.

       Into the belly   My girlfriend and I will be traveling for the next 5 days.  We're heading down to Boston area to enjoy the sights and sounds of American Thanksgiving.  We've got two friends from Ontario who moved down there recently, and just think the idea of 4 Canadians celebrating American Thanksgiving in America is kind of funny.  Plus, there will be yams.  I will make an effort to post while we're down there, so you can look back here over the next couple of days for a dispatch from within.  I've been planning and organizing our travel information and documents over the last couple of days, and as I was going through my bag I realized that I had to leave something behind, lest I wish to do time in an American prison.    I'm a man who moisturizes, and as such I had a tube of The Body Shop " urlLink Hemp Hand Protector " in my bag.    I am leaving it here.  It's exactly the kind of thing that can get a Canuck into hot water on the dismal side of the 49th parallel.  We are bringing a Canadian care package for our ex-pat friends that includes:  Tim Horton's Coffee  Red Rose Tea  President's Choice Decadent Chocolate Chip Cookies  Kraft Dinner  Swiss Chalet Tangy Dipping Sauce Mix  The "instant mashed potatos" idea was nixed before it was formed.  Until next time.

       Why I love living in the city   At one time in my life, I lived in the country.  My home town was Millgrove, just north of Hamilton, Ontario.  There were no bars and for a long time, no cable news.  Tonight, after getting home from work, I watched CNN's ongoing (6 hour) coverage of Michael Jackson's arrest and bail.    When I first got home CNN showed a helicopter feed of Jacko's SUV drive from the Santa Barbara.  Anchors interviewed Jermaine Jackson, Latoya Jackson's ex, and the rest of the cast, about their reactions to MJ's arrest, bail, and trip back to Las Vegas.  I watched a black SUV drive slowly along California freeways, and eventually his warm welcome from anonymous fans on the Vegas strip.  Hours and hours of coverage, reaction, pundentry, and interviews.  Oh yeah, and there was a terrorist bombing in Turkey, committed by the same organization who flew two planes into the World Trade Centre, but who cares about that?  I mean...it's in Turkey for Christ sake!  A country who didn't have the common decency to allow American and British forces to use their soil as a base for attacking Iraq.  CNN decided to show   urlLink this major story   as a side note to the drama unfolding in California.  Quality, quality editorial content.  A nation, engulfed in it's own personal War on Terror, chose to completely ignore this major terrorist event in favour of, alternately, a pop singing peterast's arrest and the 40th anniversary of the assassination of one of it's former presidents.  To escape this insanity I did some spreadsheet work, and then headed downstairs to enjoy a pint in the bar just below my apartment.  And here, is why I love living in Toronto.  Instead of the usual televised offering of SportsNet, or CP24, my local establishment was showing.... urlLink The Producers .  For an hour and a half (and three pints of Creemore Springs) I was able to forget about our neighbour to the south, and watch some of the funniest shit I've ever seen.  Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder and  urlLink Dick "Inventor of the High Five" Shawn  had me laughing loud amongst the aging alcoholics and cougars.  God help me, I had a really really good time.  I am so privileged to be living in a city, where I can watch a classic movie in a bar, have a few laughs with some strangers, and forget about the embarassing state of the world.  God love it, but Millgrove was never this fun.

If your Postal system were as efficient as  your legislature is for the Gay  and Abortion agendas you should have received  the package within 4 days. I suggest patience with your snail mail. Cordially,   As my friend put it, "I was taken aback.  This guy doesn't know me.  He doesn't know if I'm gay or not.  I'm a complete stranger to him, so why would he write that."

       The Persistence of Memory   When I was about 14 at summer camp, one of the guys in our cabin told us that he had epilepsy.  He said that if he didn't take his medication he'd have a seizure, where he'd loose consciousness and flop around on the ground for 5 minutes or so.  Intrigued, I remember asking him what it was like, and he said that he didn't know, but just before it happened he'd hear an orchestra warming up.  I'm not sure why I just thought of that.

       Oy My God   What a morning.  Sorry folks, work's been a little  urlLink squirrelly  (scroll down, it's worth it) lately and haven't had time to post.  Let me just write a few things down now while I'm thinking about them:  A three hour meeting with two very off topic people.  Crime Stoppers is filming a crime re-enactment in the building today.  There are signs everywhere.  Today would be a good day to commit a violent act in broad daylight around here.  I watched a woman in her late 30s return an egg salad sandwich so the crusts could be cut off.  And re-wrapped.  And put in a different bag.  I'm pretty sure she works here.  I'm also pretty sure that she will complain to her co-workers about the service in the cafeteria.  Walked past Miller when I got back from my meeting.  I was going to shake his hand, but someone beat me to the punch.    Guy :   Hey man, congratulations.  It's great that you won.  Miller :   Thanks very much, it's really great for everyone.  Now we can finally start to bring this City together and really get some work done. Wow.  So he actually talks like that.  More later I'm sure, I'm just swamped now.

It's now 3:30 which means that the hookers on Sherbourne and Jarvis are taking a much deserved rest after a busy morning.  "Honey, I'm going to drop you and the kids off here and go and do some 'Christmas shopping'.  I'll meet you after the parade."

       Garbagemen Get Pie   What a  urlLink lovely story  to leave Friday on.  Two garbagemen in Milwaukee found a woman's purse, returned it to her, and received  urlLink a pie each  for their efforts.  In my experience, garbage collectors are some of the nicest people on earth.  Just don't piss them off.

       And since we're on the subject   Tender eyes might not want to click on either of the following few links.  Or read the rest of this post.  Or anything else on the internet.   urlLink Twiddly Bits' Sex Blog  bills itself as "The ramblings of a very horny woman.  (...with regular guest submissions from her cross-dressing husband)".  Currently Twiddly is in the process of meeting a new, uh, "play partner".  Their initial lunch meeting went smoothly, and she's planning when she can fit their next meeting into her schedule.  Also, she started her period today (which will end on Monday).   urlLink Moving On...  is the new home of "Married But Lonely", a blog about the experiences of a man looking to separate from his wife.  He had a real life " urlLink Mom Finds Out About Blog " experience the other week, when he  urlLink sent out an email to a list of friends and fellow Cub scout parents  from an address affiliated with his Married But Lonely blog.  He locked the site, confessed to his wife, and set up shop at Moving On...    Pure, unadulterated, earnestness.  I might as well put all the damaging links in the same post.   urlLink Urban Armor :  kickass alternative menstrual hardware  presents,  urlLink the Keeper .  The Keeper  is a safer alternative to tampon use. It catches your flow instead of absorbing all your natural juices and disrupting your lady ecosystem.

       This is...   ....Without a doubt, the  urlLink funniest shit I've ever seen .  So I asked to be placed in the Blogs Canada directory recently (the "Eclectic" section...).  I've put a link over there.  It's the one with the flag.  I checked the site again tonight and a link to this page is up there, in the  urlLink What's New  section, with a single comment from a user named Snoop Dawg. Fo shizzle my armchizzle garbizzle! He gave me a 5 star rating.  Whether I know you or not Dawg, drop me a line.  Peace.

       Last Day for Last Chance   Rick McGinnis at  urlLink Last Chance City  is closing the door on the blog today.  He should be commended for becoming the go-to site for Toronto blogger opinion during the final 10 days of the municipal election.  The site, and Mr. McGinnis' efforts were noticed in the  urlLink National Post .  A nod from Jakobek's campaign office was strange enough, but clearly this form of media and idea exchange is becoming noticed more and more by the main stream media.  Thanks for sticking your neck out Rick and thanks for the exposure.

       Zoom out one level   Peace, Order and Good Government, Eh? ( urlLink pogge ) has posted an open letter he  urlLink wrote to our new Premier .  I like what he's thinking, and I especially like the idea that efficiency for efficiency's sake is a attribute of business; and it should not be an attribute of public services. Dear Dalton:  I read with interest of your intention to keep the Balanced Budget Act and abide by it. "We've got to balance our budgets, and we've got ensure they are transparently so, so that people have faith that when we say the budget is balanced, it really is balanced," he said. Transparency has nothing to do with the numbers themselves. They're two different issues.  I can understand that you found the $5.6 billion deficit sobering. And I'll acknowledge that the secret deals the Tories made have left you fighting for the public interest with one hand tied behind your back. But you appear to be beating too hasty a retreat when you embrace a piece of legislation that you, yourself, have mocked and discredited.  Running a reasonable deficit during an economic downturn in pursuit of sound policy shouldn't be a crime. It's too easy to imagine circumstances when this would be a viable option. The corporate world's all consuming fixation with the next set of financial reports isn't something that government should emulate. Shouldn't you be thinking farther ahead than the end of the year?  By keeping this legislation, you effectively agree to play the game by Tory rules. Falling back on the Tory record every time you back away from a promise becomes a losing proposition because you've chosen to play by those rules. You might want to rethink this one, Dalton.  Regards, pogge

       Pondering Sacrafice   I attended the Rememberance Day ceremonies at Old City Hall this morning.  Afterwards I walked up Yonge and found a couple of used book stores that I needed to browse through.  Over the course of the morning, I overheard two things that I think illustrate the day.  I don't mean for this to sound holier then thou, but for what it's worth, here's what I overheard:  At the service - 11:30 am  A group of 13-14 year olds are fidgiting and giggling during the laying of the wreaths.  There's a steady drizzle, and they're jockeying and pushing to get space under the few umbrellas that they had brought.  At one point a woman walks from behind me, to the group and lectures them about their behaviour.  She's clearly a complete stranger.  Emboldened by her move, a 40 something husband beside me says to his wife:    "I'm gonna find out what school those little brats are from and call them up after this.  They have no respect.  None at all.  They're just a bunch of little brats."   Sushi King - 1:15 pm  Two women in their 40s dine on a plate of sushi ("No octopus ok?  I hate octopus, so I don't want any included in the order"):  "Yeah, that's the thing about Yoga pants....I mean, I like them and everything but here's something you have to keep in mind when you're buying them.  I usually buy them a bit small so they fit tight, but sometimes they.....(Her cellphone rings.  She has a MIDI version of the theme from "Sex and the City" as her ringtone)...Hello?.....No, no I don't want to see that with you......Because it's stupid and I don't want to see it OK?"

       Quick!   Download every inch of text off of David Miller's website!    Keep it.  Preserve it.  Hold him accountable.  This election was so closely contested that we need to keep him true to his promises.  Miller won me, but just barely over what Tory was saying.  They were very differently focused platforms, and of the 536,000 of us who voted for both Tory and Miller, I'm sure the lion's share wrestled with which direction we wanted the City to go in.  Do we want a financially secure City first, or do we want to ensure that public services and infrastructure are preserved over all?  Can greater savings and better service be found in the private sector, or should we focus on keeping the City in charge of it's own services?  Those are tough questions with equally persuasive arguments.  Should Miller's Office start to slip, and we loose those things that brought him to power, how will we react?  On another thought, Miller came in to his victory speech with Springsteen's  urlLink Badlands , and left with BTO's  urlLink You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet .  Miller is a little bit Jersey and a little bit Vancouver?  He's a people's rocker who was born out of a conflict with his former bandmates?  Awesome.

       Well sir...   ...it's been decided.   urlLink Miller  by about 35,000 votes.  The woman I voted for in Ward 30, lost out to the former school board trustee who ran on the Miller ticket.  Jak's on stage now at Mr. Slates Sports Bar in the Beaches, thanking his wife, children, father-in-law, and the public for their support while he was doing the budget back in the 90s.  Hall was on stage a little while ago thanking Max, and her supporters for all their....support.  Tory's still on the bus outside the Capitol Theatre on Yonge.  About 19,000 people voted for someone  other  then the top 5 candidates, and I'm eager to see what the vote spread was for that.  I'll post it up here tomorrrow.  I've got to say, that this has been a great campaign, an interesting campaign, and a fun campaign to watch.  I might follow  urlLink Andrew Spicer's  lead and actually volunteer for a campaign I believe in next time around.

       Yeah but, who are you voting for?   I don't think anyone should care who I'm voting for, but I might as well lay my cards out for you all.  I live in Ward 30 (Riverdale South) so I don't even have an incumbent to evaluate.  I've got 8 candidates for councilor to choose from and the same slate of mayoral choices that everyone else has.  I don't think I'm a "one issue" guy but I do feel strongly about garbage and recycling in this City.  Tory swooned me with his suggestion (and balls to suggest openly) an incinerator to deal with the portion of the waste stream that can't be recycled.  Hall basically said "just recycle more and it will go away" a statement that's always confused me.  Miller, in a number of debates, has indicated that he'll push for more recycling, and more diversion (including support for organics diversion in apartment buildings) and when we've diverted all we can, he'll look at other new and emerging technologies  other  then incineration.  My fear is that a Tory led council will push for an environmental assessment for an incinerator far too early, and give us less reason to work with the recycling programs.  I see this as the same argument against Adam's Mine:  If we get another landfill, then we'll use it.  There would be no reason for anyone to put any effort into recycling and diversion, if everyone knows there's a bottomless pit to throw it all into.  I believe that Miller will agressivly push recycling and diversion and as a "final step" will start the process to evaluate and approve a cleaner solution then burning.  Generally I believe that city services should remain firmly within the city.  Garbage, water, transit, purchasing, etc.  No one should be making a profit off of the services we use and depend on.  For me, as soon as someone else's hand is in the pot, that's just less money to spend on the job we need done.  I have a difficult time believing that a company will provide altruistic service for it's employer just because they want to do a good job.  I believe that David Miller will protect and preserve city services.  Other people have said it better then I have, but I think the statement goes:  Either Miller or Tory will be a huge step up from what we just had in the Mayor's Office, so either way Toronto wins.  I have to agree with that.  My vote will go for Miller, but if Tory pulls through I still think the city will benefit.  As for my choice for councilor in my ward,  urlLink Paula Fletcher  has packaged herself with Miller, but I don't think I'll be voting for her.   urlLink Chris Phibbs  has been Kyle Rae's executive assistant for 11 years, so she's always been in there supporting a councilor, but never actually getting to make the decisions.  I know that if I were in her position, I'd be chomping at the bit to make a break into politics and get a shot at running the show.  I'd see her first term on council as an author's first novel.  She's been working on her ideas and her strategies for years, and I'd like to give her a shot in the council seat.  There you have it, for what it's worth.  You may adjust your votes accordingly.

       Election Day   Go out and vote now.  Please.  There's too much at stake in this election for anyone to be "too busy" to vote.  The advanced polls have been busier then they've been in years.  Voter turnout is slated to be high throughout the day, so please don't let anyone else take your place.  Get out and cast your ballot in this election.   Where on earth do I go and vote?    urlLink Click here , and type your address into the little boxes.  The magical computer elves will tell you where to vote today.   Oh my god.  I didn't receive a voter notification card....   Yeah, you and half the city.  Most of us young-type people generally flit from apartment to apartment across this town, so we're more likely to NOT have received a card.  Because I'm a civics geek (and because I work in City Hall) I went and filled out an "Application to Amend the Voters List" about a month ago and got my card.  Because you didn't, you'll have to take some  urlLink identification  to your polling place (see above) and you may have to swear an oath that you are who you say you are.  You swear a lot anyway, so it should be natural.   Yeah, but I haven't really been paying attention.  Who should I vote for?   If you haven't heard about the election issues, or any of the candidates, then you should really cut back on the weed.  Or at least the Joe Schmo marathons on Spike.  Off to the   left hand side**   of this page you'll see a list of mayoral candidates with websites.  Try and focus for a few minutes and peruse the info on there.  There's also some other opinion blogs for you to check out.  Ready?  Enjoy today because the City changes tomorrow morning.  ** Update  (Seems I need to lay off the whatever as well.  That should read...."Off to the right hand side of this page.....")

       Last Chance City   Like  urlLink Mr. McGinnis  I've had a crazy week at work and I wasn't able to post this little story on Thursday when I first saw it.  I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Rick at Last Chance City for his  urlLink kind words  about this space.  So, Thursday morning, I'm walking across NP square on my way to work.  Standing out in front of City Hall beside one of the parking garage stairwells is David Miller in all of his 6'3'', flowing blond glory.  He was talking to a woman, and as he spoke I watched him shake his head and roll his eyes.  He produced a newspaper from under his arm and unfolded it to show her.  She laughed out loud as he pointed to the cover of the paper and shook his head again.  I had the same paper under my arm, and resisted the temptation to ask for his autograph on it.  Miller was either really impressed, or really annoyed about his rendering on the  urlLink cover of the Eye  this week.

       Right down to the F'n wire   Finally an entertaining election campaign!  The latest poll results (as reported in the  urlLink blue box ):  Miller - 44%  Tory - 37%  Hall - 11%  Nunziata - 5%  Jakobek - 2%  Those results are declared accurate within 4% (with a 95% confidence).  The poll was conducted on 612 people, and 22% of those  still  remain undecided.  Let's face it here, the last "good" election in this town was probably Mel vs. Babs in the first Megacity race.  This time around, everything was truly amazing to watch.  I was at 2 debates, and watched or listened to the rest on TV or radio.  I shook hands with all of the top 5 at least once during the campaign.  I even got to ask a question during the first major debate (CBC radio on September 8).  I've been so pleased with the coverage of the campaign (in the latter weeks) and just thrilled that things like "blogs", "candidate webpages" and generally "youth oriented things" have received some media exposure during this campaign.  Personally I've been thrilled that tangible things like  urlLink garbage ,  urlLink litter , and  urlLink transit  were major issues in this campaign, and not just the usual  urlLink econospeak  that causes hands to clamp over ears all across this city.

       Attention Stoners   The following links are kind of strange if you're not prepared for them.  Caution is advised....  Via  urlLink thismodernworld.com , you may want to consider paying  urlLink this site  a visit.  It's the White House adventures of Flat Stanley (a paper cutout of a guy named Stanley, presumably).  My  urlLink favourite  is:  "Where's the Vice President?" Flat Stanley wondered as he made a stop at the Vice President's Office, which is decorated with historical maps. Stanley learned the Vice President was in a meeting with his staff.

       I have a serious problem   I watch election coverage.  Last night, after watching a reasonably good debate on the CBC, I switched to the  other  CBC and watched Saskatchewan election coverage.  It's not the first time I've done it either.  I've watched election coverage for the recent Quebec and PEI provincial elections.  In 2000 I spent an entire evening watching election coverage from another country, and then continued to follow the aftermath of the non-results.  There's something so very universal about how election night anchors cover the evening's results.  They dance from one riding to another and say things like "the incumbent has a huge lead here, no surprise" or "This is one of those bellwether ridings, and it's a race that we'll be watching closely all night.  This one's going to come down to the wire".  I watched the Liberal party's leader give his concession speech after his party was completely shut out of the Legislature.  The final tally of the night saw the 3 term NDP government return with 30 seats, and the right wing Saskatchewan Party bring up the rear with 28 seats.  I'm basing the "Right Wing" statement on a single line from the Saskparty platform (which I also looked up last night):  Establish strict discipline boot camps for chronic repeat young offenders who steal cars and break into homes;  My brother asked me the other day "What are you going to talk about when the municipal election is over?"  I don't know man.  I just don't know.  I guess I'll have to follow the Newfoundland election campaign....

       How did they vote in council?    urlLink VoteToronto.ca  collects and compiles the results from various council votes, and the way each councilor voted.  If you have an issue that's close to your heart, you can check how your local representative voted on council items like:   urlLink Banning homeless sleeping on the streets    urlLink Privatizing garbage collection    urlLink Establishing a registry of lobbyists   You can check out the list of vote results that VoteToronto.ca have compiled  urlLink here .  Now, if you go ahead and put "votetoronto.ca" into a  urlLink WhoIs  search to determine who owns the domain name, you'll find that Bill Freeman is the admin contact.  You might also find, if you looked, that Bill Freeman is the noted author and vocal opponent to the Toronto Island Airport expansion.  If you looked even harder, you might find that Mr. Freeman is a resident on the Toronto Island and a supporter of  urlLink Community AIR  (Airport Impact Review)  If you didn't look so hard, you might remember his name, and the site, from last week's NOW article titled " urlLink Toronto's 10 Worst Councilors "  If there were only some unbiased political commentary in this town.  Does such a creature even exist?

       Jak's team sends some love out to the blogs   Word.  Quoth Rick Trainos, Jak's  urlLink Internet campaign  advisor: Closer to home, a number of weblogs, including  urlLink accordionguy ,  urlLink andrewspicer , and  urlLink blamblog  have been posting news, commentary and editorial cartooons (sic) on the municipal election and the mayoral race with increasing frequency as we get closer to election day. And now, Toronto writer, photographer and blogger  urlLink Rick McGinnis  has created a weblog called  urlLink Last Chance City  which features original postings as well as highlights of municipal election coverage in other blogs. Last Chance City also has a handly (sic) list of more blogs that are covering the municipal election than the ones I've listed here as examples of the genre. Accordion Guy. Andrew Spicer. Blamblog.  Damn.  Feels like I just missed out in the alphabetical list department.  Perhaps I should change my name to the aaarmchairgarbageman.  But then there's this from  urlLink Path of the Paddle  a few days ago who suggests that blogging isn't even remotely journalistic; it's emotional and should always be treated as such.

       I think I've got them all   I feel like a kid in a Pokemon store....  Off to the right there, you'll see the "Leadership" column.  Since early June I've been linking to Toronto mayoral candidates who have websites.  Of the 44 candidates running, 21 have websites you can visit to read their platforms.   urlLink Joe Fiorito's column  today poo-poo's candidates who simply refer their platforms online, but I have to disagree.  If there's 44 candidates who are serious about being mayor, there should be 44 websites to visit.  There's 2.5 million people in this village, and I doubt any one of the candidates could knock on that many doors, and hand out that many pamphlets.  A website should never replace campaigning, but it's an absolute necessity in this era, and more then half of the candidates running in this election are so behind the times, that they chose not to put up campaign sites.  Here's two more I added just now:   urlLink Albert Howell  - One of the two devil's advocates.  He's also the candidate with the best slogan: "Albert Howell for mayor.  Truth.  Honesty.  Not lying."   urlLink Ahmad Shehab  - Has quite a resume, including: "Special advisor to the United Nations envoy", "Marriage Counselor at the Islamic Information and Da'wah Centre", and "Black Belt Two Degree Taekwondo".  Oh yeah, and if you type - "Ben Kerr" mayor toronto - into Google, you get  urlLink this site .  If anyone out there speaks Persian and can translate it, I'll put it up on the site.  For those who aren't familiar with Yonge and Bloor, Ben Kerr is the kindly old maritimer who stands on the North East corner singing kindly old maritime songs.

The deal would have been aimed at saving Copps the embarrassment of a first ballot loss to Martin.   But her campaign manager Joseph Thornley says there's been no such deal.

       In which the author makes yet another startling admission   The only television program I watch with any regularity these days is.....Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.  I'll give you a minute to get up off the floor.  It's not like I don't watch anything else on TV, but over the last few weeks I've actually caught myself, on Sunday nights saying "Oh wait, what time is it?  8:00?  Queer Eye is on."  This behaviour is out of character because when I'm watching television on my own, I generally refuse to watch:   Reality, or Reality-based shows  Improvement Shows (a la Trading Spaces)  Makeover shows  "New" television shows  I'll clarify that last one.  TV these days kind of sucks, so I spend most of my time watching either old shows that are in syndication, movies, or whatever is on the History channel.  There's just something about Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.  The first 10 minutes of each episode is by far the best.  I love watching these 5 men burst into "some guy's" apartment and completely destroy the place.  I love hearing that condescending tone that only gay men have perfected: "Please don't tell me you actually wear this...." and "Your bathroom is disgusting, how can you possibly live like this?"  Don't take me wrong:  I know that  all  gay men aren't like this.  I know that all of it is arranged ahead of time.  I know that the show drips with stereotypes, both positive and negative.  But, and here's the really shocking part, I'm actually learning something from watching it.  A few years ago I lived with 3 other guys.  One of my roommates would come home from an evening with friends at a bar and tell us that "I had a guy hitting on me all night."  He'd describe how a nervous man would follow him around the bar, trying to strike up a conversation, or ask for his number, or try to buy him a drink.  It didn't just happen once......  I asked my girlfriend "Why do men hit on him all the time?  Why have I never been hit on by another guy?"  She looked sheepish, blushed a little, and finally said "I'll tell you, but I don't think you are going to like the answer."  She took a few seconds to sugar coat her words, and then said "Gay men, are usually a little more concerned with.....grooming, and appearance.  You are not."  So, here now, are some grooming tips from the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy website.  I've already started to work the product into my hair from the back.  The Straight Tips    A baggy look is acceptable, but you'll look like a trash bag if you're pants balloon to clown size.  Your skills at matching colours in kindergarten can still be used today. Black belt. Black shoes. Now you, try.  It's okay to wear jeans and a t-shirt every day of the week. Just not the same ones.  Caesar haircuts are out. There's a reason Brutus had him killed. Et tu unfashionable?  The messy look is just that - a look. Hair needs to be washed.  Men, "moisturizer" is not a dirty word.  If you have to unscrew it then don't serve it. That wine is no good.  Don't skip the tip. It's not your place to punish the waiter for less than perfect service.  Read. Anything. It makes conversation less excruciating if you can talk about more than sports or Wild On.....  Good art is good anywhere. Even in the bathroom.  Candles are not just for birthday cakes. They're perfect for romance and for bad smells.  Don't be afraid to dress up. If you're going some place trendy with your lady, dress the part.

       Nunziata's timeline   So  urlLink here's the story from the Star  where the York Region police lay out what Mr. Nunziata says happened in the "inducement" scandal. The first call was at 3 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 28. It came from a Toronto lobbyist who, according to sources, was the person who allegedly tried to get John Nunziata to drop out of the race for mayor. What's interesting is Nunziata's reaction to the offer: John Nunziata, who has spoken about the incident but not named names, has said publicly he was outraged at the offer. Sources describe his reaction that evening in this way. "He went ballistic. He immediately wanted to go to the police. He even suggested that somebody wear a wire and try and get the offer on tape."  Nunziata's advisers calmed him down, and Naldini was instructed to call Pellegrini back with a refusal.  "Tell him I am not for sale, I am not a quitter," Nunziata said that night. Obviously, I have no knowledge of any of this, but  urlLink here's the way-back-machine story  from the Star on September 22 of this year, where Nunziata is quoted as saying this: "I know the other camps would like to see me not be in the race. But I can give you my unqualified, solemn commitment that my name will be on the ballot; I will be there," Nunziata said, adding: "And let me tell you another thing: The Nunziatas are not quitters. I'm not a quitter." Maybe I'm the only one who thinks that Nunziata was approached with some kind of offer before he says he was, on the 28th of September.

       WDO funding for municipal recycling programs   Mr. Andrew Spicer knows all about this stuff.  Hell, he's even done research about  urlLink product stewardship .  I'll be reading that over the holidays.  Spicer took note of Wednesday's announcement as well,  urlLink and writes : There are several reasons why this new regulation is good news. The simple story is that municipalities are going to get a sizeable sum of money to offset their waste-disposal costs. The bigger story is that producers will now have to factor these costs into the decisions that they make, thus encouraging them to reduce costs and waste over the long term.  Unfortunately, the system isn't complete. Soon, producers will be responsbile for paying part of the costs for recycling their blue-box material packaging. However, I don't know of plans to charge them for their non-recyclable packaging. Making garbage is free, but if you make something that is recyclable, you have to pay. It should be different: if you make something that you reuse you don't have to pay, if you make something that is recyclable you pay, and if you make something that is not recyclable you pay more. This whole situation is a great start, but it only involves companies who make, or sell items which end up in the blue and grey box streams.  Expanding this kind of stewardship to other areas like household chemicals and paints, tires, motor oil, and other items that aren't in all municipal recycling programs like styrofoam and plastic films.

       Seriously man...   On today's Supreme Court assurance that criminal charges for  urlLink pot possession  are currently constitutional: Tokers hoping for relaxed marijuana laws instead got a lump of coal as the Supreme Court of Canada upheld 6-3 a federal law banning possession of small amounts of pot. "I'm bummed out, man," said David Malmo-Levine, a self-styled pot freedom crusader in Vancouver. "I was dreaming of a green Christmas but they grinched out on us.  "Their hearts are two sizes too small."  Malmo-Levine, 32, and two other men failed to convince a majority of the top judges that pot penalties are out of whack with constitutional guarantees of fundamental justice. Martin has said that he'll resurect the decriminalization bill in the House.

       Stephen Lewis may be too busy to run   This one was out on Friday and I'm sure most of you heard it.  Not that I'm a huge NDP supporter, but wouldn't that be an amazing federal race to watch?  Jack Layton, Ed Broadbent and Stephen Lewis taking on Paul Martin, Stephen Harper, maybe Bernard Lord....?  Up there, on the national stage, federal debates would skew towards Kyoto, HIV/AIDS relief funding and Health Care.  You want the American's to be even more pissed off at us?  Try putting this crew at the centre of national debate and see what happens.  Stephen Lewis isn't sure if he'll  urlLink run or not .  Here's some text from  urlLink The Stephen Lewis Foundation  website: How to  urlLink Contact Stephen  If you wish to reach Stephen Lewis for matters outside the Foundation, such as: speaking invitations,  media requests,  personal messages, etc.,  please send e-mail to Stephen's Executive Assistant,  urlLink Christina Magill . Come on Stephen.  Your country needs you too.

       Edward Q. Broadbent   No, I don't know what his middle name is, but everything's catchier when there's a Q involved.  From this morning's Globe and Mail, former NDP leader Ed Broadbent  urlLink lays out his reasons  for getting back into national politics.  And here's a twist, he's running for leader of the newly united right: Instead of slashing social programs such as education and health to compete, as Mr. Ibbitson would recommend, these countries correctly see such expenditures as providing a competitive advantage. General Motors and Ford, among other reasons, choose to invest in Canada over the United States because, as a result of publicly financed health care, they don't have to provide their workers here with health-care benefits.  If I'm nominated and elected, I will work flat out with Jack Layton to rid Canada of the pre-1940s economic and social policies currently being pursued. Jack Layton's priority on the cities did not wait for an election year.  He has also shown how we could be combining environmental and economic concerns by building fuel-efficient cars. While Paul Martin was evading a clear answer on Kyoto, Mr. Layton actually led the battle in Toronto to put the new wind turbine on the city's waterfront. While Mr. Martin conducts seminars on the "politics of achievement," Jack Layton acts. Just kidding.  He's not running for the  urlLink Conservalliance .  Come on.  That's a great name.  Any takers out there?  Stephen?  Peter?  Preston?  How about the Alliancervatives?  Did someone already do these?

       A little story about your blue box   The blue box you put by the curb, not the other  urlLink blue box .  Yesterday the Provincial government announced that a plan to fund 50% of municipal curbside recycling programs (the blue and grey boxes) using money from companies who make products that go in those boxes.  Through Stewardship Ontario (an industry organization), manufacturers and brand owners will contribute money to Waste Diversion Ontario (WDO, a Provincial agency), which will distribute the money to municipalities to help them offset the cost of curbside recycling programs.  Let's pick a company that produces products that end up in the municipal recycling stream.  Let's say...Coca Cola Bottling (only an example, I have no idea if they qualify).  Stewardship Ontario has provided  urlLink a chart (PDF)  to help that company determine if it is obligated to contribute money towards municipal blue box funding.  I'd say that Coke would answer "yes" to all those questions, and would therefore contribute money to WDO.  It's a huge step forward for municipalities who face the decision to cut, or cut back on, expensive recycling programs.  And let's not beat around the bush here...  In municipalities outside of Toronto (places that actually have active, partially full landfills) it is  so  much cheaper to bury everything, then to collect it separately (in separate trucks, and sometimes on separate days) and process it.  Famously  urlLink one municipality chose to suspend it's blue box program  outright, simply because it cost too much.    Recycling programs are supposed to "make money" because the recovered material can be sold back to industry to process into new material.  But when every municipality with a blue box program is trying to sell massive amounts of similar material to industry and processors, then market forces tend to take over.  It's a supply and demand thing, so when there's " urlLink no market for green glass " then no one will buy it and municipalities can't get rid of it.  Municipalities like Toronto don't stop collecting certain parts of the blue box program simply because of lack of market demand, so they're left on the hook for the collection and disposal of unwanted recyclable material.  Enter the roles and responsibilities of  all  the players in the municipal recycling game: Municipalities, the Province, Business and Manufacturers.  This step essentially acknowledges that business has a responsibility for the end-life of their products, and that that end-life cannot be dealt with using property taxes alone.  50% of the net cost of curbside recycling programs is a lot of money.  And while no one was expecting dancing in the streets, a little more notice of the announcement would have been nice, especially during this climate of inter-governmental love.  There were two news stories acknowledging this bump in funding to municipal recycling.   urlLink Here , and  urlLink here .  And if you count it,  urlLink here .

       King Street Car Work   Mr. James Bow writes this on  urlLink Transit Toronto :  Delays Hit King Street Bridgework   A reader sends up this heads-up: "The City's contractor for the work associated with the lowering of the roadway surface underneath the Atlantic Overpass (King Street Closure - Shaw to Dufferin) is 3 weeks behind schedule and has hit another road block: that being an active sewer line that was discovered where according to project plans, none existed. As a result, additional work involving the lowering of the sewer is required, prior to the actual lowering of the road base can commence. This delay will require a continuance of the diversionary routings being utilized by streetcars that normally operate over King St. W., between Dufferin St. and Shaw St. until further notice.  The new tentative completion date for this phase of the King St. W. streetcar track reconstruction project is scheduled for 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, December 14. As a result, streetcars operating on the 504 King & 508 Lake Shore routes are to continue operating on their current diversionary routings. In addition, streetcars operating on the 509 Harbourfront, 511 Bathurst & 512 St. Clair routes will also be required to operate on their assigned diversionary routings upon entering \ exiting service until the project's completion. I know it's tough to get free TTC info like this but it's a huge help when planning your life around your metropass.  Like last night for example...  Quarter to 5:00 and I head for the Dundas subway station, only to be turned back by a security guard who said only "You can't go in there.  They've shut it down."  Right.  What shall we call this one?  An 'electrical problem'?  A 'medical emergency'?  When an entire subway line is shut down at rush hour, and shuttle busses run between stations along Yonge, and there is no explanation on the news, or even reported in the papers the next day....then yes.  It's a suicide.  Merry Christmas in the TTC.  There have been major problems on the TTC every day this week.  Monday there was a 'police incident' at Spadina, and someone 'smelled smoke' at King.  Tuesday shuttle busses ran between Keele and Kippling because of a 'problem' at Jane station.  Wednesday morning there was an 'electrical outage' at Bathurst Station.  And finally yesterday there was a morning problem at Ossington (a co-worker was turned away at the door to the station), and at Dundas in the evening.  God willing there will be nothing this evening and I can get home without hoofing it up Yonge.  This alert reader of the Sun complains about the service: TTC THE better way? No way! Early Thursday morning, while getting ready for work, I was watching CP24 and they mentioned a delay at Ossington Station. I left half an hour early in order to get to work on time. During this "delay" the speakers on the trains and platforms were not working so there was no way to know what was going on. Then, another delay, this time at Kennedy station. No announcements or anything. A normal 45 minute ride took me almost 2 hours. Now I hear that our "Fiberal" government is not going to keep their promise of allocating a portion of the gas tax for public transportation. The TTC desperately needs this money to fix problems and increase service on the system. Shall I get ready for more delays - or should I just bite the bullet and buy a car?   G. Wilson   (Is the expense of a car worth it to have a life?) I doubt the 'Fiberals' can do anything tangible about people tossing themselves in front of speeding subway trains.  I've got to admit, it's pretty tough not to grumble about some guy who 'just couldn't take it anymore' when you've got to walk up to Bloor.  I did my share of cursing, along with the snipits of cellphone conversations that I passed at each subway station:  "...whole Yonge line is closed.  Yeah they said something at Dundas.  Yeah someone jumped...."  "...said there was someone who got hit on the platform.  I saw ambulances and stuff down there...."  "...can't get in.  They won't let anyone into the stations and they won't say what happened...."  That's probably the most frustrating part.  There were hundreds of people walking up Yonge last night, cabs occupied, busses packed, news choppers hovering overhead.  It was exactly like the power outage this summer.  Except when I got home in August I could turn on the radio and hear what happened.  NO explanation last night.  I get the reason.  I understand that when suicides are reported in the news, it encourages more suicides.  I even remember a few summers ago when 680 news reported that a suicide had shut down the Bloor line all morning.  The news director had to respond to massive backlash from the TTC, social workers, and the public on the air by saying "While we don't normally report suicides, we decided to report this one because it affected so many people's commutes" (It's not a real quote, but it's the gist of what he said).  I guess I'm just hoping for some kind of reporting system from the TTC, and maybe "Transit Toronto" is a good place to start.  Radio news reports TTC conditions sporadically, if at all, and there is NO other source of info, save sitting on the platform and listening to the "Attention passengers on the Bloor/Danforth line...." announcements that come on during delays.  I'd like a site to check, or a number to call to find out what the extent of the delay is.  Just let me know if its going to be 5 minutes or 30 minutes.  No one needs to know why.

       My Ex-Pat Friend   From a Canadian, living in America: it's kinda funny to be experiencing this situation from down here - probably because it's the most 'balanced' i've ever heard american media. of course, this is largely due to the angles taken by the seemingly dozens of democratic leadership hopefuls against w.  that is to say, a lot of people while happy that saddam has been captured are also asking "so what?" and the related conclusion that "capturing saddam has sadly nothing to do with the weapons of mass destruction that they didn't have" and "we've still really mucked things up in the international community."  realistically, the americans were starving for anything that might redeem this rather vietnam-like scenario, and so the war supporters are trying to bank on this - but even a lot of them aren't playing this up with the usual melodrama.  certainly there will always be hardcore bush fans (insert childish giggle here), but it seems that what group of moderates that do exist down here are thinking that iraq was a bad call made by a unspectacular leader. A bad call indeed.  What's the projected US budget deficit this year?

       National Post vs. CBC   From an editorial in the  urlLink Post today : To summarize, here are the impressions a casual viewer might have taken from Monday night's CBC news: (1) Iraqis still love Saddam, and so his capture has only enraged them; (2) Despite Mr. Bush's "gloating," things will get worse; (3) Saddam's trial will be a propaganda trick engineered to re-elect a Republican president; (4) To the extent Saddam did anything bad, America was the real villain; and (5) Saddam's capture is meaningless anyway because Osama is still on the loose.  That all seems fair, doesn't it? You can really see what CBC News editor-in-chief Tony Burman was talking about when he told National Post readers earlier this year that "informed citizenship benefits from the expression of the fullest range of responsible opinion on important issues, rather than artificially limiting the spectrum of debate to favour one particular perspective."  Sarcasm aside, this is yet another example of left-wing, anti-American bias at the CBC. We remind the network's executives again that the public broadcaster is funded to the tune of $850-million per year by Canadian taxpayers. It should not -- and must not -- serve as a closed-circuit forum for the predictable biases of a tiny clique. So if everyone else reports Saddam's capture as an unquestioned victory in the War on Terror, and everyone else sticks their fingers in their ears and screams that only good will come from Saddam's capture, and the CBC  doesn't  parrot those stories, then the CBC has a left-wing bias.  Yeah, Saddam was a terrible dictator.  Yes the fact that he's out of power is good for human rights, and the individual lives that lived under him.  But for a media organization to trumpet this American victory without acknowledging the "What now?" factors, is simply bad journalism.    The CBC asked questions like "What will happen if Saddam is put on trial publicly" and "Will the US start respecting international law?".  That's journalism.  That's analysis of the situation.  If those questions aren't asked by a publicly funded media outlet, then I'm not getting my dollar's worth.  The author writes: From there, CBC viewers were taken to Kabul to get Afghans' take on Saddam's capture. Why Afghanistan? We haven't the foggiest -- except that the backdrop provided a convenient pretext to remind Canadians that, although Saddam is caught, Osama bin Laden -- who "many argue ... is far more dangerous than the former Iraqi leader" -- is still at large. Where's the bias there?  Isn't Osama bin Laden still at large?  Does the Post know something that the rest of us don't?  If the CBC displayed a left wing bias with the reporting of this story, then isn't the alternative simply shoving fingers in our ears and ignoring plain fact?    "They caught Saddam like the rat he is, and that's all there is to it.  Hooray!  The War on Terror is over and we don't have anything else to worry about."  Is that good journalism?  It's certainly biased journalism.  Maybe not left-wing bias...

       A letter with a wild twist that will have you rethinking what you just read...   In this morning's Sun a letter from a reader who takes issue with political correctness.  Keep reading till the end, because it's got a crazy twist: TOMORROW I will be attending the staff Christmas party at the school where I teach. It is called a "Christmas party" and no one objects. In the evening, the students at the school will also join us for a "Christmas party." Again, no one objects. We have a "Christmas tree" in our school. We exchange "Christmas presents." The school is decked out in "Christmas decorations" and, again, no one objects. Tonight I will play "Christmas carols" in class. The streets in our city are decorated with "Christmas decorations." Most people will welcome Santa Claus on Christmas Day as he brings gifts to their children. There is no politically correct movement against the celebration of Christmas. I find this ironic as last year I heard talk of "seasons greetings" and "holiday trees." Last year I was in Canada. This year I live in Japan. Merry Christmas.   Tom Browne   Obihiro, Hokkaido, Japan   (Many Japanese don't really understand Christmas, but they love the festivities) Yeah see...it's all you political correctness wags out there who are ruining Christmas for this man.  Can't you see?!?  Can't you see how your inclusiveness has gone off the deep end, and he just can't love Christmas, and Christ, the same way that he could as a kid?  You're ruining ice cream for him too.  And puppies.  Why don't people like this write to scientists, and cancer researchers, when studies  urlLink like this  are released?  Why aren't there letters to the editor complaining that "I  used  to be able to enjoy a corned beef sandwich with mustard and Swiss, but since these do-gooding eggheads want to "stop treating cancer" I guess all the fun has gone out of meal time.  Thanks a lot guys."

       Lord, cometh   From  urlLink Bourque  Newswatch: EXCLUSIVE: MARTIN LIBS FEAR LORD MOST LORD'S DISCIPLES He's the one candidate Martin Libs will privately admit they are concerned about. Bernard Lord. And yes, Lord cometh. Soon. With the NB Premier set to enter the race for the leadership of the Conservative Party, now stunning news about who he can count on to build the coast-to-coast campaign organization needed to wage a winning bid. And winning is what this bid is all about. According to highly placed sources, Lord will count on the "hands-on" support of Alberta Premier Ralphl (sic) Klein, former PM Brian Mulroney, and no less than Jean Charest, the Liberal Premier of Quebec, and the former Conservative Deputy-Prime Minister of Canada. Lord, who mere weeks ago was denying an interest in the new Party's leadership, is now "playing coy" this morning, according to a BN report out of Fredericton. Says Lord, "a lot of things can change in life". Meanwhile, top Liberal sources are admitting to Bourque that "Lord is to one we have to watch, he can build the coalition that can trip us up". Interesting that Bourque's sources in the Martin Libs are so candid with thier concern that  this guy  might "trip up" thier chances.  Time to start paying attention again...

       Any readers in Don Valley West?   The City did a recount of the election night results, and the decision stands: Clifford Jenkins by 80 votes.  Count 'em.  80.  December 12, 2003 Ward 25 recount confirms election night results  A recount of ballots for Councillor in Ward 25, Don Valley West today confirmed election results from the November 10 municipal election when Clifford Jenkins was declared the winner by 80 votes. The results from today's recount did not vary from the official results released on November 13.  The recount was directed by City Council last week.  Election Services staff from the City of Toronto conducted the recount using the vote tabulator machines used on Election Day. All eight candidates for Councillor in Ward 25 were invited to witness the recount, which took three hours to complete.  The results are as follows:  Clifford Jenkins: 4,859 Jaye Robinson: 4,779 Tim Flynn: 2,240 Barbara Krieger: 1,858 Jon Williams: 1,648 William Rauenbusch: 1,575 Stuart Weinstein: 1,283 Nancy Loewen: 420

       On the list   The good people at Revolutionary Moderation say hi:  Weblog roundup pt. II   I'm reluctant to draw this list. The blogosphere does not deserve to endure formal organizing. Nonetheless, onward.  As I was starting to rebuild my links,  urlLink as promised , a pattern emerged of a heavily cross-linking cabal of Canadian centre-left political bloggers.  urlLink Spicer ,  urlLink Ikram ,  urlLink Kinsella ,  urlLink POGGe ,  urlLink Middleman ,  urlLink Bow ,  urlLink myself  (I'd like to think), and at least one that I've somehow managed to miss until now:  The Armchair Garbageman .  He (I'm going to say "he" unless corrected - GarbageMAN, you see) writes well, and has that snarky tone I work so hard to emulate. I hope I don't lose all my readers to him. Then again, there's the whole Alberta thing.... he's another T.O.'ian. Regardless, once the link list is rebuilt, you'll be seeing him there.  I'm sure there are several others I have likewise missed. Forgive me... I'm keeping up as best I can. I'll spare the snarky tone for a moment to say thanks for including this space with such prestigious company.

       Parting words   Joanne Flint is the subject of a retrospective article in the  urlLink Town Crier : Flint reminisces about one call she got regarding litter when she was a councillor in North York. After the woman complained to Flint, the councillor asked if she had ever seen people litter. "What did you do? Did you ask them to pick it up or point out that there was a trash can there?" asked Flint. "She said thats your job. Thats not mine."   "We spent $1 million a year picking up trash (litter) from boulevards and it did not get there by it self," she mentions. But "if there is a community standard that can push people. That makes more of a difference than a rally."   "People can, in little ways, make a huge difference," she says. However, she is not abdicating the city from its job. "We have to work together." Might have to file that one in the "just crazy enough to work" category.

       The Geek Riseth   I say to my brethren, that we have found our way to power.  Warren Kinsella is a senior Liberal party strategist, adviser to Chretien , McGuinty and, given time, Martin.  And given even more time,  urlLink Sutherland .    This is the kind of thing Warren Kinsella posts  urlLink on his blog : December 12, 2003 - This ran in the Ottawa Citizen today, apparently. Found it online, but haven't seen the paper, yet. Hope the photo shows me with lots of hair!  ...  SECTION: Arts; Pg. D1 LENGTH: 170 words HEADLINE: Lord of the Rings SOURCE: The Ottawa Citizen BODY:   Warren Kinsella, author, lawyer, campaign adviser to Jean Chretien and Dalton McGuinty.  Q: When did you read The Lord of the Rings?   Kinsella: I confess to having read it while in the throes of adolescence, when 16 or so. I was a student at Bishop Carroll High School in Calgary, and - not surprisingly - I hung out with a lot of weird people. It was only natural, therefore, that we all read The Lord of the Rings. I seem to also recall that we also made use of some, ahem, imagination accelerants while reading the books. I have been advised by my legal counsel to say nothing further in that regard.  Q: If you were in The Lord of the Rings, who would you be?  Kinsella: Stockwell Day might say I was Grima Wormtongue, but I like to think of myself as Sam, Frodo's pal - you know, a good hobbit to have on your side when engaged in a pitched battle with the forces of all that is Evil and Corrupt.  Everything you need to know about The Lord of The Rings: See the special supplement in Saturday's Citizen.  GRAPHIC: Colour Photo: (Warren Kinsella) A geek on message.  Now there's a scary thought.

       PS2   So I'm doing some shopping online and while reading game reviews I came upon this text from an Edge Magazine reviewer who gave "Ratchet and Clank 2: Going Commando"  urlLink a 70% : Edge Magazine Ratchet & Clank 2 shows all the signs of a game that's been focus tested to death; at no point will you have to repeat a section more than three times. It's a frustration free journey but sometimes feels anodyne. [Dec 2003, p.97] Aw come on.  Honestly, who uses  anodyne  in a video game review?  I shouldn't have to  urlLink look up a word  when I'm reading Edge Magazine should I?  Well, aparently I do.    When I went to  urlLink Edge-online.com  and clicked on "about Edge Magazine" I found this description: The world's leading interactive entertainment magazine, Edge is at the cutting edge of video-gaming technology. With its clean, sophisticated design and informative, erudite writing style, Edge is no conventional videogame magazine. Instead of feeding its readers a diet of over-hyped, average games, Edge scours the globe every month for the hottest exclusives and the most revealing news.

Read by professionals but open to all, Edge is the undisputed interactive entertainment bible for those on the leading edge of the games' frontier. Yeah.  I had to look up  urlLink erudite .  I think I might be retarded.

       A slug   A 21 year old Somaili-born warehouse worker, is accusing the Toronto police of assault.  He claims that, unprovoked, a cop punched him in the face twice; one of which was graphically caught on tape.  CP24 was playing the video over and over last night and you can clearly see Jama Jama getting punched, hard, in the face with a left jab from one of Toronto's finest.  What the tape doesn't show (thanks to the amature video capture) is what happened a few seconds before the punch (which was reportedly, the second punch).  The cop says that Jama Jama shoved him, but makes no mention of the beating which he and fellow officers alegedly administered following the, again "alleged" shove.  From  urlLink the Star : The camera momentarily veers away  the person behind the camera appears to duck down  and there are a few seconds where Jama Jama and the officer can't be seen. But a moment later, the tape clearly shows the officer grabbing Jama Jama, throwing him against a car and punching him in the face with his gloved left fist. "This is abhorrent police misconduct," Vaughan said yesterday. So this comes down to 2 seconds that aren't on tape.  It also comes down to whether Jama Jama's injuries (which he claims were from the police beating) were sustained in the parking lot, or during a party that he attended earlier.  The tape in this case was made by some tourists from Ottawa, who began taping an altercation between two groups of men in a Tim Horton's parking lot.  Here's the really wild thing:   urlLink The community's voice  is growing louder over the issue of racial profiling by Toronto police.  Fantino says he is sick of hearing it, and he's sick of not getting the co-operation he needs from the community to solve crimes.    So if this video tape is effective in proving police brutality against this visible minority...then what?  Will entire ethnic groups carry video cameras to videotape on the off chance that they encounter law enforcement?  Will the City still pay  urlLink $2.7M to install video cameras  in police cars if everyone is already taping on their own?  Will gangs carry video cameras?  Will there be an entire video library of evidence, both for and against the police?  There are greater implications here and I wonder if it will work out well for both sides.

       The Office of the Prime Minister (of Canada)   The PMO's website has officially changed to be Paul Martin's website.  In case you've been living under a rock (who is the new  urlLink UN ambassador  by the way), the PMO has PM's face plastered all over the  urlLink splash  page, and  urlLink site .  Off to the left of the new page is a random photograph, taken from one of six.  Here they are, so you don't have to wear out your refresh button...:   urlLink Patriotic Twenty-somethings    urlLink Patriotic Youngsters    urlLink Paul and Kofi    urlLink Paul and Bono    urlLink Paul and the Peace Tower    urlLink Paul and the Premiers   Don't get me wrong.  I like it and I think it's completely necessary after handing the reins of a country over mid-stride.  It's all part of the re-branding of the PMO, and it's all very savvy.  I'm just saying, if I had a picture of me and Bono, I'd put it up on the splash page.  And at the top of every page.  And incorporate it into my office stationary.

       Mayoral Hanky-panky   Not Miller, no.  Not that we know of yet, anyway....  Seems the mayor of a northern B.C. town did what every single one of us would do after a hard-fought but successful campaign.  She got her husband to take her picture, wearing the chain of office,  urlLink and nothing else .  I'm sure  urlLink Lastman  did it.  I'm sure  urlLink Hall  did it.  I'm definately sure  urlLink Eggleton  did it.  Not as sure about  urlLink Sewell  though...  The point is that none of them kept the picture on their home computer for the kids friends to find during a party.  I think our mayor should show solidarity with his slightly embarassed BC counterpart.  Double points if he doesn't hang it on his neck...

       Garbage.  Michigan.   From this morning's  urlLink Globe and Mail : It is absurd that a province the size of Ontario, with millions of acres of empty land, cannot develop a landfill. In the Greater Toronto Area, the last landfill opened four years ago. In the city itself, the last one opened in the 1960s. Since the late 1980s, the city and the province have wasted more than $100-million looking for a site for Toronto's garbage. But whenever the effort got close to success, the NIMBY syndrome -- Not In My Back Yard -- kicked in. In 2000, Toronto approved a proposal to ship its garbage to the abandoned Adams open-pit mine near Kirkland Lake, Ont. That deal fell apart over liability issues and Michigan came to the rescue. Thank god for NAFTA. The U.S. Senator's webpage, mentioned in the article, can be found  urlLink here .  And  urlLink more .  And  urlLink more .

       That little feeling   I am starting to understand how New Yorker's felt.  I'm not implying that the Uptown theatre collapse and the World Trade Center attacks are in any way comparable, but I am saying that I am starting to understand the civic pride associated with a disaster.  Those were our firefighters on the roof of the collapsed building searching for survivours.  Those were our police running dogs through the rubble.  There is even a twitch of pride that comes through when you see a competant mayor, generally informed of the situtation, giving live interviews from the scene.  I think this kind of pride is easily co-opted, and corrupted in the wrong hands.  This civic, local pride can be easily turned over to nationalistic pride and jingoism, but I can't imagine that happening in this case.  Toronto's response will focus on learning from the results of an investigation, and support for those injured.   urlLink A friend  emailed this clip from Joe Fiorito's column in the  urlLink blue box  this morning: Nobody was seeing movies at the Uptown. At the Odeon Varsity cineplex, across the street from the ruined theatre, these films were among those on the billboard: "21 Grams," which is reckoned by Hollywood to be the weight the body loses at the moment of death; and " The Missing." At that moment?   One dead, one thought to be missing." The old Union Pacific doesn't come by here much anymore...

       Arguments and Refutations   Nothing that gradiose, but here's two posts on neighbouring blogs that are on topic for this afternoon.  Relapsed Catholic  urlLink suggests  (emphatically) a reason why the Uptown was being torn down in the first place.  Brett Lamb at  urlLink Blamblog  takes some issue with RC's point of view.  I've got no opinion, accessable or otherwise, on the subject but thought I'd get the words out there.

       I'm not into buildings falling down around here.   Jesus.   urlLink One killed , still one trapped, 14 people taken to hospital.  The Uptown Theatre, close to Bay and Bloor, collapsed as crews were preparing the building for demolition.  One dead is too many, so let's hope that total stays where it is.  No idea if the subways are running under the rubble or not.   Update: "Officials have closed Bloor between Yonge and Bay, but the threat of any natural gas leak has now been diffused, and the T.T.C. reports the Yonge subway line is still running."

       Take the red pill and see the world in black and white   Seems shades of grey make Ms. Levy from the Sun go cross-eyed.  Do we really have to reduce every issue to left and right in  this  country too?  Do we really have to assign a slant to someone and judge and discredit everything they do and say based on that slant?  Here's a quote from  urlLink Sue-Ann's column  this morning On Day One of the new world order at Havana Hall on Queen St. W., I'll grant our socialist mayor one thing.   David Miller knows how to chair a council meeting.   Miller managed to keep tempers in check in a council chamber packed with Islanders armed for battle against the pro-Island airport contingent. A grudging endorsement for a "socialist", from the Sun.  The "Havana Hall" line is just weird, but as she repeats it at the end of her column it seems clear that she's trying to coin a phrase. My left-wing media pals will no doubt be tripping over each other to praise Miller for this very important first win. I can just see the fawning copy about how he kept his campaign promise, mobilized his new council, yada, yada, yada.   But if this is the way Miller intends to run City Hall - ramming vital decisions like this one blindly through council before anyone (councillors and bureaucrats included) could do their homework - this city is in deep doodoo. Yeah, we should really be worried about a politician who did what he said he was going to do.  I'm sure had the vote gone the other way, Levy would be frothing about broken promises from a left wing liar.  Not to worry however, left wingers do exactly the same thing to the right wing.  This morning's  urlLink City Hall column  from NOW's Don Wanagas Fortunately, the cream of the right-wing crop seems prepared to work from within the new administration rather than obstruct it just for the sake of being obstructionist.   Too bad the politician who invited Tory to Tuesday's ceremony at 100 Queen West, Denzil Minnan-Wong, appears to be intent on fighting the battles of an often acrimonious campaign over and over again for the next three years.   Even on this largely ceremonial occasion, when other councillors ? including some very dedicated right-wingers with numerous ideological differences with Miller ? were doing their civil best to show some interest in teamwork, Minnan-Wong had to signal that he has no intention of participating. Granted, Wanagas seems to be a lot less seething then Levy, but then maybe that's just because the lefties are finally in office and the Darth Vader-esque right wing corporate backroom dealers have been swept into the gutter.  Sorry.  Got carried away there.

       My joke does not go over well   So the council debate today is about the  urlLink bridge .  Mayor Miller is trying to convince council to re-examine whether a fixed link to the airport should be built.    There are equal pro-bridge protesters and anti-bridge protestors downstairs.  The pro-bridge side have construction workers who are just trying to make an honest living for their families.  The anti-bridge side have doe-eyed children and asthmatic kittens who will no doubt deputate eloquently about increased pollution, noise and traffic.  I went down for lunch at 1:30 and got a coffee with my lunch.  The cafeteria offers barista style lattes, and the milk steamer is louder then all hell.  Louder then say....increased jet traffic to the Toronto island.  My joke, aloud to anyone standing within earshot: (shouting) "Boy, is that what the waterfont is going to sound like if that bridge goes through today?".  I thought I was going to get hit.  Two men to my right glared at me as I smirked back at them.  Their "A Deal's A Deal" buttons indicated their particular stance on the issue.  I nodded to them and got the hell out of Dodge.  I feel no remorse.  Every time council's public gallery is filled by interest groups, all the good sandwiches in the cafeteria are gone by 12:30, and I have to have a a date square for lunch.  I swear to god, they even ate all the egg salad.  Stupid bridge.  I hate date squares.

Let us heed the cry for open, accountable government in this city.   Let us dare to tell each other the truth - even when it is hard.   Let us be fierce and proud defenders of the public interest.   Let us be driven by what is possible, and not paralysed by what cannot be done. So says the 2nd Mayor of Amalgamated Toronto, David Miller, to his council of 44 representatives.

       The Detroit Free Press   Two stories this morning about  urlLink cross border dumping .  In that spirit the state Legislature returns today to consider a raft of rules to restrict the flow of solid waste from Canada and neighboring states -- an issue that has seized the public's attention like few others in recent years.   Perhaps obscured amid the grandstanding is that none of the pending bills stops garbage from being trucked across borders, and some create higher disposal fees for Michiganders as well as for those . . . well . . . foreigners.   The package would, however, reduce the amount of out-of-state refuse dumped in state landfills. It also would boost the state's recycling programs, make the contents of landfills cleaner and allow virtually every Michigan lawmaker to return to his or her district and say, "I did this for you!"  The quotes from some of the State legislators are precious (bold added)  The public outcry reached a crescendo during the past year. Television news footage showed Toronto-based garbage trucks lumbering across the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron; politicians issued demagogic statements like that of U.S. Congressman Mike Rogers, who vowed to stop the importation of  "dirty diapers and leftover Canadian bacon."  And Michigan House Democrats paraded their Trash-O-Meter, a cheesy electronic tally board showing tonnage of out-of-state garbage entering Michigan in "real time."  Thanks Mike, but up here we just call it "bacon".  All in all I would have to imagine that poopy diapers and pork scrapings are generally easier to manage then say.... urlLink electroplating chemicals and paint sludge.   Michigan ships more than nine times as much hazardous material -- plating sludges, spent solvents, paint wastes and the like -- to Canada as Canada sends to Michigan.   "We're sending them hazardous waste and getting municipal waste. That's a fair trade-off to me," said Mike Johnston, director of regulatory affairs for the Michigan Manufacturers Association. The association opposes many of the proposed laws regarding imported waste, including the $3 per-ton fee on garbage landfilled in Michigan.  Right, because the Michigan Manufacturers Association knows that levying import tariffs on garbage trucks would most likely prompt Ontario officials to block the import of hazardous waste, and stop the US from taking advantage of our more lenient disposal regulations for chemicals.

       The dead man can't breathe   A good friend/pseudo-relation of mine found a little picture that's been quite dear to me for some time now.    A few years ago I was working in a City transfer station.  I heard the roar of a diesel engine, and the skid of breaks outside my door and then the shouts of one of my co-workers.  In his thick Newfoundland accent he called out my name and then said "Buddy, you gotta look at this.  Check this out man.  Jezus eh, this is so weird".  He was out of breath for two reasons: 1) He was a heavy smoker (like most of my co-workers) and 2) He'd just bought a pack of DuMauriers that had one of the new Health Canada  urlLink colour photos  on it.  "Donnit look like you buddy?".  The soon-to-be-corpse in the photo on the package, looks almost exactly like me.  Dying.  In a hospital bed.  Tubes rammed down my throat.  It was as if Health Canada were sending me a direct message: This is you dying.  Please don't smoke.  The photo circulated around my friends and relatives for a few months and now, thanks to the glorious internet, I can share it with you.

       Ginger   Whilst down south, I purchased a little treat in a local chain called " urlLink Trader Joes ".  Ginger Altoids.  If you've ever tried Ginger Beer, you'll understand why the company famous for it's "curiously strong" product chose to include ginger in it's line.  They're hot and spicy and they taste exactly like distilled ginger bread.  I've got about 50 left and they're going fast.  Haven't seen them in stores around here, which means that as soon as the tin is empty I've got two options:  Drive 8 hours back to the store and buy them out.  Go through violent, introspective withdrawal, ending in a frothing rampage through the streets of Riverdale.  In an effort to avoid either of those two unsavoury choices I've sent the following email to the good people at  urlLink Altoids.com : Sirs,  I have recently returned to my home country of Canada with a tin of your new "Ginger Flavoured Altoids" in my pocket.  This product is quite simply the tastiest, most refreshing pastilles I've ever popped in my mouth. I love the flavour and I love the look.  Now the problem.  They don't seem to be available in Canada...    Can you let me know when, or if, you have plans to market this product north of the border?  We are a people who enjoy robust flavour, and your product would be an excellent fit.  Just drop me a line at the above address, and I'll let the rest of the country know.  Faithfully, While waiting for a response from Altoids.com I am, still.

When I returned to my desk I found this email in my inbox:  To:  	All Members of the Toronto Public Service   From: 	David Miller, Mayor  I am deeply honoured to take office as Toronto's Mayor today.  As one of my first official statements I want to thank you for your commitment to the City.  I believe strongly in the talent and abilities of the Toronto Public Service.  Your mission, like mine, is to serve a great city and its people.  During my years as a City Councillor, and as chair of the Personnel Sub-Committee during Council's last term, you have shown me that you take very seriously your role in helping City Council carry out its responsibilities. I have seen the excellent service you provide to individuals, communities and the City as a whole, seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day.  I have watched you fulfil your stewardship role by taking care of the City's resources and balancing the economic, social and environmental needs of the City with the long term in mind.  Your commitment is clear in the skills and knowledge that you apply to your work.  I have promised to work hard to make Toronto a great city.  Council will rely on you to make the promise of a great city a reality.  I want to work with you to increase openness in City government, and to ensure that Council's accountability to the people of Toronto is clear.  I want to hear your ideas and allow your energy and innovation to make a real difference to our city.  Together we can return City Hall to all of the people, and we can build a clean, vibrant, healthy city that reflects the pride and dedication you put into your work every day.  We all have a part to play in building a great city.  Once again, thank you, and I look forward to a respectful and productive partnership with you. Slightly above that email in the list of 60 or so this morning (post-vacation inbox) was this final sign-off from Mel:  Farewell to City Staff    I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your hard work and dedication over the past six years. The challenges we've faced since amalgamation have been both daunting and numerous, but we faced them together - and together, we've built a new foundation for this city that we all can be proud of.  There's no doubt that you are among the best public servants in the country.  This great city has been blessed with a good, conscientious staff and I am very grateful to each of you for all you have done to make our Toronto even greater.   Thank you again for helping me make a difference. Your support, your friendship and your trust have meant a lot to me over the years,  and it has been an honour, a privilege and a pleasure, to have served as your Mayor.  Mel Lastman Mayor I suppose "ex-Mayor" would have been a better salutation.

       The Return   My eyes are open again.  My girlfriend and I left our friend's home in Boston at 6:00 am yesterday morning, and drove for 8 hours.  We got to the border around 2:00 pm and got ready for the line up.  The longest we waited in line was 10 minutes, and that was just to pay a toll on the 190.  I was convinced we'd hit border traffic, or at least some questions at the border.  I wrote out the psychological cat and mouse game that was played as we entered the states in an earlier post, so in the interest of completeness, here is the psychological cat and mouse game that we played when trying to re-enter our home country: (Passports in hand again....)  How long have you folks been away? 5 days. What is the value of the items that you are bringing back into the country? About $150. Thank you.  Carry through please. I turned to my girlfriend after we'd rolled up the window and said "Wasn't he supposed to ask what country we are from?"  Not surprisingly, this isn't our first strange experience criss-crossing the border together.  A few years ago we spent a weekend in Niagara Falls.  After getting sick of the lights and animatronic robots in the tourist traps, we opted for a scenic walk along the Niagara river gorge.  At a few points along the river there are border crossings, used mainly by commuting locals.  We decided to walk across one bridges to the States, just so we could get a better view up the river.  As we crossed to the American side, we approached a shack.  There was no way to jump the fence (not that it would have been a good idea) so we went into the customs area.  In the tiny room sat some huddled masses yearning to breathe etc. and a very stern looking border guard.  He glared at me as I explained that we just wanted to cross the bridge and walk back across.  He demanded identification from both of us, and stared at our photo ID slowly comparing the pictures to our faces.  "Walk across the road, and directly back across the bridge.  That's all."  Ok.  I understand that we were kind of "testing" the system, and that a border guard has better things to worry about then two Canadians who "just want to walk across the bridge".  His demeanor and attitude were equal parts "I don't have time for this" and "There are ample opportunities to view the gorge that don't involve an international border crossing".  But still....  it was pretty and we wanted to see it.  We giggled and joked as we walked back to Canada, and yes the view was pretty.  As we approached the Canadian border shack we took a deep breath and walked in.  An alarm announced our arrival, and was silenced when the door was shut.  We walked into the waiting area and found no one.  Not a soul.  No huddled masses, and more importantly, no Customs and Revenue Canada staff.  The sounds of a television in a back room carried through the building, but that was it.  I asked aloud "Hello?" and was not granted a response.  We left feeling secure that the crazies would probably be stopped at the American border.  That's it.  Those are my best stories about international travel.  No strip searches, no probes, no 6 hour delays with questions and interrogations from INS officers.  I guess we should count ourselves lucky that our hassle was limited to a few stern questions that ended with a wave-through.  I guess we should count ourselves lucky that we're two white folk as well.  Namaste.

       Belinda, Ben and Mike   Ok I have to warn you.  The only link in this post goes to a site called Consumption Junction.  It's a self described 'sick and twisted' site, with lots of pictures of gross things (bloody and infected things), porn things (naked women and men doing things), and silly things (pictures like the one in the link).  There's LOTS of porn site advertising, so if you get queasy or morally outraged, then its probably best that you ignore this one and wait for my next post about puppies and daisies.  Conservative Party of Canada leadership candidate Belinda Stronach, perennial Toronto mayoral candidate Ben Kerr, and former Ontario Premier Mike Harris, get their  urlLink picture taken  and posted on Consumption Junction.  It's a first for national, provincial and municipal politics in Ontario.  In case you're wondering..."Better then Viagra" refers to the miracles of cayenne pepper that Ben Kerr has long advocated.  For more information on the wonders of cayenne pepper, please visit Ben Kerr on the north-east corner of Yonge and Bloor.

From:  Customer Service, Facilities and Real Estate  Re:  WinterCity 2004 Sound Checks on Nathan Phillips Square  ________________________________________________________________________________  Please be advised that there will be a number of sound checks for the upcoming WinterCity 2004 beginning Thursday January 29 and continuing through to Friday January 30, 2004. The sound checks will be conducted intermittently each day between the hours of noon to 2pm and 5pm to 8pm for the purpose of ensuring that the music for the WinterCity 2004 is satisfactory.   Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter please feel free to contact me on my pager at (xxx) xxx-xxxx  Thank you for you patience in this matter. I saw Babar the Elephant skating around down there earlier today.  No time to get his autograph though.  Pity.  In the interest of disclosure, I submit the following phone conversation I had with my girlfriend on the above matter: Her:  Hello?  Me:  Hi.  Who's the cartoon elephant that wears the green suit?  (*Shaft!*)  Her:  Babar.  Why?  Me:  I thought Babar were those cartoon blobs on TVO.  Her:  No.  Those were the  urlLink Barbapapas .  Is he wearing a crown?  Me:  Yes.  Her:  Then yes.  It's Babar the Elephant.  What's he doing?  Me:  He's skating around on the rink outside.  Her:  See, the Barbapapas had no real form.  It would be difficult to make a costume character for them.  You'd need two people.  Me:  Ok.  So Babar the Elephant king is out there skating around warming up for WinterCity.... Between Burberry, Babar and the Barbapapas, I'm getting taken to task on the Bs today.

       No, I'm just grossly uninformed   A friend over at  urlLink The Daily Planet , corrects me on the whole urban-burberry thing. Whoa man I just saw your blog. LOL you should install comments for times like these.  Burberry "repositioned" itself a few years ago out of the trenchcoat ghetto and into the rock star ghetto -- they put out uber luxe perfumes and hats and handbags aimed at the under 30 market.   The Burberry "urban" thing has been huge with rap stars for like the last 2-3 years, in fact I was complaining to  urlLink RobotJohnny  the other day (when I saw some girl with a knock-off bag) that it has TOTALLY PLAYED OUT so the gangstah you saw is way outdated and should move on, the new Burberry is the YSL man-bag with the chain on it to attach to your baggy pants, I think.  So now you are schooled man!!!! Ok so not only was I completely fascinated into over analyzing another fashion trend, but the trend was WAY out of style by the time I got to it.  Van Dutch indeed.  Still "whitey-bling" was quality wasn't it?....right?

       Man, I saw the wierdest thing today   He was walking on the sidewalk in front of me.  A guy, hunched over wearing a sports team logo parka and a pastel coloured ball cap.  Flat rim.  Hands shoved in the front pockets of overly baggy, dark blue jeans.  Ok, it's a look.  Fine, I get it.  I know there's supposed to be an attitude that goes along with it as well.  Generally you're not a member of the wind ensemble in highschool if you choose to dress like that.  On the back of his jeans, were two comically large back pockets made entirely out of fabric with the  urlLink Burberry pattern  on it.  A rolled up bandana hung out of the top of the left-side pocket.  Come on.    That must have been satirical.  I mean, you can't walk around in the full-fad-gear of your peers, while wearing a symbol of another generation's fad-gear on your ass, without having a passing sense of irony.  I've ridden the subway to Queen Station enough to give me an idea of what fads the rich-folk are into.   urlLink Burberry  definitely seems to be one of them.  Handbags, gloves, scarves, shoes....  It's an effective logo, and one that denotes the ability to casually spend.  Whitey bling, if you will.  So was this guy:  Making a visual statement by wearing one of the status symbols of the upper class....on his ass?  Making a statement about conformity by being simultaniously involved in two fads?  Showin' his mad skilz, my nizzle.  Yeah, probably.

       Frum and the Whale   The only place that I can make these two references is here.  I must say, I love the internet.  I'm " urlLink reading " Frum and Perle's "An End to Evil" right now and it's an interesting balance after  urlLink this one .  They maintain that Iraq had WMD, and decry Clinton and other "soft" theories as containment ('he's in a box now'), and even the original Bush decision to "not go to Baghdad".  Frum and Perle are SO far to the right it's comical.  They talk in terms of "they (the left) want to cower from the challenge, but we (the right) want to fight".  Frum is completely American, and it will be interesting to see if he refers to the country he expatriated from as home, ever again.  Not as comical  urlLink as this  however. "The animal was close to death when someone found it beached on shore on Saturday... Because of the natural decomposing process, a lot of gases accumulated, and when the pressure buildup was too great, the whale's belly just exploded and spilled blood and the innards on the street," Wang said.   Despite the explosion, enough of the whale remained intact that it will still be transported to the 'Shi-Tsao Natural Preserve' for a scientific examination, Wang added. The fact that it was a sperm whale that exploded all over Taiwan, just made it that much funnier.

       Reality   Coming up next on Fox: Who wants to  urlLink fuck a midget ? The sweeps period gets underway Feb. 5.  Here's a sample:  A Valentine's Day weekend on Fox with "When Animals Attract," a National Geographic show about mating rituals, and "Love Hurts," a two-hour "Cops" featuring domestic disputes.  Fox is also lining up stars for a "Celebrity Spelling Bee" set to air over three Friday nights starting Feb. 13.  CBS is launching an "all-star" edition of "Survivor," featuring past contestants. It premiers Sunday after the Super Bowl.  ABC is reviving "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," with contestants competing for a $10 million prize, starting Feb. 23.  NBC is depending on expanded or "supersized" versions of its new reality hit "The Apprentice."  For the first time, two major awards shows also will air in the sweeps with the Grammys on CBS (Feb. 8) and the Academy Awards on ABC (Feb. 28).   Remember when this stuff only happened on the Howard Stern show?  Remember how outraged people (and media) were that he could get away with those kind of stories and contests?

Apparently the extent of the power outage was from College to Queen, and University to Victoria.  Yours truly was in the dark for about an hour and a half.  My desk is nice and tidy now.  My girlfriend pointed out that City Council was meeting today.  Apparently they just kept right on going after the lights went out.

       Anchor   Gord Martineau doesn't live here.  Sorry folks.  In the past hour and a half the the referrals from Google and other search engines have been a broken record:   urlLink Gord Martineau off Camera Comments    urlLink gord martineau scandal    urlLink "gord martineau" singer    urlLink gord martineau gesture   and my favorite:   urlLink "Gord Martineau" ass   A good friend of mine forwarded the solution to this puzzle  urlLink this morning : 'Crazy' Gord Martineau insults people everywhere Glen McGregor  CanWest News Service  January 27, 2004   In outtakes now circulating on the Internet, Citytv anchor Gord Martineau calls a Canadian singer a "homo," mocks a walkathon for cancer-stricken children and says his penis has more news value than a pancreas transplant.  With co-anchor Anne Mroczkowski at his side in the Citytv studio, Mr. Martineau made the offbeat remarks during an undated taping of promotional items for the CityPulse at Six newscast.  In one clip, Mr. Martineau, lisping heavily and swinging his arms from side to side, warms up by referring to a prominent Canadian singer as a "homo."The anchors then refer to a news items about a memorial service for a slain Toronto-area high school student and a walkathon for children with cancer.  "Boy, we're sensitive, eh? Aren't we?" Mr. Martineau says sarcastically. "... I'll go to confession tomorrow."  In another segment, he ridicules a news story about Ontario's first pancreas transplant recipient. "Jesus Christ, what is that? Is this like National Lampoon? Who wrote this?.... Oh boy, Ontario's first pancreas transplant recipient."  When Ms. Mroczkowski defends the item as an interesting medical story, Mr. Martineau points toward his groin and says: "This is interesting. That is not."  Taping of another promo is interrupted by a technician concerned about a graphic, referred to as a key. Mr. Martineau leans back, holds a rolled-up piece of paper in front of his groin and says: "Right here is your key. See this key? Right here."  Mr. Martineau did not return a call requesting comment.  Stephen Hurlbut, Citytv vice-president, yesterday apologized for what he assessed as a lapse into a "bad sense of humour" such as is apt to occur in newsrooms.  No disciplinary action is required, he said. "That would be absurd."  Mr. Martineau was embarrassed about "something that may speak to a stellar career in broadcasting that might get a bit of smirch on it because he got crazy one day," Mr. Hurlbut said. He said the clips are taken out of context and would give viewers an unfair measure of Mr. Martineau's character.  "It's absolutely wrong. This is not who we are."  Mr. Hurlbut said he did not think the comments would offend gay employees who might have heard them in the newsroom.  "I think any employee, whether they be gay or not, is absolutely comfortable with Gord and the value structure within which we operate."  He pointed to the station's history of championing human rights.  "Our news channel, CP24, is the first station in Canada to have an openly gay show."  Mr. Hurlbut said he did not know how the outtakes ended up on the Internet.  Mr. Martineau is one of Citytv's most recognizable faces. He has been reading the news for the station since 1977 and is active with many Toronto charities.  "Off camera, Gord keeps us laughing with his wicked sense of humour and keeps me on my toes," entertainment reporter Liz West said on Citytv's Web site tribute to Mr. Martineau, who celebrated 25 years with the station in 2002.  (Ottawa Citizen) Hmmm...  remember when  urlLink Avery Haines  got fired from her job at CTVnewsnet for  exactly the same thing ?  I wonder if they'll give Mr. Martineau the same consideration....  In Haines' case, someone in the back room ran the wrong tape (intentionally or not).  The tape (an outtake) of her flubbing a line while reading the news, and then joking (on mic, but through her earpiece) with someone in the control room.  She joked by saying "We've got a stuttering newscaster. We've got the black, we've got the woman, I could be a lesbian, folk-dancing, black woman stutterer."  Come on....it's still funny today, but CTV still bowed to pressure to fire her.  Now in Martineau's case the footage of the anchor mincing about the newsroom, and encouraging his colleagues to focus on his crotch never actually made it to air.  Like those of the  urlLink Star Wars kid  or Mayor of  urlLink Huston B.C. , Martineau's private moments were captured and then spirited around the internet by wags like myself.  Was it private?  You can't tell me that it wasn't.  How else would you expect him to act?  Have you ever cracked a joke at work?  Ever made light of a stressful situation?  Ever had fun with colleagues in a way that other's might percieve as being inapropriate?  This is  not  a big deal.  If you're actually offended by Martineau's comments.....  Let me clairify here: if YOU are actually offended by Martineau's comments, and not just feeling offended for someone else.....  then write to CityTV and express your outrage, and lobby the rest of us to your view.    If it doesn't matter to you, then just watch the videos and laugh at the embarassing behaviour.  You do it  urlLink all the time  anyway.   Update :  The good people at  urlLink RobotJohnny  pointed out a spot to see  urlLink Gord in action .  But the link is now dead.  The VidMan has a working copy, and you can head over to see  urlLink him here .   Further Updae:  City TV and Gord Martineau released the  urlLink following statements  about the incident: January 27th, 2004  Citytv Toronto issues the following statement in response to off-air footage that has recently and illegally been circulated on the Internet:  Ive been in the news business for over 35 years, and it is with huge regret that I find myself the center of the story. Within the past 24 hours some videotape of a station promo session taped many years ago - material that was never telecast or ever intended to be - found its way to the Internet. Im personally mortified some tired, silly and inappropriate comments I made might damage the stellar reputation that Citytv has earned. I apologize. Im so proud to be part of a news team that has always been instrumental in making a difference, and still leads the way in effecting positive change. I ask and hope that youll judge me based on the work Ive been part of for the last 30 years and not on a regrettable incident.  Gord Martineau Anchor/Reporter, CityPulse News    For 25 years I have had the privilege of working with Gord Martineau; I know who he is as a man, I know what he values, and I know where his heart is. Gord is perfectly placed as our lead player in a news shop that respects all individuals. We are inclusive, we are fair, we are committed to reflecting every voice, every race, every face, every cause. We are respected for breaking barriers and celebrating each others differences. We are fully committed to building bridges of understanding between individuals and groups.  Gord's attempt to be humorous - in an off-air exchange with a colleague many years ago -- was insensitive and inappropriate and he truly regrets his comments. This incident does not reflect his character, his professionalism or his body of work.  This is not only about Gord; this is about every member of our staff who, like Gord, all share values of respect, inclusion, fairness and social justice. While our hearts are absolutely in the right place, this is a case when, admittedly, the humor was not. Our values and commitment remain strong. I commit that we will be better, still human, and therefore still flawed, but better.  Stephen Hurlbut Vice-President, News Programming - Citytv Toronto So there you have it.

       If you're like me, you'll need these eventually...   When the contact high from the real life adventures wear off, you find, in the tiny moments that bomb, your old files rain down from the sky. And would they fall down, like cymbal crashes, would the alarm bell sound? Would your eyelashes keep all this in time? If not, I won't mind... it can be impractical. So can you tell me why in every version of the events shown here, there's another season that crawls by like years, from blown speakers clear? It came out magical. Just a contact high, one in every mood I've ever declined to fight, one in every single exchange you might find. From blown speakers, time came out magical. It came out magical,  urlLink out from blown speakers .  First my trusty voice cracked, like it's not plain to see, a sidewalk step, defaults on my debt to the order of society. Behold our first rate lady, as if you hadn't guessed, the homemade queen of every homecoming not so gently laid to rest. And then outside her courtyard after entering your plea you strike the right ingredient and chew the scenery. How many times must we say, this kind of inflation cannot kill us. Our backers use versions we used to unwind with, the threads of an argument lost. To wild homes we go. To wild homes we return.  urlLink To wild homes  we go.

       Sunday Evening   Every year, in early December, I try egg nog again.    I know I'm going to hate it, but I just have to remind myself  why  I hate it.  This ritual doesn't apply to everything gross or unpleasant in my life; I don't have to re-touch a hot stove every so often just to remind myself; but egg nog is just so bloody popular that I keep thinking I'll eventually develop a taste for it, and maybe this is the year...  No dice so far.  Ditto for fruitcake.  Using the same logic, I watched some of the Golden Globes last night.  I hate award shows with a passion normally reserved for war criminals, but I thought it would be a topical distraction to watch while I was washing dishes.  Hated the presenters, hated the dresses, hated the speaches, hated the smugness....  But I loved some of the winners.  Ricky Gervais was up there twice (that I saw) last night for a fantastic BBC program called  urlLink The Office .  Bill Murray won for best actor in a drama ( urlLink Lost in Translation ), and gave a cut and dry (literally) acceptance speach.  And I think the Return of the King might have received a passing mention last night.

       John Paul 2: Electric Boogaloo   This story  urlLink is worth it , just for the picture: During the show, one dancer -- part of a Polish group that helps poor and marginalized youths -- planted his head on the inlaid marble floor of the Vatican hall and spun to loud applause from his group and from Vatican officials. Another performer flung his body around in a series of spins and handstands.  "Artistic talent is a gift from God and whoever discovers it in himself has a certain obligation: to know that he cannot waste this talent, but must develop it," John Paul said. Pop and lock, fool.  (Pope and lock?)

       It's all there   If you are having trouble understanding why strange things are happening in the world, then I submit  urlLink this article , via the good people at  urlLink Fark.com  (bolding added):  KSDK will rebroadcast Monday's end of 'Average Joe: Hawaii'   By Gail Pennington Post-Dispatch 01/20/2004   Larissa Meek (NBC)   KSDK (Channel 5) has obtained permission from NBC to rebroadcast the final segment of "Average Joe: Hawaii," interrupted Monday night for a news report from the Iowa caucuses.    Viewers clogged the KSDK switchboard and fired off questions to the station's Web site on Tuesday to protest the interruption, which came at a pivotal point in the episode. The entire final segment, running about nine minutes, will air about 10:30 tonight, after the station's late newscast.    The station broke into "Average Joe" to go live to a speech by Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who had finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, all but ending his political career.   "Unfortunately, we can't orchestrate when breaking news happens," KSDK news director Mike Shipley said Tuesday. Citing the station's slogan, "Where the news comes first," he said, "We'd do the same exact thing again. The only thing I wish we could change was the timing."   "Average Joe" is a reality series in which a beautiful woman (this time, St. Louis native Larissa Meek) is courted by a group of average-looking guys. In a twist, handsome men then arrive to compete with the "average Joes"; that arrival, which had been teased all night, was just about to happen when the interruption occurred. And yes, it would be just a stupid to complain if it were a football game instead of last night's episode of Popular Reality Show.

       I just feel like someone should preserve these   God forbid something happens to the Toronto Star  urlLink online server  and these responses are lost, I'll still have a copy of them here.  And for the record "Gliding Beaver" is the funniest shit I've seen in a month: Canadian American Transportation Systems (CATS) is holding a competition to pick a name for the ship that will be used for its new high-speed ferry service between Toronto and Rochester, scheduled to begin in May. We asked our readers what name they would suggest. A number of readers elected the ToRo (or RoTo) drawn from the first two letters of each city's name. Here's some other suggestions:   The best name is the Magic Ferry. You will have so much fun you will not know how you got to the other side.  Lora Magliocco, Rochester, Jan. 21  Name the ferry CANUSA (pronounced canoosa).  Billie Atkinson, Welland, Jan. 21  My suggestion is CANUSA STAR.  Robert Ford, Windsor, Jan. 21  Gliding Beaver.  Albert Perez, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Jan. 21  Catch the Moment.  Dorothy Luckhurst, Toronto, Jan. 21  The Friendship Ferry because people on both sides of the border will visit.  Melicent Young, Toronto, Jan. 21  The recommended name from me is YiFei. It's Chinese name which means "fly away". Sounds cool, doesn't it?  Ke Sun, Toronto, Jan. 21  My suggestion is the LINKONNY or ONNYLINK (linking Ontario to New York State).  Alan Wadsworth, Pickering, Jan. 20  The new name for the ferry, definitely, should be Aqua Runner. It defines that it's a water vessel with a decent speed to it.  Maxine Maxwell, Toronto, Jan. 20  I would like to name the ferry Kinship.  Maureen Aubrey, Sharon, Jan. 20  In my opinion The Circuit would be the perfect name because it's in direct reference to a permanent connection and it moves in a loop traveling back and forth.  Amanda Brooks, Toronto, Jan. 20  The Shortcut (because it is); The Torester (the two cities); The Carousel (a festive round trip); The Straight Line (shortest distance); and Le Voyager (a touch of bilingualism).  Kristin Basso, Consecon, Jan. 20 Man, now I have to think one up.    How about "The Muskokarondack: The ship that will connect the two cottage countries"...  I wonder how that's going to look when I'm sober.

       Rising   The signal on the top of the Canada Life building at 7:30 this morning:  Solid red light, with a rising tower.  So, if I interpret this correctly, there will be rising temperatures this morning, under overcast skys.  No snow, no rain.  Or...hail followed by locusts.  I forget what the red one means again...

       Clarification   When I said "classic Canadian controversy" back there?  I didn't mean to detract from the more popular Canadian controversy, or "Canadian Ethical Debate": If I buy you and me a coffee at Tims when it's Roll-Up-the-Rim-to-Win time and you win the truck   do you keep it, or  do I get it, or  do we sell it and split the money?   Figure out where you are in the debate and let's get it out there.   urlLink We're going to need it soon .

       That'll do pig    urlLink This show  will change political discourse in this country.  While the jury may still be out on the  urlLink quality of the show .  It has a few people talking and may be the double shot of espresso that the public needs to stay engaged during the upcoming Federal campaign.  If it can stay on the air.  Mercer's streeter tonight on the steps of parliament hill was great.  His point was, that if it doesn't cost us money, they pay for their own roads, their own hydro and they don't piss off the Inuit, then the Americans can set up whatever they need in the Northland to run their missile defense program.  Finishing with "Jack (Layton), that's not caving to American pressure, that's just being nice to the neighbours".  I liked it, and his argument won me over.  We've got to give them something.  But then they did the George W. Bush action doll, complete with assless chaps for when he goes clubbing.  Please don't take me wrong here, it was a funny bit, and would have been perfect coming out of  urlLink any number  of different  urlLink types of media .   But the CBC is a Federally funded organization, and if they piss off the Americans.....     But their mandate says they should: (i) serve to safeguard, enrich and strengthen the cultural, political, social and economic fabric of Canada,  (ii) encourage the development of Canadian expression by providing a wide range of programming that reflects Canadian attitudes, opinions, ideas, values and artistic creativity, by displaying Canadian talent in entertainment programming and by offering information and analysis concerning Canada and other countries from a Canadian point of view,  (iii) through its programming and the employment opportunities arising out of its operations, serve the needs and interests, and reflect the circumstances and aspirations, of Canadian men, women and children, including equal rights, the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature of Canadian society and the special place of aboriginal peoples within that society, and be readily adaptable to scientific and technological change; .....right?  (Oh,  urlLink and it's here , by the way.  It's a fun read)  So this is the classic Canadian controversy.  Like a national cold sore, it flares up every once in a while and I think something like this will set it off again.  I can understand how the W-as-leatherman bit would be broadcasting Canadian attitudes, opinions and ideas, but there's guys  urlLink like this watching  everything we do, and that scares me, because he gets people  urlLink like this talking .    One one side the issue is that "the CBC is a Federally funded organization" and "the CBC can say anything it wants regardless of how politically sensitive it is" tend to blur into "The Canadian government portrayed George W. Bush in a homosexual outfit and pose" when it gets translated into American.  On the other, the CBC's content is not State controlled and Parliament doesn't (or shouldn't) have any say in dictating what content will or will not fulfill the mandate that's been set out in the Act.  That's what we pay the CBC to do, and if it's still a problem then it needs to go to the Supreme court to interpret the legislation.  So there you go.  That's the debate.  It's  urlLink already started .

       Sunday Morning   First Coronation Street, then  urlLink CBC News: Sunday .  That's how it's been around our place for the past few months.  My girlfriend and I prepare breakfast while finding out how Fred, Fiz, Richard and the rest spent their week, and finish our coffee watching  urlLink Evan Solomon  and Carole MacNeil battle for journalistic supremacy on the CBC.  We think that Evan is winning the battle.  Each week the two start by previewing and comparing the interviews that each has conducted for that week's show, and after each segment the camera turns back to them in the studio for reactions and follow-up.  Last week Carole MacNeil interviewed noted Canadian diplomat  urlLink Lloyd Axworthy  and noted idiot  urlLink Patrick J. Buchanan  about missile defense and Canada's involvement therein.  Buchanan remarked "If Canada does not go along with the United States on this issue it will be perceived as an unfriendly act".  After the goodbyes MacNeil said that she'd looked up the definition of "unfriendly act" and found that it represented a diplomatic term meaning an act which may lead to war.  She summarized Buchanan's statement as a "threat of war".  After the break we returned to hear MacNeil tell about a "call from one of our producers upstairs" who said "Pat Buchanan could sue us" over her closing statement.  She didn't exactly retract her statement, saying only "I just said what the definition of the term was".  This week's show made me laugh out loud though.  MacNeil had scored an interview with embattled Liberal Sheila Copps, who spoke about  urlLink Tony Valeri's  intention to win the Liberal nomination in her  urlLink East Hamilton riding of 16 years .   urlLink Carole MacNeil , interviewing Shelia Copps: "How intent are you, on running in this riding....period" Um....shouldn't there be a question mark in there somewhere...?  I know I'm just finding fault where there is none warranted.  But it was a line that definitely jumped out of the TV screen and hung there like a fart on a subway platform.  "What did she just say...."

       One eye open   Wow, Peter MacKay is going to have to start looking over his shoulder.   urlLink This is the kind of thing  that causes guys like David Orchard to go postal.  To review:  Clark steps down as leader.  MacKay battles with Orchard and other Tories for the leadership of the PCs.  MacKay makes a deal with Orchard, by saying that he won't unite the party with the Canadian Alliance.  Orchard drops out, and MacKay wins the PC leadership.  MacKay and Stephen Harper agree to unite the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance.  The Conservative Party of Canada is born.  Harper aggressively announces his intent to win leadership of the Conservatives.  Peter MacKay announces he will not seek to lead the new party.  Does Orchard have any recourse?  Probably not.  This is the kind of thing that will get ugly when they pass each other at a fundraising dinner one day...

       Youth and New Media in Voting   We're in there somewhere.    I found  urlLink this little number  while doing some  urlLink narcissistic searching  last night.  Enjoy: The real news, though, is that as publishing has become affordable by most Canadians, the rise of self-publication has led to new magnitudes of political discussion. Although perhaps the most famous alternative political source on the Internet is  urlLink http://www.indymedia.org , created during the WTO Protest in Seattle, alternative political discussion on the Internet has spread throughout the political spectrum. Although the trend in Canada is far behind that of the United States by  several  magnitudes, political weblogs have begun to take root in Canada. Some good examples include  urlLink http://www.canoe.blogspot.com ,  urlLink http://davidartemiw.com , and  urlLink http://armchairgarbageman.blogspot.com . Although normally the purview of the political hobbyist, they have begun to attract the interest of the political savvy, including such as Warren Kinsella ( urlLink http://www.warrenkinsella.com ) and Michael Wilson ( urlLink http://michaelwilson.blogspot.com ). These websites provide a forum for their authors to describe their perspectives on the world's happenings to anyone who would listen to them, and consequently come as close to Thomas Jefferson's ideal of universal popular press as ever before. Democratizing the press can have a greatly positive effect on the public's overall perspective. After all, as Joseph Pulitzer warned in 1904, "Our republic and its press will rise or fall together. A cynical mercenary press will produce in time a people as base as itself." I'm not exactly your go-to guy when it comes to in-depth political commentary.  Might I suggest some of my more insightful colleagues...   urlLink Spicer    urlLink Fletcher    urlLink Bow   and  urlLink Pogge

       No tongue indeed   This, via the good people at  urlLink warrenkinsella.com : Princess Marg Delahunty plants one on Stephen Harper; he returns favour  Jan 12, 2004 21:12   OTTAWA (CP) _ It was a scrum to remember for Stephen Harper.   Moments after officially announcing his candidacy for the leadership of the new Conservative Party of Canada, Harper was blitzed by Marg Delahunty, the sword-wielding warrior princess played by Mary Walsh on CBC's news satire This Hour Has 22 Minutes.   The scantily clad actor launched into her trademark political diatribe as Harper stood with a frozen smile in the camera lights. As the rant ended, Delahunty grabbed Harper around the shoulders and locked her lips on his, drowning roars from the crowd of Harper well-wishers surrounding the pair.   Harper responded by playing against type, returning the embrace and emerging from the encounter with a huge grin and his face smeared with bright red lipstick.   Walsh later grimaced that there'd been no tongue work involved.   Delahunty is known for her notoriously funny ambushes of prominent political leaders, including Paul Martin, Jean Chretien, Ralph Klein, Mike Harris and Stockwell Day.   It wasn't the first time in the evening that Harper, 44, drew a big laugh.   In his speech making his candidacy official, he cracked that "Paul Martin commits to positions like Britney Spears commits to marriage.''   Â© 2003 The Canadian Press Once again:  "Paul Martin commits to positions like Britney Spears commits to marriage"  HaiOohh!!  Does he have Bruce Vilanch writing for him now?  Let's get a couple more ready for him: Hey folks, I hear that Paul Martin and Pete Rose are old friends, turns out that Paul was the guy that Pete never bet on baseball with.  No but seriously, Paul Martin is a friend of the little guy....a little guy named 'Paul Martin'!  Thanks, you folks are great audience..Incidentally, Paul Martin's mamma so fat.... Man, I'd love to hear the dozens start with: "Incidentally, Yo mamma so fat..."

       Our PM   I'm not saying whether he is or not, but Paul Martin looks like he's lying.  Watch him on camera, and listen to his voice.  When he's in a press conference, or answering reporter's questions about sensitive issues (like the RCMP raids in BC, or the Liberal membership scandal that is slowly unfolding) his voice waves, his eye flutter closed.  I think it's much easier to tell when Bush is lying.  Don't bother listening to the speaches, or even the network interviews; they're coached to death, and the questions are provided ahead of time.  Watch the Bush press conferences, and reporter scrums.  Watch when he's asked novel questions, and required to provide off the cuff responses.  He stammers, he slips on words, his grammar disappears like so many WMD.  He's either lying, or he's trying to sort out in his head what he's allowed to say, and what he's been told not to say.  We're very early in Paul Martin's reign and as such we're seeing him speak on a national and international scale for the first time.  He's being asked tricksy questions about things he doesn't know about, or knows too much about, and he's got a tell.  It will be interesting to see if he gets it coached out of him, or if we will have a solution to the "every politician lies" puzzle.

       P3   Public-Private Partnerships.  There's  urlLink this story  from the Star this morning: The coalition claims Great Britain's experience with privately funded hospitals is proof the extra borrowing costs for the private sector and the profit motive will suck billions of dollars out of medicare.   "Privatization comes out of the cost of your operational budget, and that means a cut and slash to programs, a cut and a slash to beds and it certainly means a slash and a cut to jobs," said Nancy Pridham, a Toronto mental-health worker. Is an organization, that is committed to quality, efficient and effective health care, in a conflict of interest if it is required to turn a profit in order to operate?  Will decisions that affect "patient care" (things like quality of food, patients per nurse, number of beds, etc) sway towards "the cheaper" over "the better" in a private system?  I guess we'll find out.

       Roast a Mayor   I don't mean to dwell on things past, but I got an email today from "the Friends of David Miller" at the Miller for Mayor office.  Who knew, they were still in business...  Anyway apparently, on my birthday, David Miller will be roasted by such celebrity guests as David Crombie, Anne Johnston and John Tory. Subj:  Roast Miller - Wednesday, January 28, 2004  Celebrity Roaster: John Tory with David Crombie, Anne Johnson, Jane Pepino and Friends	   The Concert Hall, 3rd Floor, Royal York Hotel, Toronto, Ontario (Front and York streets)	   Wednesday, January 28, 2004 Cash Bar and Hors d'oeuvres: 6 pm, Dinner: 7 pm Dress: Business	   Reservations: $500 per guest or groups of 5 for $2500.  urlLink Order Online Now   If reserving or making a donation by mail, please send your reservation information and cheque to David Miller for Mayor, c/o Janine Anderton, 260 Adelaide Street East, Suite 180, Toronto, ON, M5A 1N1.	   For further information or to order by phone or fax, please contact Janine Anderton Tel: 416-350-3574 or by email: janderton@look.ca	   Reminder: The maximum donation to a mayoral candidate is $2500 from an individual, business corporation or trade union. If you have not donated to David Miller before, you may reserve up to 5 places. Otherwise, you can only reserve a number of places that will not exceed a total donation of $2500. For full information on the donation policy and the City Rebate policy go to:  urlLink   http://www.toronto.ca/vote2003/pdf/rebate_bulletin.pdf    Authorized by the CFO for the David Miller for Mayor Campaign At $500 a person it's a little out of my reach, but I have to say it sounds like it would be an entertaining event.  Anyone who caught debates, especially those that were pared down to just three candidates (Miller, Tory and Hall), knows that Miller and Tory trade barbs on stage like two brothers.  Each usually had a comeback for what the other dished out, and the best part is that it was all done with an amazing degree of humour, despite the circumstances.  Watching Tory roast Miller would be a perfect event to listen to these two professional debaters go at it.  When I grow up and have a lot of money, I'll go to political fundraisers.  But for now, I'll just have to wait for the DVD to come out...

       Two things to tell you about   First and foremost, 5 simple words: Law and Order Colouring Book.  Via  urlLink Something Awful , you can  urlLink find it here .  My only concern is that feisty Assistant District Attorney Claire Kincaid wasn't featured.  [Editor's note: Try to think up a saucy "Hard to stay inside the lines" joke to go here.]  Secondly...  Ghostbusters is playing at the  urlLink Revue Cinema  (400 Roncesvalles) on  urlLink Wednesday and Thursday  of next week.  Both shows are at 7:00 and both are followed by that other Bill Murray classic... urlLink Caddyshack , at 9:10.  If, like some of my colleagues, you've never been west of Bathurst, take the subway to Dundas West station and walk south.  Or better yet, take the 505, or 506 to Roncesvalles and walk south.  Or, take the 504 right past the theatre. Dr. Egon Spengler: There's something very important I forgot to tell you.  Dr. Peter Venkman: What?  Spengler: Don't cross the streams.  Venkman: Why?  Spengler: It would be bad.  Venkman: I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing. What do you mean "bad"?  Spengler: Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.  Dr. Raymond Stantz: Total protonic reversal.  Venkman: That's bad. Okay. Alright, important safety tip, thanks Egon. Heh.  I love that movie.

       The Red Box   Sue Ann Levy's column caught my eye this morning.  Forgive me, but I'm going to put the whole megillah here, because the Sun doesn't archive it's content...  Bordering on trouble    City's trash trucks face U.S. tie-ups  By SUE-ANN LEVY -- Toronto Sun  With the New Year's bloom barely off the rose, one hates to engage in more security hysteria.   Heaven knows we've heard plenty over the past few days about the heightened "orange" terror alert in the U.S. and cancelled international air flights.   But let's not forget that - for better or for worse - up to 140 trucks take Toronto's garbage down Hwy. 401 each day to Michigan's Carleton Farms landfill site, located about one-half hour south of Detroit.   Those trucks - which carry about 22,000 tonnes of waste each week during the winter months - cross at the busy Michigan border points of Windsor and Sarnia.   With reports of border patrols being beefed up in the past month, what does that mean for Toronto's trash?   Angelos Bacopoulos, the city's general manager of solid waste management, told me yesterday "no doubt" there's a concern about the trash trucks making it across the border in a timely fashion.   He says the only reason they're not yet feeling the impact is that traditionally the amount of waste is down from January to mid-March compared to the busy spring and fall - which translates to 120-130 fewer truckloads per week.   "We certainly do have concerns," he said, noting last year with far less scrutiny they "struggled" during the peak periods to get the trash over the border on time.   "We understand the threats are to a great extent political posturing but we are taking them very seriously," adds new works committee chairman Jane Pitfield.   There's so much concern that Bacopoulos, policy and planning director Geoff Rathbone and Pitfield are travelling to Michigan tomorrow to meet with four officials from the state's department of environmental quality and a representative of the governor's office.    Update required   Rathbone says they've been asked to provide an update on Toronto's long-term waste diversion efforts and how the city is managing to keep hazardous materials out of the trucked trash. The Michigan people will also be giving our officials an update on the legislative situation there.   Now, I hate to sound less than fawning but prior to the election our new mayor didn't have much of a garbage platform - except to ask people to recycle more and to explore new and emerging technologies.   He openly derided his closest rival John Tory for daring to suggest state-of-the-art incineration, a proven technology being used in many European cities.   The city's green bin composting program will be rolled out throughout the city this year and Pitfield is determined to ramp up recycling efforts in apartment buildings. But Bacopoulos says the very earliest any kind of full-fledged emerging technology plant could be up and running is 2008 or 2009. And in the demonstration phase, a plant would at the most divert 25,000 tonnes of Toronto garbage a year.   Asked about incineration, he said it's a "proven" technology and if officials "could navigate through the public approvals" it would take less time to get a plant up and running.   COMRADES-IN-ARMS: You just have to read the latest CUPE 79 newsletter to understand the tight ties between new Mayor David Miller and his CUPE brothers and sisters.   And what price, in my view, he will pay for that coziness.   In a glowing report, president Ann Dembinski talks about how much Miller appreciates their hard work and what "great news" his win as mayor is for her local.   She makes no bones about how "actively involved" CUPE 79 was in that election.   "We organized phone banks to support David ... many of our members worked on election campaigns, devoting their time and energy to get David and union endorsed councillors elected," she writes.   There's no question Dembinski and Co. are expecting a big return on their investment.   As she continues: "We are hopeful that with a new Council and with David Miller as mayor, we will find a more receptive and cooperative mood at City Hall."   Hmmm. I always felt the last, more right-of-centre council kowtowed to the powerful CUPE unions. Just how much more co-operative can this new left-leaning bunch be without breaking the bank?   Will the union be just as "receptive" to the city's fiscal woes and offer up $75 million in efficiencies?   Nah. You can forget that. Wow.  Boy that's really something eh?  All those unions and stuff....  Weren't we talking about border security measures, and a garbage crisis a few seconds ago?    Ms. Levy never misses an opportunity to seethe about the City's unions, and when an opportunity doesn't present itself, it seems she just shoves it in at the end of a column.  Was the topic too thin?  I mean, is the fact that Canada's largest city on the verge of a major environmental crisis too boring of a topic for Ms. Levy?  Did she feel the need to punch it up a little, with some juicy bits about unions?  Just a little focus, that's all I'm asking for.  Maybe she's got that  urlLink Adult ADD  I keep hearing about....

       Overnight   It's a common theme, among these bloggers, to point out the silly ways that people find blogs through search engines.  Type "gay garbageman" into an AOL search engine, and  urlLink there I am .   urlLink  Je T'Aime Moi Non Plus (1975)   Dir. Serge Gainsbourg Joe's favorite film of his own work, this is a cult classic waiting to be discovered. A rich, tightly directed, sexy and very wild little film, it tells the story of a gay garbageman (Joe) in the American Southwest who falls in love with a girl (the incredible Jane Birkin) because she looks like a boy from behind. They spend the film trying to consummate their relationship. Filled with poetic touches using color, space, framing, dialogue and action, it's easy to see why Joe loves the film so much, though it will initially be disconcerting for fans to hear him dubbed into French (with English subtitles). Available for purchase on video through specialty video vendors and in France on DVD from Wild Side Video.

       Bringing down corporate America   Polaroid did some  urlLink PR work  a few days ago advising their customers that if they "shake it like a Polaroid picture", as advised by Outkast, their snaps will turn  urlLink out blurry .   urlLink Look at all  the news organizations that picked up Polaroid's response to the Outkast song.  Basically, Polaroid had to spend time, and possibly money, to react to some lyrics in a popular song.  There was no ill-intent (presumably) on Outkast's part, it's just that Andre 3000 probably wasn't all that interested in researching Polaroid's position on instant photo developing procedures.  Polaroid had to move to ward off any  possible customer complaints of poor quality photos.  "Shake it like a Polaroid picture" is just such an amazingly effective hook that it has become entrenched in Polaroid's brand almost instantly.  So there it is, all you culture jammers out there.  If you're really intent on "bringing down" the corporate giants, just work the improper use of their products into a catchy song hook, and they'll have to spend their time and energy reacting.  Some possibilities include:  "My big booty baby always supersizes at McD's....I'm lovin' it" from I Like Big Butts (remix by Justin Timberlake)  Wait a mintue....  I was going to try to think up other examples here....but now I'm just stuck on that one.    I really, really want Justin Timberlake to remix "I Like Big Butts".  Who do I have to talk to to make that happen?

       Two birds bought for $30,000   Who says the French are arrogant?  The Americans that's who.  The Americans are never arrogant themselves of course, they just like to think the French are...  There's the story of  urlLink this guy  who flipped off Brazil, twice, and was fined almost $30,000 for it.  See...it seems that the US brought in photographing and fingerprinting rules and technology called US VISIT around Christmas of 2003.  Foreign nationals from a long list of countries that the Americans have deemed hostile, are now required to submit to even greater public scrutiny in the name of national security...or homeland defence...or whatever they're calling it these days.  Countries who thought they had a good relationship with the US, like Brazil for instance, found themselves on the "list" and had their nationals stopped and documented at the border.  Brazil got so pissed off that they responded by requiring all Americans to be fingerprinted and photographed upon entering Brazil.  No one seems to doubt that this is more of a "show them what it's like" action, then an actual "national security" action.  After being "shown what it was like" for so many foreign nationals to enter the US, this guy flipped Brazillian authorities off.

       It takes something like this....   Ok.  Dogs poisoned, intentionally or not, in Withrow Park in the Danforth and Logan area.  Have you heard the discussion going on about this?  It's barely about "we need to find out who's doing this" and mostly dog owners and non-dog owners going at each other.  The blue box keeps the  urlLink flame alive here .    Forgive me, but I don't want to loose these: All dogs should be on leashes. All. They are the responsibility of the owner, and the owner should always be only a few feet away. That is for the safety of others and the animal itself. Unfortunately, in our society, it is often the dog that's walking the human.  Anthony Grieco, Los Angeles, Feb. 5  If people don't like to be around dogs then they shouldn't be in, or choose to reside near, a designated leash-free zone.  Wendy Tideman, Toronto, Feb. 5  Off-leash areas are great but they should always be fenced in. High Park on a Saturday seems to be a huge off-leash area.  Jason Mote, Toronto, Feb. 5  Leashless areas are no problem as long as the dogs are not attacking people and the owners pick up after them.  Lino Cafazzo, Hamilton, Feb. 5  Dogs are animals. They are not completely within a human's control. Dogs off-leash are at best a nuisance and at worst a danger to small people, children or not.  Marion Macdougall, Toronto, Feb. 5  It's obvious that kids and dogs shouldn't mix at parks. Both dog owners and parents pay taxes, and therefore have the right to use those public spaces. So why don't we just fence these off-leash areas and make everyone happy?  Rob Drynan, Toronto, Feb. 5  I believe that there should be designated off-leash areas for dogs in the city since there are no other legal areas for a dog to walk around and get exercise.  Nicole Hanhams, Stayner, Feb. 5  We have a very nice, and very big, off-leash dog park here in Austin. It's fenced, patrolled by the Parks Dept. and is locked at 10 p.m. No one is allowed in without a dog. In other words the park is just for them. Why not have a park exclusively for dogs and let the adults and kiddies have fun in another park?  Christine Giles, Austin TX, Feb. 5  City parks that are habitually used by dog owners and dogs are less susceptible to gangs, drugs and violence. Dogs in effect make the parks safer for everyone.  Garnet Marziliano, Toronto, Feb. 5  Off-leash parks are great, but it is imperative that they be fenced for the safety of others and for the dogs. Some people are terrified of dogs and we should all be able to share the parks. In Brampton we have no issues because are parks are fenced and located away from homes.  Jerry Castle, Brampton, Feb. 5  Leash-free zones are valuable assets for both dog owners and their dog. They promote physical and mental benefits and as long as the owner is responsible and knows their dog's behaviour well, there is no reason for alarm.  Melissa Whetstone, Toronto, Feb. 5  The majority of dog owners are not responsible. While I complete disagree with harming an animal, I can understand the frustration. In my neighbourhood, dogs run without leashes, dig up gardens and bark all night.  Lori Nyles, Toronto, Feb. 5  The city has smoke police but has never cared to act on the by-law requiring dog owners to pick up after their dogs. My former home in the area of the Humane Society was constantly subjected to dog feces on the bricked front yard. The parkette at King and Sackville is a disgrace, and the streets of the city are unwalkable. Why are the taxpayers funding dog bathrooms?  Robert Berg, Winnipeg, Feb. 5  It is only fair that parks include off-leash areas in parks as owners of mans best friend are taxpayers too. We and our beloved dogs have a right to exercise and socialize just as much as a parent with their child.  Michelle Coutu, Toronto, Feb. 5  Off-leash parks are great, but it is imperative that they be fenced for the safety of others and the dogs. In Brampton we have no issues because are parks are fenced and located away from homes.  Jerry Castle, Brampton, Feb. 5  There is a lot of work that goes into a leash-free park. The local government must agree to location and size of the completely fenced-in area. If non-dog owners wish not to have a leash-free park in their local park then they can speak out at the meetings.  Rhonda Smith, Georgetown, Feb. 5  I have been taking my two dogs to the leash-free park in Hamilton, Oakville, Burlington and Belleville. These parks differed in some respects but they all had three things in common: They were fenced in, they were away from residential areas and the dogs had a great time. Why is this even a question?  Frank Olah, Eldorado, Feb. 5  I could never understand why a city dweller needs a very large dog. Surely not for protection.  Hal Watt, Toronto, Feb. 4  In my area of North York there isnt any (off-leash area) and it is a shame. I would even pay a user fee for the privilege of a safe environment to socialize and exercise my animals.  Liz Johnson, Toronto, Feb. 4  Dogs, on or off leashes, do not belong in public parks or on city streets.  William Bedford, Toronto, Feb. 4  Dogs, especially large breeds, have no place running freely in an unfenced area near playing children. Many children are afraid of dogs, many dog owners are ignorant or uncaring of boundaries, and many dogs are poorly trained.  Michele Craig, Barrie, Feb. 4  In using Withrow Park for almost 15 years, Ive learned that many dog walkers release their dog at the border of the park, rather than waiting to get to the off-leash area proper. This mightnt be so bad, were it not for the equally numerous lot who appear to have little command of their pets once released.  Ross Turnbull, Toronto, Feb. 4  I strongly disagree that dogs should be allowed off-leash in open areas. It is completely irresponsible and dangerous. I am speaking as a dog owner in the Bayview area where off-leash dogs are becoming an endless battle. Just because your dog may be 'friendly' doesnt mean ours will be if it is approached.  William Sawada, Toronto, Feb. 4  Im sick and tired of the holier-than-thou attitude of Riverdale dog owners. Two of my kids have been bitten by out-of-control dogs in Withrow Park over the years. I dont condone this crazy poisoning but I do believe big dogs dont belong in a city.  Ritchie Leslie, Toronto, Feb. 4  You want a leash-free zone? Then put a fence around it! Parks are first for children, not dogs.  Jim Anderson, Toronto, Feb. 4  Having an area where responsible owners can let their dogs socialize with others is important to the emotional health of both owner and canine.  Byron Patchett, Toronto, Feb. 4  I understand the frustration that many people feel when dealing with the small number of anti-social and irresponsible dog owners who take great pleasure at ignoring all rules and normal codes of conduct but to deliberately seek to harm these animals is a serious crime against us all.  Phillip Wallace, Toronto, Feb. 4  There will always be dogs in parks, so we should have times that the park is considered off leash, with each park setting different times, depending on the location.  John DeBoer, Toronto, Feb. 4  There need to be more (leash-free zones), and they need to be fenced in. In Philadelphia, a neighbourhood dog owners association held fundraisers and got corporate sponsorships to finance the building of a fenced-in area in their local park.  Jill Skorochod, Toronto, Feb. 4  Our four-legged companions need playtime as much as peoples children do as well as socialization.  Leslie Ogilvy, Toronto, Feb. 4  For years, I lived near Withrow Park and was treated to the nightly sounds of wild dogs barking, growling and snarling as they tore around the park with their irresponsible owners huddled together, 50 or 100 yards away.  Andrew Morgan, Toronto, Feb. 4  I live by a dog park. Most residents do not want it due to continuous barking 24 hours a day. The city has to enforce better laws to protect all people that use parks.  Kim Halfyard, Toronto, Feb. 4  Is our planet so small that we cant afford an area for dogs to run and get exercise under their owners supervision?  Norm Ullock, Ajax, Feb. 4  I have seen dogs repeatedly chase tobogganing kids  If your toddler was repeatedly frightened out of her wits, and even put in danger by a nonchalant dog owner refusing to stop the dangerous situation of his own making, how would you feel?  Geoffrey Lumby, Toronto, Feb. 4  There are a lot of parks in the Greater Toronto Area and if people do not like to be where dogs are loose, there are a lot of parks where they must be leashed.  Lynn Hutcheon, Brampton, Feb. 4  We take our 3-year-old lab to leash-free parks in our area  After this we are not taking him there any more. Its scary.  Lisa Sheppit, Burlington, Feb. 4  Dog owners should be responsible and pick up after them, and not allow unruly or bad-tempered dogs to run free (the majority of the people are responsible). There are enough other parks for those people who do not like dogs running free to go to.  Sharon Smith, Bradford, Feb. 4  Off-leash areas in parks are fine, but the city should rigidly enforce the fines for having a dog off the leash outside the designated area. In High Park, there is a major problem of dogs roaming all through the park off the leash, inconveniencing other users of the park and totally uncontrolled by their owners.  Ash Baker, Toronto, Feb. 4  I attend a leash-free zone within a large park in the Danforth area with my dog. I have seen two problems: Dog owners socializing without having a clue when their dogs are eliminating or running off towards other people, and not having the skill to call their dog back and mothers and children determined to walk through the legally leash-free zone without teaching their children how to deal with dogs, such as not pulling their tails and not running away.  Liza Bryant, Toronto, Feb. 4  In the local parks in my area, not one single dog has ever littered. But I see baseball teams, soccer teams, teenagers out at night, all littering. And theyre the ones complaining about the few people who dont pick up after their dog.  David Cook, Toronto, Feb. 4 Wow.  That last one was funnier then I first though.  It always comes back to litter or garbage.  I've totally seen entire soccer teams NOT playing soccer and just throwing garbage all over the place.  And teenagers.  But no dogs...  Probably has something to do with the opposable thumbs.

       Keep this one in your back pocket   Might as well put the text of it  urlLink up here : Scalia Was Cheney Hunt Trip Guest; Ethics Concern Grows    Thu Feb 5, 7:55 AM ET    By David G. Savage and Richard A. Serrano Times Staff Writers   PATTERSON, La. ? Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia traveled as an official guest of Vice President Dick Cheney on a small government jet that served as Air Force Two when the pair came here last month to hunt ducks.   The revelation cast further doubts about whether Scalia can be an impartial judge in Cheney's upcoming case before the Supreme Court, legal ethics experts said. The hunting trip took place just weeks after the high court agreed to take up Cheney's bid to keep secret the details of his energy policy task force.   According to those who met them at the small airstrip here, the justice and the vice president flew from Washington on Jan. 5 and were accompanied by a second, backup Air Force jet that carried staff and security aides to the vice president.   Two military Black Hawk helicopters were brought in and hovered nearby as Cheney and Scalia were whisked away in a heavily guarded motorcade to a secluded, private hunting camp owned by an oil industry businessman.   The Times previously reported that the two men hunted ducks together while the case was pending, but it wasn't clear then that they had traveled together or that Scalia had accompanied Cheney on Air Force Two.   Several experts in legal ethics questioned whether Scalia should decide the case.   "In my view, this further ratchets it up. If the vice president is the source of generosity, it means Scalia is accepting a gift of some value from a litigant in a case before him," said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers.   "It is not just a trip with a litigant. It's a trip at the expense of the litigant. This is an easy case for stepping aside."   Aides to Cheney say the vice president, like the president, is entitled to travel to vacation spots on government jets and to take along guests at no cost.   "The vice president is on duty 24 hours, seven days a week," said Kevin Kellems, a spokesman for Cheney. "His security is important, and a certain number of people must accompany him."   Judges are bound by different rules, however. Federal law says that "any justice or judge shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might be questioned."   When asked about the trip last month, Scalia confirmed that he had gone duck hunting with Cheney, but said he did not see a need to withdraw from the case.   "I do not think my impartiality could reasonably be questioned," he said in a written response to The Times. He said "social contacts" between justices and high-level government officials have not been seen as improper, even when those officials have cases in the courts that concern "their official capacity, as opposed to their personal capacity."   "I expect that all of the Justices were invited to the Vice President's annual Christmas Party. The invitation was not improper, nor was the attendance," Scalia wrote.   This week, the justice was asked whether he had traveled to south Louisiana as Cheney's guest or paid for the trip. He refused to comment.   Two years ago, the Sierra Club (news - web sites) and Judicial Watch sued Cheney, seeking to learn whether the vice president and his staff had met behind closed doors with lobbyists and corporate officials from the oil, gas, coal and electric power industries.   A judge ordered Cheney to turn over documents detailing who met with his energy task force. Cheney appealed, and in September, Bush administration lawyers asked the Supreme Court to hear the case and reverse the judge's order.   It "would violate fundamental principles of separation of powers" to force the president or the vice president to disclose who they met with, said U.S. Solicitor Gen. Theodore B. Olson.   After considering the appeal behind closed doors on three occasions, the Supreme Court on Dec. 15 announced that the case of "in re Richard B. Cheney" would be heard in the spring.   It takes the votes of at least four justices to grant review of a case, but the court does not disclose which justices vote in favor of such appeals.   The hunting trip took place three weeks later.   Northwestern University law professor Steven Lubet said a vacation trip with the vice president is not the same as attending a Christmas party.   "This is certainly a level of hospitality that most litigants are not able to extend to Supreme Court justices," he said. "It also reinforces the perception this was an exceptional event, not a run-of-the-mill social event or a White House dinner."   The Washington legal director for the Sierra Club said his group is considering filing a motion to ask Scalia to withdraw from the case.   "On the face of it, that makes things worse," said the Sierra Club's David Bookbinder, referring to the justice's trip aboard an Air Force jet. "The fact that the vice president is his host and, in effect, is paying for his vacation puts it in an even more awkward light for Justice Scalia."   The decision is likely to rest with Scalia himself. In a response to a recent inquiry from two Senate Democrats prompted by the hunting trip, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the high court does not have a formal policy or rules for reviewing decisions by justices on whether to withdraw from a case.   Gillers said he found Rehnquist's response troubling as well.   "This has exposed a gap in the ethics rules. This is a federal law that applies to the justices, but in this instance, Scalia is the judge of his own case. I would think the full court has an interest in its institutional reputation and would want to review a decision like this."   In south Louisiana ? the state bills itself as the "Sportsman's Paradise" ? the Cheney-Scalia trip drew the attention of local officials because of the unusual security precautions.   Scalia had hunted ducks in the state's southern marshes several times before, and in November, Secret Service agents visited the area to plan for a visit by the vice president.   Ken Perry, who runs the Perry Flying Center at the Harry P. Williams Airport, said Secret Service agents were there in November to study security plans for the upcoming trip. They returned for a second trip around the Christmas holidays when the nation's terror level was raised to orange, or high, he said.   He and St. Mary Parish Sheriff David Naquin said that on the morning of Jan. 5, a large security contingent was in place ? two Black Hawk air combat rescue helicopters, a line of armored sport utility vehicles and a ring of federal agents and sheriff's deputies who set up a security perimeter. The area was declared a no-fly zone for other aircraft.   It was raining when the two blue-and-white jets, with the U.S. flag on their tails and the fuselages clearly marked "United States of America," appeared under the clouds. Perry said the planes radioed that "Air Force Two was on its approach." Perry said Cheney was among the first to deplane, followed by Scalia and a young woman who was identified to Perry as one of the justice's daughters.   Both Perry and Naquin said there were orders prohibiting photographs of those who exited the planes and climbed into the motorcade. But two days later, Cheney returned to the airport without Scalia, and photographs were allowed. Perry and Naquin said the vice president happily posed with them for photos at the Patterson airport.   Scalia stayed on to hunt for a few more days, the sheriff said, but local officials said it was unclear how he returned to Washington.   Perry said the planes were piloted by Air Force crews, and he added that the Air Force paid $2,000 for fuel to return to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.   Lt. Col. David Branham, a spokesman at the base, said the 10- and 12-seat planes are assigned to the 89th Airlift Wing there and are typically used for trips to rural airports too small to handle larger aircraft. "That's part of the package for moving the president and the vice president," he said.   The hunting camp is on private land and in a secluded section of a bayou. According to several local hunters, it includes a large floating camp where guests stay overnight. During the day, hunters armed with shotguns go out in small boats to duck blinds to position themselves for shooting.   Scalia and the sheriff said the hunting was not good in early January, probably because of inclement weather. "It was terrible," Naquin said. "There were very few ducks killed."   The camp is owned by Wallace Carline, the head of Diamond Services Corp., an oil services firm that is on 41 acres of waterfront property in Amelia, La. The company provides oil dredging, pile driving, salvage work, fabrication, pipe-rolling capability and general oilfield construction.   Carline, who founded the company 42 years ago, also contributes money to local Republicans running for office in Louisiana. He refused to comment on the visit by Cheney and Scalia.   Carline's secretary said he was in Mexico and had nothing to say about the hunting trip. "He enjoyed the visit," she said. "But it's over with now. It's old news. He's not going to talk to you."   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Serrano reported from Patterson, La., and Savage reported from Washington.

You'll note that Justice Scalia was one of the voices in favour of Bush.

       Well this is new...   I saw my first " urlLink See you in Athens " ad tonight.  It shows an American flag reflecting off of a young woman's face.  She looks something beyond sad.  I missed the tag line completely but I think it was something to the effect of "She didn't let her country down by loosing the gold medal.  She didn't even get to go to the games".  The camera pans back and we see she is standing at a storefront window with several TVs on display.  She's watching an Olympic medal ceremony, featuring an American athlete at the top of the podium.  Our woman is wearing a red "Canada" jogging suit, as she quickly runs away from the storefront and camera.  The onscreen text says 70% of our Athletes live below the poverty line.   So...who's doing PR for them?  That's a big message, that carries a lot of weight.  If our athletes don't get the money, America wins.  The message is so familiar (we hear it during and after every olympics), but someone had the brilliant idea to rub our noses in it  before  the Olympics.  Or at least, long enough before the Olympics for us to actually do something about it.  Like give money.  You're either with us, or you're with the Americans.  Don't let the Americans win...  I wonder if it will work.

       Men who aren't men   My girlfriend and I were killing time in a bar the other night.  We chose an establishment close to our eventual destination, which was in the heart of the downtown core, and as it was after work on a weekday, the bar was filled with Bay St. suits.  I've got nothing against suits.  Suits are the reason that I get to have pretty things to wear and an iPod to listen to.  However, I find that suits are generally phony.  They've got big salesmen smiles, and hearty handshakes that imply a lot, but don't mean anything.  They drink imported beer when they're with co-workers or a mark, and light beer when they're at home.  Whatever company they worked for, whatever job they were on, it required them to wear identical blue-gray suits, and carry identical black leather briefcases.  Maybe they were twin brothers.  Maybe they had a special mentor-protege relationship.  Maybe the blue-grey was the new "power colour" and anything that they said would be discounted as schizophrenic ramblings unless they were clad in  that  particular shade.  A waiter approached: Waiter:  Hi, what can I get you fellas today?  Suit one:  Yeah, I'll have a Stella.  Suit two:  Yeah, I'll have a Stella.  Waiter:  Ok, so that's two Stellas; Any food tonight?  Suit one:  Yeah, I kind of feel like something to eat...  Suit two:  Yeah, me too.  How about something to eat?  Suit one:  Uh.....how about we get an order of 10 wings and fries to split?  Waiter:  Ok, and how would you like the wings?  Suit one:  What do you have.....Medium?  Hot?  Waiter:  We have hot.  Suit one:  How hot is hot?  Waiter:  Not that hot.  Suit one:  Ok, we'll have those.  And some fries.  Suit two:  Yeah, that sounds good. Fade to black.

       No seriously.  This is what I want my Federal tax dollars spent on.   The CBC Archives.  I'm sure they're slowly digitizing their entire collection, but I want it all right now.  I want entire episodes of old radio shows like  urlLink Rawhide , I want a searchable index of every major global,  urlLink national , provincial and local  event that the CBC covered in it's history, and I want lots more  urlLink Gordon Lightfoot .    Lots more.    There comes a time in every man's life when he must empathize with his father.  A 9 minute version of " urlLink The Canadian Railroad Trilogy ", complete with a chorus of men who re-enact the building of the railway, helps me do that.  And I want more big haired Keith Morrison, reeeaaalllly pushing his news anchor voice, while introducing this clip:  urlLink The politics of plague . When you look at AIDS, God's judgment because of homosexual promiscuity in this land, and herpes, God's judgment because of heterosexual promiscuity, one can only use his imagination to determine "What is God going to do to judge America, because of 13 million little babies we've murdered since 1973?"  - Jerry Fallwell Well, if you believed what he said after September 11th....  I want my children to have a sense of history.  Not Cromwellian pillaging, but real, honest-to-God "it happened on that street corner right there", history.

       This ain't good   You know...as a casual observer, who's not invested in either side, I have to say that killing  urlLink this guy  seems like a really stupid idea.  I know it's hard for those of us who haven't subscribed to a formal religion in quite some time, but someone who can be described as the "spiritual leader" of a group of people, carries an enormous amount of emotional support from those people.  The kind of emotional support that will convince people to kill themselves for his cause.   urlLink Here's what the UK said .  Here's what  urlLink we said .  Here's what the  urlLink US said .  Here's the part that I don't get: The reaction from the US President.    I can't find any mention that he was aware of the action at all.  I mean, it's been a full news day, it had already happened when I woke up at 7:00 this morning, so he has to have been briefed on it, or something.  I find some stories that say that the " urlLink Bush Administration " is " urlLink deeply troubled " by the killing.... but no "President George W. Bush said 'something'" about the Yassin killing.  Surely the man who was installed on earth by God himself to rid the world of evil has  something  to say about what happened.  Maybe he'd say "Yassin's death means greater security in the region.  He will no longer lead the Palestinian people blindly to their suicide deaths.  The Israeli people struck back at terrorism today, and won another battle in the war against evil." Or maybe he'd say: Terrorism reared it's ugly head again today in the Middle East.  The Israeli government needlessly killed a spiritual leader to thousands of civilian Palestinians.  As of today I am requesting that Congress back my upcoming bill to sanction Israel and cut off all business ties with them. I know it's an election year George, but come on....you've got to back your horse, you know what I'm saying?  You can't pledge yourself to a war on evil, and then not say anything when evil happens in the world.   In fact  urlLink you just got finished saying  "We will never bow to the violence of a few. We will face this mortal danger, and we will overcome it together."  And further....  The war on terror is not a figure of speech. It is an inescapable calling of our generation. The terrorists are offended not merely by our policies -- they are offended by our existence as free nations. No concession will appease their hatred. No accommodation will satisfy their endless demands. Their ultimate ambitions are to control the peoples of the Middle East, and to blackmail the rest of the world with weapons of mass terror. There can be no separate peace with the terrorist enemy. Any sign of weakness or retreat simply validates terrorist violence, and invites more violence for all nations. The only certain way to protect our people is by early, united, and decisive action. Just give is a blink to let us know you're not too hungover...  Just hold all those who meet the definition to the same standard.

       Burma   This is a  urlLink pretty funny  story.  Bush campaign gear made in Burma  His campaign store sells a pullover from nation whose products he has banned from being sold in the U.S.  BY LAUREN WEBER STAFF WRITER  March 18, 2004, 9:49 PM EST  The official merchandise Web site for President George W. Bush's re-election campaign has sold clothing made in Burma, whose goods were banned by Bush from the U.S. last year to punish its military dictatorship.  The merchandise sold on www.georgewbushstore.com includes a $49.95 fleece pullover, embroidered with the Bush-Cheney '04 logo and bearing a label stating it was made in Burma, now Myanmar. The jacket was sent to Newsday as part of an order that included a shirt made in Mexico and a hat not bearing a country-of-origin label.  The Bush merchandise is handled by Spalding Group, a 20-year-old supplier of campaign products and services in Louisville, Ky., that says it worked for the last five Republican presidential nominees.  Ted Jackson, Spalding's president, said, "We have found only one other in our inventory that was made in Burma. The others were made in the U.S.A." He said the company had about 60 of the fleece pullovers in its warehouse, and that a supplier included the Burma product by mistake.  Bush campaign officials did not return calls seeking comment. The imports are potentially an issue because outsourcing has become a hot political topic in the election.  Bush last July signed into law the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, saying "The United States will not waver from its commitment to the cause of democracy and human rights in Burma."  Violators of the import ban are subject to fines and jail, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.  Burmese textile workers earn as little as 7 cents per hour, according to the National Labor Committee, a human rights group.  "If it is true, it is very contradictory because the sanctions were imposed by the Bush administration," said Bo Hla-Tint, a spokesman for the Burmese government-in-exile in Washington, D.C.  Spalding, which works exclusively with Republican candidates at both local and national levels, tries to order American-made products, Jackson said. "Our first effort is always to source things from the U.S., but not a lot of garments are made in the U.S. Friday," he said. He said all embroidery is done in the United States.  The Bush-Cheney fleece pullovers were imported to the United States by Denver-based Colorado Trading & Clothing. President Jeff Schmitt said Thursday the pullovers were included in one of the last shipments brought in from Burma last year before Sept. 1, when the import ban went into effect. "It's a terrible irony" that the Burmese jacket landed at Newsday, he said.  Schmitt said Colorado Trading employs an agent in Asia who conducts checks of factory conditions.  Human rights watcher Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, said the slip-up showed a lack of conviction on the administration's part. "Given the debate about outsourcing, it's amazing that the campaign would be selling stuff made in the most brutal country on earth, known for things like child labor and sexual slavery," he said. "It shows a crude indifference to this issue."  The National Basketball Association recently vowed to stop selling Burmese-made sweatshirts after a campaign by the NLC.  Last week, Newsday ordered a hat, T-shirt and fleece pullover or jacket from both the Bush and Kerry campaign stores. The Bush merchandise - which totaled $81.85 - arrived this week. The Kerry products, worth $62, have yet to arrive because the fleece jacket was on back order, according to Financial Innovations, the company that licenses and sells Kerry merchandise on the Web site www.kerrygear.com.  The campaigns receive no profits from the merchandise because of federal election regulations.  The Kerry merchandise was made in the United States, according to Mark Weiner, the president of Financial Innovations. The company, whose employees belong to the Communications Workers of America Union, sources most of its merchandise from union factories.  "It's becoming more difficult to find American-made union product, especially in textiles, but you just have to look. We pay more money for them, so we make a smaller profit margin," said Paul McConnell, Financial Innovations' vice president.  Copyright © 2004, Newsday, Inc.  UPDATE :  The right wing  urlLink Drudge Report  posted a letter from the shirt supplier that borders on xenophobic.  urlLink LETTER TO CAMPAIGN  FROM MERCHANDISE SUPPLIER Fri Mar 19 2004 13:26:53 ET   Mr. Tom Josefiak General Counsel Bush Cheney '04 Inc. 2107 Wilson Blvd. Arlington, VA 22201  Dear Mr. Josefiak:  I am writing to apologize and accept responsibility for the recent distribution of foreign goods in our Bush Cheney '04 merchandise program. We take great pride in providing this service to your campaign, and at your request have worked with our vendors to distribute goods that have been made in America.   Unfortunately, in one of our recent shipments, a vendor inadvertently supplied us with foreign goods, and our own company did not discover this mistake before distribution to the public. The purchase orders for these items included a statement specifying "Made in USA products." (See attached document). We received an acknowledgement from our supplier substantiating that it was their factory mistake. (See attached document).   We have already reviewed our entire stock of items and have pulled from inventory all foreign products. Of the 60 fleece jackets in stock, only two were from Burma. According to best estimates by our supplier, less than a total of ten items from Burma were shipped to the public. We have taken corrective action to assure this will never happen again. We are a small company employing 40 workers and take pride in the professional services provided by our hard-working American families.   Please accept my sincere apologies for this error and let me assure you that all necessary steps have been taken to guarantee that all future shipments will contain only American made products.   Sincerely,  Ted Jackson President, Spalding Group

       The colour of things to come   I got my new metropass in the mail yesterday. It was in the same unmarked, envelope it comes in every month. Obviously I can't possibly use it until April 1st, but like every month, I opened the envelope 2 weeks early just to see what colour the Metropass is going to be.  It's got a crazy, brand new design!  There's big gold letters indicating whether it's an Adult, Student or Senior card.  April is green.  A light, springtime green.

       My expiration date  "Sometime in the 23rd century...the survivors of war, overpopulation and pollution are living in a great domed city, sealed away from the forgotten world outside.   Here in an ecologically balanced world, mankind lives only for pleasure, freed by the servo-mechanisms which provide everything. There's just one catch. Life must end at thirty unless reborn in the fiery ritual of carousel." I got back to my desk after helping interview some summer staff and there was an envelope on my chair from  urlLink OMERS .  It was my 2002 Pension Report, and the first one I've received in my career.  If I retire right now, I'll receive a cool $805.06 a year.  The very first section contains the following text:  Your normal retirement date  January 31, 2042 This is the last day of the month in which you turn 65 I have to say....this is pretty shocking to see.  At once, it lets me know I'll be doing this, or something like this, for the next  38 frickin' years , but it also tells me when my services will no longer be required, and when my widow will receive a folded flag "On behalf of a grateful City-State".    This is the last day that you are useful.  This is the last day that anyone will even remotely value your opinion.  This is the day that your body will be ground into paste and served to Charlton Heston.  So I've got that to look forward to.

       Takedown   I grabbed a coffee and walked throught the Eaton Centre on my way to work.  One doesn't normally hear hollering, and profanities being hurled at 8:30, so this morning was a real treat.  Cadilac Fairview security (4 of them) were taking a homeless guy to the floor by the Mmmmmuffins outlet.  No idea what it was all about, but they got their man.

       I can't get off this   This stuff is gold.  On " Testing the effectiveness of [litter minimization] strategies ": Surprisingly little work has also been done to test the effectiveness - particularly the long term effectiveness - of litter minimization strategies.  In part, this may be an artifact of funding policies.  Most research projects and environmental education programs are funded for a limited period of time, and their resources are targeted towards complimenting the projects, rather than conducting the longitudinal testing.  Often new initiatives and intervention strategies are explored by investigators rather than the development of monitoring processes to assess the effectiveness of recent or ongoing initiatives. And so we're caught in a loop.  Do we want to put the time (years and years of behaviour analysis and research) to decide on a litter management strategy that  works  or do we want to deal with the problem immediately as it arises?  If we choose to be academic about the subject, then we're stuck with dirty streets and no plan for a few years.  If we throw more money at it, then it gets picked up but no behaviour ever changes.  Happy medium time.    The review of the litter-ature concludes with this: Littering is a complex activity, influenced by interactions between personal perceptions, attitudes, values and behaviours, as well as environmental factors such as prompts, the presence of bins, the amount of litter already present at the site, and the presence and actions of other people.  In order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of littering behaviour these elements must be studied from a holistic view. For those interested in what the Ausies are doing about litter, you can  urlLink check it out here .  As a side note, one should keep in mind who's doing and funding this research.  Is it State, National or Municipal governments?   urlLink No .  I'm not implying that the research is biased or tainted at all.  I am implying that your City, Province or Federal government will use research like this (should it exist in Canada), but won't fund it in a million years.  Perhaps some group,  urlLink somewhere , would do the right thing and pony up the dough.

       Beg pardon?   From a review of the litter-ature: In one Australian study (Leigh, 1995) 52% of the subjects thought that throwing an apple core under bushes was acceptable behaviour and not really littering.  Cigarette butts, used matchsticks, icy pole sticks and organic material such as some food scraps were also considered not to be litter by many subjects (Leigh, 1995) It took me a few minutes but "icy pole" means "popsicle" right?  Right?  Maybe "Mommy can I have a pole to suck on for dessert" doesn't carry the same implications in Australia.  The good people at wordreference.com define " urlLink icy pole " as the Australian name for an ice lolly.  Which, of course, clears everything up.

       A form letter in bag format   I sent away for some information from the Australian Beverage Industry Environment Council.  They've done some very comprehensive studies on litter behaviour and attitudes.  I finally received the literature in the mail today. The package was hermetically sealed inside a giant, thick-gauge plastic bag, that took me  5 minutes and a pair of scissors to remove.  The envelope inside had been torn and taped back together, and on the bag itself was printed this note:  We apologize   Dear Customer,  The enclosed item of mail was either received in this condition or damaged during its processing.  We sincerely regret this unfortunate incident and any inconvenience caused.  We are always concerned when mail entrusted to our care is damaged, and we have made considerable improvements to reduce such incidents in our operations.  Please be assured that we are continuing to make every effort to improve our service.  Warning: Please keep this bag away from young children. So there you have it.  Mail was damaged.  We're not saying who's responsible.  We've made improvements.  Don't allow children to asphyxiate.  Love, from Canada Post.

       Local business   The Music Hall has been closed since the 3rd week of February.  I just did a search to see if anyone else has noticed and  urlLink one other person has :  Danforth Music Hall Now Closed?  posted by jlangdon on March 11, 2004 at 10:15am TORONTO, CANADA - Yet another historic cinema in Toronto is closed. The Danforth Music Hall, which started life as Allen's Danforth Theatre in 1920, has been closed since the third week of February.   Since 1998 the Music Hall has been a member of the Festival Cinemas chain, showing second run films mostly with the occasional concert or play thrown into the schedule. It is the last operational theatre built in the Allen's chain. All its sister theatres have been either demolished or converted into other uses.   No details are being provided as to the reason for the closing. The message on the Festival Cinemas' Hotline (416-690-2600) states simply that the theater is closed.   Given the recent collapse of the Uptown and ceiling falling at the Bloor cinema, Toronto cinema fans have reason to be worried about this old movie house. The Music Hall is my "next door" theatre, and I'd hate to see it closed permamently.  I'd hate it even more if the roof caved in while I was watching a movie, mind you.

       A Canadian Ethical Dilemma   It's that time of year.  The debate remains strong.    Two men take turns buying the coffees for each other, every day during their break at work.  It's a long-standing Canadian tradition of "I got it.  You get it the next time".  Each spring the devil creeps into the mix, when Tim Hortons starts  urlLink putting prizes under their cup rims .  The question is this: "If I buy the coffees this time, and one of us wins a prize, who gets to keep it?" I mean....if it's a donut, or a coffee or something, then good-on-you for winning.  But what if it's cash, or a bike, or a plasma TV.....or one of 30 GMC Canyons?  If I bought the coffees and you win the truck, then we sell the truck and split the money right?  No?  What if I bought the coffees and my rim has $1000 under it.  Good luck for me, and you'll buy them tomorrow right?  Not fair?  What if you bought the coffees and after setting them on the work bench we got mixed up as to who's was who's? What if one of us won?  There's lots of stuff about odds of winning, skill testing questions and prize distribution  urlLink in here , but nothing to answer our question.  Every day, all over this country, men and women are stepping up to Tim Hortons counters with slips of paper in their hands containing the individual cream and sugar combinations for entire offices.  Usually, getting the coffee is a sign of camaraderie and solidarity with your fellow worker: I'll get it today, and I trust you to get it tomorrow.  But Every Spring, Tim Hortons mixes a double-double of greed and desire into their brew, and it's tearing our country apart.  I'm not suggesting that we cancel the contest, but I think we need to start a national discourse, to try and resolve this issue.

       In the bar the other night.   I can't bond over sports.  I never have.    I can't shoot-the-shit over scores and standings, or rule changes and officiating.  But it's such an integral part of masculinity, that I have to fake it sometimes.  It's a rare moment when I CAN make a relevant comment about a play, or a game.  So I was in the bar downstairs the other night, enjoying a pint of Creemore Springs.  A middle-aged man sat beside me; receding hairline, sports-team jacket, jeans, and a newly-divorced air about him.  He swigged his beer, and then watched the Leafs game on the TV.  The puck is behind the Leaf goal and Antropov moves it out from behind, and then in front of Belfour where he gets knocked to the ice by an eager Boston winger.  Puck stolen, shot and mercifully blocked, in one swift move.  The guy beside me snorted and shook his head.  I did the same, and we spoke for the first time: Me: Boy...what was the first thing they teach you in Junior?  Don't bring the puck up the middle in your own zone....  Him:  Junior?  How about Pee-wee, Atom, Novice.  That's the first thing you learn, and they're still blowing it at the professional level. We chatted like that for a bit and then fell back to watching the screen flickering in the haze.  Eventually a commercial for Tim Hortons roll up the rim came on.  I asked aloud: "Is roll up the rim back?"  My barmate told me that "Yeah...it's been on since Monday".    He then launched into a brief but familiar tirade known to Canadians around this time of year: They're really cheapin' out over at Tim Hortons.  I hardly win ANYTHING anymore.  5 or 6 years ago I'd buy all kinds of coffee and win 2 or 3 times a week.  Now?  Nothin'!  I hardly won anything last year, and I had 4 coffees yesterday and today, and nothing yet.  They keep saying there's millions of prizes but nobody ever wins them anymore. I've heard a lot of disaffected Canadian caffeine addicts harp on this same note: "Roll-Up-The-Rim is a scam nowadays.  I used to win a lot, but I don't win as much anymore."  I lost my head at that point.  I should have nodded, or agreed, or provided details about my own frustration at those donut-makin' bastards, but I didn't.  Instead, I thought for a moment about what my barmate had said and then offered this: Yeah....But Tim Hortons has really expanded in the past few years.  I mean, it's not just the small towns anymore, there's thousands of new franchises popping up every year in suburbs and office buildings all over the country.  Maybe, with all those new locations, it's just that there's MORE cups out there and more people competing for the same amount of prizes. He stared at me for a brief second and then faced forward towards the bar mirrors.  He mumbled: "Yeah...could be....could be...." sipped his beer, and looked back at the TV.  He didn't speak to me for the rest of his beer, and then eventually paid his tab and left.  I had either blown his mind, or crossed a line that you do not cross while watching hockey in a bar.  I have a feeling it was the latter.  The Leafs  urlLink won 3-2 .

       Brampton is dirty too...   There's been a lot of talk about litter lately.   A whole lot of talk...  So much talk, in fact, that  urlLink the following letter  from a Brampton resident caught my eye:  Brampton needs more cleaning   I recently read that Toronto city councillors have approved a $3 million plan to clean up the city. Also, many residents are suggesting everyone pitch in to pick up garbage that is strewn all over our streets and parks.   We, in Brampton, need to do likewise! Our streets, parks, shopping areas and storefronts are a total disgrace. I remember way back when Brampton was beautiful, clean and, indeed, deserving of its former name of Flowertown.   In my opinion, we need to start at the grassroots level, by educating our children in the schools that littering is wrong. There are certain basic moral principles that are obviously not being instilled in our kids and are missing from society in general.   It is beyond my comprehension how people can throw their trash on the ground without a care for their community, expecting someone else to pick up after them. Littering is an obvious epidemic in our city. This is a symptom of a more insidious problem: a complete lack of regard for others and a lack of respect for society in general. This is manifested also by the great increase in violence.   This should all start in the home, but if parents are not doing their job, the school-system is compelled to do it for them. We must teach our kids right from wrong. Mandatory community cleanup as part of a high-school education should be instituted, as so should fines for littering (which many other cities have), and they should be strictly enforced.   Adults need to lead by example, and not throw pop cans, cigarette butts, etc. out the car window, or while walking. Ditto for 'poop-and-scoop'. More garbage bins need to be placed around streets, parks, and stores and emptied regularly. Ad campaigns can be run on community-cable channels, buses, in our schools and our newspaper.   This problem can be changed for the better, but it will take a little effort from all the residents of this once beautiful city.   Annamarie Bohus,  Brampton Wait a minute.... go back there for a second please? We, in Brampton, need to do likewise! Our streets, parks, shopping areas and storefronts are a total disgrace. I remember way back when Brampton was beautiful, clean and, indeed, deserving of its former name of Flowertown. Flowertown?  I think I speak for all Toronto residents when I say "I just completely lost respect for Brampton".

       Canadian porn star?   A Canadian porn star is missing in  urlLink Pennsylvania  (link via  urlLink Bourque ).  She made the trip down to Conshohocken in a '92 Saturn for a photoshoot.  The ADA is on the case, and has her priorities straight: "We certainly hope that the exotic film industry or anything connected to that is not going to be centred here in the region," Ferman added. "That is not our primary concern in this investigation. Our investigation is centred on finding this woman." People getting naked for money in Conshohocken?  They better not be!  It just makes me sick to think about the depravity that is goin.... Pardon?  Oh.  Yeah, we'll see what we can do about finding this missing girl.  That's all well and good for how the AP newswire carried the story.  But what about the local coverage?    The Philadelphia Daily News couples her story with another missing person under the banner  urlLink 'Sexy Canadian' disappears; search still on for elderly man .  The story includes her measurements, and a website where you can view nude photos of Natal King (who performs under the name Taylor Sumers): Graphic nude photos of Sumers are featured on two Web sites, and one of them,  urlLink onemodelplace.com , gives her measurements as 36D- 26-35.  On onemodelplace.com, King, posing in a firefighter's hat and boots, describes herself as an actress, dancer and adult performer. "My name is Taylor and I am looking to hit it big within the adult industry," the resume reads. While Philadelphia ADA Ferman is hoping that no porn stars will grace her jurisdiction, I have a feeling that the Philadelphia Daily News researchers welcomed the assignment of "finding background material" on the missing woman.  Oh and make sure you get her cup size right.  We want to keep the public informed.

       Tooker no more   The first, and possibly only, time I saw  urlLink Tooker Gomberg  was in front of City Hall almost exactly a year ago.    Rumour has it that an email was sent to some senior management at City Hall inviting them out to a Smoke and Skate party in Nathan Phillips Square, to protest Marijuana laws in Canada.  Tooker Gomberg himself was hosting.  I could see out my window as a small crowd (like 7 people) gathered and started making a snowman.   I wandered past the party site after the festivities had broken up and the only remnants were a fat white kid with a blond afro filming a lopsided snowman which sported  a giant newspaper spliff.  It was an argument simultaneously for and against decriminalization.

       "The melting snow was coughing up junk"   That headline came from a  urlLink Brett Lamb  dog-walk-photo-essay two weeks ago.  It's the clearest description I've ever read to explain the springtime litter phenomenon.  For those of you who didn't take the red pill on Tuesday morning, you missed  urlLink Ms. Levy's column  detailing her walk from Yorkville to City Hall.  Ever get deja vu?  It seems that every spring, columnists like Levy make their money pointing out the obvious, but generally assessing blame to the wrong source.  Levy claims that bungling at city hall, wasted public education campaigns, and the city's unions are to blame for the increased litter and junk on the streets around this time of year.  I've got another reason that you can see more litter on the streets.  It has a lot more to do with what happens between December and March every year in this city, and less to do with politics, spending and the Left and Right wings.  Snow.  When it snows the city can't pick up litter.  If you take a bag and a broom and walk around the sidewalks in the wintertime, you'll sweep up more snow then garbage.  If you drive one of those cool litter vacuums around the sidewalks in the middle of January, you'll suck up more slush and snow then cigarette packages.  Some of you might recall how difficult it was to park on city streets with 4 foot high snowbanks on one side and streetcar traffic on the other.... Could you drive a street sweeper into that fray as well?  I doubt it.  The reason there's "more junk on the streets" in the spring, is because the accumulated litter and garbage that's been throw, blown, or seemingly magically appeared on our streets, is released from it's icy prison and free to offend people like Levy.  Give it a rest.  It's not a surprise every year, it's not a result of over-spending, and it's not Miller's fault.

       The 905 and 519 weigh in on how filthy Toronto is   I happened upon some letters to the editors at the Toronto Sun this morning....  The text in brackets after each letter is, as always, the response of the editorial staff to the individual letter.  I've taken the liberty of linking to the self-stated hometown URLs, to give everyone a better idea of where these carpetbagger-letters are coming from.  You people in Toronto should be ashamed for making Nancy from Beeton feel upset.  I'm sure she drove her SUV home and complained to the other 4 people in Beeton about how dirty and scary a place Toronto has become. LETTERS  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  KUDOS TO the Sun for blasting City Hall for the disgusting mess Toronto has become. Now, how about addressing another revolting habit that seems to be back in vogue and which was against the law years ago: Spitting. On the sidewalk, into garbage pails, even opening car doors and horking into the street. It's repulsive and likely very unhealthy. I can't believe how low Toronto has sunk.   Nancy Paul    urlLink Beeton    (For a sure cure to this problem, see next letter)    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MY WIFE and I just returned from Hong Kong where there's a $1,000 fine for littering and a $2,500 fine for spitting on the sidewalk. The city is spectacularly clean ... no wonder. When we arrived there someone told us to be careful about dropping anything: "They take littering very seriously here." Perhaps a couple of Hong Kong-style fines levied against messy Torontonians would make the point and clean things up quickly. It sure isn't the same Toronto in which I lived in the '40s, '50s and '60s. In those days, people were proud of their city.   Jim Lawrence    urlLink Wooler   (Now they escape to New York. Read on ... )    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I JUST returned from a two-day trip to New York City. What a nice, clean place to be. We were staying near Times Square and our city council has a long way to go to even come close to getting Toronto to compete. NYC is clean. Why? Because it has workers who clean up the sidewalks, roads and garbage bins on an ongoing basis. NYC is safe. Why? Because it has police patrolling the streets in numbers - a deterrent for any criminal. In two days of walking midtown and downtown Manhattan, I was not approached by one panhandler. If council doesn't get its act together, our city won't even be a blip on anyone's vacation radar. Me? I'm going back to NYC.   Joseph Marn   Toronto   (How times have changed)    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CLEANING UP Toronto should not be a problem. First of all, you could start handing out fines for littering and put the money from the fines into a fund to hire people to clean up after those who don't get caught and to pay for a special litter police to catch the rest. This might be a little too logical for your leaders to understand without years of million-dollar studies. Clean up this pigpen and the tourist dollars may flow back to what once was a beautifull place to visit.   Dennis MacMillan    urlLink Mississauga    (You should try living here)    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  IF CITY staff cannot keep parks groomed, streets clean, or pick up dead animals, contract these jobs to the private sector. Private contractors either work within a budget and do a good job or they do not get the contract next year. Eliminate city departments that cannot provide service and contract to private contractors.   Louie Goodwin    urlLink Elmira    (Won't happen with this mayor and council)    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I JUST have to get my two cents in. Why hasn't anyone else seen what I have been seeing for the past several years in Toronto, namely the now infamous Dundas and Spadina area? The big, dead rats, the small spaces between buildings crammed with trash, the industrial-size garbage bins with a smell that literally makes me gag. I grew up in Toronto and it makes me so sad to see it in decay. If it isn't a law that you have to keep your own property clean, maybe it should be. For goodness sake, clean up your own spaces.   Gina Straine    urlLink Mississauga    (Some people won't, unless they're forced to)    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I WOULD like to question the criteria used to determine the filthiest street corners (March 2). I agree with some of the selections and also agree that something has to be done with the attitude not only of those living/sleeping in downtown Toronto, but also of those that work downtown. Has anyone tried walking up Bay Street, from Adelaide to Queen in the mornings? The stench is so unbearable most pedestrians cover their faces - and this is in the cold winter mornings! Imagine what it's going to be like when the sun warms things up.   Barb Worthington   Toronto   (Pee-uuw! We hate to think)    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  SO MAYOR David Miller wants every Torontonian to spend 20 minutes on April 23 picking up litter. Shouldn't this be the job of unionized city maintenance workers paid out of ever increasing property taxes? Silly taxpayers, expecting essential services to be funded out of their taxes rather than having their money wasted on every special interest group and professional grant-getter that appears before council.

       Witness Relocation   They called.  They called and left a message this weekend. Hi, this is Elder Witt calling from the  urlLink Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints .  I'm kind of new in the area and I'm trying to get to know some of the members in the area and people around here.  So we want to know if we can come and see you sometime this week or whatnot.  If you can give us a call that, would be fantastic.  Our number here is (xxx) xxx-xxxx and we look forward to talking with you. The funny thing is how bored he sounded on the phone.  Apparently, telemarketing for Jesus isn't a sparkling endeavor.  I didn't even get one of those seductively naive, peppy Christian girls calling me and asking to come over to my apartment.  No, I got a bored Mormon guy.  Some of you might recall my last brush with  urlLink a pseudo-christian proselytizer .  At least I was sober this time.

       Wow, this guy really hates Rogers   Do you hate Rogers Cable?   urlLink This guy  sure does.  The site indicates that it's written (or written with the help of) an  urlLink ex-Rogers employee  who details how Rogers alegedly gouges and cheats it's customers.  Personally I don't have an opinion, except that I tend to get frustrated dealing with  any  large company.

       Friday Night   Feels good to be blogging again....  So in the midst of it all, there was  urlLink this racket   at the foot of Bay on Friday morning.    I had heard about it on the radio, and just in scanning the day's headlines.  Apparently the protesters were pissed off about Mills' "reversal" on a promise to turn an abandoned building in to shelter for the city's homeless.  My confusion over  why  Mills' press conference was being protested was probably shared by anyone who's actually heard Mills speak about anything.  If he isn't dancing around the question outright, he's snapping at the reporter who asked the question, as he did famously during SARS-stock when questioned about the cost for the day's event.  I gave my girlfriend a call at home to let her know that I was leaving work late (on a Friday night I might add...) and she said "There's all kinds of reporters and protesters at Dennis Mills' office across the street".  I told her about the press conference and then headed home to see the fuss.  It's certainly not the first time that Mills' Danforth office (across the street from my place) has been picketed.  A few months ago I was enjoying a lovely Sunday afternoon nap on my couch when I was slowly awakened by a nagging sound....singing.... "This is the day.....That the Lord has made.....We will rejoice.....And be glad in it....." An anti-gay-marriage protest was cutting into my Sunday slumber.  As a side note, that rude awakening was one of the chief reasons I now support legislation to recognize same-sex marriage.  Don't piss me off during nap time.  By the time I got home the protesters had dispersed leaving only CTV and CBC news trucks parked at the curb.  My girlfriend and I sat on the couch beside the window, and watched as Mills was interviewed live on the local news.  We watched Mills, then the TV, then Mills....  If you listened closely to the broadcast you would have heard: "SPEAK UP!!  WE CAN'T HEAR YOU!" shouted from an open window on the Danforth.  One of his messages during the two snarky interviews was: "the NDP wants wall to wall condominiums on the waterfront".  Oh come on now.  Layton is starting to put some campaign ads on TV, and it's going to be a hell of a run in my riding.  Mills vs. Layton on the Danforth.  I'll keep you posted...

       Just one more thing ma'am   At that litter meeting....?  The Mayor came to address the delegates.  It was the closest thing I've come to celebrity in quite some time.  The following day, after lunch with a colleague, we walked back to the office.  On the way, we passed the Mayor with an entourage of 6 or 7 staff members.  As she and I passed the group, we gaped, made eye contact and nodded slightly.  We got a nod back and after he'd passed we got all giddy: Me:  Psst.... heads up!  Her:  Wha...Oh my god.  Look at the size of his entourage!  Me:  Did you see that?  He nodded at me.  Her:  You!!?  He nodded at me!  Me:  He did not.  He must have remembered me from the meeting.  Her:  Yeah right, he was nodding at me. Come on.  I've only got a little bit of time before gushing over a  mayor  with a friend is really embarrassing.  More embarrassing then it is right now, that is...

       Just where the hell have you been?   I'm going to take a step here, and write about some of the work that's kept me so busy over the last few weeks, and hence not blogging....  I've usually avoided talking about my job here, and I'm going to continue to avoid it...so pardon the generalities.  There was a meeting last Wednesday.  Municipalities and brand owners (like restaurant chains and product manufacturers) from all over the province were invited to the meeting to discuss litter, and to share ideas about how to address the optics of litter and the cost cleaning it up.  Litter is linked to civic decline, and groups representing business and tourism industries are VERY interested in reversing the perception of civic decline in this or in any city.  Municipalities presented some of their experiences with litter reduction programs.  Famously, Mississauga has the "Litter Not" program in which they revived a classic (retro?) logo from the 60s and 70s... urlLink the litter bug .  Mississauga put its program together, raised their littering fines, set up a  urlLink snitch-page , and got a  urlLink celebrity endorsement .  While JYD now plays for the Bulls, it hasn't stopped Mississauga from spreading their litter message to a pile of  urlLink municipalities .  Last spring Toronto launched its own "Don't Trash Toronto" campaign care of the Clean Streets Working Group.  If you live or work in the city you'll probably remember bus shelter and litter bin ads that noted the new $305 dollar fine for littering.  Toronto set up a litter reporting hotline (39-CLEAN) and an adopt-a-bin program based on NYC's Adopt-a-Basket program where local merchants report overflowing litter bins and the city will clean them up.  The City of Windsor showed off their  urlLink Make it Shine  program which features, among other things, litter postcards that are mailed to offenders when an address can be found...  Toronto spends something in the order of $16M on litter cleaning every year, including sweepers, bag and broom crews and all of the litter bin collection.  It's a chunk of money to spend and we still claim to live in a dirty city.  There have been editorials, town hall meetings, and an election campaign which trumpet how dirty (filthy, disgusting, sickening, putrid, among other notable adjective) the streets have become in recent years.  Honestly I can't tell if there's been a decline or not, but then I've only lived here for 3 years so maybe I just missed the Utopia this city apparently once was.  Research was presented about how other countries deal with litter.  A country like Japan has very few litter problems, partially due to strong enforcement of cleanliness laws (fines for gum, etc.) but mostly because residents simply pack their garbage away until they can find a place to dispose of it.    There were some images of our city....garbage stuffed into a hole in a light standard, 1/2 a block away from a litter bin at Yonge and Eglinton.  A picture like this highlighted two messages:  People are willing to "put" their litter somewhere, and not just on the ground  People aren't that willing to carry their garbage with them until they can find a litter bin  So what to do?  Municipalities say they put money into the problem (more routes, more equipment) but that doesn't seem to be helping.  If it's agreed that there is a certain level of civic decline, and that litter is one of the symptoms of this problem, then simply sweeping up the litter faster isn't going to solve anything.  Can municipalities, and perhaps the province, engage an increasingly cynical population into a discussion of "who is responsible for your society?"  I don't want to make litter into something that it's not; we're still talking about garbage here, but dare we ask ourselves, and our fellow citizens to take some pride in the cities and towns that they live in?  If I asked you to "pick up that piece of litter, and put it in a bin" would you tell me that it's not your job?  Would you tell me that your taxes pay someone to pick it up?  Would you tell me to go to hell?  Or would you pick up that piece of litter, and turn around and ask me to pick one up too?    Pollyanna blogs.  There's lots of talk about increased enforcement of littering fines, but their effectiveness at actually causing social change is debatable.  There's lots of talk about producer responsibility, and asking manufacturers to contribute to municipal litter programs the same way they contribute to municipal blue box programs.  Is more money going to be the solution to the problem?  If money is put into an education campaign, on the order of "The Three Rs" or "Don't Drink and Drive", then we might actually see some results.    Watch the papers, there's going to be some buzz in the future.

       A night at the opera   Again.  It was a few weeks back and I'm just willing to articulate it now, seeing as how the  urlLink COC  season is officially over and my embarrassing story won't affect anyone's viewing of the opera in question: Die Walkure (the one with the Apocalypse Now helicopter song in it).  While waiting in line for our cheap youth-tickets we were informed over and over that "Die Walkure is really really long.  It's 3 and a half hours and with intermissions, the opera that starts at 7:00 will end at 11:30 or later".  Sure, we can hack it, we can handle it, we're all cultured and shit.  No.  We're not.  After a long work day, my girlfriend and I met up and had a beer and some dinner before the show.  How are you doing?  Think we can handle it?  Yeah I'm pretty tired too.  We got to the Hummingbird Centre early and killed time in the usual way:  We looked at the walls and walls of photographs of the previous shows and stars to visit the Hummingbird/Okeefe Centre, and tried to count how many times Liberace played on stage over the years.  We're up to 400 so far.  That guy really liked Toronto for some reason...  He was so good to his mother.  The show starts, and not really being familiar with Wagner, I initially compared the long lost brother and sister twins Siegmund and Sieglind, to Luke and Leia....that is, until they had sex, fully aware of their common history.  What the hell is wrong with German people?  The opera is long.  The music is dark and brooding, and meant to be sung at a snail's pace.  It was very cool to see these all-powerful gods and supernatural beings fighting for power, and being bound to their own contracts and decisions....but it wasn't enough to keep us in our seats.  Wracked with guilt, we finally slunk away at 10:00, just after the 2nd act mercifully drew to a close.  There was still an intermission and a 3rd act on the slate.  We chastised ourselves for not being more cultured.  We made excuses and justified our 7th inning dash to beat traffic.  We were tired, it was a school night, but all the same, we felt bad; that is, until we got to King station, and rode the train home with the other 10 people in our car alone who were all clutching their opera programs and wearing decidedly less guilty looks on their faces.  On the whole I liked Rigoletto much better then Die Walkure, but I think that has more to do with the fact that I just like  urlLink seeing clowns  emotionally tortured.

       A contract   All city services should be contracted out.  A contractor can get the work done cheaply and efficiently, unlike city employees.    If a contractor can do the work for cheaper then why wouldn't the city hire them to do it?  It's just silly to pay staff to do it when there are companies out there who do this work cheaper and better.  Contract.  Contract.  Contract.  Yeah...except when the contractor doesn't make money on the deal anymore and  urlLink wants to back out .  Trash hauler wants contract declared void   Dispute over money-losing arrangement could lead to garbage pileup this summer  Toronto could be faced with piles of rotting garbage this summer if the city cannot resolve a dispute with the company that says it is taking a bath on its deal to ship the trash to Michigan.  Wilson Logistics Inc., the trucking company that carries Toronto's trash to a Michigan landfill, is trying to get its haulage contract with the city cancelled. A change in U.S. trucking laws means it has been losing more than $10,000 a day on the contract since the start of the year, according to chairman and chief executive officer James Wilson.  "Wilson would be very prepared to pass on the baton, if there was someone to pass it on to," he said in an interview.  The news that Wilson Logistics is trying to get out of the contract hit city hall like a bombshell, only two days after council passed a budget handing home owners a 3-per-cent tax increase.  Since last fall, the company has been trying to get city officials to agree to a $5 increase in the $33 a tonne shipping fee to make up for increased costs under the new rules. If everything stays on track, the company will ship about 950,000 tonnes of trash this year.  With the talks at an impasse since December, Mr. Wilson said the company has been forced to refer the contract to an arbitration panel, which will have its first meeting on May 19.  A ruling against the city would throw the trash-collection system into chaos, because Toronto has the capacity to hold only two days' worth of garbage.  But city politicians did not know about the problem as they prepared the budget, they said yesterday. "We haven't been briefed by city staff at this point. We've only heard from the company," said Paul Burns, senior council liaison adviser for Mayor David Miller.  Councillor Gloria Lindsay Luby said she does not know why councillors were unaware of the problem when working on the budget.  "It would have been good to know," she said.   Mr. Wilson said Washington's new rules, which apply to all truckers in the United States as well as those who enter the country as part of their daily runs, are much tougher than the old ones.   The previous regulations limited work shifts to 15 hours, required drivers to have eight consecutive hours off between shifts and allowed drivers to take the time for coffee breaks, bathroom stops and meals out of their hours worked.  Rules that came into effect Jan. 4, however, limit shifts to 14 consecutive hours, including breaks, and require 10 consecutive hours off between shifts.  Until recently, a Wilson driver would pick up a load of garbage at a Toronto transfer station, drive the truck 475 kilometres to the Michigan landfill and bring the empty truck back to the transfer station, where the next driver took over. The routine roundtrip took 12 hours, Mr. Wilson said.  But trips have been taking longer. One reason is slower loading and unloading as both the city and Republic Services, the operator of the Michigan landfill, adjusted to increased tonnage after Toronto's Keele Valley landfill closed.  The company also has delays of up to three hours to get across the border in the wake of stepped-up security after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as U.S. officials check paperwork and each load carefully.  After tracking his trucks with global positioning devices, Mr. Wilson now estimates that four roundtrips out of 10 take longer than 14 hours.   To ensure compliance with the new rules, it now takes two drivers to get a truck to Michigan and back. One driver, who does two runs a day, drives from Toronto to London, Ont., and turns the truck over to another driver, who does one run a day from London to Michigan and back.  That has meant that Wilson Logistics has had to hire 150 more drivers and build a new terminal next to Highway 401 at London, where the drivers do their switch.  The arbitration panel will have to decide whether the new U.S. rules create what the contract calls uncontrollable circumstances, and if it so finds, it must rule that the contract between the city and Wilson is null and void, Mr. Wilson said.  A city official who has been dealing with the issue said yesterday the city believes it likely will win the arbitration case and that Mr. Wilson is trying to panic Toronto politicians into cutting a deal.

       "I answered every question"    urlLink Every single question .  No doubt about it, he answered every question that was asked.  There were questions asked, and they were answered by him.  Every single question.  You tell me if this guy is going to get re-elected.  He'll 'testify', but not under oath, not alone, not on camera, and not on any public record.  Wow.  Seriously?  Why bother showing up?  Do Americans actually trust this guy?  I can't imagine it, but he seems to still be wielding power without a passing sense of accountability.    He appears to have lead the US into a war, predicated on a false premise.  He's put the government so deep in debt that it will take decades to get out.  He's alienated the sentiments of just about every country on the globe.  And now....when he finally agrees to speak about the worst mass-murder on American soil, he won't do it under oath, without Cheney, or on any public record.  Why...why....why would you trust another word that comes out of his mouth?  I'm really at a loss here.  I just can't empathize with his position.  What's the argument for NOT testifying under oath, alone, or on the public record?  Is it a national security issue?  Every other principle involved has had to testify under oath, alone, and in part, on the public record.  How is he different?  Like....what does he know that say...George Tennent doesn't know?  What Rice, Powell, Clarke, Ashcroft, Reno, et al. don't know?  THEY are the ones giving him the bloody information in the first place, and THEY had to testify in the usual manner.  But somehow, he doesn't have to testify under oath, alone, and on the public record.

       When the AP reads like The Onion   This is it.  This is everything in one, neat little package.  Right here: Beef-scarfing couple booted from buffet  SALT LAKE CITY, Utah - A couple on a low-carb diet were kicked out of a buffet restaurant after the manager said they'd eaten too much roast beef.  Sui Amaama, who along with his wife has been on the Atkins Diet for two weeks, was asked to leave after he went up to the buffet at the Chuck-A-Rama in suburban Taylorsville for his 12th slice of roast beef.  "It's so embarrassing actually," said Isabelle Leota, Amaama's wife.  "We went in to have dinner, we were under the impression Chuck-A-Rama was an all-you-can-eat establishment.''  Not so, said Jack Johanson, the restaurant chain's district manager.  "We've never claimed to be an all-you-can-eat establishment," said Johanson.   "Our understanding is a buffet is just a style of eating," he explained.   The general manager, who was carving the meat Tuesday, became concerned about having enough beef for other patrons and asked Amaama to stop, Johanson said.  The offended couple asked for a refund.   The manager refused and called police when they would not leave.  The couple said they had eaten at Chuck-A-Rama's $8.99 buffet at least twice a week, but did not plan to return.

       Happy day after earth day   Another gem from the red box this morning: JUST A note to everyone involved in today's 20-Minute Toronto Makeover, especially where children may be participating: I found a condom outside the fire station at Regent and Dundas streets yesterday morning on my way to work. This is close to Regent Park School in Ward 28. Many of you in downtown wards are familiar with the Harm Reduction Programs we have in our neighbourhoods and know condoms, needles and crack pipes are all over the area. Please use extra care when cleaning your neighbourhoods. Gloves are vital and children participating should only do so with strict supervision. The condom I found was a pretty purple and children could mistake it for a balloon. Have fun cleaning.   Linda Dixon   (It's a dirty job, but ...) Pretty Purple Prophylactics.  Yes.  Safety first.  This is a real pickle here isn't it?  We want everyone to be safe.  We don't want anyone picking up condoms and needles.  My God, if you find one just mark where it is (put something over it so no one else will mistake it) and call the City's Solid Waste Management Hotline at 416-338-2010.  Don't let children pick up litter by themselves, and use your own common sense.  There's another side to this though.  Being safe, and watching for dangers is just part of the human condition.  But at what point will people simply not participate because the perceived risks are too high?  The above letter from a Sun reader is very anecdotal.  She saw a condom!  The implication (and in so many words) are that the area is a minefield of pestilence covered with "condoms, needles and crack pipes" like a playground in some after-school special.  The logic goes something like this: I think the City is dirty;  I have an  urlLink opportunity  to help clean it up;  Pardon?  You saw a condom?;   There's no way I'm going to participate because my health is much more valuable then a clean city. I'm so glad that SO  urlLink many people  are going  urlLink to participate  in this 20 minute  urlLink clean up , but if "condoms" and "needles" are going to be an excuse for not participating then we just go back to square one, where everyone complains, but no one is willing to do anything.  The attitudes of the residents of this city have changed so dramatically from last year to this.  People are very interested in helping out, people seem less likely to simply blame city hall because they can see garbage outside.  Honestly, it's a very promising attitude and I hope it stays with us.  Taking responsibility for, nay, even  acknowledging  our own garbage is a step in the right direction.  I hope everyone reading this will take a few minutes and tidy up an area they feel is unsightly.  If you feel it's too much for you, then please at least call 39-CLEAN and let the city know where you see litter.

       The colour of things to come   I got my new metropass in the mail yesterday. It was in the same unmarked, envelope it comes in every month. Obviously I can't possibly use it until May 1st, but like every month, I opened the envelope 2 weeks early just to see what colour the Metropass is going to be.  April's went from green, to black to white at the top.  May's metropass follows the same pattern, but it's a light blue at the bottom, then green, then white at the top.  I wonder if June will have a new colour at the bottom, then May's blue, then white.  I suppose only time (mid-May) will tell.

       The Anglos take a stab at it   "Unibroue"  Our man in Quebec (Matt over at  urlLink Living in a Society ) wrote to me an suggested that it's pronounced "Unibrew" and not "Unibrow" as I had previously thought.  He noted that he's never actually heard a francophone pronounce the word, and that he and his anglo friends may be getting it wrong, but I've got to trust him on this one.  Didn't Unibroue own part of the Jays at one time?  I suppose I should really look into that myself instead of asking no one in particular.

       Tips for aspiring letter writers   Did you ever want to match your opinions and wit against those of the Sun Editorial board?  Here's an example of the level of sophistication required to get published in the Sun: I'M LOOKING for backers to finance a great new Canadian sitcom -- The Khadr Family. There's already a theme song we can use: "They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky, they're all together kooky, the Khadr Family." Joe Flaherty can play Papa Khadr, who teaches his kids to "blow up real good." Sheila Copps can be Mama Khadr, who teaches her children how to manipulate and abuse the goodwill of multicultural Canadians. We could sell it to Aljazeera, the Arabic cable channel. It's a guaranteed money maker. Who wants in?   Ron Laffin   Toronto   (Sounds like it could be a hit, so that rules out the CBC) Editorial response is in parenthesis.  It took me a while to figure out some of the gags, but here's a quick guide to "getting" the jokes in Laffin's letter:  "Khadr" and "Addams" have the same number of syllables, so the two words are interchangeable in the familiar Addams Family TV show theme song.  Joe Flaherty was a cast member on SCTV in the 80's where he created a movie reviewing farmer with the late John Candy.  The two characters liked to see things "blow up real good" in movies.  The reference to Joe Flaherty as a father who would encourage his children to become suicide bombers, is based on this character.  The fact that Ahmed Said Khadr the patriarch of the real Khadr family is dead, seems to have eluded Laffin', but I'm confident he'll realize his unfortunate error and correct it in a re-write.  The Sheila Copps reference comes from the fact that Copps traveled to Afghanistan to orchestrate a series of bombings and ambushes against Allied forces in the war-torn country, not only because she is a terrorist, but also because she wants to waste tax money.  Including her as the matriarch of Laffin's family is subtle and satirical beyond anyone's comprehension.

       Stressed   There's been a lot of talk about  urlLink stress  lately.  While out and about in the downtown core (taking "before" pictures ahead of  urlLink Friday's event ), I passed by the Bell Trinity Square building.  A woman stood outside an emergency exit, frantically puffing on a cigarette.  She looked stressed.  In her smoke-free hand she held a small blue ball, painted to look like the earth.  A foam stress ball, that she was methodically squeezing over and over and over.  She was staring straight ahead, eyes fixed on nothing.  I've seen stress balls, and I've been given a few of them at trade shows.  I've seen them sold in execu-toy stores, and I've seen them displayed proudly and ironically on desks.  I've never actually seen someone use one.  She must have been really stressed, because unless she kept that one in her purse or briefcase, it means that she had to go and get it from that bottom drawer of her desk where she shoves her pay stubs, dried out highlighting, power bar wrappers and promotional ephemera, to retrieve it.  It wasn't something that she just picked up from the sidewalk outside the building.  At some point she had to have thought: "Fuck....I really need a smoke and my stress ball".    Now THAT'S stressed.  I wonder if it helped.

       Festival of Meme's   These have been going around for a while.  Rather then post my contributions one at a time, I'll shove them all here like a closet that needs cleaning.  I'll see what I can do about adding a couple more soon.  Fun.  Silly, silly fun.  Page 23, 5th sentence meme:  1. Grab the nearest book. 2. Open the book to page 23. 3. Find the fifth sentence. 4. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.  "The left fielder had a good arm, and he got the ball right in to the second baseman, but when the dust settled Jennifer T. was safe with another double."  - Summerland, by Michael Chabon Via,  urlLink Shaternian  among others.   iPod meme:   Turn your MP3 player on random and list the first 15 tracks it plays (regardless of how embarrassing they may be): 1. Country Yard - The Vines 2. The Girl from North Country - Johnny Cash 3. Meu Destino - Thievery Corporation 4. A Long Time Coming - Sloan 5. George J. Tennet (3.24.04) - 9/11 Commission Hearings 6. Hollywood Freaks - Beck 7. Street Fighting Man - Rolling Stones 8. Elegy for Elsaber - The Wearkerthans 9. Alpha Beta Gaga - Air 10. 12:51 - The Strokes 11. The Taming of Carolyn - The Lowest of the Low 12. A Mighty Wind - A Mighty Wind OST 13. Seymour Stein - Belle and Sebastian 14. Non-Sectarian Blues - Dave Brubeck 15. A Side Wins - Sloan Via  urlLink Robotjohnny , among others. The good people at meme.org see memes as different then the examples above.  Here's a bit of  urlLink a definition .  Acording to  urlLink meme.org , memes are more like "mind viruses": ideas or practices that spread from one person to another in a culture or society.  I'm trying to think of examples and let's say something cute like "eating your Snicker's bar with a knife and fork" might fall into the category of a meme.  The belief that Clinton had a number of people  urlLink secretly murdered  during his administration is an idea that began with "conspiracy nuts" and was then repeated over and over in, somewhat slanted, media circles.  I think that could be considered a meme as well; as it spreads it looses it's shell of creation and gains credibility by virtue of the number of people who mention or talk about it.  It's an idea that creeps into consciousness, and eventually the line between the factual components of the meme, and the innocent or sinister conclusion draw from those facts, is blurred.  It's a very interesting concept.

       The Mayor   I'm talking about Kevin Clarke here, not Miller.  Those who work in and on the area in question know Kevin Clarke as "the Mayor".  He's the one on the south east corner of Bay and Adelaide screaming at the top of his lungs each morning.  He gives passers-by sermons on subjects ranging from "The one true path to God is through his Son Jesus Christ" to "The Government cannot show love for it's people".  He was the guy who let us know that  urlLink SARS  was our fault.  He's loud, aggressive and you can smell the corner of Bay and Adelaide from both Queen and King, depending on wind direction.  But he's true to his faith.  This morning I walked up the east side of Bay, to find Kevin wearing a suit jacket and his usual bedsheet.  He had fashioned a 10 foot cross by lashing two pieces of 2"x2" together with some twine, and had hung himself from the cross.  His bare feet were planted on an overturned green bucket, and his hands left their grip on the cross only long enough to scratch an itch, or adjust his sheet.  Sometimes yelling about the true path to the Lord, and sometimes standing quiet, eyes closed, imagining the Passion of the Christ.

       Liberal-in-Exile   If you're like me you've probably had trouble following the subtleties and political bob-and-weave involved in the AdScam Sponsorship Scandal, or whatever they're calling it now.  Lucky for us,  urlLink Mr. Kinsella  and the Navigator public policy group posted  urlLink a presentation  he gave recently, which includes a detailed timeline of the events that have unfolded thus far.  The presentation contains some analysis of what the current government did right and wrong (mostly wrong), and chides the Martin government for trying to shift blame onto the lowly civil servants.  Kinsella was a special assistant to that tall guy who puts pepper on his eggs.

       Bush on TV   No cable, no TV.  I watched Futurama episodes from a box set last night.  I strongly doubted that the bar downstairs would heed my request to change the channel from the hockey playoffs to the Presidential press conference last night.  Thank god for the White House site which  urlLink transcribed the entire press conference , including this little Q and A: Q Mr. President, thank you. You mentioned 17 of the 26 NATO members providing some help on the ground in Iraq. But if you look at the numbers -- 135,000 U.S. troops, 10,000 or 12,000 British troops, then the next largest, perhaps even the second largest contingent of guns on the ground are private contractors -- literally, hired guns. Your critics, including your Democratic opponent, say that's proof to them your coalition is window dressing. How would you answer those critics? And can you assure the American people that post-sovereignty, when the handover takes place, that there will be more burden sharing by allies, in terms of security forces?   THE PRESIDENT: John, my response is, I don't think people ought to demean the contributions of our friends into Iraq. People are sacrificing their lives in Iraq, from different countries. We ought to honor that, and we ought to welcome that. I'm proud of the coalition that is there. This is a -- these are people that have -- the gut leaders have made the decision to put people in harm's way for the good of the world. And we appreciate that sacrifice in America. We appreciate that commitment.   I think -- one of the things you're seeing is more involvement by the United Nations, in terms of the political process. That's helpful. I'd like to get another U.N. Security Council resolution out that will help other nations to decide to participate.   One of the things I've found, John, is that in calling around -- particularly during this week, I spoke to Prime Minister Berlusconi and President Kwasniewski -- there is a resolve by these leaders that is a heartening resolve. Tony Blair is the same way -- he understands, like I understand, that we cannot yield at this point in time; that we must remain steadfast and strong; that it's the intentions of the enemy to shake our will. That's what they want to do -- they want us to leave. And we're not going to leave. We're going to do the job. And a free Iraq is going to be a major blow for terrorism. It will change the world. A free Iraq in the midst of the Middle East is vital to future peace and security.   Maybe I can best put it this way, why I feel so strongly about this historic moment. I was having dinner with Prime Minister Koizumi, and we were talking about North Korea, about how we can work together to deal with the threat. The North Korea leader is a threat. And here are two friends now discussing what strategy to employ to prevent him from further developing and deploying a nuclear weapon. And it dawned on me that had we blown the peace in World War II, that perhaps this conversation would not have been taking place. It also dawned on me then that when we get it right in Iraq, at some point in time an American President will be sitting down with a duly-elected Iraqi leader talking about how to bring security to what has been a troubled part of the world.   The legacy that our troops are going to leave behind is a legacy of lasting importance, as far as I'm concerned. It's a legacy that really is based upon our deep belief that people want to be free and that free societies are peaceful societies.   Some of the debate really center around the fact that people don't believe Iraq can be free; that if you're Muslim, or perhaps brown-skinned, you can't be self-governing and free. I strongly disagree with that. I reject that, because I believe that freedom is the deepest need of every human soul, and, if given a chance, the Iraqi people will be not only self-governing, but a stable and free society.   Let's see here, hold on. Michael. You're next. Ahem.  The second largest group of guns on the ground in Iraq are PRIVATE FUCKING CONTRACTORS.  Not nations, not countries, not contributions from the UN security forces.  Companies like Haliburton.  A coalition of the well paid.    That wasn't even the funniest part of the press conference: Q Thank you, Mr. President. In the last campaign, you were asked a question about the biggest mistake you'd made in your life, and you used to like to joke that it was trading Sammy Sosa. You've looked back before 9/11 for what mistakes might have been made. After 9/11, what would your biggest mistake be, would you say, and what lessons have you learned from it?   THE PRESIDENT: I wish you would have given me this written question ahead of time, so I could plan for it. (Laughter.) John, I'm sure historians will look back and say, gosh, he could have done it better this way, or that way. You know, I just -- I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to come up with an answer, but it hadn't yet.   I would have gone into Afghanistan the way we went into Afghanistan. Even knowing what I know today about the stockpiles of weapons, I still would have called upon the world to deal with Saddam Hussein. See, I happen to believe that we'll find out the truth on the weapons. That's why we've sent up the independent commission. I look forward to hearing the truth, exactly where they are. They could still be there. They could be hidden, like the 50 tons of mustard gas in a turkey farm.   One of the things that Charlie Duelfer talked about was that he was surprised at the level of intimidation he found amongst people who should know about weapons, and their fear of talking about them because they don't want to be killed. There's a terror still in the soul of some of the people in Iraq; they're worried about getting killed, and, therefore, they're not going to talk.   But it will all settle out, John. We'll find out the truth about the weapons at some point in time. However, the fact that he had the capacity to make them bothers me today, just like it would have bothered me then. He's a dangerous man. He's a man who actually -- not only had weapons of mass destruction -- the reason I can say that with certainty is because he used them. And I have no doubt in my mind that he would like to have inflicted harm, or paid people to inflict harm, or trained people to inflict harm on America, because he hated us.   I hope I -- I don't want to sound like I've made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't -- you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one. Bush is apparently the kind of guy who would answer "I just push myself too hard, I'm a work-a-holic" when asked "What's your worst quality?" in a job interview.  This is the guy that will get elected again in November?  Wow.

       John Denver   Frequent ejaculations you say?  Helps to lower your risk of  urlLink prostate cancer .  This study confirms an earlier one (.... urlLink mentioned here ).  On the same subject, " I'm going home to listen to some John Denver " just replaced " Pulling the goalie " as my euphemism of choice for lowering one's risk of prostate cancer.  The logic (as it was explained to me by my local bartender) is that "...everyone does it, but no one talks about it."  Smart woman.  Variations on a theme:  I'm just listening to some 'James Taylor'  I think I'm going to stay in and put on some 'Andrew Loyd Webber'  Yeah I went to a 'Nickleback concert' last night

       A brush with tallness   So my girlfriend and I went to see  urlLink Rigoletto  last night.  Good show.  Too many kids.  Actually going to the opera is about the most exposure to old people that you can have outside of a church or  urlLink Country Kitchen Buffet .  The performances were excellent (read "Amazing" in the case of  urlLink this redhead ).  The sets left a little to be desired (I was getting dizzy just looking at the weird perspectives) and the lighting at times reduced the actors on stage to an order of fries waiting to be sold.  But what the hell do I know.  I do know that the time required to stand in line for a free urinal at the opera is directly related to the sum of the conditions of the prostates ahead of you in line.  So while waiting, I noticed a familiar face in the lobby.  I asked my girlfriend later "Isn't that former Mayor of Toronto John Sewell?"  She wasn't sure because, like me, her only image of him comes from that tiny little picture every week in the  urlLink Eye .  I mean, I've never met him, I don't think I've ever actually seen him in person, but this guy was a dead ringer.  So I did what I normally do in a situation like this:  I called my mother. Me:  Hi mom.  Her:  Oh it's so good to hear from you.  How are you doing?  Me:  Great, we're at the opera tonight and it's intermission.  I've got a strange question for you.  Her:  Ok...?  Me:  Do you remember former Mayor of Toronto John Sewell?  Her:  Yes.  Why?  Me:  How tall is he?  Her:  Oh, really tall.  Like 6'1'' or 6'2'.' Something like that.  He's probably taller then you.  Me:  Ok great.  Thanks mom. I should note at this point that I didn't just cut my mother off there.  We chatted about Easter plans and my brother's birthday.  She's making a ham.  So that was all the evidence I needed to walk up to a complete stranger and tell him that I read his column in the Eye every week.    Nice guy.  Really tall.

       A postman, a policeman and a hot dog vendor   I was walking home yesterday after work and I happened upon an impromptu meeting of 3 men in the street.  A traffic cop was smiling and chatting with a hot dog vendor and a Canada post employee.  They all stood at a corner, the postman holding his mail bag and standing beside his bright red, Canada Post truck.    It struck me as a very wholesome, Norman Rockwell-esque scene, which brightened an otherwise gloomy day.  A bite of banality to soothe the soul.    As I approached I could see them chatting and joking with each other, maybe sharing the day's experiences and stories about work.  There was a slap on the back and a hearty laugh as the group dispersed.  A scene like this is comforting, life affirming, and shows cynics like myself that there is a little bit of good in each one of us.  I was so moved by what I saw, that I turned to look back on the men after I had passed by.  They went off on their separate ways: the postman to the mailbox to fill his bag with love letters and bill payments; the hot dog vendor to a new customer on the approach; and the police officer to the Canada post truck to write down the license plate, fill out a form and post a parking ticket under the wiper blade.

       The Alarms   The fire alarm went off in the building where I work.  Right above my head.  It was a constant, loud, *booooooooooooooop*......*booooooooooooooooop* for about 15 minutes, broken only by an intercom voice stating the obvious "Attention please, attention.  An alarm has been activated.  The fire department has been notified.  Please stand by for further instructions". When the alarm turns on, the fans go off.  I'm sure it's like that in every building....something about feeding the fire I think....so there was this weird dusty funk in the air.  Sneezing, beeping, voices.  Oy.  Weird Dusty Funk?  I saw them open for Random Emo Band at the Rivoli.  Good show.  Too many kids.

       Call me Kramer   I don't get cable anymore, which kind of means that I'm reduced to a single, blurry channel.  Sunday morning (whilst watching the Coronation Street with a certain lady-friend) an ad for Tim Hortons came on.  As I don't watch a lot of TV anymore, I'm not sure how long the spot has been running.  It was the first time my girlfriend had seen it too...  We open on an office scene.  A couple of young employees meet at a desk, one of them holding two, red, roll-up-the-rim cups in his hands.  He's clearly bought a coffee for him and his co-worker...  The co-worker stretches his hand out in anticipation of receiving one of the cups, but they are withdrawn.  The man holding the cups, dramatically weighs which one he will give to his friend.  Eventually one is offered and the co-worker makes a point of taking the other cup.  The tag line is...."Nobody wants to give away a winner".  Now, I'm not saying that they stole my idea.  I'm not saying that it was directly lifted after I so  urlLink skillfully articulated  the scenario.  But it's awfully close...  And, I had this idea for a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach....

       A shiny new red pill   The  urlLink Toronto Sun  (the paper with pictures) has redesigned as of this morning.    Go on.  Blow two bits and pick it up.  The editors highlight the changes for you: I'll direct you to a few of the more noticeable changes and enhancements:   - A new, strong Page 1 title-piece, displaying the Sun's traditional white on red colour combination.   - An expanded Page 2 index to direct readers to their favourite features.   - A greater number of stories every day, many in a news-in-brief format.   - Larger photographs throughout.   - An improved Two-Minute Markets listing (Tuesday-Saturday), but no full TSX listings. Yeah...Larger photographs, less words.  News is too wordy anyway, it should all be in easy to understand, analysis free, news-in-brief format.  And an expanded index to help you find the articles that aren't there.  Oh.  And a new logo.

       What's the deal with Dennis Mills?   Someone asked me the other day about why Dennis Mills is in the news so much, in such a negative light.  I'm certainly not an expert on the campaign but let me try to recap what I can pull together and we'll go from there.  I haven't been a constituent of his for long, so the first time I recall seeing him in the news was last summer as the architect of the rockin'-awesome SARSstock concert at Downsview park.  I was there and had a great time, so I suppose I owe the Member from Toronto Danforth a thank you.    My first encounter with his arrogance however came the next day while watching the local  urlLink Bell Globemedia  news.  A reporter at the concert asked Mills to respond to reports that the price tag for the concert was going to be much higher then he'd originally insisted it would be.  He responded (and I'm paraphrasing here because I didn't have the foresight to write it down 10 months ago): "I'm not accountable to you.  I'm not accountable to the media.  I'm accountable to the House of Commons."  Yeah I guess he has a point there... Do other politicians do that?  I mean, just give a Royal "Fuck You" when they can't, or don't want to, answer a question?  The next round came in February, when Mills released his familiar-looking report on  urlLink Toronto's waterfront .  I kind of thought it looked like Fung's version, except the Casino was substituted for a "United Nations University of Peace".  Whatever brings in the crowd I guess.  Mills had a press conference on the 27th of February to announce the plan, but was shouted down by a group of  urlLink OCAP protesters  demanding that he resign.  The OCAP protesters were  urlLink then shouted down  by a Liberal press handler, causing the Harbour Castle Weston staff to flip the lights on and off quickly until everyone returned to their mats for quiet time.  Now, I couldn't figure out what the hell the big deal was at the time, but apparently in November of last year Mills promised to convert an OCAP occupied building on Gerrard St. to social housing within thirty days, or he'd resign his seat.  So it was THAT promise that OCAP was holding him to when they crashed his press conference.  Thirty days huh?  Has any government, anywhere, ever done anything in thirty days?  Granted it's been about 7 months since the promise and still no social housing at 558 Gerrard, but really.  More recently Mills came under some fire for illegally putting up "campaign" signs.  The  urlLink City's bylaw officers  took a few of them down from public property and gave orders to remove more.  They went up all over Riverdale shortly after Mills' waterfront announcement in February.  Since the election call (like the day of...) the signs magically changed from this:     To this:     And in many places the signs simply switched from one to the other overnight.  Mills' chief competition in the riding, Jack "First Federal Leader to Campaign with Facial Hair Since the 50s" Layton put up signs of his own long before the election call, but they were ads on billboards up and down the Danforth.  Layton and Mills jockey'd for ad space throughout Greektown with Mills winning the coveted Broadview/Danforth "Gateway to the Danforth" corner billboard high atop Wong's Camera shop.  The first Layton one is further down the strip, closer to Logan.  That's what I've got so far.  Yes I took the pictures.

       Eventually it will become passe   But for now, I'd like to take a moment and answer a question that was posed to the MSN search engine.  Since this site was ranked #1 in the response, I feel an obligation to attempt to answer the query.   urlLink "Is pepper the spice bad for the prostate?"   Pepper the spice is not bad for the prostate.  In fact, if you listen to Ben Kerr (the old man singing on the north east corner of Yonge and Bloor), cayenne pepper (the spice) is  good  for the prostate.  "Pepper", the 'independent entrepreneur' on the corner of Jarvis and Dundas on the other hand is probably bad for the prostate, as well as the mucous membranes, so you might want to steer clear of "her".  I hope that clears things up for you.

       Oh you have got to be kidding me   Reading from Left to Right:  urlLink Jim Harris, Leader of the Green Party of Canada.    urlLink Jack Layton, Leader of the NDP    urlLink Dennis Mills, incumbent Liberal MP   And on the Right end of the Toronto-Danforth See-Saw, up in the air, kicking his feet and hollering at the other kids to please let him down now...  Loftus Cuddy, candidate for the  urlLink Conservative Party of Canada . Sorry, I'm coming into the coverage pretty late in the game (compared to my honourable  urlLink bloggerparts ) but really... the leader of the Greens and the leader of the NDP in the same riding?

       Chewing Gum Returns to Singapore   Here's a fun little nugget  urlLink from Salon : Ultra-tidy Singapore is lifting its notorious ban on chewing gum after 12 long years -- but only for registered users. Gum dealers face jail if they break the rules.   Before Singaporeans think about unwrapping a pack of the Wrigley's Orbit gum that's just started selling here -- and only in pharmacies -- they have to submit their names and ID card numbers. If they don't, pharmacists who sell them gum could be jailed up to two years and fined $2,940.   This Southeast Asian city-state, known for its immaculate streets and tight social controls, outlawed the manufacture, import and sale of chewing gum in 1992 after the country's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, complained that it was fouling streets, buildings, buses and subway trains. In the time that I've been...uh.. "Professionally concerned with litter in our city" I've heard a number of colleagues, superiors and assorted citizenry chastise the City's approach to litter management by invoking the world-class example of Singapore.  Real people, like you and me, honestly and openly suggesting that Toronto take a Singapore-esque approach to curbing litter.  Suggesting things like fines upwards of several hundred dollars for anyone, including children, who are caught littering.  "That will teach them".  Generally, the suggestions stop short of the corporal punishments that Singapore is also famous for, but not too far off the mark.  Singapore banned the sale and use of chewing gum on the whim of a single man, because he felt it made his city unsightly.  Here's a brief sampling of the suggestions I've fielded to help curb the litter problem in Toronto:  Pass a by-law banning the sale of fast food to any minor, during school hours.  Fine school children if they are caught littering and make their parents pay the fine.  Place video cameras in heavily littered areas to catch offenders  For litter.  For LITTER.  These are the lengths that some people are willing to go to in order to get their way.  The short-sighted, single-minded, knee-jerk solutions that are proposed....the justified means to a desired end.  If you thought the ban on pesticides was rough, try banning something like gum, plastic shopping bags, fast food packaging, or the like.  It's probably worth noting here that the only two brands of gum which are for sale in Singapore (for therapeutic use only) are  urlLink Wrigley's Orbit  and  urlLink GlaxoSmithKline's Nicorette . Gum became a sticking point months ago in Singapore's free trade talks with Washington, when Representative Philip Crane of the U.S. state of Illinois -- home of chewing gum giant Wrigley -- pressed the issue. Ok so...the powerful multinational chewing gum/pharmaceutical lobbies took issue with Singapore's hard line on gum, and worked their business into free trade talks?  What's the Singapore market worth to Wrigley's?  8 Billion?  9 Billion?  Why on earth would an American house representative push for this?  Can anyone have an opinion of their own, right or wrong, without a corporation thrusting itself on the issue?

       Yeah.  THAT Bill Gates   You know...I'd read that Bill Gates partially owned the landfill in Michigan that Toronto sends it's garbage to every day, but I kind of thought "it's a common name....it couldn't possibly be THE Bill Gates."  Well yeah, it is.  William H. Gates III owns (I think)  urlLink just under 12%  of Republic Services which owns the Michigan landfill that has a contract with the City of Toronto. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF FIVE PERCENT SHAREHOLDERS          The following table shows certain information as of March 1, 2004 with respect to the beneficial ownership of common stock by each of our stockholders who is known by us to be a beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock.

This whole post is of course in reference to this morning's article in the Globe  urlLink which again mentioned Bill Gates  as partial owner of Republic's landfill.  I know this is all investing, and corporate governance, and ownership of companies that own other companies....  And that Bill Gates isn't sitting in his mansion, wringing his hands and salivating at the thought of you throwing bag after bag of garbage on Toronto's streets....  But who knows.  Maybe he is.

       Sorry   I can't resist.  This is so strange it needs attention.  Bush.  He got scuffed up a few days ago after a fall from his mountain bike ride around the ranch in Crawford.  A Whitehouse spokesman (Trent Duffy) explained the fall this way: "It's been raining a lot and the topsoil is loose," Duffy said. "You know this president. He likes to go all-out. Suffice it to say he wasn't whistling show tunes." Ok so...he wasn't gay?  What the hell does the show-tunes thing mean?  It was Raining.  A lot.  In Crawford.  Loose topsoil.  Actually no, it wasn't.   urlLink Daily Kos  compiles the quotes and the precipitation reports for the area where Bush took a tumble.

       Greater men then you have tried to censor him   Now...I'm not usually one to take the Drudge Report at face value...  According to  urlLink Drudge : ESPN SCRUBS HUNTER S. THOMPSON BUSH BASH  Monday May 24 2004 17:50:09 ET   Hunter S. Thompson's ESPN column was scrubbed of controversy late Monday afternoon when online editors worried the famed gonzo journalist had gone too far.   In a column entitled, "Let's Go to the Olympics," Thompson went off on the Abu Ghraib prison picture scandal, exclaiming: "Not even the foulest atrocities of Adolf Hitler ever shocked me so badly as these [Abu Ghraib] photographs did."   But after being linked to the DRUDGE REPORT, a top editor demanded the sentence be immediately edited --without Thompson's okay, according to an ESPN.com staffer.   "Hunter can go too far sometimes," the Bristol-based ESPN employee told the DRUDGE REPORT.   The cleansed paragraph now reads:   "These horrifying digital snapshots of the American dream in action on foreign soil are worse than anything even I could have expected. I have been in this business a long time and I have seen many staggering things, but this one is over the line.   As with the original, Thompson still concludes with the thought: "Now I am really ashamed to carry an American passport."   Developing...   The column in it's current, allegedly sanitized form  urlLink is here  on the ESPN website.  Of course if the good Doctor intended to use the original phrasing, he'd be in violation of  urlLink Godwin's Law , and we'd have to dock him points.

       The Prince Edward Viaduct   I was walking home from work the other night.  As I crossed the Danforth bridge on the south side there was a guy playing the luminous veil like a harp.  He was getting pretty good sound out of it.  I asked if he played professionally, and he told me that I could catch him, and the rest of The Infrastructure Players on Thursday night at the Dufferin works yard.  I hear the guy on the salt dome is amazing.

       To the Queen   Word.  So I see that while I was in the warm, pine-fresh comfort of a loved one's family cottage this weekend, an election got called.  I suppose it's about time for me (and the rest of us) to stop paying attention to the sleeping elephant next to us, and do some good, old fashioned Canadian introspection.  It's suffering from night terrors recently and it's been keeping me up, so it's probably for the best.  I'll reveal now that I live in the home riding of a certain, federal leader and intend on seeing a few debates during the run.  You know...to get my money's worth out of this.  urlLink Jack Layton : Let his mustache tickle our economy's upper lip. (That was the best I could come up with tonight.

       Garbage   Man.  There was this little bit in  urlLink  the Globe  this morning from the AP: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it is taking some steps to deal with the flow of thousands of tonnes of Canadian trash into the Michigan landfill.  In a letter to U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, made public yesterday, EPA administrator Mike Leavitt said the agency may give Michigan a one-time grant to help make sure trash crossing the border meets its environmental and recycling regulations. The press release from Stabenow sums up the  urlLink details here .  I hope to God you're not looking to me for a solution to this problem...   urlLink Seriously , maybe I'm just a pessimist, but I think we're boned.  I'm not just saying that as someone who may, or may not, work for the Solid Waste Department of this fair city; I am saying that as a casual, tax paying citizen who has no direct control over this situation.  Let's forget everything else here: Let's forget the 125-145 trucks filled with  30 tonnes each  of  our  garbage that we send to Michigan every day; Let's forget about the piles of garbage dumped in our alleys, laneways, parks, hydro corridors, and ravines by jackasses who don't want to pay the fees or abide by the procedures to dispose of their garbage properly; Let's forget about the editorials that spout how "dirty" and "disgusting" our city has become, and how it's all the mismanagement and fault of City Hall that bits of garbage are visible to the easily offended eye; Let's forget how "difficult" and "confusing" programs like the blue and grey boxes and the new source separated organics (Green Bin) programs are for the average citizen; Let's forget about the fact that Toronto has no operational landfills, no space within it's borders for a new landfill and that the Province has no new landfills under development, let alone under the 8-10 years of review required for approval, essentially indicating that we have no intention of building a landfill within our borders; Let's forget about how outraged business owners are that they have to pay $3.10 per bag of garbage that they want the City to pick up; Let's forget how close that system of "user-pay" is to being imposed on each one of us; and Let's forget the sanctimonious harping of every doomsday-sayer like myself. Let's instead, remember that every bag of garbage that we put at the curb may be the first bag returned from the border, dropped at our feet, with no legal ground under which to bury it...  Let's remember that for a few moments.  I'm sorry if that sounds righteous and holier-then-thou, but the truth of the matter is that a little thing  urlLink like this , will close the border to our garbage, and force us to, for the first time in our lives, take responsibility for the garbage that we buy, produce, consume, stuff into garbage bags and will away with the power of "paying taxes".  I need a beer.

It's been a week since I last opened this thing up, and I see that at least one  urlLink person out there  was wondering about my opinion on a topic true to my name.  Got to get a few other things off my chest first...  Flitting back to that subject for a second....

       Where's a high powered egg launcher when you need it?   It's 7:30 and I have a serious homicidal urge.  Or suicidal.  Either will suffice in this situation.  I am one of the mercifully few people in this world who live across the street from an amateur improv theatre.  I know there are much worse things to live across the street from: an open pit sewer or a Denny's come to mind, but an amateur improv theatre is right down there.  Tonight, due to the warm weather (thank you very much God), the burgeoning improv-lets are doing their warm-up exercises out front, on the street, directly across from my open window.  They must be plenty warm by now, because it's been going on for a half an hour.  I swear to the aforementioned God, that they've been rhythmically clapping their extroverted little paws together and chanting in some creativity-inducing, pre-acting warm up since I poured my first shaky glass of scotch tonight. Improv dipshit #1: (as fast as his tongue will allow) Money money money money money money money money money money money STOP!!! (excitedly points at Improv dipshit #2)  Improv dipshit #2: Money money money money money money money money money money money STOP!!!  (excitedly points at Improv dipshit #3) Continue ad nauseum.  Meant to sharpen their skills of "hand off" or "Spot grab" or whatever, but like their final product it dissolved into a group giggle.  Next week.  On the roof.  2 dozen eggs.  I'll be waiting.

       Van Helsing   I'm not usually one for internet movie forums, but Van Helsing did something to me in that dark theatre on Friday night.  I just had to see what the rest of the world had to say about it.  I found the  urlLink following post  about Van Helsing at  urlLink rottentomatoes.com  1. THIS ISN'T GONNA WIN ANY OSCARS - don't go in expecting Titanic or Gone With The Wind.   2. THIS ISNT TITANIC! - So don't go in expecting Titanic  3. What you don't understan is that you can't think through this movie. This isn't Titanic or a foreign movie. You just have to look.  4. The acting isn't that great, but again, THIS ISN'T TITANIC! Don't go in expecting good acting.   5. It's not all that funny, but this isn't Seeinfeld or Titanic here. The jokes are excellent for this type of Summer movie  6. It plot is confusing at times, but this movie isn't running for any Oscars here. And if you think the plot doesnt make sense, well, do Werewolves make sense? Case point.  7. Don't go in expecting nipples, this isn't Titanic here. It's questionable whether or not vampires have them, so enough said.  8. The begining of the movie has no color. This may annoy some people or think that somethings wrong, but it's not. Just try to think of it as an old movie, or watching a new movie through sunglasses and it will make sense.  9. It's very entertaining and a visual treat. Great movie to eat with popcorn.  10. It might have just been in the version of Van Helsing that I downloaded, but it sounded great and very loud.  I live in Chile Boy I really wish I had read that before going to see Hugh Jackman battle Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman.  I'll admit I was kind of expecting Titanic.

       Once again   Here you go.  Read  urlLink this one  too.  From the Article 15-6 Investigation of the 800th Military Police Brigade 6. (S) I find that the intentional abuse of detainees by military police personnel included the following acts:   a. (S) Punching, slapping, and kicking detainees; jumping on their naked feet;   b. (S) Videotaping and photographing naked male and female detainees;   c. (S) Forcibly arranging detainees in various sexually explicit positions for photographing;   d. (S) Forcing detainees to remove their clothing and keeping them naked for several days at a time;   e. (S) Forcing naked male detainees to wear womens underwear;   f. (S) Forcing groups of male detainees to masturbate themselves while being photographed and videotaped;   g. (S) Arranging naked male detainees in a pile and then jumping on them;   h. (S) Positioning a naked detainee on a MRE Box, with a sandbag on his head, and attaching wires to his fingers, toes, and penis to simulate electric torture;   i. (S) Writing I am a Rapest (sic) on the leg of a detainee alleged to have forcibly raped a 15-year old fellow detainee, and then photographing him naked;   j. (S) Placing a dog chain or strap around a naked detainees neck and having a female Soldier pose for a picture;   k. (S) A male MP guard having sex with a female detainee;   l. (S) Using military working dogs (without muzzles) to intimidate and frighten detainees, and in at least one case biting and severely injuring a detainee;   m. (S) Taking photographs of dead Iraqi detainees. There is so much more to come, and I don't think that an actual, or sort-of appology, from Bush, Rumsfeld, or whoever, is going to make it right.  Iraqis, and Arabs in general will be looking for vengance.  This is going to get so much worse, and we should all be very very scared.  I know I am.

       Just to let you know:   From the Presidential  urlLink Executive Order 13303 : I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that the threat of attachment or other judicial process against the Development Fund for Iraq, Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial instruments of any nature whatsoever arising from or related to the sale or marketing thereof, and interests therein, obstructs the orderly construction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. This situation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.  I hereby order:   Section 1.  Unless licensed or otherwise authorized pursuant to this order, any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is prohibited, and shall be deemed null and void, with respect to the following: (a) the Development Fund for Iraq, and (b) all Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial instruments of any nature whatsoever arising from or related to the sale or marketing thereof, and interests therein, in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest, that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons. And from Presidential  urlLink Executive Order 13290 : I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, hereby determine that the United States and Iraq are engaged in armed hostilities, that it is in the interest of the United States to confiscate certain property of the Government of Iraq and its agencies, instrumentalities, or controlled entities, and that all right, title, and interest in any property so confiscated should vest in the Department of the Treasury. I intend that such vested property should be used to assist the Iraqi people and to assist in the reconstruction of Iraq, and determine that such use would be in the interest of and for the benefit of the United States.  I hereby order:   Section 1 . All blocked funds held in the United States in accounts in the name of the Government of Iraq, the Central Bank of Iraq, Rafidain Bank, Rasheed Bank, or the State Organization for Marketing Oil are hereby confiscated and vested in the Department of the Treasury, except for the following: (a) any such funds that are subject to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations or the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, or that enjoy equivalent privileges and immunities under the laws of the United States, and are or have been used for diplomatic or consular purposes, and  (b) any such amounts that as of the date of this order are subject to postjudgment writs of execution or attachment in aid of execution of judgments pursuant to section 201 of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (Public Law 107 297), provided that, upon satisfaction of the judgments on which such writs are based, any remainder of such excepted amounts shall, by virtue of this order and without further action, be confiscated and vested. But it's not about the oil, right?  It's about liberation.

       What do we do now?   Ok, I was just flipping through  urlLink this site , and this particular article has come to light a few times recently: Art. 13. Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and will be regarded as a serious breach of the present Convention. In particular, no prisoner of war may be subjected to physical mutilation or to medical or scientific experiments of any kind which are not justified by the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner concerned and carried out in his interest.  Likewise, prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.  Measures of reprisal against prisoners of war are prohibited.(Convention III, Art. 13) There's lots to say, and lots has been said, but I'd like to look at the last bit of the second paragraph, which indicates that Prisoners of War must be protected "against insults and public curiosity."  Last year, on  urlLink Face the Nation , Donald Rumsfeld accused the then Iraqi government of violating the Geneva convention, after footage of American soldiers being interrogated was aired on Al-Jazeera.   urlLink Human Rights watch agreed , but pointed out the unintentional irony in Rumsfeld's view.  Seems the US did the same thing.  (Thanks to  urlLink Slate  for the links and the memory refreshment)  A year and a month later, MORE pictures have come out that show, not only Iraqi Prisoners of War, but showing them being grotesquely humiliated.  Clearly a pictorial representation of violations of the Geneva Convention (wrt POWs), but also a violation  itself  in that prisoners are shown off as public curiosity.  Ok.  But the US government didn't release the photos, they were taken by individual US military personal, and obtained by a US based news agency: CBS, owned by a US based communications company:  urlLink Viacom .  There seems to be no indication that the pictures are fake (I'm talking about the American ones here, not the British ones).  So it would follow that, if the pictures are what everyone claims they are, then they are a violation of the rights of prisoners of war as stipulated in the Geneva Convention.  So: Who do we hold responsible?  An Iraqi would, presumably, hold the US government responsible.  Viacom, and therefore CBS who first broadcast the pictures on "60 Minutes II", is an American company, and as such falls under American rules and American responsibility.  The US government should have reigned in CBS once it was clear that CBS was going to air the pictures, to save itself from violating the "public curiosity" part of the Article.  It would of course still be responsible for the  actual  POW violations that occurred, but at least these men might have retained their dignity.  Vicom might declare their right of free speech, and the right of the American public to know what it's military had done to Prisoners of War during the present conflict.  The press in the US is free, and as such isn't under the control of the State.  The fact that everyone knew that the pictures were going to be aired, should indicate that the US government had all the time it needed to obtain any court, national security or presidential order (could such things occur?)  to halt the public broadcast of the pictures.  Presumably, no orders were given.    Would the US government really throw up it's hands in the face of a violation of their own constitution, and allow a repeated violation human rights, simply to preserve the freedom of its own press?  The US Government might claim that the prisoners were violated without official knowledge.  That the pictures were taken by individuals who have been subsequently reprimanded, and were broadcast by a international corporation whose various holdings and assets are invested in the global economy....perhaps it's was as much Canada's, or Britain's responsibility to force Viacom to not air the photographs.  Arguably some benefit has come from this violation of the Geneva Convention.  I certainly wouldn't be talking about it if CBS hadn't aired the pictures nor would anyone else, save the dipshit who snapped the shots.  Since this "public curiosity" part of the article has been broken, we now know about all of the other mistreatments that POWs have had at the hands of their American captors.  Ok, next question.  What are we calling the guys in the picture?  Are they Iraqi military personal?  Under what military do they now exist?  After a nation has been toppled, with no rulers, no military, and only the present occupiers in charge, what do we call the subsequent men in uniform?  Are they Prisoners of War?  Are they these now the "enemy combatants" that we've heard so much about?  I hear that one has rights under international law and the other doesn't....  What if these guys are just some men like us or our fathers, who fought against the invading military force who had taken over their country?  What are they then?  Are they prisoners of war?  There's lots of room for the definition of a Prisoner of War under  urlLink Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention , and therefore lots of reasons to classify the men in the pictures as recognized Prisoners of War.  Maybe there's some argument that the men in the pictures are excluded from POW standing, but that's for the lawyers to decide, right?  What do we do with the  urlLink private contractors  who are involved in this same incident?  Do Geneva convention rules apply to companies who's employees violate human rights, and the rules of war?  Finally, what will happen when the US inevitably spins its way out of this one?  We've all just witnessed a clear violation of international law by the United States, and when they tell their people that "they were all bad guys", or that "a few bad apples spoiled what was otherwise a very pleasant war", or that "freedom ain't free", or whatever homespun metaphor will help the Yanks justify what has happened.....what will we do then?

       Voted most likely to be ignored   Wow.  Remember when the US was accused of human rights violations in Iraq?    urlLink I do :  U.S. accused of human rights violations in Fallujah   Last Updated Mon, 03 May 2004 18:42:28   BAGHDAD - UN human rights investigator Paul Hunt is calling for an independent inquiry into how the U.S. military's siege of Fallujah has affected civilians.   Hunt says that while reliable information is difficult to obtain, there are credible claims that U.S. forces have been guilty of serious human rights breaches in their month-long siege of the city.     He notes some reports say that 90 per cent of the deaths during the fighting have been non-combatants and he is urging the U.S.-led civil administration in Iraq to launch the independent probe.   Meanwhile, U.S. officials have tossed aside one Iraqi general and named another to command an Iraqi brigade in Fallujah.   They now say former intelligence officer Mohammed Latif and not Republican Guard veteran Mohammed Jasim Saleh will lead Iraqi forces in disarming Fallujah's insurgents.   Saleh was the Pentagon's choice until the weekend when officials in Washington voiced misgivings. Critics say Saleh took part in the bloody suppression of a 1991 Shia uprising in Iraq.   In contrast, Latif has a history of opposing Saddam Hussein.   U.S. troops also came under heavy fire in the holy city of Najaf on Monday, where fighters loyal to a radical Shia cleric have attacked with machine-guns and mortars.   The U.S. has vowed to capture or kill religious leader Muqtada al-Sadr, whose militia launched an uprising early last month.   In Baghdad, U.S. forces used artillery to pound rebel positions in the west of the city.   More American soldiers were also killed on Monday.   Iraqi fighters killed one U.S. soldier guarding a captured weapons cache in the capital. West of the city, a U.S. marine was killed, bringing the total of American dead since the war began to 755.

       Warren Kinsella-type ass kicking    urlLink Warren  recalls the past.... May 2, 2004 - It would be churlish - cruel, even - to suggest that a journalist of Ben Mulroney's immense stature receives his columns from his father's secretary, via the fax room at Ogilvy Renault in Montreal. The Sun papers - all of Canadian journalism, in fact - are honoured by his continued willingness to balance TV celebrity interviews with scintillating political analysis. How does he do it? And all whilst keeping his hair so neat and tidy? Let me say it, once and for all: Ben has his weekly Sun  urlLink column  because he is our generation's I. F. (Izzy) Stone. The fact that his father is the chairman of the newspaper's board is entirely coincidental.  Ahem. In any event, in today's masterwork, Ben writes this: Obviously, to attack the Tories makes political sense for the Liberals. But what is politically effective is not always good for the country, and what this country needs more than an election campaign, more than attack ads and more than a Warren Kinsella-type ass-kicking is an open and effective debate. I could not agree more. What a genius this fetching young lad is.   But - and I hesitate to raise this, so forgive me - what is Benji's view of his father's celebrated decision to, and I quote, "bomb the bridges" about his Liberal opponent in the federal election campaign of 1988? You know, the one that relied upon millions in business contributions, and shadowy "independent" corporate coalitions, to deploy some of the most vicious attack ads anyone has ever seen in Canada: what about that? Given the junior Mulroney's newfound fondness for "open and effective debate," I can only assume he will now condemn his father's shocking descent into the political depths.  Here is Ben's personal email address, should you wish to urge him to take a stand on this important issue: justben@mail.com.  Tell him Warren Kinsella-type Ass-Kicker sent you! Heh..."Benji".  Mental note: Don't piss Kinsella off.

       Wow   Uh..wow.  From the  urlLink transcript of the Rose Garden  press conference with Paul Martin:  Q Mr. President, could you tell us what you'd like to see Canada doing on Iraq, both diplomatically and in terms, eventually, of getting possibly police and troops on the ground there?   PRESIDENT BUSH: My first answer to that is, I want to Canada to do what it feels comfortable doing in Iraq. That's -- and that's what I told the Prime Minister before. Canada is an independent nation. Canada makes -- will make its decisions based upon her own judgment. The Prime Minister shares my deep desire for there to be peace in the world. And to the extent that the country feels comfortable in helping that, we're grateful.   Canada is doing a lot in Afghanistan. Canada is doing a lot in Haiti. Canada is a contributor to reconstruction in Iraq. And I am grateful to be able to talk to a friend who shares the same goal, which is affecting behavior in a way that's based upon our values of human rights, human dignity, and freedom. And we've got no better partner in understanding the power of free societies.   There's a lot of people in the world who don't believe that people whose skin color may not be the same as ours can be free and self-govern. I reject that. I reject that strongly. I believe that people who practice the Muslim faith can self-govern. I believe that people whose skins aren't necessarily -- are a different color than white can self-govern.   And the Prime Minister -- I don't want to put words in his mouth -- but I think he shares that great sense of optimism and possibility. And it's good to have a friend who shares that with us.   Would you like to have the First Ladies come on up?   PRIME MINISTER MARTIN: I've got to say, though, I really do like sharing a press conference with you. You answer those questions perfectly. (Laughter.)   PRESIDENT BUSH: Thank you. Record that.   Q (Question asked in French.)   PRIME MINISTER MARTIN: (Responding in French.)   If you can give me just two seconds, I'm going to translate. They want it.   PRESIDENT BUSH: Some of these guys understand French. (Laughter.) Raise your hand, Gregory. (Laughter.)   PRIME MINISTER MARTIN: (Translating his remarks in French.)   PRESIDENT BUSH: Listen, thank you all. Ahem....first of all: There's a lot of people in the world who don't believe that people whose skin color may not be the same as ours can be free and self-govern. I reject that. I reject that strongly. I believe that people who practice the Muslim faith can self-govern. I believe that people whose skins aren't necessarily -- are a different color than white can self-govern. Bush went on to say:  "Look, there's a lot of people out there who believe that murdering little babies is ok.  I reject that.  I reject that strongly.  Folks, President Bush believes that people whose skins aren't necessarily -- are a different colour then white, can self govern.  Welcome George.  Welcome to, what...reality?  the 20th Century?  the 21st Century.  Could we please let India know that Bush thinks it's ok that they govern themselves?  Wow.  He's the one that's going to get re-elected huh? I've got to say, though, I really do like sharing a press conference with you. You answer those questions perfectly. He sure does Paul.  He sure does.

       Poisoning 8 year old girls for attending school   Silly girls, school isn't for you.  Not in recently  urlLink liberated Afghanistan anyway . "I will not call anyone an Afghan or a Muslim who poisons an eight-year-old child because she is schoolgoing," Karzai said. "They are beasts."   Vikram Parekh, from the International Crisis Group, said there had been a series of attacks on girls' schools, particularly in the south of the country, in recent months but this was the first time children had been attacked.   "A girl's school was recently burnt to the ground in Kandahar and others have been attacked, but this is a horrible development to see that the girls themselves would be targeted," he told the Guardian.

       The painfully obvious    urlLink Here are  the most predictable results of a hypothesis ever published.  Obese girls and boys bullied more often, research finds    Obese children and teenagers -- and chubby girls in particular -- are far more likely to be victims of bullying than their normal-weight peers, according to new Canadian research.And, as they grow older, overweight teens -- boys especially -- are far more likely to turn the tables and become bullies themselves, the study revealed.   "Almost all the research that is done focuses on the physical aspects of obesity, but this study tells us that there's this whole other psychological component that's really important to explore," Ian Janssen, a researcher in the department of community health and epidemiology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., said.   The study, published in today's edition of the medical journal Pediatrics, found that about one in seven Canadian children aged 11 to 16 are victims of bullying.   Ten per cent of girls of normal weight are bullied, compared with 15 per cent of overweight girls and 23 per cent of obese girls. Among boys, 11 per cent of those of normal weight are bullied, compared with 14 per cent in the overweight group and more than 15 per cent of the obese boys.  The research showed that bullying of heavy children gets more frequent and more violent as they move into their teen years, when adolescents are overly conscious of their maturing bodies.  It also revealed that obese children strike back. "My guess is that after being bullied for a while, they retaliate," Dr. Janssen said.  He stressed, however, that the research was designed to look at the link between weight and bullying, but does not explain why it occurs.   "We can only hypothesize about the whys," he said, before adding: "But it kind of makes sense that the fat kids get picked on."   Dr. Janssen said bullying has particularly devastating effects on teenagers, because their most important relationships are with their peers."Bullying can have devastating developmental consequences. It can really affect these kids profoundly," he said.  The research was conducted on a sample of 5,749 boys and girls aged 11 to 16 from across Canada. The information was collected in 2002 as part of a 35-country survey by the World Health Organization.  The researchers looked at various forms of bullying, including verbal (name-calling, teasing), physical (punching, hitting, kicking), relational (being ostracized) and sexual harassment.  Girls were most likely to be victims of physical bullying, while boys are victims of relational bullying.  Dr. Janssen said what surprised him most was the violent behaviour of girls. "You don't usually associate the hitting, punching and kicking with girls, you think it would be more about relationships."   Dr. Janssen said the lack of physical attacks on obese boys is easy to explain. "Boys who are overweight and obese are often big and strong -- the kid who is the offensive lineman on the football team -- so not many others are going to pick on them, at least physically," he said.  Dr. Janssen said schools should also take some lessons from the data, and adapt their anti-bullying programs so they pay particular attention to obese and overweight youth. I added the italics to point out that the scientist in question, probably administered his share of wedgies and pink-bellies to the lard-os in his 7th grade class.  That line about the offensive lineman on the football team kind of makes me chuckle though.  God help you if you go to suburban highschool just west of Hamilton that has NO interest in supporting a football team.  The fat kid who should be an offensive lineman, ends up being the fat kid who plays tuba.  Trust me on this one....there's no respect.  I'm waiting for the next study that shows that fat kids are the funny ones, and that girls like them, but 'just as a friend'.

       Today's the Day   Ok.  The polls have been open since 9:30 this morning and they'll be open until 9:30 tonight.  After I vote, I'm getting together with my girlfriend and we're going to watch the election night coverage in the traditional Canadian way: Take-out pizza and some beer.  We'll probably flip channels and compare coverage, hair pieces, news sets, and affects of the  urlLink hosts  and  urlLink little helpers .   I hear  urlLink Kinsella  will be one of the talking heads on Global tonight.  After reading an email from a friend who was confused as to where she should vote, I submit the following two links to help her, and anyone else who might be confused about the procedure for today:  Don't know where to vote?  Click  urlLink here .  Don't know when to vote?  Click  urlLink here .  Don't know how to vote?  The polling location has instructions and diagrams in a number of languages.  If you need help there's plenty of election volunteers who you can ask.  Don't know who to vote for?  You've got some reading to do.  Try  urlLink here , or  urlLink here , or  urlLink here  to start.  Don't know what to wear while you vote?  Casual or business attire is acceptable, as is anything you normally drape yourself in outside of your apartment.  About the only thing you're not allow to wear are political buttons or party support t-shirts.  Those returning officers are usually 80 year old women and they can get pretty feisty about the rules.  Leave your "Jack it up" thong at home for tonight.  Don't know why to vote?  Simply (and there are many other reasons) this is, by all accounts, going to be one of the closest elections in Canadian history.  A small number of votes can and will change the outcome of the election in many ridings in Canada.  If you sit this one out you're not allowed to complain tomorrow.  I've got my voter card at home but apparently I don't need to bring it with me.  Photo ID with a signature and your address on it (like a driver's license) should suffice.  If you're not on the voter's list, you can fill out a form at your polling station and get your ballot.  The good people at Elections Canada make it remarkably easy to contribute to democracy, so you should take advantage of their hard work and benefit at the polls tonight.    I put my postal code into the  urlLink Election's Canada site  and it told me that I should go to Chester Village at 717 Broadview Ave.  It's a nursing home and it's the same place that I voted in the Provincial election in the fall.  It was right during dinner and while I'm sure the residents weren't thrilled with the public intrusion, the bean salad and cherry cobler just wouldn't taste the same if they knew a young scamp like myself was skipping out on democracy.  Me?  I'm doing it for the Grandmas and Grandpas at Chester Village.  Word.  Have fun, and you're only allowed to have a beer after the polls...not before.

I hear some faint typing off in the distance, and some fax machine beeping, but other then that there might be 3 or 4 people here.  I'm pretty sure we can't take a day off to vote, and I'm pretty sure that it makes more sense to take, say, Friday of this week off instead of Monday, but there it is.  A big cannon ball bouncing around at the other end of the hallway with no one to fire it back to me.  A municipal summer.  It doesn't get any lonelier then this...

       Garbage Day   There's a Works Committee meeting Tuesday at the City with a meaty garbage  urlLink agenda .  From one of the reports...  (6) Recommendation No. (24) be amended by defining the meaning of 'litter'.   Litter can be generally defined as public space waste. It is commonly understood to be waste (garbage, recyclables and organic matter) that is consumed, and its usefulness terminated, in public spaces. It is either disposed of properly (in litter bins) or improperly (on the ground or otherwise).  In 2002 the City of Toronto conducted an audit of the "on the ground" litter stream, and identified 5 major categories of brand ownership:  - Beverage containers (e.g., aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles) - Confectioners (e.g., candy wrappers, gum) - Publishers (e.g., newspapers, magazines) - Quick Service (e.g., fast food wrappers, coffee cups) - Tobacco (e.g., cigarette butts, packaging)  While these five major categories of brand ownership comprise most of the litter stream, they do not account for every possible example of litter. Other common examples, which fall outside of these categories, include: plastic grocery bags, drinking straws, napkins, condoms, fruit peels and cores, plastic cutlery, etc.  The purpose of designating litter under the WDO funding model is to attempt to recover some of the costs of municipal litter management from the manufacturers of the products which end up in the litter stream. As such, identifying and defining the exact brand makeup of the items in the litter stream is important, but very complex.   A new committee, the Provincial Litter Reduction Committee, is currently being formed and will be facilitated by the Municipal Waste Integration Network (MWIN). One of the objectives of the committee will be to examine the designation of the litter stream, regulatory framework and funding partners for a litter program, and present the findings to the Province and WDO.  The City of Toronto has been invited to be a member of the new MWIN Provincial Litter Reduction Committee and, working with other municipalities and brand owners, will attempt to define and designate litter for WDO funding. Heh...condoms.  Bet you didn't see that one coming!   There's also this little gem:  (b) an action plan to find and/or create markets for aerosol cans and aluminum foil to allow the quickest possible introduction to the blue box.    Empty aerosol cans and aluminum foil containers are already included in the Blue Box program. This whole report ( urlLink here, in PDF ) is basically in response to all of the motions and questions that the Councilors had for the original report ( urlLink here, in PDF ).  It must be oddly satisfying to answer a Councilor's suggestion for service improvement with "Yeah...We already do that, and we've been doing for 3 years now."  There will no doubt be some news and reaction on Wednesday.

       The F-bomb   I'm going to leave tales of Dogs and Monsters and the Clash of the Danforth Titans for a few moments to focus on the Elephant to the south.  If you haven't heard yet, US Vice President Dick Cheney said a bad word to a Democratic Senator.  The word was "fuck" and it was either in the context "Fuck off" or "Go fuck yourself".   urlLink CNN tells the tale : Cheney, who as president of the Senate was present for the picture day, turned to Leahy and scolded the senator over his recent criticism of the vice president for Halliburton's alleged war profiteering.  Cheney is the former CEO of Halliburton, and Democrats have suggested that while serving in the Bush administration he helped win lucrative contracts for his former firm, including a no-bid contract to rebuild Iraq.  Cheney's office has said repeatedly that the vice president has no role in government contracting and has severed all financial ties with the Texas-based oil services conglomerate.  Cheney was chief executive officer of Halliburton from 1995 to 2000. He resigned when he became George Bush's running mate.  In response to Cheney, Leahy reminded Cheney that the vice president had once accused him of being a bad Catholic, to which Cheney replied either "f--- off" or "go f--- yourself." Similar version  urlLink here at My Way   Ok, so it wasn't on TV and the Senate wasn't in session, so there are some immediate contrasts to the point I'm about to raise.  But bear with me because there's relevance here.  The FCC ( urlLink Federal Communications Commission ) are the American broadcast regulators, and they're like the CRTC up here.  They, among other things, decide what can and can not be broadcast over the television and radio signals in the US.  The FCC has been in the news a lot recently for their crackdown of offensive material on public airwaves.  Most notably, they fined Howard Stern and his carriers for broadcasting a description of a "blumpkin"; they raised a stink over Janet Jackson's "wardrobe malfunction" during the Superbowl half-time show; and they ruled against NBC, in a landmark decision, for failing to censor Bono when he exclaimed that his Golden Globe award was "fucking brilliant" on live TV.  As I mentioned, the FCC is not only cracking down on offensive material, but are defining what is and is not offensive, in decisions  urlLink like this one  against NBC's Golden Globe broadcast.  From the decision (see the  urlLink decision document  for footnotes): ...we disagree with the Bureau and conclude that use of the phrase at issue is within the scope of our indecency definition because it does depict or describe sexual activities. We recognize NBC's argument that the "FWord" here was used "as an intensifier."23 Nevertheless, we believe that, given the core meaning of the "F-Word," any use of that word or a variation, in any context, inherently has a sexual connotation, and therefore falls within the first prong of our indecency definition. Fuck, in any context, in any variation, has an inherently sexual connotation.  OK?  Fuck off, fucked up, fucking brilliant, fuckin' eh, that fucking jackass who lives down the street...  all invariably invoke a corse sexual image.    Continuing, on whether the broadcast is inherently offensive: The "F-Word" is one of the most vulgar, graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the English language. Its use invariably invokes a coarse sexual image. The use of the "F-Word" here, on a nationally telecast awards ceremony, was shocking and gratuitous. In this regard, NBC does not claim that there was any political, scientific or other independent value of use of the word here, or any other factors to mitigate its offensiveness.25 If the Commission were routinely not to take action against isolated and gratuitous uses of such language on broadcasts when children were expected to be in the audience, this would likely lead to more widespread use of the offensive language.26 If Bono saying the "fucking brilliant" will lead to more widespread use of the offensive language amongst children, then surely  the Vice President of the United States saying "Go fuck yourself" to an elected colleague will do the same.  Right, right..but the Senate wasn't in session.  The comment wasn't broadcast, and clearly Cheney's political enemies are using this incident to further their own partisan interests.  But here's my point Dude.  The FCC has said that the use of the term, in any context, is patently offensive.  Now, while that may not apply to the local shmoe on the street (no one has banned the use of the word outright), but surely this federal decision would carry some weight with the man who sits in the second highest seat of Federal power.  Surely the VP would agree that the term is offensive and would take responsibility for setting an example for American children by not using the word anywhere, let alone in the hallowed Senate chambers.  My beef isn't with Cheney here, he can fucking say whatever he wants, it's with the idea of legislating morality.  My beef is with the hypocrisy of a nation which prides itself, seemingly ahead of everything else, on free speech but will say, in black and white terms, that a certain word means a certain thing in any context, and that it is offensive when used.  "Fucking brilliant" is without a doubt an intensifier, which reflects the common speech and language of the vast majority of listeners.  Did anyone picture two individuals having brilliant intercourse when Bono won his award?  "Go fuck yourself", on the other hand, does attempt to invoke a coarse sexual image of either masturbation or gymnastics.  Or politics, I suppose.

       Dog from God    urlLink Well this  just scared the pants right off of me.  I'm completely pants-less with fear. A man drove from the Maritimes with a carload of guns and ammunition, vowing to kill as many people in Toronto as he could Â? before a last-minute encounter with a wandering dog inspired a change of heart.  The New Brunswick man, in his 40s, surrendered to police yesterday afternoon in front of a supermarket at Leslie and Eastern Sts. He had a loaded gun in his pocket and a car crammed with more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition.   "At that time, he decided he was going to shoot people in the area," said Detective Nick Ashley of 55 Division. "He attended a local park nearby and was preparing the weapons to do that."  By chance, a dog approached the man and started playing with him in the Victoria Park Ave. and Queen St. E. park.  "He happens to be a pet lover and decided that if there was such a nice dog in the area the people were too nice and he wasn't going to carry out his plan," Ashley said.  His car, a red Subaru caked with mud, provided the testament. It was packed with doggie blankets, a big plastic dog dish still filled with dry kibble - and the biggest single arsenal Ashley had seen in his 17 years with the service.   The car "was absolutely stuffed," he said. Stuffed with guns, ammunition and a self described crazy person. "He told me he was crazy and he needed to go to the hospital," the officer recalled.  And, Douglas added, he had a loaded gun in his pocket. "He said, `I'm just going to drive around and kill people at random.'"  Officers were tallying their cache last night at their Coxwell St. headquarters, counting carton after carton of bullets.  The list included: a 12-gauge shotgun, a bolt action rifle with a telescopic lens, a 9-mm semiautomatic, a machete, throwing knife, camouflage ski mask, black leather gloves, and 6,296 rounds of ammunition.  "He felt that if he shot enough people he would stay in custody permanently," Ashley said. "This could have been a very dangerous situation had his plan unfolded."  "It's scary how close it could have been. We have a dog to thank somewhere." Thank Dog that dog was there.  You know, I don't mean to get up on a soap-box here but, this really underscores the need for more....  I mean, it's obvious that something like this is going to happen when funding gets cut from...  Clearly we should be putting more time and political effort into...  Yeah.  I don't know either.  I mean...was this guy forcibly discharged from a maritime mental hospital, screaming about how he's going to drive to Toronto and kill a bunch of people?  Were all of his guns registered with the Feds, and if so was there some indication in the database that he'd do something like this?    There's an inevitability to an incident like the one we narrowly avoided.  How on earth do you stop something like this before it happens?  There's been mass shootings in the States that we look down our noses at (you know...because they have GUNS down there) and this one was going to rival any of those.  San Diego McDonalds, New York Subway, Virginia Beltway, Toronto Beaches.  How do you prevent someone unbalanced from inflicting terror on the rest of us?  I've got a prize for the first letter to the editor claiming that the details of this story are proof that owners should be allowed to let their dogs run without leashes in Toronto parks.  I've got another prize for the first letter to the editor who mentions that the dog was actually an angel, or perhaps Zeus, transformed to save us all.  As grateful as I am for that dog, a mercifully benign coincidence is still a coincidence.  Good boy.  Come get your treat.

       Rumble in Riverdale   I tried folks.  I really tried.  I got to Jimmy Simpson Arena at 6:30 for a 7:00 debate and the line stretched out the door, down the stairs and along Queen.  By 6:45 it was clear that the line of constituents outside the building was not going to get inside for the Toronto-Danforth All-Candidate's debate.  Cursing and whining from the frustrated residents was directed at the debate organizers, and eventually back at the crowd itself: "They're not letting the voters of this riding in!!  There's party supporters in there and the people who can actually vote can't get a seat inside!!  There's only one all-candidate's debate in this riding and we're not allowed in!! Hey, fire codes are fire codes.  And besides, if you wanted more seating available then you should have organized a debate yourself.  No one's rights were violated last night, and an event like that takes weeks of planning and lots of volunteer support.  Those of us who couldn't get in, pulled up a speedbump or patch of municipally landscaped garden and sat outside, in the rain, and listened to the 2 hour debate on the loudspeakers that the organizers had provided.  Past the initial frustration of not getting into the community centre auditorium (gym), spending a couple of hours in the rain with my fellow residents, people who really really wanted to hear what was being said, is something that I'll remember for a long time.  Of the approximately 100 people outside (150 according to  urlLink the Sun ), there were groups of party supporters (most of whom were using their lawn signs as rain cover), Mom-and-Pop citizenry, and cops.  Cops.  There were between 10-15 cops on site, 4 of whom were on horseback.  By 9:00 when the debate culminated, the 2 squad cars parked across the street magically turned into 6 or 7 bearing officers sporting belts full of zip-tie protester-pacifiers.  They were clearly ready for a riot in Riverdale.  Eventually a familiar voice came over the speakers; Andy Barrie announced that he was moderating.  He laid out the ground rules and announced the drawn order of speakers for the night:  Jim Harris - Green Party (Leader)  Marcell Rodden - Marxist-Leninist Party  Loftus Cuddy - Conservative Party  Jack Layton - New Democratic Party (Leader)  Scott Yee - Marijuana Party  Dennis Mills - Liberal Party (incumbent)  The proceedings began with opening statements from the candidates.  Most augmented their party's platforms with some statements relevant to the riding itself.  Only Layton and Mills could describe public work they have already done in the Riverdale community.  Layton spoke of his Council fights to keep schools open an close incinerators along the waterfront.  Mills spoke about his opposition to Meech Lake back in the day, and lauded his party for setting up the "best fiscal framework in the G8".  Among the questions for the evening, a couple of topics jumped out.  Toronto-Danforth claims to have the 2nd largest population of gay and lesbian constituents in all of the federal ridings.  As such the issue of same-sex marriage was raised not only at the debate last night, but at a Mills headquarters  urlLink protest on Sunday afternoon .  The questioner took Mills to task on his support of "traditional marriage" and asked the Liberal, Conservative and NDP candidates to outline their positions on same-sex marriage.  Cuddy said that he, personally, was in favour of same-sex marriages but stressed that there are "arguments on both sides".  In a cool little bit of spin he said that as a lawyer he's handled same-sex divorces and they are "equal in their awfulness" to traditional divorces.  Layton reiterated his position that same-sex marriage is a human rights issue.  Mills, on the other hand, supports the "traditional definition of marriage" but will support any decision that the House produces.  Boos and cheers all around for all candidates on this one.  I might as well throw in the most entertaining candidate of the evening at this point.  Scott Yee, the Marijuana Party candidate doesn't exactly support same-sex marriage because he doesn't support marriage at all.  He'd "rip up the Marriage" act because "What's next?  Will we need a license to become friends too?"  Breaking bold new ground man.  On proportional representation and electoral reform Yee started working blue: "Why should I have to vote for him? I should get to vote for my own fucking Prime Minister!"  Yee was talking reforms beyond the scope of my humble understanding, and was advised by one questioner to "not smoke that stuff before coming to the debate."  OCAP's issue with Mills got the floor via a question about affordable housing and the Beatitude House on Gerrard.  "Why did you lie?  Why are you even running in this race?  You promised to resign your seat if that house wasn't converted into affordable housing and you didn't."  Mills explained that the process failed.  He had all the approvals ready to go but the necessary permits couldn't be obtained in time.  He also said that construction is going on down at the house right now.  The explanation wasn't good enough for Marcell "Marxist-Leninist" Rodden, who interjected on top of the discussion, shouting that he was at that house when the promise was made, and...and... The moderator had to step in, calling for his mike to be cut.  Mills concluded by wondering out loud why Layton didn't use his City Hall connections to help the process along.  The debate drew to a close at 9:00 sharp and, similar to the cheers that start up around the first "We stand on guard for Thee", the partisan chants and shouts began as the Green leader was making his final statements.  " urlLink Someday is now " was drowned out by the "Jack Jack Jack", "Den-nis Mills", and "Na na na, hey hey hey, Goood-bye" chants outside the Community Centre.  This morning there's a  urlLink few  articles about  urlLink the debate  and, having seen Don Wanagas wander through the crowd pad in hand, there'll be another on in Thursday's  urlLink Now .  I got soaked, but I got soaked for democracy.  I earned  urlLink my pint  last night.

       And for my own father...   ...who is spending the weekend with mom in Niagara on the Lake, watching Pygmalion and drinking some wine,  urlLink here's a treat  for you: It's a song that is instantly identifiable by its opening chords, striking a chord in the hearts of millions of Canadians. In this CBC Television clip, Lightfoot performs the stirring Canadian Railroad Trilogy for the very first time. As the building of Canada's railroad is re-enacted behind him, Lightfoot strolls across the stage strumming his guitar while singing: "There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run / When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun."  With Lightfoot's trademark silky, soulful vocals and the help of an accompanying orchestra, the song builds to a brilliant crescendo as Lightfoot continues to tug on our heartstrings with this unmistakably Canadian narrative. "O'er the mountain tops we stand, all the world at our command / We have opened up the soil with our teardrops and our toil." I was in the St. Lawrence Market last weekend buying a marble rye and some chicken for dinner, when I heard an unmistakable voice.  After gathering my change I turned to see a busker standing by the south east exit, guitar strapped around his body singing the Canadian Railroad Trilogy.  He must have spent years making his voice sound like that; Lightfoot's vocal doppelganger: you can catch him by the Montreal bagel stand at the south end of the south building.  I dropped a toonie into his guitar case and said "you sound just like him".  He nodded a smile and kept singing.  Happy Father's Day.

       Why hasn't Jan Wong been arrested?    urlLink Her column  today in the Globe: How long would it take a someone with zero expertise to find child pornography on the Internet -- the same kind of images Mr. Briere said drove him to his crime?  The answer: one hour and ten minutes. But those 70 minutes were a journey into depraved cyberspace that left me feeling nauseated. There you go.  Jan Wong took it upon herself to locate some of child pornography that exists on the internet.  Jan Wong, Globe and Mail columnist, sought out child pornography for a story she was writing.  Remember when Pete Townsend did the same thing?  Remember when Pete Townsend got arrested, got his computer confiscated and said that he was "doing research" because he was abused as a child?  Remember when he got his name dragged through the mud for what he did?  Can someone tell me why Jan Wong hasn't been arrested yet?  In her column Jan says that it takes an hour and ten minutes for a self-described non-"technologically savvy" person to find some of the most disturbing images that men have ever created: One child stood innocently in a bathtub; others wore black garter belts or thongs that somehow fit their narrow hips. One girl looked as young as 4. Others were probably five or six years old. Some appeared to be about 10, the age when they lose their baby fat. You know Jan...  I've never seen child porn.  I've never wanted to see child porn.  And I've certainly never gone looking specifically for child porn.  But you have. Then a series of photos flashed on the screen that made us sick. It showed men raping little kids, including a little girl who couldn't be older than 4. I hadn't touched the keyboard or the mouse when another set of photos replaced them. They showed a pot-bellied white man, his face hidden, having sex with two scrawny Asian girls, perhaps five or six years old.  In one photo, the little Asian girl appeared to be giving him oral sex. She was standing up, and didn't even come up to his navel. Another photo showed the other little girl, her wrists duct-taped to her ankles, being raped by the man. The expression on her face was vacant. She says that she passed the URLs onto the Toronto police.  She says that this was an "assignment" that she was given.  Put your hands up if you found Jan Wong's article helpful.  Put your hands up if you previously didn't believe that child porn existed and could be easily obtained by someone who's willing to put an hour and ten minutes worth of effort into a search engine.  Put your hands up if we should applaud Jan Wong for viewing child pornography in the name of journalism.  You know Jan, I hear you can make a lot of money by selling crack to teenagers.  You should do a story on that too.

       Rockin' with the Federal Leaders   Well most of them.  Not Gilles "The Right Honourable Buzz-Kill" Duceppe of course, but the four top english leaders.  Puretracks.com, in a cool little  urlLink PR project , polled Martin, Harper, Layton and Harris about their top 5 songs.  We apparently  urlLink get to vote  on the playlists.  Let's  urlLink just review  shall we? To qualify as "Canadian content" for the purpose of radio broadcasting Canadian content quotas, a musical selection must generally fulfill at least two of the following conditions:   M (music):  the music is composed entirely by a Canadian   A (artist):  the music is, or the lyrics are, performed principally by a Canadian   P (production):  the musical selection is: recorded wholly in Canada, or  performed wholly in Canada and broadcast live in Canada.  L (lyrics):  the lyrics are written entirely by a Canadian.   The MAPL system is used by both the CRTC to check Canadian content compliancy by licensees and as a basis for eligibility to the federal Sound Recording Development Program (SRDP).  In general, 35% of the sound recordings played on a radio station between 6 a.m. and midnight must qualify as "Canadian content" as defined by the MAPL system. Ok?  Harris: 1. Rascalz - "Top of the world"  2. Joni Mitchell - "Big Yellow Taxi"  3. BTO - "Taking Care of Business"  4. U2 - "Elevation"  5. Black Eyed Peas - "Where is the love" CanCon = 60%  Harper: 1. ACDC - "Thunderstruck"  2. The Beatles - "I wanna hold your hand"  3. Johnny Cash - "Folsom Prison Blues"  4. Original Cast of Cats - "Mungojerrie And Rumpelteazer"  (A favourite of Mr. Harper's children)   5. Duke Ellington & His Orchestra - "It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" CanCon = 0%  Layton: 1. Barenaked Ladies - "If I had a Million Dollars"  2. Barenaked Ladies - "Lovers in a Dangerous Time"  3. Joan Baez - "Blowin' in the Wind"  4. Buena Vista Social Club - Soundtrack  5. Barlow - "Married by Elvis" CanCon = 60%  The other guy: 1. U2 - "Beautiful Day"  2. BTO - "Taking Care of Business"  3. Nana Mouskouri - "Moondance"  4. Simon and Garfunkel - "Bridge Over Troubled Water"  5. Diana Krall - "A Case of You" (Joni Mitchell cover) CanCon = 40%  Harper, you Yankee-lovin' SOB.  Not a single Canadian artist?  Clearly going for the boomer/pensioner crowd with his selections he completely overlooked, and could have easily gone with The Guess Who, Neil Young and, I think most damning of all, Lightfoot.  Johnny Cash I can respect but..."The Original Cast of Cats"?  Jesus Tapdancing Christ.  No Lightfoot, no Hayden, no Tragically Hip, no Constantines, no Weakerthans.  Just a whole lot of Bono and Burton Cummings.    You want "disaffected voter"?  Here I am.

       Post-punk?   Franz Ferdinand, Monday night at the Kool Haus.  Were you there?  No?  I'm surprised because the place was packed, and we were sandwiched between polyester and tube tops.  My god but it was a sweaty crowd.  Toronto's  urlLink Controller Controller  opened the set at about 9:30 or so with a really great performance.  My first time hearing them and I wanted to hear more right away.  I even went looking for a CD long before they went on sale.  My spot on the floor was more important then picking up a CD that I can find, if nowhere else,  urlLink here .  Vocals were a little self-conscious but that will pass.  In the parking lot, I got a kick out of watching one of the guitarists slide a 26er of rum into his back pocket, pull his too-small jacket down over the bottle and walk in past security with his girlfriend tugging at the back of his jacket to keep the secret.  Why he didn't just put the bottle in the case that he was carrying in one hand was beyond me.  Rock star all the way.  Ferdinand's Scotch opening band was " urlLink Sons and Daughters " (which must be a take  urlLink on this ).  Another pretty cool act.  No show, just music.  This would be a running theme of the night.  Their album debuts in North America in August. "Three things:  We're Sons and Daughters.  We love you.  We'd like to play you a song by Johnny Cash"   Perfect opening.  Franz Ferdinand took the stage after the biggest, meanest looking roadie I've ever seen finished preparing the stage.  If you've never heard their sound I really encourage you to pick up their self-titled and give it a listen.  Strokes without the drunken attitude and just a little bit gayer.  A little bit: Michael, you're the boy with all the leather hips, sticky hair, sticky hips, stubble on my sticky lips. Michael you're the only one I'd ever want, only one I'd ever want, only one I'd ever want. Beautiful boys on a beautiful dancefloor, Michael you're dancing like a beautiful dance whore. Michael waiting on a silver platter now... and nothing matters now. These guys put on a great performance.  Solid, polished and very very clean.  It's been a long time since I've watched a band act as if they enjoy playing their music, and like being on stage.  Their music you want to Russian dance.  There's some very cool 50's and 60's brit-rock influence that bubbles through and, again, they enjoy being there.  It's just something I like to see in a band.  Between them and the 45 year old stoner who passed out and collapsed on the floor behind us, it was a great night.

       CalgaryGrit   Tuesday's English Federal Leader's debate had 3 speaking formats; individual answers, one-on-one debates between leaders, and a free for all.  Good on the CBC for mixing it up and not letting things get too out of hand.  For the one-on-one  urlLink Anna Maria Tremonti  would pick two leaders and set them against each other.   urlLink CalagryGrit  has a pretty funny take on the Layton-Ducceppe pairings.   urlLink Go here  to read it.

       Garbage in the News   Like most healthy, red-blooded, 27 year old guys living in Toronto I search through the online papers and Google news service every day for stories about  urlLink Toronto garbage .  Often it's local content from the red or blue boxes, but every so often our trash gets some international attention or mention in places other then Michigan.  Like "Dallas Forth Worth" which, I am told, is a small island nation located off the coast of Tanzania.  The Star-Telegram (a Dallas Forth Worth daily) recently  urlLink ran a story  about the success of some local private trash haulers who (you can gasp if you'd like) are making a living collecting garbage.  GARBAGE TIME  Local company turns hauling trash into treasure  By J.G. Domke Special to the Star-Telegram  Empty cartons, boxes, wrappers, paper towels, plastic cups. In today's disposable world, the amount of trash thrown out grows by 2 percent each year.  That amounts to more than 5 pounds of trash a day for every man, woman and child in the United States.  It's a problem for many, and an opportunity for a few: those who collect, haul and store the nation's trash account for $45 billion in revenue.  And it's becoming more complicated.  New laws protect the environment from toxic waste, causing 70 percent of landfills to close in the past decade.  Toronto closed its landfill and now exports its trash to Minnesota, which wants the practice stopped. Toronto is working to recycle 100 percent of its trash by 2007. Beg pardon?  I know Dallas Fort Worth is a long way away from our little town here, so we can forgive them for getting the some of the details wrong.  I'm certainly not going to nit-pick but I'd like to set the record straight, should any of the island's inhabitants ever stumble across this page.  Ahem  The City of Toronto exports its trash to Michigan, not Minnesota.  I get them confused too as a result of their similar "Mi" sounds.  Toronto is working to recycle as much of its waste as possible, but we can't technically recycle 100% of our waste.  The portion of waste that can't be recycled will have to be dealt with in "some other fashion" that no one has, of yet, determined.  That little fact is easy to get wrong and to be frank, a lot of our local papers here get it wrong sometimes too.  If we were to recycle 100% of our waste we would be, without question, the coolest, most awesomest city on the planet.  Yeah Lisbon, I said it.  What are you gonna do?  Nothing, that's what.  The goal for 100% waste diversion (our little term for 'not using landfills anymore') is actually 2010.  You can read all about our  urlLink goals here .  The 2010 date is easy to remember because the 100% diversion date has been worked into the Toronto Solid Waste hotline: 416-338-2010.  There you have it.

       Debate   Aren't you supposed to attack the front-runner in a debate?  Why are the loudest voices I'm hearing tonight coming from  urlLink #2  and  urlLink #3  in the polls?  You know,  urlLink the Notwithstanding Clause  is one of the most potentially dangerous, contentious tools that the Canadian Government has in it's drawer.  It provides parliament to overturn a supreme court decision and impose the will of a 3 or 4 year government on the Constitution or the Charter.  Why is Stephen Harper talking about when he will and when he won't use the clause?  I'm really torn here.  I mean, I'd like to know if I'm going to help elect a guy who'll attempt to use the Notwithstanding Clause at the drop of a hat.  I'd like to know the leader's position on using the Clause but if a party is talking about using it at THIS stage of the game and not after a Supreme Court decision or public debate, I'm really afraid of that kind of abuse of power.  Waving the Notwithstanding Clause in front of the Supreme Court and in front of the issue and debate itself, regardless of the issue, is playing a dirty game with the Constitution.  We've got a Supreme Court to interpret and answer questions that Parliament poses to it.  If our new Prime Minister is going to flaunt this Clause to overturn their decisions, then why bother having a Court at all?

       Walking Downtown   Personal music is almost a necessity in a city.  We've all seen the sanctimonious TTC riders who write into the Star and complain about the scary teenager beside them on the subway who plays his headphones too loud.  "It's a violation of my personal rights, and besides, doesn't he know he's damaging his hearing?"  Thanks, but I think what you really mean to say is "I'm not familiar with that music and I don't like it."  The reason that scary teenagers and a growing number of suits, skirts, and assorted converts listen to music everywhere they go (via iPod, mp3 player or Discman), is to drown out the auditory madness that bumpers every step in the downtown core.  The cars, the schizophrenic rantings, the political candidates; it's all too much.  On mass transit in particular, it's a sanity-saving necessity to override the overly loud personal conversations about office politics, fashion and gynecology that weed their way into our heads.  A pleasant side effect of personal music devices is that when music combines with the visual candy that a major city presents, the world suddenly turns into a music video.  Skateborders glide through the air suspended by a guitar chord and landing on the one.  Subways stop at the end of a track and accelerate into the next.  The palsic walking beside you keeps the beat with his stilted gait.  The world starts to gel around the music in your head.  Play it on random.

       It's on.   It's Mills vs. Layton, Red vs. Orange on  urlLink Monday Night Debate  Y'all...  Toronto-Danforth candidates to square off at June 21 debate    Federal NDP leader Jack Layton will be squaring off against MP Dennis Mills (Toronto-Danforth) in the first local all-candidates debate in the federal election June 21.   The debate will take place at the Jimmie Simpson Recreation Centre, 870 Queen St. E. near Logan Avenue starting at 7 p.m. and it's being organized by a consortium of community service organizations working in the south end of the riding.   Pablo Escobar, an outreach worker with the Woodgreen Community Centre, is working to develop an education package for disadvantaged voters living in south Riverdale's estimated 70 rooming houses.   "What we've been doing is organizing an information package handed out door to door - registration and voting information," he said.   "We'll be handing out information on the platforms of the various candidates, and on the all candidates meeting. It will be tailored to vulnerable populations."   Campaign offices for Layton and Mills have both confirmed their candidates will be in attendance.   Also running is Jim Harris of the Green Party, Scott Yee of the Marijuana Party and Marcel Rodden of the Marxist-Leninist party. Well, I'm marking on my calend... Wait.  Pablo Escobar?  It's probably not the same guy.  But if it was, I'm sure he and Scott Yee would have to have some words about their competing products.

       Pure, unadulterated earnestness   I must share this.  Found on  urlLink Something Awful  as a link of the day.  Kigurumi.  Anyone?  Anyone?  A potential definition can be found here:  urlLink  In Japan, there is a form of theatre seen often at malls and parks called Kigurumi. Kigurumi shows usually promote different cartoons that are popular on television, by staging plays featuring the characters. The weird thing is that, rather than just have actors play the roles, they dress from head to toe in full costumes and enclosing masks so that they look "exactly" like  the characters from the TV show.  Kigurumi has a large adult fan-following, and a lot of fans dress up as  Kigurumi on their own. It's even showing up in the states. It sure is.   urlLink Yuri's Kigurmi Paradise .  Yuri is a guy who dresses up as  urlLink anime characters .  Yuri explains: I first found out about kigurumi a little over 4 years ago. This was by finding some sites in Japan through I think the female mask page.   urlLink http://www.maskon.com/marti/station.htm   I was fascinated with the idea of doing masked cosplay. I had done cosplay before, like many others I was not satisfied. Why you ask, well I found most of the male anime characters to have plain uninteresting costumes. I have always thought the girls had the best and cutest outfits. With kigurumi I am able to fully bring to life the anime characters I play.   One misconception is that you must be gay to dress as a girl. This is simply not true. I am certainly not gay.  I am playing a anime character, and like doing any kind of acting it is a lot of work. It is also a lot of fun.

       Whither strategy?   This is getting pretty wild.  Martin called the June 28 election with no plan or strategy in mind?  Do I have that right?  I'm basing that on the fact that David Herle, Liberal campaign co-chair, said of the new Liberal attack ads " urlLink We are desperate ."  Now, I'm no political strategist, but I think "We are desperate" is something that you really shouldn't say during a campaign....or  ever .  Liberal MP Carolyn " urlLink Damn Americans, I hate those bastards " Parrish wandered into the spotlight again yesterday when  urlLink she told us all  that "The [Liberal] campaign has been a comedy of errors. It was like the Keystone Kops running around".  That's quite the damning assertion about her own party's strategy.  I'm not even sure how a comment like that would do anything but help to condemn her own chances at re-election.  Last Friday my girlfriend and I sat down to watch the Great Canadian  urlLink Jorb  Interview on Newsworld.  Paul Martin and Jack Layton were the only Federal party leaders kind enough to show up to the youth sponsored event.  After the event (and after being tipped off by Kinsella's blog), we remained tuned in long enough to see Kinsella as the  urlLink Prince of Darkness .  Thanks to  urlLink Andrew Coyne  for doing the screen captures.  Kinsella was on the show to talk about spin and the art of politics.  He's advised on strategy for a few election campaigns in the past (Federal, Provincial and some Municipal), and has a lot to say about what works and what doesn't in a campaign.  Notably, sending cabinet ministers out in red t-shrits to harass Harper when he campaigned in Toronto a few weeks ago was something that "didn't work".  He talked about spin and how a campaign is framed in the media.  The host asked about the difference between lying and spinning and Kinsella said that you can never outright "lie" because that will come back to haunt you, but if you just phrase something in a way that's beneficial but still letter-of-the-law truthful it's fair game.  I think another famous orator phrased this concept in a much clearer fashion: Jake: You lied to me. Elwood: It wasn't lies, it was just bullshit Kinsella has been kind of critical of the recent Liberal campaign, not only because of it's bits-and-pieces strategy, but because he's not involved in this one.  When his successor David Herle comes public with "We are desperate", you have to wonder if the Martin's strategy of severing all ties with the Chretien-ites was good business.  It's almost reminiscent of the Bush administration's knee-jerk severing of all things (and people) Clinton to try boost themselves up.  It didn't exactly work for them (Tenet, Clarke, et al.), and it should serve as an example of "pick the best person for the job." and not just "the enemy of your enemy".

       Questions to no one   Bloggers tend to watch their stats pages.  Mainly these are our first pages, and more importantly, our first attempts at communicating individual thoughts broadly.  It's vanity media (as  urlLink Ikram Saeed  has told us on many occasions), but gosh-darnit I'm still really interested in finding out how people come to my page.  Google searches are the most popular, and since bloggers are prolific, and write on a variety of subjects, there's lots of text floating out there to clog up the Google engine.  If memory serves, this is partially why Google bought out Blogger last year.  All of that aside (we're getting closer to the funny here), I'm in awe of the variety of questions posed to the various search bars, which end up at my door step.  Like this one, from sometime late last night, posed to the Yahoo search engine:  urlLink how do i tell my wife i wear diapers  I'm one for inflated back-stories, so I imagine a man, drunk at his computer at 1:54 am.  He's clearly got a big secret.  The kind of secret that he can't tell his buddies, can't tell his brother, and can't even tell his bartender.  I figure he's tormented with this secret, because he didn't even use the concept of a search engine properly.  He didn't search "+adult +diapers -fetish +medical +homecare" or "Depends FAQ spouse", he just laid it all out there to the only thing that would listen, but not judge: "how do i tell my wife i wear diapers".  What's not clear, is whether he  likes  wearing diapers and doesn't know how to communicate his fetish to his loving spouse, or whether he's just learned that he has to wear diapers due to incontinence or post-surgery complications.  It's also not clear if he's been wearing diapers for years and has somehow managed to keep this secret from the woman he shares a bed with every night.  All we know is that he's tired of the secrets and lies, and wants to be frank with the woman who wears his ring.  I'm sorry man, I just don't know on this one.  But I hope you find your answer.  She'll still love you man, she'll still love you.

       My spidey sense is tingling   There's something besides smog in the air this morning.  I haven't been downstairs since I got in this morning but...there's a CFRB live remote van parked out front...  The chairs are being arranged in neat rows in front of the Nathan Phillips Square bandshell.  Tables, sturdy enough to support information pamphlets, have been lined up and adorned with blue bunting.  There's booths, and promotional tents being erected...  I think it might be  urlLink Old People Day  at City Hall again.  I'll check back in after lunch.   Update:  No old people per se, but definitely an old people friendly event.  Also a CFRB friendly event...  The banner above the bandshell in the square read "First Annual Crime Free Day".  Ok so...  Was it?    I mean if I get shoved on the TTC on the ride home tonight what then?  If a crime is committed today do we have to re-do the day until we get it right, like Groundhog Day?

       Street Furniture    urlLink These things  are going to look very cool.  They won't work in every location, but they'll work in enough locations to raise the issue.  According to the article: The new bins will be laden both with trash and high expectations. These novel contraptions will resemble large, broad slabs, standing well over two metres high and will be decked out with various compartments, advertising, perhaps even electronic tourist information. "It's a well-disguised garbage bin, which is a good thing as long as people know what it's for," says Toronto works committee chairwoman Jane Pitfield (Don Valley East).  Later this month, the committee will get its first glimpse of the proposed redesign, intended to succeed those unloved and much-abused OMG Media boxes that have sprouted on sidewalks across Toronto over the past five years. Yeah, "much abused".  Besides becoming impromptu billboards for every poster-plaster kid in the city, they've been clipped with snowplow blades, pried open by people looking for food, smacked into by unsuspecting cyclists (when the doors have been left open) and, like all garbage bins, been set on fire.  Hell I've had to call 911 myself to put one out. In the curious lingo of waste management, works officials want this model to "capture" wads of gum and cigarette butts by providing special receptacles for each. There will be rubberized flaps instead of stainless steel ones, making it easier for pedestrians to shove refuse into the maw of the container without touching its disgusting surface -- a perennial complaint with the first generation of OMG bins.  Instead of three holes, there will be two: one for run-of-the-mill garbage and a second for recyclables. But Angelos Bacopoulos, the city's general manager of waste management, says the bins can accommodate a third hole for "organics" -- banana peels, half-eaten sandwiches, etc.  (Open-mouth garbage cans are going the way of the dodo because they attract insects, fill with water and invite the illicit dumping of large bags of junk.) Toronto was the first city in the world to offer its residents street-side garbage cans with recycling features. The attempt to equip this latest model with an organic option -- consistent with the thrust of household waste policy -- keeps the municipality on the cutting edge of urban trash. Hear that?  There's a reason for all of these 3 compartment bins out there.  Offering recycling in a public space isn't just to make us all feel fuzzy and granola, it's so we can get  MONEY .   urlLink Lots of money  in fact.  Some of which we've already got (ahem...saw the cheque with my own two peepers).  This past week Stewardship Ontario made good on their side of the bargain and sent the first cheque as part of the WDO agreement.  Manufacturers and First importers of products which end up in the municipal recycling stream ("blue box" and "gray box" in non-curious waste management lingo) have agreed to pay a portion of the costs of municipal recycling.  The litter connection to all of this is that the recycling that we do on the street (i.e., those 3 compartment silver bins you see everywhere) counts towards the tonnages that we get money for.  The more recycling we can show, the more money we get.  Money is good, so keep up the good recycling work, yo.

       Young People and Voting    urlLink Rachel Sa  wrote a  urlLink column in the Sun  yesterday on a popular topic these days... "Lazy and ignorant: Why youth don't vote".  From the column: I would like to defend my generation. I would like to think so few of us vote because we are frustrated with the election process. That our first-past-the-post electoral system, which distorts voter preference, rewards the large parties and punishes the small, turns us off voting.   But that argument assumes that young people know enough about our electoral system to actually be frustrated by it. I doubt many do. That's a problem that goes beyond the 20-something set. Sadly, plenty of people out there don't even know the different levels of government we have or which one it is we're electing on June 28.   No, I can't defend my generation on this one. We're not showing our discontent by refusing to vote. There's nothing political about it. If you're not going to vote, not even a protest vote to a fringe party, or a strategic vote against a candidate rather than for a candidate, then you're lazy.   You're not hip or cool, or angry or disenfranchised. You're just lazy. And by sitting on your butt, you justify the actions of the political parties you complain ignore you. Can't argue there.  Not voting comes from the same Avril Levigne school of being-pissed-off-for-no-reason-at-all logic.  Flipping a middle finger to the Moms and Dads and SUVs and phoneys of the world is great and all, but when you don't have a point for doing it you're kind of a phony yourself?  You're all angry and depressed, or pissed off at the Man, or...wait...where ever could we have learned this romanticized view of societal rejection...?   urlLink Hmm.    urlLink Hmm.    urlLink Hmm.    urlLink Hmm.   The boomers respond to Sa's column in the red box today: RE RACHEL Sa's commentary, "Why youth don't vote" (June 3): Ah, yes, now we have the "young" as victims of politicians who lie and obfuscate, thereby giving them a right not to vote.   We must "encourage" them to get interested -- gently, of course. Please. This is just another result of a generation brought up being "reasoned with" as toddlers having tantrums, "time outs" for bad behaviour and "inclusion" in adult conversations.   Many, many young men and women died to give you your supercilious attitudes.   It isn't your "right" to vote -- it is your duty. Fail to do it and your children may not have the opportunity. Get informed. Stop whining. Vote.   N. Paul   Beeton Right, because the only way to ensure that people vote when they're older is to beat the shit out of them when they're kids.  Wait...."N" from Beeton....  This isn't  urlLink Nancy  is it?  Dammit, I'm gonna take the bus up to Beeton and vote right there on her lawn just to piss her off.  "N"'s final point is valid though.  Voting is a duty, as is being remotely engaged in the political process.  Being an expert on the subtle differences between which party's version of health care spending will have a greater impact on the Provinces, is not.  Look.  Old people vote on one or two issues (Fiberals, Gun registry, Insurance promises, Taxes) so why shouldn't we be granted the same liberty?  Pick your issue and start small.  Environment?  US Relations?  Unemployment?  Then take a look a the party platforms.  Which party falls more in line with what you want to happen?  Now pick another issue...  Does that same party offer something you want?  I've got to get back to the job that I'm apparently too lazy to have, hold, or find, so we'll do more on this later.  I'll leave you with one more jackass from the Sun: RE RACHEL Sa's commentary on why the younger generation doesn't vote (June 3): She has the answer right there in her article but only vaguely identifies it. The real reason why Canadians from 18 to as old as 35 don't vote is because too many of them still live at home with mom and dad. Property taxes on the rise? Doesn't affect me, mom and dad pay! Car insurance and the cost of gas increasing? Doesn't affect me, mom and dad pay! The list goes on. If anyone is responsible for today's governing disasters, blame the boomer generation for allowing their children to slack off! Cut the apron strings, and do us voting taxpayers a favour!   Chris Varadinek   Toronto   (Today, those apron strings are made of elastic) Hey Avril, if you want to flip someone off, flip off Chris Varadinek from Toronto.  He actually deserves it.

       Boy Collapses at Spelling Bee, Nails Word   These kids are too smart/dramatic for their own good.  I've yet to see "Spellbound" but I have watched more then a few riveting hours of coverage of the National Spelling Bee finals on TSN.  My parents spent an afternoon wondering exactly what kind of children they raised as my brother and I watched the repeat of the finals, at home last Christmas.  Also, I love it when  urlLink the AP reads  like  urlLink The Onion . WASHINGTON - The National Spelling Bee took a scary turn Thursday when a 13-year-old Colorado boy appeared to faint and collapsed on stage, drawing gasps from an audience packed in for the finals. Akshay Buddiga gathered himself after a few seconds, stood up and, to the amazement of the judges, immediately started spelling his word: "alopecoid."   He got it perfectly, drawing a standing ovation. Akshay went back to his chair, looking uncomfortable, when a Bee employee came to escort him off stage. He received medical help and was expected to return. For the record: Alopecoid.  A-L-O-P-E-C-O-I-D.   urlLink Alopecoid .

       Buy a vote on eBay   No, this ain't me.  Could we check if this is legal please?  A vote in the June 28 election is up for  urlLink grabs on eBay : I respect democracy but I am protesting the $1.75 "poll" tax that the politicians in Canada are collecting when I vote in this upcoming election.    They have stolen enough money from taxpayers and I am asking that they pay me $1.50 minimum for my vote.  They collect $1.75 so both parties benefit.  If you send me a cheque I will vote for your political party in my riding.  The Bloc Quebecois are disqualified because they are not running a candidate in my riding.  My riding according to Elections Canada (www.election.ca) is the following: Toronto Centre. The seller says that proceeds go to charity.

       The Believer   ( urlLink The Magazine  published by  urlLink McSweeneys  every month).  This month is the " urlLink Music Issue " and either the free CD included this month or the growing popularity of this periodical meant that I had my choice between only two remaining copies on the shelf, as opposed to the 30 or so that I usually find.  I'm glad I got it in time...  Track 15 of the free CD...  " urlLink On to you " by the  urlLink Constantines .  Seems all my favourite things are converging.  Boy howdy I like being a white male aged 18-49.  The liner notes for the Believer CD, Track 15 are as follows:  15.  The Constantines - "On to You"   From the Sub Pop album  Shine a Light  2003 Sub Pop Records   Summary : This song is everything you've ever loved about a rock record happening all at once - all your favourite bands striking the same note repeatedly, everything on ten, rocking your ass off, literally, again and again, forever.  Reason: Constantines Singer Resembles Mike Reno of Loverboy: Canada  See...I would have said "Bruce Springstein" but what the hell do I know.  Also, the drummer kicks all kinds of ass.

       Some memory hole work   Richard Perle is a former head of the US defense policy board, former member of the " urlLink Project for the New American Century ", and general neo-con extraordinaire was interviewed last week on the BBC: Perle: I understand the obsession in the United Kingdom with weapons of mass destruction.  Interviewer: You say "obsession with weapons of mass destruction in the United Kingdom".  Wasn't that the reason we went to war?  Perle: I..I happen to believe that the liberation of 25 million Iraqis from the one of the most brutal and sadistic regimes in modern times was a very good reason for removing Saddam Hussein.  Interviewer: But that wasn't the reason we were given, was it?  Perle: Well it was among the reasons that were given.  It was actually a more prominent reason in this country then in the United Kingdom.  urlLink Richard Perle  pre-invasion of Iraq: Preemption  "Let me say a word about what you call the new strategy of preemption. There's nothing new about preemption. If you know that you are about to be attacked, it is certainly sensible if you can act first and avoid that attack to do so. I don't think anybody would dispute that. So then the question is how imminent must the attack be to justify the preemptive response. Here, we need to think more carefully about the concept of imminence. In 1981, the Israelis, after a long and, I gather, a heated cabinet debate, decided to destroy the reactor that Chirac had sent to Osirak, not because it was about to produce nuclear weapons. It wasn't. It was about to produce plutonium and it was under IAEA safeguards so the Iraqis would have had to siphon off small, undetectable quantities of plutonium and it would have taken them time to build a nuclear weapon based on what they would get from the Osirak reactor. But, nevertheless, the Israelis decided to strike some years in advance of the production of the nuclear weapon that they were concerned about.  "Now, why did they do that? They did it because the Iraqis were about to load fuel into the reactor and once they did so, they would not have had an opportunity to use an air strike without doing a lot of unintended damage around the facility, because radioactive material would have been released into the atmosphere. So from an Israeli point of view, what was imminent and what had to be acted against in a preemptive manner was not the ultimate emergence of the threat but an event that would lead inexorably to the ultimate emergence of the threat. They had to deal with a threshold that once crossed, they would no longer have the military option that could be effective at that moment. If we think of imminence in that sense, if we think of it as the thresholds that once crossed will so worsen our situation that we can't allow those thresholds to be crossed, then you start looking at how far are they from achieving the means to do the thing that everyone would recognize we were justified in stopping at the moment that action was taken.   In the case of Iraq, we're talking about stopping the further development of nuclear weapons, we're talking about new systems of delivery for the chemical and biological weapons Saddam already has, including systems with much longer range. What is imminent about Iraq and what may be imminent in some other situations requires you to look back and decide when a threat becomes unmanageable  ."  urlLink Further  from February 12 on PBS NewsHour: Perle: But let's just agree that Saddam has had those weapons and he is perfectly capable of transferring them to al-Qaida.  Perle: You know, crown jewels were the jewels in the crown, and you don't give them away because you're giving the crown away, but Saddam has lots of crown jewels, plenty for himself and to distribute to others if he chooses to do so. And the only point I want to make is that as long as Saddam is there, with everything we know about Saddam, as long as he possesses the weapons that we know he possesses, there is a threat, and I believe it's imminent because he could choose at any time to take an action we all very much hope he won't take. Don't you go to hell for this stuff?  Got much of this from  urlLink Le Show  this week.  To listen to the Perle section of the show  urlLink click here  (Real Audio).

       Photography   I'm one of those guys who carries a digital camera around with me all the time.  Problem is that I've not been savvy/engaged enough to figure out how to share my snaps with y'all.  Lucky for us, Dennis Mills' campaign/non-campaign signs provided the impetus for me to find a photo hosting site.  As such I've got hundreds of pictures just begging to be shown off to friends and serendipitous Google-searchers alike.  The following two offerings clear up a bit of unfinished business.  This is the infamous Coffee Time at the corner of Nightmare Ave. and BadTouch St. where I saw the  urlLink midnight clown .  Please note that I only had the balls to make a return visit during the day when all the scary clowns are asleep.     Scary huh?  And this is a picture of the best sandwich I ever ate.

       Woman arrested for eating a candy bar   From  urlLink the story : WASHINGTON - A government scientist finishing a candy bar on her way into a subway station where eating is prohibited was arrested, handcuffed and detained for three hours by transit police.  Stephanie Willett said she was eating a PayDay bar on an escalator descending into a station July 16 when an officer warned her to finish it before entering the station. Both Willett and police agree that she nodded and put the last bit into her mouth before throwing the wrapper into a trash can.  ...  "If she had stopped eating, it would have been the end of it and if she had just stopped for the issuance of a citation, she never would have been locked up," Transit Police Chief Polly Hanson said Thursday.  Metrorail has been criticized in the past for heavy-handed enforcement of the eating ban. In 2000, a police officer handcuffed a 12-year-old girl for eating a french fry on a subway platform. Hey, that's the law right?  And laws are made for a reason, right?  This isn't a terrorism piece, but I'm sure that it's connected to the general insanity of arresting someone for eating in a city's subway system.  Let's look at this from a "This City Needs to Get Tough on Litterers" angle.  The ultra-clean city of Singapore got it's spanky reputation by enforcing littering laws in a similar manner to what's mentioned in this story.  Hefty fines for little annoyances makes those little annoyances go away, right?  I mean, this woman will think twice before she eats another PayDay in the Washinton subway system...  Probably not.  She might expose the lunacy of the law which lead to her arrest.  She might sue the transit police for exceeding their authority and needlessly detaining her for three hours based on a chocolate fix, a snarky comment and a brisk walk away from a transit cop.  She might do what people in a free-er society (Washington DC. vs. Singapore let's say) would do, and explain how the law doesn't apply in her situation.  She'd probably win too, because I doubt that any reasonable system would equate "eating in the subway" or even "being an ass about it" with "being detained for three hours".  Let's ride the subway back up to our town here.  Listen carefully during the spring litter whining season around here, or to those who cry that "more bylaw officers" are the best way to curb the litter problem in this city.  Is this really what we want?    The Washington transit system implemented their "no eating" policy for a reason, and they've chosen to enforce it with a heavy hand, again, for a reason.  Whether it be for cleanliness of the system, accident avoidance, or national security, they've chosen to enforce this "little law".  I'd look forward to a slate of stories just like this one if our City ever decides to start "cracking down" on litter. TORONTO - A 78 year old grandmother was handcuffed to a park bench for an hour in the hot sun yesterday, while bylaw officers waited for police to arrive.    "We told her to pick up her coffee cup and she told us that she's been paying taxes for 50 years, and that she has a bad back." said SWM bylaw officer Kent Walker.  "We have these laws for a reason and this woman was witnessed committing an offence by myself and my partner, we're only doing our job".  The woman's family is outraged at City officials.  Her daughter demanded an explaination from the Mayor.  "The real litter problem in this city comes from those punk teenagers over at the highschools, and hanging out in front of the convenience stores.  Why don't you go arrest them and stop picking on little old ladies!?" Yeah, I don't think the Onion will be calling anytime soon either.

       A cartoon cat   From the letters to the red box this morning: I WISH to send my condolences to Lennie Peterson, creator of the comic strip The Big Picture, in the death of Ginger (July 23). She was a fine feline member of the comics page of the Sun and other publications. The Big Picture is a strip that will live through the ages as it is truly about life! God bless Ginger. Note: I too lost my cat of 19 years this past spring.   Doug Bauder   Bancroft   (Garfield misses her too) I can't tell for sure but I think this is the comic strip where the cat  urlLink actually croaks .  Like right there, in the last frame, just after the cat crawls into the artist's arms for the last time, right there while he's looking down at it's head buried in the crook of his elbow....Yeah, that's it.  That's it's last gasp of breath finally gurgling out of it's little feline throat.  Kind of gets you right here doesn't it?   urlLink And the healing process .   urlLink And the healing process .  (Same exact strip, except he drew the disembodied head of his mother and dead cat floating Mufasa-like in the sky behind him).   urlLink And more .  Yup, that fuckin' cat is still dead.   urlLink And more .   urlLink And more .   urlLink And more .   urlLink And more .  You can see pictures of the late cat  urlLink here .  Luckily blogs aren't the only painfully self indulgant form of mass expression.

       Deep Throat....?   Fred LaRue, former special assistant to Nixon's attorney general John Mitchell,  urlLink died yesterday .  LaRue was one of the prime candidates for the true identity of Bob Woodward's Watergate source "Deep Throat".  If I'm not mistaken, the chief evidence points to the fact that Deep Throat gave details about a meeting at which only Nixon, Mitchell and LaRue were present.  As the legend goes, there's only 4 people who know the true identity of Deep Throat: Bob Woodward, Carl Burnstein, former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee and, of course, Deep Throat himself.  Woodstein have said that the only time the will reveal their source is when Deep Throat dies, or reveals his identity himself.  The only clues they've given is that Deep Throat is still alive (i.e., they haven't revealed his name yet) and that Deep Throat is a single person, not a composite of sources, as Fred LaRue once suggested.  If LaRue was indeed the infamous Deep Throat, we should expect an announcement from Bob Woodward and Carl Burnstein within the next couple of days, but if not, it's just another one off the list.  Me?  My money is on former Nixon staffer Patrick J. Buchanan who  appeared  completely loyal to Nixon right through the entire scandal and was quoted by Woodward as  urlLink saying :  "The Watergate's all you had. Some Cubans going in to look at Larry O'Brien's mail. ... You blew it out of all proportion." After Williams replied that they had won the 1972 election in a "dirty" manner, Buchanan answered "A little spying, Ed. That's politics." Sure Pat.  I know your righteous Christian conscious got the better of you back in '72, and you had to spill your guts to somebody about all the naughty things you saw the bad men doing.  Now all we have to do is wait for Pat Buchanan to die and we're all set.  To learn more about the Watergate scandal, visit your local library.  Or just click  urlLink here .

       The Sun Gets it Wrong Again   You know I really wonder about the Sun sometimes.  Here's a story in  urlLink today's paper :  Baring all for Canada  FOREIGN STRIPPERS MUST SUPPLY NUDE STAGE PHOTOS TO OFFICIALS  IMMIGRATION OFFICERS are having to pore through naked pictures of hundreds of exotic dancers to keep impostors out of Canada. Foreign strippers planning to table dance in clubs here must now provide photos of themselves with no clothes on to qualify for a visa for Canada, immigration officials say.   "Stage photos during performances are required," said Sergio Mercado, of the Canadian Embassy in Mexico.   In a memo to fellow visa officers around the world, Mercado said if a dancer passes the no-clothes test, they may then require a police certificate or medical examination.   The memo was obtained from access to information documents obtained by the Sun.   The potential dancers have to prove they can dance in the nude, immigration lawyer Mendel Green said yesterday.   "They can't be partially nude," he said. "If they don't have pictures in the nude, they are not going to wiggle their bottoms in Canada."   Immigration lawyer Richard Kurland said the women have to show nude pictures to ensure they're not abusing the system.   When it comes to Russia, the visa officers are looking for "headline performers" who can be paid up to $5,000 weekly and are often featured in ads of which they are expected to have copies.   Officers at the Canadian Embassy in Moscow said most headliners have been subject of photo spreads after vying for "Miss Nude North America or Miss Nude Europe" contests.   Immigration officer Dorothy Christie said once dancers arrive here they are usually placed in strip club lodgings and paid $60 every time they're on stage, $10 for a lapdance and $20 for a VIP room lapdance.   Each week the women must pay $100 to an agent and $50 for a driver as well as $10 nightly to a DJ, the officer said. There they go again.  They always going for the sensational story.  They're always going for the sensational spin.    I mean, if a dog is run over by a car on Jarvis, the Sun will probably interview the two prostitutes who watched it happen from the sidewalk.  If it's a toss up between a spelling bee and a park flasher, they'll cover the pervert every time.  Jesus guys...  I mean we ALL have to supply a nude photo when applying for a job in Ontario; not  just  the strippers.  It's a part of regular human resources policy, and a reality of finding work in this day and age.  Hell I couldn't even join the union until I supplied at least a 10 shot portfolio to the proper officials.  But there's the Sun, always covering the "stripper" or "bikini" end of things just so they can make another 50 cents.  Lowest common denominator I tell you.    They should be ashamed.

       It's better then slander.  It's better then lies.   When Lulu's (formerlly home to the world's longest bar) shut down in Kitchener a few years back I really felt bad for Kim Mitchell.  Every time I passed by the place, his name was somewhere on the "Comming Soon" marquee.  Well, him and April Wine, anyway.  The Mighty Q (and CanCon requirements) has always been Toronto's source for mucho Mitchell, and now we can listen to him promote contests and introduce songs, drivetime weekdays 2 til 7.  From  urlLink the Star : Mitchell was in the studio as morning host John Derringer announced the news and he told listeners he's excited about the possibilities. He'll be heard weekdays between 2 p.m. and 7 live from the studio at the Hard Rock Café, by Dundas Square. The station plans to celebrate his arrival with a special edition of their monthly "Breakfast With Derringer" live broadcast on Aug. 27.  "I'm looking forward to bringing my experience as a musician, artist and entertainer to the microphone at Q107," Mitchell says on the station's website. "I am rocked and ready, let's go!" As are we Kim.  Hopefully Kim will be with us here in Toronto until he's finally headlining at that gig in the sky.

       A triumphant return   Not me,  urlLink him .  While lazing about and reading this past week, I got reaquainted with an old friend named CBC radio.  They've been doing some  urlLink test marketing  this summer, and one of their weekend offerings is  urlLink Sunny Day's and Nights .  Sunny Day's,  urlLink CBNR 's long running show, was formerly hosted by the "still-at-large" Frank "Sunny" Day, and is currently being manned by the legendary Paul Moth during Frank's sudden and, if the RCMP gets their druthers, permament absence.  I was a huge fan of Paul Moth's broadcasts when the CBC picked up "The Great Eastern" from the BCN (Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland) back in 94'-'99.  Hell, I even won a contest by suggesting a tattoo that Moth later had misspelled on his arm:  urlLink Thinks To Do .  Memories.  I still have the T-shirt.  Like yours truly, and every other 14 year old girl on this planet,  urlLink Paul Moth has a blog .  A companion to the show and to the legend that is his life.  Paul and his technician Julie Secord will be gracing us with a visit to Toronto on next week's show.  Please make them feel welcome.   Instant Update   Unbe-frickin'-lievable.  The webmaster of the old Great Eastern site has kept the  urlLink history alive .  Full Episodes.   urlLink History .  And the  urlLink last word .  I think I wore out that email address at the bottom, passionately requesting the show's resurection.

       Ok, we're all packed and ready to go.   Your father and I are trusting you to be good while we're away.  You can have some friends over but no parties, and no drinking, OK?  We both love you very much, but we want you to be responsible.  We're trusting you, OK?  You have Mrs. Walker's phone number, and she'll be checking in on you while we're gone.  Make sure you water the plants and take the garbage out on Wednesday morning.  Don't forget.  The hotel phone number and our room number are on the sheet on the fridge, but only call if it's really important.  Be good.  We'll see you in a week.

       Fox and the Navigator    There's a  urlLink comment piece  in the globe today from Rudyard Griffiths of the Dominion Institute. He's referring to a poll conducted by Navigator a few weeks back which included, among other things, a section about how young Canadians describe the US. The results showed that 40% of those polled would describe America as an "evil" influence in the world.   From the  urlLink Citizen's  take on the poll:  In a telephone poll of 500 teens aged 14 to 18, more than 40 per cent of respondents saw the U.S. as an evil global force. Among French-Canadians, that number jumped to 64 per cent.   Ontario proved the most conflicted on the issue; there, nearly one-fifth of youth were on the fence.   "Teens have taken (Ronald) Reagan's concept of the Soviet Union as an evil empire and turned it back on the U.S.," says Rudyard Griffiths, director of the Dominion Institute.   "Clearly, the anti-American sentiment isn't just something coming from 30-somethings or even 20-somethings." Jump ahead a few weeks and a few kilometers south to Fox News and Bill O'Reilly. Griffiths describes the infamous Fox commentator's reaction to our America-hating youth:  I suspect [O'Reilly's] producers have Google news alerts set up with the key words "Canada," "socialism," "draft dodgers" and "anti-Americanism." On his show, Mr. O'Reilly used the single survey statistic to let loose on Canada's political leaders, the media and our "ignorant teens." One of his choicer utterances included: "The truth is that the USA has freed more human beings in 230 years than the rest of the world combined. France has freed almost no one. Ditto Canada. . . . I object to the anti-American foreign press and bums like Chirac in France and Chrétien in Canada."   Sorry, but didn't our Governor-General and President George W. Bush just commemorate the 60th anniversary of D-Day together in France? Last time I looked, we fought alongside the Americans in Korea, during the long grind of the Cold War and served with distinction in Bosnia and Afghanistan. And by the way, we have had a new Prime Minister for seven months and his name is Paul Martin. There's a lot of reasons to dislike America's foreign policy these days, and honestly, that's about the only thing that we Canadians are really allowed to comment on with any seriousness. It's easy for us to fall into the trap of criticizing the State's domestic policy (e.g., same-sex marriage ban, cutting Veteren's benefits, the declining quality of their school system, seemingly institutionalized racism, etc.) but really we have no business there. It's not our country and if they want to live like that then it's their right. Right?   But when it comes to foreign policy; when it comes to how America, the biggest, toughest kid on the block, behaves in the school yard, then yes, we can comment. We can have opinions and we can voice them. We can dissent without fear of being labeled un-patriotic or un-American; a luxury that our American friends don't seem to have these days.   In fact, It's been argued that being "un-American" is about the only thing that Canadians agree that we  are  as a nation. Our ever changing, ever searching self-identity is first and foremost Not-American. What does it mean to be Canadian? "Well, it means that we are... We are all very... Maple syrup and um... The French are in there too... Well we're not American, that's for darn sure."   Griffiths continues on Fox:  Three days after our poll appeared in the Drudge Report, I got the opportunity to go on Fox News to try to do some damage control. It was an interesting lesson in talking to the prickly and standoffish America that Fox News proudly champions. The show was aptly named Heartland, and its host was the combative former Republican congressman John Kasich.   Right from Mr. Kasich's first question as to whether Vietnam draft dodgers had taken over our education system, I knew I was in for an uphill struggle. I tried to explain that Canadian teens were no different than American teens. They wear Nike shoes, listen to U.S. popular music and most likely know as much about U.S. history as their own. My conciliatory tone didn't satisfy the former congressman. What about the press? Is the same liberal media cabal that banned Fox News from Canadian airwaves responsible for our teens' anti-Americanism? My five minutes flew by and I felt I was failing miserably to counteract the stereotype that all Canadians are Yankee-haters. Have Vietnam draft-dodgers have taken over your educational system? That was really a question? Wow.   The  urlLink Heartland website  contains only this line:  Does a good amount of Canada's youth think the U.S. is evil? Don't miss this! But since we can't watch Fox news up here, I guess we'll have to wait for the transcript...   Wait..."Does a good amount of Canada's youth think the U.S. is evil?" Could we get one of those draft-dodging english teachers to take a look at that sentence please?   Thanks.

       My Spidey-sense is tingling. As are the tips of my fingers.    New York bans the distribution of mercury batteries in toys and novelties because of the likelihood that those items are improperly disposed of (i.e. in a landfill).  From the  urlLink Star this morning :  Caught in a web of criticism over a Spider-Man toy found in cereal boxes, Kellogg Co. announced yesterday it will never again use mercury batteries in its promotions.  ..  Kellogg's spokesperson Celeste Clark said that while the toy meets federal safety standards "and has no effect on the quality or safety of the food, we are taking this action to go beyond what is required by law to address an issue important to our consumers and the environment."   Battle Creek, Mich.-based Kellogg's put the toys into boxes of many of its sugared cereals, separated from the cereal in a plastic pouch. The toys project a spider, a web or a rendering of the villainous Dr. Octopus on to a wall. The boxes also advertised a separate mail-in promotion on the front panel for a Spider-Man wristwatch toy. Anyone selling theirs on eBay?  Because those do sound pretty cool. If I get one I'll promise to dispose of the battery properly.   I suppose we're a far cry from the sugar-cereal of our fathers, where die-cast soldiers and cars made of lead were dropped into specially marked packages.   Mmm...Debilitating.

       And then?  My office blew up.   Now..I'm not usually one for zombie movies, but there was one that was following me around the city a few months back.  A movie, that is, not a zombie.  There were some scenes shot here at work last fall, and along the Danforth where I live.  The production closed the viaduct bridge for a few nights, and I went out to be a lookie-loo with the rest of my neighbours.  There were helicopters, there were black SUVs there were explosions, there was some guy in a wheelchair, and there was Milla Jovovich.  It's all here in  urlLink this pamphlet .  Well I just saw the trailer for the upcoming  urlLink Resident Evil: Apocalypse , and boy howdy do I ever love watching my work explode over and over.  Rockets shoot through the sky, helicopters congregate in the square, the Nemesis wanders around town with a great big gun and shit blows up real good.

       W Ketchup   My brother sent me  urlLink this one , and I'm sure it's making the rounds out there.  From the  urlLink FAQs : What does the "W" stand for?  The "W" stands for "Washington" Oh I get it....  ...Because if you use Heinz Ketchup you're supporting John Kerry's wife's trust-fund or something?  Well that's just un-American.  Not like W Ketchup though... What percent of W Ketchup is made in America?  100%. Every ingredient is American. Yeah, but the bottles are probably made by child labour in Taiwan...Heh heh heh... 100% American? What about your bottles?  Yes, every bottle is made in America, every label is printed in America, and every step of the manufacturing process takes place in America. Oooohhh!!!  Damn you W Ketchup! Is there no path around your carefully erected logical barriers?   But wait...  I thought Heinz was an  urlLink American success story , building their empire through successful and honest American business practices, coupled with hard work and stick-to-it-iveness: The first product was horseradish, and the glass of its bottle was clear. There was a reason: while competitors extended their horseradish with fillers, concealed from view in green glass jars, Founder Henry John Heinz took his stand on quality and proudly displayed his product in transparent bottles. See? No leaves, no wood fiber, no turnip filler. Can W Ketchup say that  they  don't have turnip filler? What are the ingredients? W Ketchup contains: Tomato Concentrate (Water and Tomato Paste), High Fructose Corn Syrup, Corn Syrup, Vinegar, Salt, Dehydrated Onion, Spice and Natural Flavoring. Aaarrggghhhh!!!!  Curses, I've been foiled once again by W Ketchup, with its relentless pursuit of truth and freedom!  You've anticipated my every criticism, and bested me in a match of wits.  I tip my hat to you, W Ketchup, and declare you "America's Ketchup" or "Liberty Ketchup" or whatever works best for you.  The message is clear, American's want a choice in Ketchup.  When the Ketchup that Americans have always used, turns out to be manufactured by a company owned by the wife of a presidential candidate, it becomes sour and inedible.  Heinz Ketchup has betrayed America, and as such W Ketchup must rise to defend freedom.  And priced modestly at $3.00 a bottle (minimum 4 bottle purchase, plus shipping), it will soon become the Ketchup that REAL Americans are willing to wait for, and then go and pick up at the post office.

       Hey!  Why is my pay so low?   On my pay stub this week: BEGINNING JULY 1, THE NEW ONTARIO HEALTH PREMIUM IS BEING DEDUCTED FROM YOUR PAY.  IT IS INCLUDED IN THE TAX DEDUCTION AND IS BASED ON YOUR TAXABLE INCOME. Best..uh.."Amount-based-on-my-taxable-income" I ever spent.  You know something?  The health premium that I'm paying is about half of what I pay for union dues every two weeks.  So basically I'm a heath care premium, plus a double health care premium to have someone sit and write a letter to Dalton McGuinty to complain about the new health care premiums.  It got me thinking: I spent 2 health care premiums on dinner and beer the other night.  I spent almost 8 health care premiums a month on digital cable and internet.  I paid just over one health care premium on a magazine subscription to Toronto Life last year.  I hear companionship is going for around 5 or 6 health care premiums on Jarvis St. Yeah yeah, but he said he wouldn't raise taxes.  He broke his promise he broke....FIBERALS!!!!  He's a PHONY!!!  A BIG FAT PHONY!!!!!!  Tell you what.  I'll pay my health care premium without complaining, just as long as everyone who uses or makes money off the system pays into it too.

       Roger Moore's Son Next Bond?   That was one of the  urlLink stories  on  urlLink Borque  this morning.  I think that's great.  I mean, you get the tradition of an established, successful Bond, who can really carry the role forward.  I've never seen this guy "act" exactly, in the traditional sense.  I mean, he's got his little stunts and street performances, but he's probably been studying acting or something between his other films.  I'm not sure how I'm going to feel about a really politicized Bond movie though.  Maybe Bush will be the super villain and, I guess, Susan Sarandon will be the Bond Girl?  She might not be as hot as Shirley Eaton or Jill St. John, but she's got a sassy down-to-earth honesty and charm that will really bring something to the role.  I'm sure she'll balance with this new Bond, while they fight to discredit Tony Blair's assertions that Iraq tried to buy yellow cake from Niger.  I just can't imagine the two of them in bed though.  I hope they'll cut that part out.  Damn, I just don't know how he's going to fit into that Aston Martin.  I think they'll have to have one specially made.  I've paid for all the other ones so I'm going to pay to see this one too.  Maybe I'll bring a book or something.

       Shades of Green   I keep my eyes to the ground out of force of habit.  Normally I'm looking for examples of garbage and other things that make their way onto the sidewalks and gutters of our little burg.  A pile of cigarette butts in the middle of Dundas St clearly emptied in while someone was waiting at a red light, a raw pork shoulder gathering flys by the curb on Elizabeth, a pair of chopsticks across a storm sewer grate with no restaurant in sight....  It's pretty interesting stuff, this crap that doesn't interest us anymore.  I was around Yonge and Dundas when I first noticed the shades of green.  At the North West corner of the square (kitty corner to the Gap) there are adjacent sections of the concrete sidewalk which have been painted two shades of green.  One is a light, lime green and the other is a darker blue-green...like a teal I guess.  The really strange thing is that the concrete is painted with an eye to detail.  Only the two sections of the sidewalk are painted, and one colour doesn't bleed over into the other.  Initially I thought the painting might have been left over from an event in the square until I noticed two concrete barriers, side by side, painted the exact same shades of green, on the south side of Dundas, just west of the Eaton Centre parking garage.  If you want to check them out, you'd better hurry, because hoarding is already going up along that stretch of Dundas for the garage construction.  It must be a pattern right?  I mean the two examples of this are 1/2 a block away from each other.  A statement?  A path to follow?  If you put your left foot on one shade and right foot on the other, which way do you face?  What if your feet are reversed?  Well it sure seems like a pattern.  There is a 3rd example of the side-by-side green concrete close to where I work.  There's a concrete path which leads from Nathan Phillip Square to the side of Osgoode Hall.  If you start at the statue of Winston Churchill and walk north across the grass, you'll almost walk right across them.  Once again, the same colours, on adjacent concrete sections of sidewalk, painted with care.  I've only noticed the 3 examples of the green, and I'm looking for more.  Check them out and let me know if you've seen other seemingly random sidewalk paintings.  Not the growing trend of painted sidewalk advertising from Monster.ca and Much Music (which seems to be drawing significantly less public ire then another  urlLink infamous proposal  for public space advertising), but more of the green-on-green sidewalk paintings.  Oh and the trees and flowers are beautiful I'm sure, but they're more for the tourists...  Me?  I like concrete.   Oh, and just one more thing Ma'am : Yeah, I've noticed the colours of this page, and while similar they aren't the same as the pretty concrete.  No it's not me doing the painting.  I was never a stay-inside-the-lines kind of kid, and doubt I could pull off such an artistic job...without the use of masking tape and a crew from one of those design shows, anyway.

       Let me tell you a little story   It's about this place, here, where I work every day.  It's lunchtime now, so I've got a few minutes to share a frustration with no one in particular.  It's 1:30 now, and I haven't had any access to my email since I got here this morning. Your post office is unavailable. Please contact your system administrator. The guy at the IT helpdesk told me that "yes, there are some problems with one of the post offices in your department, but they haven't given us an estimated uptime yet.  Maybe noon?"  Great.  Thanks.  Now I complained to a few colleagues who were fortunate enough to be on a different post office.  They laughed, slapped my back and said things like "Boy a young guy like you must not know what to do when his email goes down!  Heh, what did we ever do in the day's before computers eh?  You'll probably have to pick up a phone or something!"  Yeah...the phone.  Imagine if the phones went down, but the email stayed up.  Imagine the cries and wails to supervisors and managers from frustrated workers who want to go home because something as basic as "a phone" isn't working in the office.  Imagine how quickly the problem would be addressed, and how much pressure would be applied to the proper department to get it done.  "Email?  Yeah, I get emails, but my secretary opens them, and prints them out for me.  I can't figure out any of that computer mumbo-jumbo, and frankly I'll be happy when the whole fad blows over in a couple of years.  Just give me a sturdy #2 HB pencil and I'm ready for the day."  In the time that I've been working (for whatever organization I'm working for...) we've had a number of email outages.  The most common kind around here seems to be when someone decides to send an email to every one of the 10,000 email addresses in the book.  In one instance, someone attached a word document containing a description of a house for sale and hit send, hoping to drum up some real-estate interest in St. Catherine's.  That act alone should have been enough to: a) restrict access to the group distribution lists in the address book; and b) initiate a disciplinary review, or at least a return to public stockading.  Not only have variations of the incident occured a few times since, there's been virtually no action taken save a few reminder emails from IT about "vacation rules" and "forwarding mail to outside accounts".  To add insult to the "Subj: House for Sale"-injury, was the fact that hundreds of employees who were on vacation at the time decided to set their automatic-replys...to all.  Since everyone was privy to the initial email, all of the reply-to-all'ers out there started replying to each other, and to the rest of us.  I opened up my inbox one morning to find  thousands  of messages.  The backlog crippled the email for a few days afterwards, until the messages could be dumped, and another message was sent out reminding employees to not "set their vacation rules to 'reply to all' as it generates hundreds of irrelevant mailings".  But that couldn't possibly apply to me....  I mean, when my cousin sends out her "Fwd:Fwd:Re:Fwd: MORNING GIGGLE!!!!" to all of our friends, I want them all to know that I'm on vacation...right?  Well I have a funny feeling that someone's email privileges should be suspended and replaced by a #2 HB pencil for a few months.  Because if I find out that a power point presentation featuring sad kittens is responsible for this, I'm going to kick some ignorant asshole back to the 70's.  Wow.  Look at that.  Still no email.

       Remember when?   Remember when it was Un-American to question the assertions that Iraq had WMD?  Remember when the Yanks were told to stand behind their leader, no matter what?  Remember when Bush said "He has them, we know he does"?  Well it was all wrong.  Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.  And thousands of Iraqis are dead because of it, and as of today at least  urlLink 1,000 American troops  are dead because of it.   urlLink Because of what ?  A "global intelligence failure".  A "group think" dynamic.  Oh, and an Iraqi defector code-named "Curve Ball".  From  urlLink one story : WASHINGTON (AP) - The key U.S. assertions leading to the 2003 invasion of Iraq - that Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons and was working to make nuclear weapons - were wrong and based on false or overstated CIA analyses, a scathing Senate Intelligence Committee report asserted Friday.  Intelligence analysts  fell victim  to "group think" assumptions that Iraq had weapons that it did not, the bipartisan report concluded. Many factors contributing to those failures are ongoing problems within the U.S. intelligence community - which cannot be fixed with more money alone, it said. The bold is mine.    They were just victims see?  Just innocent victims of....Well I guess it was peer pressure, wasn't it?  Like a bunch of innocent children who just wanted to believe in Tinkerbell so much that they clapped their hands together until blood poured down their wrists.  Millions protested, demanding to know why their own children should be sent without proof of any of the Administration's claims, and they were called un-patriotic because of it.  They were told: "You don't know what we know... You don't have the secret intelligence that we do, but you should trust us".  Well what now?  Who can be held responsible for this violation of trust and needless bloodshed?  I don't know either, but if John Kerry gets into the White House he'll probably force you to have an abortion against your will, so you should probably vote Bush.  He seems like a trustworthy guy.

       That Ad.   There was an ad on TV a while ago, for cookies I think, or crackers or something.  I think it was  urlLink these things .  There was a guy sitting on a plane, and across the isle beside him was a woman in a business suit, glasses, hair up in a bun.  The palette was all grey and kind of boring, and the guy had a disinterested look about him as he glanced over.  The woman was working on something at her seat and accidentally dropped her pen, and as she leaned down to get it, we (the disinterested guy) catch a glimpse down her blouse to see that she is wearing a scarlet red bra with black lace.  Man that was hot.  What's got me wondering right now is, why did I think of that while staring at this spreadsheet?  And why can't I get it out of my head now?  And why can't I remember what the product was for certain?  And where can I buy the product if I ever remember what it was?  Cookies?  Maybe it was a commercial for pens.  Or bras.  Or WestJet.

       Garbage day at the Star    urlLink Royson James : Let's face it, garbage is a political hot potato. The City of Toronto has spent tens of millions trying to find a solution. The province has wasted tens of millions of dollars meddling in the issue and then dumping it back on the city. And through it all, one thing remains, few of us city slickers want it anywhere near us once it leaves the curb.  The City of Toronto has embarked on a process that is sure to lead to controversy, protest rallies, confrontation at city hall, chaos, legal battles, frustration and delays and, finally, abandonment in the face of intransigent and angry residents.  It's called an environmental assessment  a ridiculously tedious, inexact, convoluted search for the best of several waste management solutions. It could take three, four, five or six years, or more. It will not satisfy residents. It will be blasted and dismissed as "fixed" to deliver a certain outcome. And it will cost tens of millions of dollars in a futile search for a dump or an incinerator for between 200,000 and 400,000 tonnes of Toronto waste  the "residue" after the city reaches a target of 80 per cent reduction of its waste.  urlLink Christopher Hume : Even the members of the Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area, the most built-up and ad-heavy part of Toronto, which includes the Eaton Centre and the corner of Yonge and Dundas Sts., showed up at the meeting to voice their opposition to the monster bins. So did representatives of the Beaches, Cabbagetown and Bloor-Yorkville. One delegate after another worried about the size, the height and the obtrusiveness of the trash cans.  That didn't stop the works committee from approving the proposal (4 to 3); their argument, made over and over again, is that the deal is one the city can't afford to turn down. Toronto is broke, don't forget, so selling off the public realm makes good sense to councillors such as Mike Del Grande (Ward 39, Scarborough-Agincourt), Michael Thompson (Ward 37, Scarborough Centre) Glenn de Baeremaeker (Ward 38, Scarborough Centre) and chair Jane Pitfield (Ward 26, Don Valley West). And the  urlLink Star Editorial Board : The company that supplies the city's trash and recycling bins has offered to provide 2,500 oversize bins with the ads and 2,500 regular bins without ads. Thousands of current bins would be moved to places like parks. The city would still pick up the trash.  Toronto would get $1.8 million annually in royalties, plus a share of ad revenue. It's a tempting proposition.  But do we need so many 7 1/2 foot tall ad platforms? There's no sense in having clean streets if they can't be seen over trash cans, of all things. Why not just increase the number of regular-size bins, with regular-size ads? That would bring in more revenue, and decrease litter, without cluttering the streetscape.

       Scotty   Scotty has  urlLink Alzheimer's : One of Doohan's sons, Chris Doohan, of Thousand Oaks, California, said the Alzheimer's diagnosis stemmed from his father's increasing loss of short-term memory.  "His longterm memory seems to be intact," said Chris Doohan, 45. "If you ask him how he got his role on 'Star Trek' or (about) D-Day, he can talk for an hour about that. But if you ask him what he had for breakfast," he can't say. That's all reversed.  Doohan should be able to say what he had for breakfast and should be completely forgetting his involvement with Star Trek.  There are legions and legions of Trekies out there who will gladly recount every detail of every episode for us all; Scotty doesn't have to remember any of that.

       The tradeoff   They're big.  2.3 m tall litter bins.  They're mainly billboards (lit up from the back, like a transit shelter ad), with a litter bin sandwiched between.  The City's Works committee approved the proposed design at it's meeting yesterday.  From the Star: Eucan, the private company that has the contract to supply sidewalk trash/recycling bins, is offering to provide up to 2,500 of the oversize bins and 2,500 regular size bins without advertising. As well, 3,000 of the current bins would be stripped of ads to be placed in off-street locations such as parks.  The proposal, if approved by city council, would see the new bins appear in late fall, said Angelos Bacopoulos, the city's general manager of solid waste.  A prototype wasn't available for works committee members to see, but it's hoped one will be when the issue reaches city council, said Councillor Jane Pitfield (Ward 26, Don Valley West), who chairs the works committee. The proposal was embraced by the committee over objections that city streets have too much advertising.  Dave Meslin, who heads a group that opposes corporate ads in public spaces, said he supports reducing litter and increasing the recycling of cans, bottles and paper. But he hates the idea of bus shelter-sized ads. Meslin's website is  urlLink located here .  Publicspace.ca has been kind enough to post a document containing the proposed design, and  urlLink dimensions here .  The staff report mentioned on the website is  urlLink located here , the concluding paragraph reading: There are at least two options available to the City if we wish to enhance the CityÂ?s Clean City campaign by installing at least 1,000 additional recycling/litter bins: (a) continue with the existing contract for litter bins with advertising with Eucan and purchase 1,000 additional recycling/litter bins without advertising; or,  (b) accept the proposal from Eucan, which would extend the term of the existing agreement by approximately five and half years, amend the financial returns and place 1,500 or more large advertising bins in the road allowance. The financial analyses in this report show that accepting the proposal from Eucan appears financially better for the City rather than maintaining the existing contract and purchasing 1,000 additional bins. These analyses assume that if we continue with the existing agreement and go out for bids once it expires, we would receive royalties that are similar to the existing agreement. Without actually tendering or conducting a financial analysis by an independent party with knowledge of the advertising industry, there is no way of determining what the CityÂ?s royalties could be after the current agreement expires. It is not possible to say unequivocally that accepting the proposal from Eucan would end up being financially advantageous to the City compared to maintaining the existing contract, purchasing 1,000 additional bins and tendering once the current contract with Eucan expires.  Due to the various considerations of:  retaining flexibility that harmonizes street furniture as part of the City's Beautiful City initiative;  the implications on the streetscape of introducing 1,500 or more large illuminated advertising structures containing litter/recycling bins;  the concerns with undertaking significant modifications to an existing contract without the benefits of a competitive process; and,  the uncertainty around the financial benefits;  it is the staff recommendation not to proceed with the current offer from Eucan to modify the existing contract. And you thought litter was just a little bit of junk on the ground...   Recycling is important.   We cannot return to the days of open-topped litter baskets or bins on our streets and in our parks.  Everything that's put into those bins, be it cans, bottles, newspaper, etc., is wrapped up and thrown into the back of a truck with the rest of the garbage.  It's not the fuzzy "let's all recycle because mother earth wants us to" argument, it's about money.  The more tonnage of recyclable material that we can divert from landfill, means more money to this municipality from  urlLink these   urlLink two  organizations.  As we recycle more, the cheque just gets bigger.    The other half of the money argument is that, as a municipality with no operating landfill, and a cross border contract to dump our waste, we must aggressively work to reducing the amount of garbage that goes into the Michigan-bound trucks.  It's costing us a lot of money to send our garbage on an American vacation everyday.  Programs like home, work and school recycling, the Green Bin, home composting and public-space recycling are all efforts to reduce the Michigan-bound garbage.  We absolutely need street-side bins that have several compartments, to separate the recyclable material.   Public space is important.   We're bombarded with ads, and mass-marketing every day.  Signs, billboards, buses, washrooms, and now even painted on the public sidewalks.  It all adds up to visual pollution, and I agree it's really annoying.  But you know...I'm a big boy, I can ignore it.  We live in a time when consumerism is global and reaches into every aspect of our lives, and it's not going to change because the City allows or disallows ads on litter bins.  Council has held out against the advertising demon over the years, first refusing to put corporate sponsor logos on the blue boxes (a proposal which would have seen boxes offered at even cheaper prices then we have now), and then refusing to put ads on Works vehicles (like those on busses and streetcars).  The cost of doing the business of making our garbage disappear has skyrocketed in recent years, so that additional $1.8 million is a tempting carrot.  For the most part the jump in operating cost is not big-fat-union pay raises, and it's not corporate bungling (if it is, then I got left of the loop on both counts), it's the fact that we used to pay $12 a tonne to dispose of our garbage in our own landfill, and now we're paying $52 a tonne.  Advertising on bins may be a little ugly, but we have to face the reality of either higher taxes, or a bit of cash from the private sector.

       Kiss me I'm Greek   So....did Greece win some sort of contest?  Did they best a rival in a test of skill?  They might as well have won their independence or slayed a Minotaur, for all the noise outside my Danforth digs.  From the  urlLink CBC : Toronto's Danforth Avenue erupted into a cacophony of car horns honking the instant the referee blew the final whistle in Lisbon's Stadium of Lights. Yeah.  I know.  When Greece beat Portugal in the first round, I knew.  That cacophony of car horns and drunken screams went from Danforth Ave, west to College and Ossington, just to rub it in.  I came home one night after Greece had beaten France in what one amateur Hellenic scholar described to me as "A fuckin' miracle, man.  You have no fuckin' idea".  The car horns lasted from the game's final whistle to about 2:45 AM while I was beating my head against the wall in an attempt to drown out the noise.  As a loyal member of the neighbourhood and supporter of whatever these people are interested in, I decided that a walk up the Danforth was in order after today's victory.  Danforth was blocked at Broadview (the crowd control barriers have been sitting roadside since early this week) and all the way to Pape.  I live in the barely-Greek area of the Danforth: the area that has lots of bars, but only one decent Gyro stand.  Greektown doesn't officially begin until you're east of the Carrot Common at Chester, and extends mostly until Pape with a smattering beyond.  The street was as crowded with as many people, if not more, as a Sunday at  urlLink Taste .  I was pushing past soaked Greeks (thanks to God's impromptu wet t-shirt contest at around 5:30 pm), in an attempt to move further east along the street.  Whistles, screams, chants, and OOOOPAAA!!! filled the air from one end to the other.  Around Logan, crowds formed in front of the various media trucks; CBC and CP24 were the most popular, but CFRB somehow snuck their way past the legitimate media and found a spot in front of a Greek bakery.  I knew we were live when the crowd started to scream and chant for a 10 second bumper-spot, before dying off to wait out the commercial break.  Good spirited, nationalistic pride was no match for entrepreneurial libido however, as the street was also packed with "legitimate" vendors selling "Greece: Champions" t-shirts, soccer ball shaped whistles, and enough Greek flags for every available window in Riverdale.  One old man even sold floral-print umbrellas from a shopping cart during the post-game torrential downpour.  Overheard: "I'm ready for a big meal, some cold beer and some hot sex."   And...  "Hey ladies....  We were just wondering what you were doing after the street party tonight.  Perhaps you could join us for a drink...." Greek boys will be greek boys.  Greek boys with their priorities in order.  Who's up for some Ouzo and a Gyro?  Lord knows I am.    It's going to be a long night.

       Reason I like winter #476   My skin stays one colour.  We spent a good part of the weekend outside.  I've been off work since Wednesday and between a round of golf with my father and brother, a Canada Day Hip concert, a picnic in High Park and a hike along the Scarborough bluffs, my head is starting look like a bronzed bust.    Actually, because I'm one of these guys who keeps his shirt on under any circumstance (save morning showers and sweet lovin') the bronzed bust analogy is more like: "Shit, we're running low on bronze.  Ok, just do the head and leave the shoulders and chest in pasty white plaster."  Once again this year, probably around August, I'll start to get pulled off flights and busses by armed police and scrutinized about my involvement with Al Qaeda sleeper cells.  "But my father was a protestant farmer from Stayner!" I'll protest.  Yeah sure, save it for your Gitmo celly, freedom-hater.

       Garbage Week in the Globe   The Globe's Marcus Gee has a 4 part Toronto garbage series all this week.  The schedule:  Today: The garbage "crisis" is really no crisis at all  Tomorrow: Landfill phobia lies behind the garbage crunch  Part 3: Why incineration is a burning issue  Part 4: There's no turning back on recycling  That's quite a slate and I'll be looking forward to all of them.  I'll put links and sophomoric comments up here as the series unfolds.  Onto the "crisis".  From the  urlLink Aug 2 Globe : Is Toronto facing the same fate? The city has been looking for a garbage solution since at least 1987, when the government of now-defunct Metropolitan Toronto began fretting over what to do when two local dumps filled up. Tens of millions of dollars later, it still has no answer to this most fundamental of urban problems.  The best method it has been able to find is shipping the garbage to a private landfill in Michigan. Every day, about 140 enormous, six-axle trucks make the 12 to 15-hour round trip, taking their crushing toll on highway surfaces and spewing exhaust all the way.  Almost everyone agrees that exporting Toronto's garbage is a poor solution -- including the people of Michigan, who have made unwanted waste from Canada one of the biggest political issues in the state. At the same time, no one can agree on a better way. Well when operations becomes a political issue then yes, no one will ever agree on a solution to anything.  If there were bi-partisan battles about how to fill potholes in this city then every suspension would be shot.  If bus schedules, or subway car maintenance were a debatable point then no one would get anywhere in this city.  Garbage and "what to do with garbage" is a political issue plain and simple.  It shouldn't be, of course, but it is.  Adams Mine was a solution that was researched and presented and, under pressure, was abandoned ( urlLink decisively  in later years) with no alternative presented.  Increased recycling, green bins, and deterrent programs (like the commercial Yellow Bag program) were implemented, but the unacknowledged elephant in the livingroom is still "what do we do with the rest?". In the 1990s, Ontario's NDP government banned the building of incinerators. Just this spring, the current Liberal government cancelled for good a long-standing proposal to ship Toronto's trash to an empty mine near Kirkland Lake in Northern Ontario.  "We're busy ruling things out before we really look at them," says John Tory, a contender for the leadership of Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party. In Toronto's mayoral race last year, he stood out from the pack by supporting incineration (and lost to David Miller). That's a great quote from Tory by the way.  It really sums up the experience around solid waste planning around this city.  Proposals and potential new technologies are vetoed at the committee level with no further direction then: "We don't like it (or 'These community groups don't like it').  Give us something else".  There seems to be an unsaid theory that there is some  thing  out there that will get rid of garbage, not produce any emissions, not produce any residue, be cheaper then the current operation and be safe enough for kittens and babies to roll around in, and that we just haven't found it, or done enough research to find it yet.  The reality is that no such technology exists anywhere and we're fools to think that we can keep futzing around and gently testing the waters to see if everyone will be ok with the solution.  When it comes to new technologies (read: incineration, pyrolysis, etc.) the war cry against is usually "It hasn't been tested.  It hasn't proven itself safe and effective."  That's a very reasonable point to consider.  But proof that a technology works for a given city, in a given scenario is no guarantee that it will work here, and simply dismissing technologies on this basis is just childish.  We have to, pardon the phrase, but think outside the box of what we know and what we're comfortable with.  We have to have some fortitude to take a plan and move forward with it.  Currently we're lacking in fortitude department. "You can easily find holes in the ground of sufficient size within convenient distance to take all of Toronto's waste, but nobody wants it," said Richard Anderson, who teaches geography at York University. "People freak out over garbage issues."  Some environmentalists even say we are wrong to produce garbage in the first place. Our trash is proof of our wasteful ways, they argue. "There should be no such thing as garbage," Frank de Jong, leader of Ontario's Green Party, wrote in April. "Garbage should be recognized for what it is, partially used resources." Right and what of the toothbrushes and potato chip bags?  So the fact that we have garbage is just laziness on our part?  For a resource to be utilized there has to be someone willing to utilize it.  Municipalities can't effectively produce recycling markets with the stroke of a pen.  We rely on the whim and call of business and industry to dictate what can and can't be recycled.  If there's no market for, say, green glass bottles, then guess where those bottles end up? The city had a foretaste of what could happen when the U.S. border was closed for 16 to 18 hours last year because of the scare over mad-cow disease and Canadian beef. Garbage trucks lined up by the dozen at the transfer stations. Ahem.  Yes.   urlLink I remember . To complicate matters, the provincial government decided in June not to let Toronto open a research facility to study high-tech options. So council voted to conduct an environmental assessment, a process that could take several years and cost millions of dollars.  Naples tried for a high-tech solution, too. City officials wanted to build two new low-pollution incinerators to deal with the overflowing garbage. Residents and environmental campaigners resisted. No one wanted an incinerator in their backyard. And so we get to one of the keystones of the debate: everyone wants a solution but no one wants it to affect them in the slightest.  Gee's final point should be taken seriously. Instead, they got piles of refuse in their streets, a medieval scene of squalor straight out of Roman times. Looks like a well researched series.  I'll post some updates and future articles from the Globe.
