      She lost her user name, Karma1. Or rather, maybe someone stole it? So, now she is once again, oneandonly.   I did a search on that name, oneandonly, it's got about 55,000 links to dating services. I'm not kidding, try it for yourself.

      jchallquist@excite.com  I got an IM from her, I didnt' even know she knew my yahoo name... Of course, she DOES search for me on a regular basis... Anyways, here it is. I blocked her, so I don't know if she sent more or what. She can't send my anything again unless she forms another NEW name...  Session Start (Yahoo! - JudyHallquist:scarpenter92020): Sun Nov 16 15:43:04 2003 scarpenter92020: lame very lame--trying to be me in sparc--desperate are we? dont worry, you'll be out of sparc in NO time JudyHallquist: what the hell are you talking about? JudyHallquist: bite my ass bitch *** scarpenter92020 has been ignored. JudyHallquist: you are a fucked up delusional bitch that should NOT be IM'n me...  I don't know what the hell your babbling on about but YOU need to stop this bullshit. DO NOT CONTACT ME. Session Close (scarpenter92020): Sun Nov 16 15:46:42 2003  So, now she's claiming that i'm trying to be HER? Oh my gosh!! How gross.... Have you seen her? yuck... anyways, I rarely go into the sparc site. If ever.   I have this and one other site I'm keeping up on, and I have finals next week... WHY would I bother with HER? She's the loser wife of my EX husband. Mike, who's behind in support.  Could it be that he's giving her shit about him not paying and this is her chance to try and fuck with me? Or it this her release because she's so ugly that he won't touch her? She's pathetic to IM me, accusing me of ANYTHING. Oh my gosh... LOL

      jchallquist@excite.com I just got an email regarding *blackmail* from Mike; or was it actually sent by Shelly? It states, and i'm paraphrasing here, ... "one more thing. I am trying very hard  to NOT stoop to your level but just in case you forgot there are many embarasing things you have emailed or instant messged me about. would you like to see these things posted? or the ones from the ssss board?  think about what you are doing for a change and get some help" Okay not exactly a para-phrase, but you get the picture.  If you don't so this, I'll do this... Blackmail. LOL...  What I'm posting about is about things I"M dealing with. I'm dealing with NOT receiving child support currently. When and If I do receive child support from this person, I'll be the first to post it here. Just to show good faith, I DID remove his last name on this post.

      jchallquist@excite.com  I got a letter in the mail from OREGON Department of Justice.  Child Support Program. Mike is now $ 7,089.76 in arrears. Monthly support is $406.00 per month and an additional $81.20 for arrears.  Total monthly he owes is now $487.20  Plus I got a second letter, Apparently Califorina found a possible employer. And forwarded that information on to Oregon.  CSP #:                      ********************* Current Support Amount:                          $406.00 Last support Amount: Case Balance:                                         $7,089.76            (May include current month's support) Obligor:                                            Xxxxxxxxx, Michael L.                                        Notice to Obligor of Order to Withhold Income  It states, "Your order requires the obligor listed above to carry health care coverage for the child(ren). Our records show that the obligor is not carrying health coverage. This office is responsible for enforcing the health care coverage provisions of your order. Therefore, we have sent the obligor's employer a notice to enroll the child(ren) and to withhold the cost of the premium, if any, from the obligor's wages.  I'm so excited. It's getting closer to when I might actually start recieving child support...  Edit due to Mike's embarrassment of the situation.  Of course, How many Mike's with his last name are out there??? Do a google search and try and find THIS one... You won't be able too. ;)  But, I thought I'd be kind enough to do this lil favor for him.  Of course, I heard the same old same old, " I took care of it all when I got a job..." Yea, we'll see.

      Posted on FreeAdvice by me...  Ya know, this whole thing has gotten twisted. I will explain this once again --- simply put.  MIKE is OVER $6,000 in arrears. He has NOT paid support in the last three months.  Support is 406 per month for 2 kids. Arrears is to be paid @an additional $50 per month.  He is SUPPOSED to call on Sunday evenings, HE chooses when and if he calls. I DON"T answer the phone on Sunday evenings. The kids do. WHEN he calls. We have caller ID, so I make a point to let the kids get it. Last summer, he didn't exercise his visitation because HE didn't call to make arrangments. That's fine, they didn't want to go anyways. THEY ARE 15 and a half.   I WILL NOT make my kids get a job to cover the support that their dad is NOT paying. PERIOD. When they work, that money will be for 1. a car. 2 insurance. 3. frivoulous stuff they want. 4. college.  I DO have an income. A seperate income from my husband. Where I work has NOTHING to do with MIKE paying his support. PERIOD. Support was based BOTH of our incomes. HE was in college for 4 or 5 years. Now that he's finished, this means that theoritically he should be able to get a better paying job and then be able to easily pay his support. I'm not in the process of taking him for a modification. I don't want or need that. I just want the support to restart as soon as possible. Just like everybody else on this whole dang board. The kids deserve this support to be coming into our household.  The budget we have is for my FAMILY income. Like I said, the support money is to pay for the extra things that come up in life. Whether it's movies or a huge family meal. And yes, when that support is coming in on a regular basis for a change, YOU get used to it coming in. SO, in turn, you increase your living style. PERIOD. It's not socked away for when he's NOT going to pay. Oh yes, we had some money socked away for a rainy day. BUT, NOT 3 months worth. Yea, I know I should have because I can't depend on MIKE to do the right thing by his kids.  The one thing I got out of all this bs, is that LW has her lil following and they are so gullable to see the lies as truths. Even when the truth is shoved in their faces.  I've proven my point time and again regarding the under handed dealings and **** that they do, and still, you've got her back... So be it...   I did get links to some GREAT sites I will be taking advantage of very soon. And I can't wait.  Oh yea, MY NAME IS JUDY... (how's that? Is it fair now?)   __________________ ~Life is Short, Pray Hard~  "Ohana means family, family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten. This is MY family, it is little and broken, but still good.

      Remember, Shelly is oneandonly.  From :  Shelly Carpenter    Sent :  Saturday, December 27, 2003 9:53 AM  Subject :  Must have really bothered you~    Since you left that message on our machine last night   Here's the thing--Your mother made sense to me and I deleted posts--she's got a valid point (about wanting peace) and you will no longer see threads or posts about you by me....My New Year's Resolution, if you will.   However, there are a few things that do need to be said. First of all--(geeze, where do I start?)---you created this whole support mess and should have left everything alone. YOU would have had at least 2+ months of support by now. Secondly, while I think that YOU think you are being clever, you appear more to be someone in desperation. "Sneaking " in to several forums (remember that whole SSSS board thing?) and trying to get information--ie, sparc chat. What is the truth? What can you really rely on to be the truth about what I talk about, knowing full well you are lurking? DO you NOT remember that whole, "we are moving to Japan" made up story that you ran to FA with? Looking like a total fool? *that was funny, btw* Thirdly, most times, either what you post or write in your online journal is sent to me....you have more net enemies than you think. I go, check it out and copy and print. BUT, from this point forward, I will ignore. You have proven to be one sick person, which I always knew, just confirmed more strongly now. I do believe, or did believe, that your mother (and probably your husband) do NOT know of the extent of you sickness----was not "tattling" as you put it, just think, as family members, someone should help you. But, again, this won't happen again (my trying to get your family to help you) because, by evidence of your message last night--you are a lost cause.    See, here's what I have learned....and mind you, when I hear of other pbfh's like yourself doing the exact same thing,(your "methods" are done by many) I always advise to ignore....be the bigger person....you cant change that persons actions, only your reactions to them (you might have seen me say this in sparc chat a time or two)...so, I am now going to follow my own advice. Lastly, and this is to reassure you....I will NOT be posting one little bit about you, anywhere. So, no need to lurk in sparc chat, or pretend to be me, or try and take yet another posting name from me, or post things about me....(funny how you stated on singlemomz that I was blocked from you--yet, all my emails get through?).  I am done with you. I want to have that peace your mother wishes for too~ You've already shown me (and others), numerous times, that your life is not complete unless you have something to complain about. BUT, that is NOT my problem. I will no longer give you any "ammunition" to spark that need to complain and be nasty in you... Hope YOU find some peace and gain a little integrity~ *all emails blocked so don’t bother responding--but feel free to post this anywhere-as we know you will*          |X| Mike and Shellys crap | Inbox      My answer: It's all a lie. Her leaving well enough alone... She just can't. And the sad part, she's got NEW friends, that haven't yet gotten sick of her shit... They are Shellie, Troubledmom, granny, and Childrenfirst. Pretty sad...   I have a THEORY as to WHY I got this email... Mike heard the message, she prolly had to tell him a little of what's been going on.. and she's gotten in TROUBLE. This happens, each time that I bring this  CRAP  to  his  attention, she *Disappears* for a short bit. Only to reappear saying I'm stalking her, starting shit... But, alas, I've saved the proof of her actually starting the shit. She deletes the stuff that starts the *battles*, she even admits to it.  She's the one that I NEVER see talking about NORMAL life stuff. Only about ME! Why is that? She may be a little off her rocker. And she's a school teacher... YIKES!

      Shelly sent me an email telling me she's gonna stop all the bullshit. About time, but then again, I've heard/read this before. It seems that this is her New Years' resoluation EVERY year. LOL  As long as she stops, I'll have no need to *correct* her on the truth. Or let her know that her version or thoughts are incorrect. I know, I've made mistakes. I'm not perfect. By no streatch of the word can she consider herself to be either.  She's not a mother, yet she's always bringing up the way I raise MY kids. She's not raised any kids, she's not an expert.  My THEORY on her sending the emails to my mother is that everyone she talks to about me, is just sick of it... I've read where they tell her to just leave it all alone. I've proven her wrong. She's proven herself to be wrong. They've told her time and again, that if Mike's not paying, that he SHOULD be paying.  But, alas, they have run out of patients with her ~ I suppose.  So, My theory is that my mother is *fresh meat* to her.  Shelly sent my husband, mind you ~ to his employers address~ a copied and pasted and modified IM message from YEARS back. Trying at that time also to GET ME IN TROUBLE. LOL! He thought very little of her childishness. Tit for Tat... I guess. Now, I'm wondering, will my husband be receiving anything from her again... Telling him *just how SICK* I am? This will prove to be interesting. Because he knows what shelly is doing right now... emailing my mother. LOL...  So, we'll see how long it stays quite.  Oh yea, Shelly is claiming that *someone* is sending her copies of this journal... That's find and dandy... The more people that she can drag into her world, the better she feels justified to keep at it... Neither of them have a life... apparently. This is where I get out my fustrations and what not... That way, they are released and I can walk away from the computer feeling much better... leaving the fustrations on this journal. And as I step away, I take a deep breathe and release it all... :) Feels good.  Yea, feels good that I know I've really pissed Shelly off too... LOL! Just a little satisfaction.  I just had a thought. Did Mike's parents hear the message??? Ohhh that would be funny... To have them bitch you out... after Mike called me bitching me out because I talked to his dad regarding Child Support! Apparently, Mike had told his dad that he WAS paying support, but actually wasn't. And Mike's dad confronted him on this lie.

      Doug owes about 15 Grand in arrears. Now, that would be great to get in one lump sum... At least I've gotten a little.  $205. for November, and $152 for December. Ordered amount is $388.00  Edit: After doing up all the accounting of support received since Jan. 2001. Doug owes $11,350.99 in back support.  PLUS INTEREST...    The above is an over estimation.

      Soooo funny that she keeps deleting posts... Does this make since? NO. She just fades away everytime I stand up for myself, prove my point, prove her to be an idiot, or just answer back. She expects to me cry and cry and run and hide... I think not. I won't be pushed around any longer by her...  Now, she's running to MY MOTHER. *Tattle'ng* on me... LOL!  To date, I have not recieved any child support from or on behalf of Mike. Arrears are adding up... It would be really nice to get all that he owes in one lump sum... Life would then be GRAND. SEVEN GRAND! Then, I would post on each and every forum that I know Shelly frequents and tell everyone that ALL of the support is paid... Too bad that'll never happen!  Only dreaming...

[QUOTE][i]Originally posted by oneandonly [/i] [B]I'm afraid~ NO one can tell you for sure if a judge will take this child away from the other parent and while the "evidence" you speak of is quite damaging, NO one can tell you what a judge will or will not do in court. I sat in a California family court room for many weeks while waiting for my brothers case to be heard-not to mention being in court for my husbands case. In some instances, I was thinking, "this is a slam-dunk case and surely the child will be given to the other parent."--didnt happen--counseling ordered, etc...but child remained with offending parent. In other cases, I witnessed a minor infraction resulting in a custody change. Each case is different, and the judge had to weigh each and every bit of evidence and base decisions on the best interest of the child. I've also learned that while consulting with an attorney is good--consulting with many is better. In any custody matter, I would NOT go without an attorney, IMO.  If hiring an attorney is not possible, then yes, one can file on your own. But this should be done as a last resort. You need to know how to fill out the forms, how to speak in court--that sort of thing. I highly recommend going to the courthouse after your case has been assigned to a judge and see how that all works. You get a "feel" for how the judge is, etc...and could quite possibly hear a case similar to yours.  Good luck [/B][/QUOTE]   While I've tried to be good... I will not tolerate this. Where did I say that I knew or know what a judge WILL order? Reread my previous post O&O. It states that a judge CAN do something about the abuse currently happening. When the CPS can't or won't.  And as a judge SHOULD do something about it, NOT saying he actually will. But, in some of these cases posted on here, the only thing some of these people are holding on to is a bit of HOPE. Hope might not change things, but knowing there is hope out there, it means that they won't quit until they actually find it or crash into a brick wall. If the op isn't finding the answers through CPS, then YES. Contact SEVERAL attorneys'. Also, consult with several. They can point you in the right direction.  Some people can't afford an attorney. Just as in my case, I"M not getting support, so all of our income goes to support the family. And when agencies tell you to get an attorney and you know there's NO WAY it's possible, you look for other answers. Then, someone may find this site, ask some questions and be told GET AN ATTORNEY. If they could afford an attorney, they prolly wouldn't be HERE looking for advice. Only to be told to find an attorney. It's your only hope. IT'S NOT!   Take my case for example, I filed for mod of support. Albeit, in the wrong court house. Took the clerk's word that it was the correct place. NCP filed a response of FULL CUSTODY. So what. He ONLY got July, odd new years and even xmas. Got a new court date in the right courts, and got an increase. NCP was told to get a 2nd pt job, or bring his current hours up to full-time. Didn't matter that he was in college. New date set, postponed. Court error. Then later, final order set at last court date. I get more than I asked for. New child support order. 206 per kid. I only asked for 200 from 125.00 You'd think I was trying to rob him... He fought it all the way. Lied about some stuff on his papers. I come to find out later. But, oh well..  In the end, I won. I got my increase. He might have gotten his visitation modified, but he wouldn't have pursued anything hadn't I filed the Original Mod. And he did ask for full custody. He ONLY got a total of 7 weeks per year. AND to top that off, he's not doing anything about the visitation. This last summer? Nope. Last xmas was his 1st xmas with the kids. They came home complaining. The previous summer, July ~ but they were with my mother and his parents most of the time. And with me while I was visiting my mother. This New Years? Nope, hasn't mentioned ANYTHING to me. Needs to give a weeks; notice. Too late for that.  So, in the end. All is not hopeless. YOU can do this on your own. Yes, YOU SHOULD speak with SEVERAL attorney's that specailize in family law. Write down all of your questions. Ask all and take notes. Make sure that if they tell you a form. WRITE it down... Ask them to spell it if necessary. I've not found a single attorney that's been a butt nugget and told me he would give me the same advice, had i hired him. I go in letting them know I need tons of advice. I've paid for a few consultations, and it's worth it.  I've learned SOOOO much in the consults with attoneys'.  To the OP, I wish you the best. To O&O: as Jessica says, Back off barbie...lol  Play nice, or don't play at all.   __________________ ~Life is Short, Pray Hard~  Play nice, or don't play at all.       12-21-2003 06:42 PM                  gammy490 Junior Member  Registered: Dec 2003 Location:  Posts: 6  Didn't mean to...  cause an argument. Although, what I want to hear is "Yes, a judge will give your son full custody", I know that may not be true,but I also know that a judge is the only one with the power to do that. My thinking is something needs to be done. If we just sit back and do nothing, then we are saying that we approve of this life-style. To not try, would be to say we don't care. As far as filling out forms, I have found quite a few sites that help with this. Thanks again for all the info-there is much more to this story, but I think the drugs and neglect are the main factors.       12-21-2003 08:42 PM                 Cookie97128 ~Sunshine seeker~  Registered: Apr 2002 Location: The rainy state... Where's the sun??? Posts: 328  Gammy...  You didn't cause this arguement... It's a long standing battle...   The clerks at the court house can direct you to someone that is able to look over your forms to be sure they are all filled out correctly.  You may be able to find a paralegal that can actually do the forms for you ~ for a reasonable fee.   I wish you and your son the best of luck with the kids and the situation.

Posts: 328  Re: Kooky, kooky kooky....(hijacking but making points)  [QUOTE][i]Originally posted by oneandonly [/i] [B]you failed to mention that this increase (which was actually 203$ total per child) took you over a year to get.   A= yea, took over a year. But they went back to January 2002 for support. The FIRST court date!   That your being in the wrong court was addressed in the response papers (and still you persued this in the wrong court),   A= Said this... And no it was NOT in the resonse papers. He filed for Full Custody in Response to support mod.  that the meditation did NOT go in your favor (not a good idea to try and have children present or keep mediator waiting while you were told to get a phone card), A= were you here? were YOU in the room with Mike? I did this by phone, and later found out that I should have had that lady removed... Hind sight. Look at you, I tried to be nice to you. Didn't get me anywhere.  that custody issues were dropped by my husband (not like you state and he was not granted this),   A= No, HE didn't DROP this  ... etc...etc...etc.... fact is, you went into this without an attorney (wonder what ever happened to the threats of getting one after court?) and you messed up. You filed in the wrong court, but since my husband filed a response in the right court, his requests were heard and granted. It took you over a year to get this increase and ended up being very costly to you-since you had to bring the kids down to talk to the mediator after your tirade by phone~  A= yea, I took the kids to SD. But, then again, if I hadn't.. Mike wouldn't have seen them that summer. Because HE wouldn't have asked for them to visit...   OH, but thats all in the past~ What about presently? Filing for change in jurisdiction(for support) to your state without an attorney. How did that work out for ya?  A= got it... ALL SUPPORT ORDERS ARE DIRECT WITHHOLDING FROM OREGON. THAT"S what I wanted...   As soon as my husband became employed, he notified CSE  A= Actually, NO he didn't. I gave the info to CA. and Oregon. I have the proof of that. I used casebreakers to get home addy and home phone.  and all the paperwork was being sent--this takes time. Then employer gets a wage withholding order from your state--umm...2 orders from 2 different states for same children? This has taken 2+ months to straighten out. Your state then sends employer notice of termination of order--things on hold again.   A= employer has been contacted by phone by CSE. Been told to withhold. Mike has been told to send direct to Oregon until withholding takes money from check. Has he?  Now employer waiting to get current status of orders... If you had just been patient, odds are, support would have been received for at least 2 months now~  Lesson learned--- A= Don't marry someone with kids. Oh yea, the count down you are doing??? Are you including COLLEGE?   DON'T do these things on your own because you have NO idea what you are doing~ hence my advice to hire an attorney to gammy~ [/B][/QUOTE]   __________________ ~Life is Short, Pray Hard~  Play nice, or don't play at all.

      Just pay the damn support he owes for his kids??? He's a deadbeat loser, that refuses to follow the order of the court. Oregon has sent a wage assignment to his employer and still no support is being paid. I understand it takes time, especially when OREGON CSE screws up. California has even enformed loser Mike to pay directly to Oregon. California case is closed.  Oregon CSE agent, Bonnie, verbally told loser Mike to pay directly to Oregon. But, alas, NOTHING.  3 days till xmas, and NOTHING! The other day, the kids got a card from loser Mike, telling them that they won't be getting anything till AFTER the NEW YEAR, for CHRISTMAS. Well, at least they might get SOMETHING! We'll see if he lets them down again.  Shelly is a fucking bitch from hell.   Lieing fucking bitch. She goes onto forum as if SHE'S a parent... She's soooo upset by the fact that SHE'S not a MOTHER. She has to take digs at me at every turn. She REALLY must not have liked the fact that I truely feel sorry for her at times. I have kids, and she doesn't... I have a theory on that ~ she had kids, and LOST them to their father. Or she was slutting around and had abortion after abortion and NOW when she might want kids, SHE CAN"T... or, she drowned them when they were babies, and is afraid of this getting out, maybe doing it again, if she had more kids... I tend to believe if she did have kids in the past, she lost them.  I remember a "story" i heard about her. She got fired from a teaching position for yelling at  and grabbing a 12 year old boy. The story goes that he cursed at her and disrespected her. I don't know if it's true, but it was told to me by Mike's family.

      Why must she try to pick a fight? WHY???? Telling the general public, where I post some damn good advice, that I am giving 'misleading advice'? If she was to take a minute to SLOWLY read the posts that I write, she might find out that she's reading it wrong! It's a shame to think that she's a teacher and the kids are subjected to her reading style... LOL  It's 4 days till xmas and all through the house, not a phone was -a-ringing ~ not an email was transmitting...  To ask that the kids' visit on this New Years' holiday break... But we all know what's a coming.. a contempt claim from her to try and ruin the holidays'.  Once and for all, will she just leave us alone. Let the kids deal with dad and let well enough be ~ alone...  Ah well, there's always next year.

      I'm gonna respond here, because it's safe. And I know she comes here daily...  1. No need to feel sorry for the children. They aren't yours and they are well taken care of. Their needs are being met, but the support that's not coming in could help to meet their needs better... 2. Christmas is NOT up for debate. My daughter had questions, I couldn't answer them, so I posed the same questions to her dad. I have NOT heard anything back. I doubt I will, because he doesn't have a logical explaination. The question/inquiry from my daughter was "Last xmas was the first year we've ever spent with him, and we got 50% off stuff from his work. 3 cd's, and my brother got a few games. While the neice of dad got $50 gift cards from Hot Topic and somewhere else. And lots more, she, not so much bragged, but showed me and it's just not fair. Why didn't he do more for us?"  This is coming directly from my daughter. This was her thoughts and inquiries. I couldn't answer her because I don't really know the answer. Though I do have my own opinions. If you count the airline tickets as presents to the kids, I know damn well they'd both have rather had the cash. What parent is going to include THAT in the xmas gifts to the child? That is the gift to the parent, having the child there. No-one is "raking" you over the "coals" for dad not doing more. He's not ever done more than necessary. I just keep hoping this will change. I think he wants to, but it's hard to then have to explain this to you. Or maybe he's all talk, he says he's gonna send Jonathan something a few months ago, and still nothing's come. This, i think, was a remote control car that he no longer wanted. Hand me down RC Car. I don't think Jonathans' gotten a new car of his own from Dad, but nephews have. Jonathan gets the left over parts and cars. How is it that my kids should suffer because the neices' mother took back all the presents she gave to her daughter? How is it that we can know this is even true? Or just an excuse? How does this affect Mike with his own kids? It shouldn't.  But, it seems that Shelly is trying to play VICTIM here. That is hilarious!  Below is a post written by Shelly.  #166, "RE: hmmm...this must have been a great post~lol" In response to In response to 3 Tue Dec-09-03 05:06 PM by oneandonly              Well, this has been going on for a long time now..it's quite boring but I knew she would come here and read this (obviously from her online journal, which btw, she changed again). You can read in my original post the problems that directly relate to me...the ones we feel most sorry for are the children~ Now, it seems, last CHristmas is up for debate and what my husband got his children (not to mention the plane ticket for one)....LAST Christmas, mind you. My husband and myself are being raked over the "coals" for providing my niece (who lived with us) with a nice Christmas (her own mother took all her presents back)....can't win for loosing as my mom used to say..... oy vey... thanks for listening~

      The DA's office for Support Enforcement sent out a wage assignment to Mike's employer. They then called the employer to verify that they will process this as soon as they receive it.  Also, the case worker spoke with Mike and informed him that he needs to send support until the wage assignment takes place. He can see his checks reflect that no support is being taken, but yet he refuses to send the money.  NOW, by being told to do this by CSE, he should do it and the kids might have a decent xmas. I'll be able to get them a lil more. They aren't getting much as is... so this will help some. Of course, I'm not holding my breath.  But I can be hopeful. For the kids' sake.

      Y.A.H.O.O. Mexico Mission 2004 March 19 - March 27, 2004	  The Mission The Mexico Mission 2004 trip is a week-long project for high school student that provides home for underprivileged Mexican families. The project is designed to bring students into a deeper understanding of, and commitment to, the Christian faith, as well as give them the opportunity to develop the confidence and ability to make a lasting and positive impact on the world.  The Experience	 Mexico is still one of the poorest countries in the world. In the area where we will be working, most families live in small huts made of cardboard, wood, and scrap metal they have collected from garbage dumps. This trip will introduce high school youth to the incredible needs of others and will allow them to participate in the solution of one little piece of the larger problem of global poverty. In Mexico, our students are given the full responsibility for building a home for a homeless family. They lay the concrete, build the walls, raise the roof, and apply the stucco. Each student will experience living in a different country and will learn what it means to be a servant to people who can only repay such service with gratitude. Often, students return from this trip feeling that they have received much more then they have given through the contact with the Mexican people. Y.A.H.O.O Mexico Mission 2004 will be a life-changing experience not only in the living standards of the Mexican people but in the spiritual life of the students and adults who participate.  Y.A.H.O.O. Mexico Mission 2004; sponsored by: (Yamhill Alliance Helping Others Out). An alliance of churches in Yamhill County working with Amor Ministries, San Diego, Ca.

      and counting.   BUT! yes, there is a BUT in this post. Mike got paid friday the 23rd. I'm wondering if any support was withheld. Wouldn't it be great if it was...? It's been a long damn time.  If the support was withheld, then hopefully support will start coming on a regular basis every two weeks, since he does get paid every two weeks. I really should start a calendar on here, to show that he's not calling to 'exercise his visitations' and to track support payments. This way, I don't have to verbalize that he's a loser, he's proving it himself. But, we'll see how things go.  Ideas...

      Two elderly ladies had been friends for many decades. Over the years they had shared all kinds of activities and adventures. Lately, their activities had been limited to meeting a few times a week to play cards.  One day they were playing cards when one looked at the other and said, 'Now don't get mad at me....I know we've been friends for a long time.....but I just can't think of your name! I've thought and thought, but I can't remember it. Please tell me what your name is.'  Her friend glared at her. For at least three minutes she just stared and glared at her.  Finally she said, 'How soon do you need to know?'

      I asked the kids each what they thought of the "gifts" they got from their father. Jessica, she's soooo disappointed. She wanted to send him an nasty email, but I wouldn't let her. Told her it wouldn't do any good. She got a  necklace. It's one that you get free with purchase. Who got the purchased gift she wonders? Not too hard to guess that one.  And Jonathan. He said he'd rather have gotten a better car. Maybe a new one for a change. Anyways, he put this car back together. But had to provide his own battery. Thank god, I had bought him one a few years ago. Isn't this the same car that he received a few years ago? That you took back to "fix", and never returned? Or am I wrong? I could be wrong... Then, Jonathan also got a bunch of old games. Which is kewl. But, what else for Jessica besides the necklace? You wouldn't happen to be playing favorites now would ya?   And you got your feelings hurt because I called you a loser on this site? Well well well... what do ya think about that? You can prove yourself to not be the loser. But you can't - or should I say you won't? You don't want the title, but you still want to act the part? It doesn't work that way. They have no clue what I write here. I make all kinds of excuses for you, and you keep blowing it. This is MY RANTING. Not theirs. I wouldn't let Jessica write to you how she felt. Maybe I'll set her up with her own blog. Just to get her feelings out... yeah, that's what I'll do.  Think long and hard Mike. You say that the kids deserve to have support coming into our house, but what have you done to make sure that this is happening?

      1 used, old, broken, totally in pieces, no good for nothing, scrapped remote control car.  (All the left over parts that should have prolly gone in the trash. But wait, I'll send it to the kids!)  There is NOTHING he can do with this scrap.  2 old footballs with NO GRIP. Smooth all around. What's the use? (Dog toys.) 1 Pringles can, EMPTY. (Just throwing the trash away... Oh, wait, I'll send it to the kids!) 1 freebie necklace. (Gift with purchase...Hey, I'll send it to the kids!) A bunch of old computer games. ( I beat them, I'll send them on.) *Okay, this is kinda kewl. Jonathan likes this stuff, but what about Jessica???*  And all this is meant to be   Christmas   presents???   Gift ideas for future reference:  Blockbuster gift cards. $5.00 Wal-Mart gift cards. $5.00 Target gift cards. $5.00  Important dates to Remember: February 14 ~ Valantines day. Card?, Candy? Gift card? March 16, 2004 ~ TWINS' 16TH BIRTHDAY!! HUGE deal. Sweet 16. Wow, they are getting old! June 2004 ~ End of school year. Grades? Congrats? Gift cards? September 2004 ~ Start of 11 th grade!!! A new backpack? Half of the registration fees? NOTE BELOW* December 2004 ~ Christmas!  *Btw, I'll be sending Jessicas' receipt for this years registration. I still can't find Jonathans'. But, that's okay. Half of Jessica's receipt is $82.50  I just don't understand your reasoning for hurting the kids.

      Mikey poo got his feelings hurt. This is the reason he says he's refusing to do as Bonnie, the support agent, says. Pay the support directly until his employer withholds the monies. He's gotten paid TWICE, 12-26 & 1-9, since the employer received the wage withholding. He's been at this job for at least 3 paychecks. Not once has he taken the intiative to send the support in that he owes for his kids. His reasoning for this? Because of this journal... awww poor baby. Don't come reading it then.... If you know it's gonna hurt your feelings, DO NOT READ IT.  There is NO PERSONAL information being published here. NONE. No Addresses, No full names with SS#'s. Not yet, anyways. I will do what I find necessary to get the support coming in. No holds barred.    Arrears balance is $7901.76 as of 1-10-04. With interest adding up.  Mike and Shelly, since I know you are reading this... Pay the support. Mike says the kids do deserve to have this money coming in... so then why not live by your words? Pay the support directly to CSE.  Make checks payable to  Oregon Dept. of Justice, 047-DC9552E-41  Send checks to :  Deptartment of Justice, P.O. Box 14506, Salem, OR 97309-0420  Okay, this is not the first time you've been given this address.  So, if you still fail to pay on your own... Even $100, although your order is for $406, plus arrears of $100.  YOU  ARE PROVING YOURSELF TO BE A DEADBEAT. It's not my problem or the kids' problem that you were sick for a week. Isn't that how long your parents were visiting? Funny... It's not our problem that your check wasn't big enough. Get a second job to make up the difference. You were ordered to pay this amount. This is what you need to pay. It's been 104 days since I last recieved child support.

      It's been 5 months since I last received child support from Mike. Nothing yet. Bonnie told me that Mike assured her that he sent some money on the 12th. Nothing... Bonnie also said the Mike got paid on the 26th, and hopefully the employer withheld the support by wage assignment. I'm not sure, and won't find out anything until Monday.   Mike is $7901.76 as of 1-3-04  Would this constitute a deadbeat? Knowing that he's gotten paid for working and refused to pay SOMETHING towards support. Lieing to the CSE agent.   Ya know, I post pictures of the kids on my fotolog and this allows Mike to have pictures, Do I get a THANK YOU, for the pictures? HELL NO. Does he tell the kids they are good pictures of them? Hell no. In the visitations he's had with the kids, has he once taken them to get professional pictures? Hell no...  Dead beat... is all I can say.  Doug too. Over 11 Grand in arrears. I get 201 in November, and 152 in December.  Order is for 388.  He's not working over xmas break, and so, the child support checks are going to cease to exist for January. Prolly February too. And Doug used to bitch and moan about Mike being a deadbeat dick.  Saying that Mike didn't deserve to have the title of dad. He wasn't a dad... All this stuff was, of course, said when Doug WAS paying... He's avoiding me completely now. Didn't even call Jennifer for Christmas. No card, no nothing.    Dang, I sure know how to pick'em... huh?

      Mike, if you want the stuff removed, then how about putting a stop to your wife? YOU have a Yahoo username with your zip code, and you are complaining about me posting the evidence for the Priority Mail? Get a grip! Shelly comes here reading, MY THOUGHTS and VIEWS. NOT calling her any names anymore... Then, she goes onto MY FOTOLOG and make comments. Thus, leaving the door open for me to look at yours/hers Fotolog. And yet she just can't stop at just that. She goes on to make an additional Journal all about me and MY life. Of course, she's got most of the facts twisted, but that's okay. She's got NOTHING better to do. She's posting on that journal day and night! I thought SHE had a job??? Fired already? Damn.  The only thing that you should be worring about, is getting Shelly to STOP and paying for the kids' dental and medical bills. Shelly needs to delete her SHIT journal.  Do you even know where it's at? There is a link on your FOTOLOG. Do you even know where that is??? Here are your links:    They will be deleted from this site within 24 hours.  Deleted websites.

      Mike's Geocities page... LOL... Not exactly written by Mike, but well... WE all know that Shelly like to pretend that Mike actually writes stuff.   Love it, especially the lies. Mike's not called the kids in I don't know how long.  They've given up... Mike's loss. The "gifts" Mike/Shelly speak of... Ha ha ha. My kids don't receive gifts. They receive broken, used, or worn items. AND an EMPTY can of Pringles. Nothing to take back to any stores.  The summer that Jessica asked Mike for a new CD case, he ended up giving her his old one, 'because he didn't need it anymore." At first, he was going to buy her a new one, but she had to keep it "their" secret, because he didn't want Shelly knowing. Then, all of a sudden, he couldn't. SO, he gave her his old one. It was in fair condition. And apparently he bought himself a new one.   "Hello my name is Mike. I live in Nevada but originally from California. I am married to a beautiful and smart young lady. Her name is Shelly. We been married since the summer of 2000. I have 2 kids from my previous marriage. They are 15 now and I love them with all my heart.      I have a hard time keeping in touch with them due to thier mother likes to control them and coach them when I call them, and she also likes to listen in our conversations. My parents and I have sent them gifts in the past that they haven't recieved in one way or another. So it is hard for us to send anything for the chance that their mother might intercept it and take it back to the store.     I am currently going to school for my network engineering degree. I should be done with my schooling in arround 2007 or so. Then hopefully we can live a comfortable life here in Nevada living in a nice 3-4 bedrrom house by then.     I hope you enjoy this site and have a wonderful life now and in the future.                   Mike"  By the way, SHELLY IS 6 years OLDER than Mike. Beautiful??? That's a matter of opinion... i guess.

      CSE  and the fight I am a custodial parent. I have two ex’s. The first ex, is my twins’ father. His name is Mike. My twins are now almost 16 years old, Jonathan and Jessica. We were divorced in 1994, and I was awarded sole custody and child support. The amount was a measly $125.00 per child. He was granted ‘reasonable’ visitation, which he never exercised. It was difficult to collect on the court ordered support, as he would constantly move from job to job. San Diego Child Support Enforcement was given the pleasure of collecting the support for me, and trying to keep track of all of his changes. I would receive child support sporadically over the years. Mind you, very, very seldom the full ordered amount. In April 2001, I filed for a modification of support. My darling ex,(VERY sarcastically)  Mike, responded by filing for FULL CUSTODY; of kids he didn’t want to visit with. I basically forced visitation on him. In doing this filing of all the papers, I was given incorrect information by the Family Court in San Diego. So, I ended up filing the modification of support in the wrong court house, but yet the custody paperwork was filed correctly in the Family Court. In January 2002, we went to court for what I thought would be the only time. To settle on the modification of support and dismiss his ridiculous Motion to Show Cause of Custody Change.   Well, I was in for a shock. At this hearing the judge informed me that I was in the wrong court house. But, Mike was in the right one. THANK GOD the judge saw that I had filed the mod of support first and saw that Mike was only filing for full custody in retaliation of the support increase. All of his requests were denied. The judge did allow him to change his plea in mid-trial, asking for set visitation. (Anything to piss me off) So, the judge ordered shit head, who never wanted his original visitation rights, all of July, odd Christmas, and even New Year. I immediately, (right after court), got in touch with the correct court house, and spoke with a child support enforcement agent. I told her the long horrible story of what had happened. She filed immediately for my modification of support, in the correct court house. We got a court date, and I flew back to California for the hearing. Mike was ordered by the judge to get a second part-time job or bring his current hours up to full-time. Another court date was set. But, this time the judge said I didn’t have to return. So, I stayed home. I got a phone call a day after the next court hearing, telling me that courts been postponed. I needed to be present. ARGHHHHHH!   I flew back to San Diego for this court hearing, and Mike and I met in the waiting room before court. I approached him, telling him we could avoid court if he was to agree to raise the support by $75.00 per month per child. Mind you, this will only be $200 per month per kid. He refuses. He says he doesn’t think it will be raised that much. So, we go into the court room. The judge is happy that both of us are present. She orders Mike to pay $206.00 per child and tells him that no matter what he wants to do with his life, he HAS to pay this support. He was currently in college and he thought he could use that to not pay so much. The Judge told him he was also to provide transportation for the kids for any visitation. If he wants them, he picks them up or what ever. AND he returns them. This was all verbal.  At this point, I’m thrilled. I got more than I asked for. And of course, the support is retroactive to the original filing date. It took almost a year to finish with court. Current plus arrears at 10%. WaHoo!   Fast forward a bit. I went to the DA’s office to open my case with them regarding collecting support. I was asking for them to transfer the case. As I was told by San Diego.  They denied me service. I currently had an open case in California that was enforcing the order, and they didn’t want to get involved. I told them that I went to California and got a modification of support. I then gave them a certified copy of this order. Still they wouldn’t open a case for me nor help me in any way. I then got really emotional and told them that it was there job to open the case, and help collect the monies. That THEY should have been the ones to help me file in the right court house to begin with. And it’s just not fair that I had to go through all this by myself when they were supposed to help me. I asked them over and over to transfer the case to Oregon, register the order and help me. All this time, they’ve refused.  Then, Bonnie did the unthinkable, she asked me to tell her who’s been telling me to transfer the case to Oregon. I did. When she tried to call SD, she couldn’t get through. So, I pulled out my handy dandy lil cell phone, with speaker phone. I called San Diego CSE office. I asked the same questions I always had; per speaker phone so she could hear the response.  “Can I get this case transferred to Oregon? Both kids and I live here, dad still lives in SD.” Always the same answer. “YES. Your local CSE office should request this to happen.” says the support agent in SD.  Bonnie was floored. She was embarrassed and pissed. She then turned her anger and embarrassment on me. She told me I was a disgrace to my daughter, who was present, for doing such a stunt. (Proving her wrong). And told me to get out, and she’d not have me back in the office. I will be dealt with by mail and by phone ONLY in the future. I have fought with these people for over two years. Just to get my case opened and heard.  I finally got my wish. BUT, they are in the process of transferring the case to Nevada, where my ex recently moved to. WTF ! They say that the case follows the NCP . BULL POOPY!   And so, the saga draws on. Bonnie, against her wishes, was instructed by her supervisor to send out a direct wage  withholding to Mike’s employer. She did so, then the next day, withdrew the order. It took another month to get a new wage withholding out to the employer. The employer was contacted and is confused by the stunts CSE is pulling. They don’t know if they should withhold or not at this point.  Bonnie was instructed to get support. So, she’s been calling Mike informing him to send money directly to Oregon. She relays that he says he was going to send some on the 12th of December. Here it is the 4th of January and NOTHINGS come in.  Bonnie told me that he got paid on the 26th of December, but she’s unsure whether the employer withheld any monies. It’s been 4.5 months since my last child support check. And everyday I have to call the DA’s office to make sure they are working my case. Otherwise, I’m afraid they will allow the case to fall through the cracks. On February 5, 2004, I finally received my first child support check since August of last year. My first child support check of the year. Hopefully it won’t be the last. It was for the full court ordered amount plus the ordered arrears. $224.86 is ordered every two weeks.  It is FINALLY starting to fall into place. The Child Support Enforcement office is still trying to work against me, as they tell me that I need an attorney for jurisdictional matters.  I have future plans of retaining an attorney and suing him for all that I can. I know this sounds really vindictive, but such is life. I am tired of being the one to explain to the kids why I can’t purchase the things they want. I am tired of worrying about whether the next check is going to come in so I make buy food and pay all the bills. Teenagers are expensive, and I’m NOT on any state aide at this time. My kids and I depend on that Child Support that the courts awarded. WE deserve it. I deserve the knowledge that I’ll be able to care for my kids without worries, and the kids deserve to get the necessities when needed. And of course, this is to be continued again. But for now, this is the end of this paper.

      On Feb 5, 2004, I received a child support check in the amount of $224.86. The first check of the year. Hopefully not the last. The first check since Aug. 26th, 2003. Hopefully not the last. CSE has not received another one since, and it's a bit past due. Since he got paid on 2/6. CSE should have received it no later than the 12th.  That means that I should have received it no later than today. INCLUDING the holiday.  Oh yea, I have receipts for bills that will be mailed tomorrow. To be sent with DELIVERY CONFIRMATION. All amounts are YOUR PORTION.   $84.00   for dental bills. For both kids. $  7.50   for an office visit for Jonathan $16.75   for a prescription for Jonathan. $108.25   Total due

What are ya gonna do when this guy dumps you? I understand this aint to far off... YOu've done everything in your power to create havoc everywhere you go...you thrive on drama, especially where the internet is concerned. I suspect this is actually a chicken sh*t way for you to deal with things--never have to really face people and all. You, my little psychotic friend, would have NO idea how to deal with me in person. THings have been so quiet--are you off your meds again? Yes, Judy, we know all about the prozac meds you need.  I told you I would leave you alone if you left me alone--and now ya gone and done it.....you forget, oh little psychotic one, that many of the posters here were also on the ssss board when you "snuck" in....have also read your posts....some were in sparc chat when you pretended to be me...some were in sparc chat when you got banned for starting your crap.....some were in ssss chat when you went there under my posting name....some of the posters here have actually heard your "lovely" messages you leave on our machine......Gosh, I could go on forever... My point? You have absolutely NO credibility here and you must know that. Posting or replying is for your drama filled life only. I'll tell ya what though--no matter what you do, say, post, b*tch about..I will always have the memory in court when the judge denied both your motions. The complete look of horror on your face--the redness that krept from your neck to the top of your head...that, my little psychotic one, was pure magic~ How really embarrassing for you? To not only be in the wrong court--but have my husbands family witness all of this.... Now, ya wanna keep this up? I'll risk banning-- Ya know, even if there was a way to prepay YOU--you'd only find something else to b*tch about. I'm done. [/B][/QUOTE]      MY REPLY:    Here ya go... Being the child... Ha ha, got ya pissed enough to go spouting off. LOL! Ya know, the only thing you have is ANGER. (maybe YOU should see someone) I have a LOVING husband and MY WONDERFUL kids and an extended family that supports me and my kids and my husband. MY husband is VERY supportive to me and MY CHILDREN. He's supporting me while I am in COLLEGE. HE'S supporting the kids, while MIKE is failing to pay ongoing support. So much so, that the arrears are in the amount of $8200.+ To date, I have NOT gotten a child support check from MIKE since Aug. 03.   IS that your problem? That MY husband is SO supportive of me and my kids? He's wanting me to stay in school and go for my B.A.! And to just hit home a bit... I DO have an income. But, it's not for you or Mike to know the details. I make enough to keep us happy.   All the 'history' you keep dragging up is your lousy attempt to re-start trouble. But, that's okay. You lie and I've proven it. Or should I say your "friend's" actually proved it. Remeber? No need to remind you, you remember...lol.  You have SOOOO much anger. When I replied to this, it was actually supposed to be kinda mocking, but more funny... Like Mike will EVER pay more than he has too. He couldn't even send the money that Bonnie, the CSE agent, told him to. To pay support directly to CSE until the wage withholding was received and collected on. FIVE months!  So, it's a complete JOKE that either of you would consider 'pre-paying' the support for the kids. This is YOUR loose attempt to try and bring about a cat fight. But, ya know what??? It doesn't matter, I don't care. I'm not gonna come on here calling you all sorts of names.  YOU ARE NOT WORTH IT.  I AM ABOVE YOU.  I AM BETTER THAN YOU. I won't stoop to your childish level.  You keep raising that blood pressure. I am at peace with myself, my kids, my husband and MY LIFE. You bring a smile to me, the thought of you ranting and raving this to MIKE. "How dare she respond to me?!" says Shelly! LOL, funnier than ****. I'm sure that this has caused a big fight in YOUR house.  Yea, I told Jon what YOU wrote... He laughed his ass off too. He said, "What a joke! He can't even pay what he owes right now." Then kissed me, and went to work as I was off to school.   Shelly, Breathe in ~~ breathe out... now repeat until calm... and smile.   __________________ Grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked anyway, the good fortune to run into the ones I do, and the eyesight to tell the difference.

      $84.00 for dental bills. For both kids. $ 7.50 for an office visit for Jonathan $16.75 for a prescription for Jonathan. $108.25 Total due  This is a SUMMARY of what Mike owes for Medical and Dental bills for the twins... Just a summary. I sent him ACTUAL COPIES of the bills for the kids. It showed what the total bill was, the insurance amount that they were gonna pay, and how much I owed and exactly how much I paid. I paid in full.  Then, on the bottom of one of the papers, I broke it down for him. His portion. Which is ONLY 50% of what I already paid. Basically, he's reimburrassing me for monies I've already put out for the bills. Simple enough??... NOPE... NOT FOR MIKE. I know, I know, he's just being a jerk... Doing what he does BEST!  But, don't ya realize that I WILL file contempt charges??? I put out this money. I took it from OUR income, knowing that Mike had to repay his portion. Knowing he wouldn't do so until he got his FULL 30 days grace period... Okay, fine, I paid at the time of service. As you almost ALWAYS have to do anymore. No more payment plans. Doctors and dentist's want their money at the time of service. SO, why should the NCP's get to do a payment plan when paying the CP back for dental and medical expenses??? They shouldn't.  Mike called the dentist. Talked to them about the bills. Verified that they were legit. I know, they told me they talked to him. That was RIGHT AFTER he got the bills!  SO, NOW, 32 days later, I get a $20 money order, and a note, It's reads:  "Judy     Here is part of the medical expenses. I am not going to send the dental  part until I get a breakdown of the dental cost. The way it looks the $166.00  is from a previous balance on your medical insurance. I also need a break  down on the dental insurance so I know what I am supposed to pay.                                                       Mike                                                  "  In the "mailing" i sent to Mike, I sent EVERYTHING he needed. Copies of the bills. The part regarding the $166 from previous balance???  is for previous stuff, IE: CLEANINGS! that are covered under insurance 100%. Would you like to pay for that too??? You would if I didn't have the insurance! You stupid f*ck!  Why would you WAIT the full 30 days if you had f*cking questions??? I know, I know, just to f*ck with me... Well, guess what? You are f*cking with the kids too. Because this is money that went out of the house, we are waiting for this money to come BACK INTO the house.  You have failed to follow the court order regarding medical and dental.

      I am so suprised / thrilled/ happy. I received another  Child Support check.(3rd one this year) This must mean the EMPLOYER has  finally  caught up with the current withholdings.  Hopefully this means that future cs payments will come on a regular schedule; ie: every two weeks. Way kewl!  The kids' 16th birthday is coming up. Both of them want to go skiing. So suprising. They had a blast. I'm not sure when they are gonna go because we've got activities all this month already! Camping with the Adventure Crew this weekend. 5 - 7 Weekend with the Gaurds next weekend. 12 - 14 Jessica to Mexico on the 20th - 27th Jennifer goes to SD. My birthday on the 25th. Going away for the two days. Jon goes to Ca on the 27th - 4/2 Easter is 4/11. I guess that's a good weekend for their birthday ski trip. It'll also give everybody time to recover from the muscle fatigue. LOL! This time, I'm taking ski lessons!  More later...

      I had to laugh... It's funny that Shelly is putting my kids' pictures on HER picture site. Does this really make her feel better? Maybe so, maybe people will think she's their mother and that makes her feel better.  Ya know, it does't bother me anymore.  I know that they don't like her. I know that she is the reason that Mike doesn't want to talk to nor see the kids. I know that she's the reason that he's not paid the balance. I also know that THEY are/were having marital troubles because of her being on the computer all night. She says she's a part of these people's lives that have been fighting for years. They have what he has with his kids.   *** What? A non-existant relationship?   Because of the new jealous partner in their lives? Pretty sad. She is right about one thing, they don't deserve to be treated with contempt by either her nor Mike. And that's the way it's been for 6 years. Sad, but true.  Just look back at all the postings Shelly has made. Look back at all the emails I've gotten FROM SHELLY. I lost a few, but still have the bulk of them. 6 years. The kids deserve better.  That is why I am giving them better. Because Mike won't.

      Dear Mike,  I have not received your check for $88.25, which became past due on 03/23/04, toward the balance of  your share for the children's dental expenses.  From time to time we all find ourselves preoccupied with other matters and fail to remember an obligation. I am sure this is merely an oversight on your part.  If you sent the payment in time to reach me by now, you may wish to contact your bank and arrange to have a "stop payment" placed on the original check so that another may be issued.  If this indeed was an oversight, please submit the full amount plus the additional interest as quickly as possible.  Thanks for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Sincerely,   Judy  Interest will accrue at 9% per legal advice and ORS 82.010 Balance   	   $ 88.25 Interest	                    7.94 Total due               $ 96.19   Note:   Chapter 774 Oregon Laws 2003 AN ACT HB 2498 Relating to interest on judgments; creating new provisions; and amending ORS 82.010.

      God Bless the USA  Lee Greenwood --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  If tomorrow all the things were gone . . I'd worked for all my life, And I had to start again . . with just my children and my wife, I'd thank my lucky stars . . to be livin' here today. Cause the flag still stands for freedom . . And they can't take that away.      And I'm proud to be an American     Where at least I know I'm free     And I won't forget the men who died     Who gave that right to me     And I gladly stand up . . next to you and defend her still today     Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land         God bless the USA  From the lakes of Minnesota  ... To the hills of Tennessee ... Across the plains of Texas  ... From sea to shining sea ... From Detroit down to Houston  ... And New York to LA     Well there's pride in every American heart     And its time we stand and say..  That I'm proud to be an American Where at least I know I'm free And I won't forget the men who died Who gave that right to me And I gladly stand up . . next to you and defend her still today Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land     God bless the USA  And I'm proud to be an American Where at least I know I'm free And I won't forget the men who died Who gave that right to me And I gladly stand up . . next to you and defend her still today Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land      God bless the USA!   "I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free, And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me, And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today, 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God Bless the U.S.A."   There are few songs that speak as strongly to America's patriotic pride as Lee Greenwood's classic "God Bless the U.S.A.". America is a land filled with courageous, giving people. People who fight for what is right. People who won't tolerate bullies. People who are there in times of crisis. And people who lend a hand.   We are a people who are proud to call ourselves Americans. God Bless the U.S.A. is a celebration of the legacy of freedom and the determination that made the U.S.A. the country it is.   From John Adams' telling his wife about the great decision to make the colonies "free and independent States" to Abraham Lincoln's resolve that the "government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth"; from the remarkable spirit of Chicago after the city was destroyed by fire, to Martin Luther King's dream that we all join hands and sing "Free at last, free at last, Thank God Almighty, we are free at last," the book portrays the indomitable spirit that has characterized Americans for more than 225 years.

      I am very suprised that the stalking is continueing. Seems that there is nothing else for her to do... That's okay. It's funny now.  There are many many new things happening in our lives, but of course, it's now posted on my 'other' site. This one is SECURE. Where the truth can be told and there is no fear of 'stealing' what i've written. I've found that when my words are quoted, they are reworded, and there are NEW words inputted as if I am saying more than I actually said. But, all is being reveiwed by my attorney. Enough here, this site will be gone very soon. Moved to the secure one when I have the extra time to just sit here...

      In light of the recent shooting in San Diego, let's see, I think it  started when Madeline Murray O'Hare complained she didn't want any prayer in our schools, and we said OK.   Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school.... the Bible that says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself. And we said, OK.    Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn't spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped  and we might damage their self-esteem. And we said, an expert should know what he's talking about so we said OK, we won't spank them anymore.    Then someone said teachers and principals better not discipline our children when they misbehave. And the school administrators said no faculty member in this school better touch a student when they misbehave because we don't want any bad publicity, and we surely don't want to be sued. (There's a big difference between disciplining and touching, beating, smacking, humiliating, kicking, etc.)  And we accepted their reasoning.    Then someone said, let's let our daughters have abortions if they want, and they won't even have to tell their parents. And we said, that's a grand idea.    Then some wise school board member said, since boys will be boys and they're going to do it anyway, let's give our sons all the condoms they want, so they can have all the fun they desire, and we won't have to tell their parents they got them at school. And we said, that's another great idea.    Then some of our top elected officials said it doesn't matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs. And agreeing with them, we said it doesn't matter to me what anyone, including the President, does in private as long as I have a job and the economy is good.    And then someone said let's print magazines with pictures of nude women and call it wholesome, down-to-earth appreciation for the beauty of the female body. And we said we have no problem with that.    And someone else took that appreciation a step further and published pictures of nude children and then stepped further still by making them available on the internet. And we said they're entitled to their free speech.    And the entertainment industry said, let's make TV shows and movies that promote profanity, violence, and illicit sex. And let's record music that encourages rape, drugs, murder, suicide, and satanic themes. And we said it's just entertainment, it has no adverse effect, and nobody takes it seriously anyway, so go right ahead.    Now we're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it doesn't bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.    Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with "WE REAP WHAT WE SOW."    Dear God,  Why didn't you save that child in California?    Sincerely,  Concerned Student    ..............................AND THE REPLY    Dear Concerned Student,  I am not allowed in schools.  Sincerely,  God.    Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell.    Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says.    Funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything the Bible says.    Funny how someone can say "I believe in God" but still follow Satan  who, by the way, also "believes" in God.    Funny how we are quick to judge but not to be judged.    Funny how you can send a thousand 'jokes' through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing.    Funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but the public discussion of Jesus is suppressed in the school and workplace.    Funny how someone can be so fired up for Christ on Sunday, but be an invisible Christian the rest of the week.    Are you laughing?    Funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to them.    Funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of me than what God thinks of me.    Are you thinking?    Pass it on if you think it has merit! If not then just discard it.... no one will ever know what you did, for sure.    But, if you discard this thought process, then don't sit back and complain about what a bad shape the world is in.....I sent it to everyone on my list.     Today I sent this e-mail out to most of the people on my list. I sent it because it struck a chord with me and I wanted to share. My friend Doug (and I do consider him a friend) had a response to it that I thought was kind of interesting as well and I wanted to share it too.    Funny how nobody, especially parents, ever wants to take responsiblity for the moral upbringing of their children. That's somebody else's responsibility.  Funny how when a child does good, nobody every says it was because of something he saw on tv, read in a book, learned from a teacher. That's when a parent suddenly feels responsibility.  Funny how people are still believing in centuries old myths that were made up to explain what had yet to be explained and blame the enlightened for all the problems of the world.  Funny how no matter how good a person is, if that person doesn't support prayer in schools, they are deemed a bad person.  Funny how this country was founded on the premise of freedom-freedom to practice any religion one chooses. Or not to practice if one chooses. Yet some people still try to impose their religious views by passing laws that support their narrow minded views.  Funny how, historically, more people have been killed in the name of religion than for all other reasons combined. Think I'm exaggerating--think the Crusades, the Holocaust, and look at the Middle East today. Religion breeds hate and religion kills.  I could go on endlessly but the simple fact is this. Each and every person is responsible for his or her own acts. Period. I don't care how much influence tv or movies or music or not praying in school has, when it comes down to it, at the moment they are about to pull the trigger, it is that persons choice. And that person should be held accountable-not the maker of the gun, the maker of the car that drove him to the crime scene, the movie he saw last night, the food he ate or whatever.  Now, would you forward this to al the same people? Didn't think so.  Then, please, don't ever send me religious propaganda.

      My mother sends me these little "story's". The are supposed to be inspiritional, but it's hard to live up to this. I am not perfect. I am not 92.  When I'm 92, I hope to finally be perfect. Do you think it'll be too late by then?

      GREAT ATTITUDE   The 92-year-old, petite, well-poised and proud lady, who is fully dressed each morning by eight o'clock,  with her hair fashionably coifed and makeup perfectly applied, even though she is legally blind, moved to a nursing home today.  Her husband of 70 years recently passed away, making the move necessary.  After many hours of waiting patiently in the lobby of the nursing home, she smiled sweetly when told her room was ready.  As she maneuvered her walker to the elevator, I provided a visual description of her tiny room, including the eyelet sheets that had been hung on her window.  "I love it," she stated with the enthusiasm of an eight-year-old having just been presented with a new puppy.  "Mrs. Jones, you haven't seen the room ... just wait."  "That doesn't have anything to do with it," she replied.  "Happiness is something you decide on ahead of time.  Whether I like my room or not doesn't depend on how the furniture is arranged...  it's how I arrange my mind.  I already decided to love it ...  "It's a decision I make every morning when I wake up.  I have a choice; I can spend the day in bed recounting the difficulty I have with the parts of my body that no longer  work, or get out of bed and be thankful for the ones that do.  Each day is a gift, and as long as my eyes open I'll focus on the new day  And all the happy memories I've stored away ...    Just for this time in my life.  Old age is like a bank account ...  You withdraw from what you've put in.  So, my advice to you would be to deposit a lot of happiness in the bank account of memories  Thank you for your part in filling my Memory bank.  I am still depositing.   Remember the five simple rules to be happy:  1. Free your heart from hatred.  2. Free your mind from worries.  3. Live simply.  4. Give more.  5. Expect less.   FAMILY  Are you aware that if we died tomorrow, the company that we are working for could easily replace us in a matter of days. But the family we left behind will feel the loss for the rest of their lives.  And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more into work than into our own family, an unwise investment indeed, don't you think?  So what is behind the story?  Do you know what the word FAMILY means?   FAMILY = (F)ATHER (A)ND (M)OTHER (I) (L)OVE (Y)OU

      Reply to : smarty_panties   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope everyone had a good day.you know what my favorite picture on the SSSSart link is?"you alienate the children from their dad then crow he has abandoned them"Thats the text...it's a picture of a proud momma bird feeding her baby birds as the dad sits defeated inside the cage getting shit on.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I do not alienate my kids from there dad. I have called him, in the past, asking him to call the kids. HE went so far as to get an order to be able to call them on Sunday evenings.   I had been offering a time and day for years.  A schedule because he didn't know when to call.  He chooses not to call.  It's court ordered, they answer the phone when he did call, (7:30pm or Caller Id.) I even tell the kids to go into a different room.   I do not listen in,  I HAVE in the past due to my daughter crying and all upset ~ that she'll NEVER talk to him again.  They HAVE told him, if he's gonna be childish, don't call. BUT, we've since gotten past that barrier. Talked about it.  He SAID he understood what the kids meant and how they felt.  Would start calling again.    Now, Easter and he didn't call. I just think it is a bummer for the kids.    For years I tried to MAKE Mike be a dad, take part in the kids' lives. The ONLY reason there is now a set court order is that I filed a modification of support and he replied with full custody.  YEARS after we move to Oregon, he says I didn't have permission to move to Oregon. YEARS.  Grandparents even had both kids for the summer one year and he never said one word about us living in Oregon.  I don't need to hear from you how I am alienating my kids from there father, I have not. I have done the opposite, stupidly, tried to force him to be a dad.  I now know, I should have just left him alone and let the kids forget him. Do you realize that he never contacted us after we got up here, I ALWAYS called him to tell him what was going on. Tried to get him to talk to the kids. They didn't really know him when we lived in SD and he only lived 10 minutes away. I called his parents numerous times, asking them to talk to Mike about taking the kids for a few hours or maybe over night.  They would always say they would try, but he never listened to them, and they didn't know if it would do any good. The grandparents took the kids some. More often than Mike.   Ya know, there was a time that I had to PAY Mike money to watch his kids so I could go to a parenting class.  I wanted to go to this class because they told me it had SOOOO much helpful stuff dealing with twins and Multiples.... If I'd missed that class, i'd have to have waited another 3 months for it to be offered again. SO, I paid him. TO watch his own kids.  How sad is that?  This other time, I invited Mike over to watch a movie with the kids, (so i could get some cleaning done and maybe go grocery shopping), and He DID come over, but I couldnt' leave. He said, I had to stay right there and watch the movie too. I kept getting up to do one more thing. He said that since I wasn't gonna sit with him to watch the movie, he was leaving. So, he left. Cuz that's the one time i didnt' give in. If he did ever come over, it wasnt' to watch the kids or see the kids, It was to see me or be with me. Yes, to make sure my kids grew up knowing there father, I gave in too often.  Everyone told me to  not even bother with him as the kids' daddy. They would be better off not knowing him. Well, I didn't listen because I didn't know MY REAL FATHER growing up, I didn't want my kids to grow up like that too.  I have Mike on tape, saying he wouldn't come over to watch the kids so I could have a break. It was recorded when the twins were 4 or 5. I needed a few hours, I was STRESSING hard. Knowing he was about 10 minutes away. Don't you think he could have helped me a little??? NO! He flat out said no, I asked him what he was doing, he said "NOTHING... "   Now, years later, I am trying to keep this line of communication open... Trying to "force" him to be a dad. Shoud I just quite? Like everyone tells me too?  His wife thinks i should just give up, his parents too. So, maybe you all are right.  The kids will continue to sit home, waiting for his calls and nothing will come. So, what do I tell them? All during the fights and shit going on, they still sit and wait.  Maybe if we disappeared, and I didn't post what's happening in our lives, he'd call to find out? No. I dont' think so, cuz when I didnt' post, and didn't call except to give him a new address or phone number or to tell him that Jonathan broke his foot, he didn't call back or contact the kids in anyway.   He never even followed up about Jonathan's foot. The kids need eye exams and glasses. He's to pay for 50% of that, he's still not paid for services rendered in  Jan ~ Feb.  It's almost the end of April.   The only credit I can give to LW, is that she did get Mike to show some interest in the kids for a while.  She pushed him to go for the custody and then to settle for set visitation. She just didn't think he'd be ordered to pay the 406 per month and 50% of the medical bills. (althogh he agreed to the 50% of medical, dental and vision) AND all the arrears. That was a bonus.   Anyways, regardless of Mike calling or not, we all had a good Easter.

      We have midterms for Payroll accounting and Business on April 24. Next Thursday. Payroll accounting is going GREAT. I really like the work. It's coming pretty easy. Business. It's all about the vocabulary. Needing to study the words. I have written them, now my goal will be to type them all up. Then I can hopefully use them as notes.    I picked up Rebecca today. She didn't have school tomorrow and she's here for the weekend. I talked to Jon about keeping her. I will need to talk to her Case worker about applying to be her foster parent. I don't want to see her going into yet another group home type place. She enjoys coming here and we enjoy having her here. The girls are going to my mom's tomorrow night.   Sandy will be here tomorrow night, so Jennifer will go with her and Kim to a hotel to do girly things.  My mom suggested that Sandy take both Jennifer and Jessica shopping to buy an easter dress. I mentioned it to Sandy and hopefully she'll do just that.  Since ASSHOLE Mike isn't sending the money for the medial bills now.  ASSHOLE Doug isn't paying support, hasn't paid regularley in over a year. I am sic'n TEXAS AG office on him. They told me all the goodies they can do to him. I just need support.   Well, gotsta get to bed.

      OMG! Doesn't Shelly know when to quit. She tried to get my FA account deleted... Isn't it enough that she got my YAHOO account deleted along with all of Jessica's Mexico Mission Pictures???   Mike called today, saying he wasn't sending the money for Jessica's doctors bills on Friday like he said he would...  Now, I doubt it if he's gonna send Jessica the signed poster and the CD from Jessica Andrews he says he got her. I bet he's gonna give it to Nicole. Oh well. Jessica will ask him about it sometime and HE can LIE to her.  Doens't he understand the medical bills(50%) are on top of child support.He's getting off pretty easy with $206 per kid per month.  He's says that BOTH of his jobs are now garnishing him for support. Well, DUH! He was ordered to get a second job a year ago so he could pay the full support. He's not done it till now, and when I found out about his second job, I called CSE and told them to collect from the second job also. I will be getting the full support ordered now. FINALLY!  School It was better today. 4 hours for 1 class is a long time. But it was more interesting today. 8 more days then on to another set of classes. Each 'semester' is 5 weeks. Starting this summer, some of the classes will be 10 weeks, still 2 days per week.  But hey, i'll be walking out with an associate's in Business. Way kewl. Later.

I dont' give a flying rats ass shit about keeping the peace any longer. She's stepped over the bounds for the last time.  And it's not because of the last post she made.  Revenge WILL be mine. She's fucked up for the last time.   This is NOT a threat. This is a promise. There will be a restraingin order put of her fucking FAT ass. Yes, Shelly is FAT. NOT big like me, whom carries the extra 20 pounds well. She's flabby fat ass.  She also doesn't and CAN"T have any kids of her own, so she comes onto message boards and BITCHES and moans and groans about MY kids and her OWN neice. Her neice is a normal, nice, sweet TEENAGER. WELL behaved and doesn't deserve to be stabbed in the back like she gets from Shelly.  I pity her haveing to live with the likes of Shelly.     I also pity my EX, he doesn't know what the hell Shelly does or says or writes on these boards. THAT"S why she disappeared for a short time. I TOLD him about what she wrote about Jessica going to MEXICO. Shelly's thoughts of WHY Jessica wanted to go.   Shelly is just SOOOOOOOO jealous. PERIOD.

       Do you know that at military funerals, the 21 gun salute actually stands for the sum of the numbers in the year 1776?   I hope you have noticed the honor guard pays meticulous attention to correctly folding the American flag 13 times?  You probably thought it was to symbolize the original 13 colonies, but we learn something new every day!  Be surprised at the following only because "they" quit teaching this around 1955 in public schools... some of you out there might remember.   The 1st fold of our flag is a symbol of life.   The 2nd fold is a symbol of our belief in eternal life.   The 3rd fold is made in honor and remembrance of the veterans departing our ranks who gave a portion of their lives for the defense of our country to attain peace throughout the world.   The 4th fold represents our weaker nature, for as American citizens trusting in God, it is to Him we turn in times of peace as well as in time of war for His divine guidance.   The 5th fold is a tribute to our country, for in the words of Stephen Decaur, "Our Country, in dealing with other countries, may she always be right; but it is still our country, right or wrong."   The 6th fold is for where our hearts lie. It is with our hearts that, "We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States Of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all."   The 7th fold is a tribute to our Armed Forces, for it is through the Armed Forces that we protect our country and our flag against all her enemies, whether they be found within or without the boundaries of our republic.   The 8th fold is a tribute to the one who entered into the valley of the shadow of death, that we might see the light of day.   The 9th fold is a tribute to womanhood, and Mothers. For it has been through their faith, their love, loyalty and devotion that the character of the men and women who have made this country great has been molded.   The 10th fold is a tribute to the fathers, for they, too, have given their sons and daughters for the defense of our country since they were first born.   The 11th fold represents the lower portion of the seal of King David and King Solomon and glorifies in the Hebrews' eyes, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.   The 12th fold represents an emblem of eternity and glorifies, in the Christians' eyes, God the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit.  The 13th fold, or when the flag is completely folded, the stars are uppermost reminding us of our nation's motto, "In God We Trust." After the flag is completely folded and tucked in, it takes on the appearance of a cocked hat, ever reminding us of the soldiers who served under General George Washington, and the sailors and marines who served under Captain John Paul Jones, who were followed by their comrades and shipmates in the Armed Forces of the United States, preserving for us the rights, privileges and freedoms we enjoy today.   There are some traditions and ways of doing things that have deep meaning. In the future, you'll see flags folded and now you will know why.   Printing this out and handing a copy to those who would distribute it to school children and/or congregations is appropriate at a time such as we face today. Please share this with the children you love and all others who love what this symbol stands for... by God's grace it will continue to stand thusly... for and by "Liberty and Freedom

       Are You Ready for Children?    Are you considering having children? To determine whether you are truly prepared for the experience, we suggest you take this set of simple tests...   MESS TEST:  Smear peanut butter on the sofa and curtains. Now rub your hands in the wet flower bed and rub on the walls. Cover the stains with crayons. Place a fish stick behind the couch and leave it there all summer.   TOY TEST:  Obtain a 55-gallon box of Legos. (If Legos are not available, you may substitute roofing tacks or broken bottles.) Have a friend spread them all over the house. Put on a blindfold. Try to walk to the bathroom or kitchen. Do not scream (this could wake a child at night).   GROCERY STORE TEST:  Borrow one or two small animals (goats are best) and take them with you as you shop at the grocery store. Always keep them in sight and pay for anything they eat or damage.   DRESSING TEST:  Obtain one large, unhappy, live octopus. Stuff into a small net bag making sure that all arms stay inside.   FEEDING TEST:  Obtain a large plastic milk jug. Fill halfway with water. Suspend from the ceiling with a stout cord. Start the jug swinging. Try to insert spoonfuls of soggy cereal (such as Fruit Loops or Cheerios) into the mouth of the jug while pretending to be an airplane. Now dump the contents of the jug on the floor.   NIGHT TEST:  Prepare by obtaining a small cloth bag and fill it with 8 to 12 pounds of sand. Soak it thoroughly in water. At 8:00 PM begin to waltz and hum with the bag until 9:00 PM. Lay down your bag and set your alarm for 10:00 PM. Get up, pick up your bag, and sing every song you have ever heard. Make up about a dozen more and sing these too until 4:00 AM. Set alarm for 5:00 AM. Get up and make breakfast. Keep this up for five years. Look cheerful.   PHYSICAL TEST (WOMEN)  Obtain a large beanbag chair and attach it to the front of your clothes. Leave it there for 9 months. Now remove 10% of the beans.   PHYSICAL TEST (MEN):  Go to the nearest drug store. Set your wallet on the counter. Ask the clerk to help himself. Now proceed to the nearest food store. Go to the head office and arrange for your paycheck to be directly deposited to the store. Purchase a newspaper. Go home and read it quietly for the last time.   FINAL ASSIGNMENT:  Find a couple who already have a small child. Lecture them on how they can improve their discipline, patience, tolerance, toilet training, and child's table manners. Suggest many ways they can improve. Emphasize to them that they should never allow their children to run riot. Enjoy this experience. It will be the last time you will have all the answers.

      I have my OWN blogger now. Way kewl!! 4/6/03 Today I found out that my daughter's friend was molested by a 19 year old 'friend'. "Rita" is 15, almost 16 and states that this guy is her 'friend'... She doesn't think he did anything wrong... but yet he locked her in the car, forced her to do things to him, and touched her. Then when she refused to have sex with him, she fought to get out and he flipped her off, called her names, and drove off fast. Some friend. I think not.  I'd like to find this 'friend' and have a few words with him.  My daughter just turned 15 and follows these girls home almost everyday. I will be following the girls home tomorrow with a video camara. The cop said I prolly shouldn't make contact, as I could get into trouble. The pictures will help alot and he is encouraging this. So, till tomorrow. Chaio.

       Posted in reply by me, Jchallquist to Shelly Carpenter Queen Bee   Date Posted: 05/30/2003 8:57 PM                        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  honestly, after two mornings of early morning calls, and a message to bitch and complain, Im thinking maybe its my voice you REALLY want to hear????  YOu had daughter call once--you want a medal or something? and that was at 9:30 at nite not at  court set phone visitation time--like you claimed before.  ME: Court order is for dad to call kids. He can't, so yes, I had Jessica call him. Several times. On MY cell phone.  Still cant believe you still use real names on these boards?  ME:  Get over it already.  You should see my journal... You'd have a cow!!!   I sent off an extra 100$  back in March (maybe april?) to CSE....  ME:  You? Well, any monies recieved through support enforcement will go towards arrears. Or didn't they tell you that?  I have talked to them several times regarding this issue. Check it out if you like.  I have not received ANY extra monies.  BTW, why would YOU send off money to CSE when you don't think it's even a REAL bill??? As you've stated, No receipts, no money...  emergency my ass---you would have called back over and over again, or called his  work like you've done before....or called grandparents.....  ME:  So, you don't know that Mike and I have talked? Right before he has to go to school? It's okay, he's a big boy, he can deal with me directly. YOU brought this to the boards.  kids will have pager number and cell phone number, maybe....yeah, thats right, I control my husband and his actions with his children.....  ME:  We all know this.  get a grip, stop calling, get a life......if ya called once, and left a message regarding some kind of "emergency",  life would go on....but twice and almost at the same time, when you know damn well he's not here? It's really my voice, huh? my husband told you before, my gate dont swing that way.....  ME:  Twice? You are mistaken. You ASSume that I called twice, I only need to call once.  Was not I. Your gate don't swing what way??? Are you suggesting that you may be gay? I wouldn't have thought that of you...   ME:  Again, have a great day.!  To everyone else, I know I know.... But SHE started it    LOL   ~judy~

         Posted by Shelly Carpenter on flamewars as lovingwife   Date Posted: 05/30/2003 11:46 AM                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The freakin phone calls at 7:30 am and 8:00 am will get you a hang up every time...in case you havent figured that out yet! (I know, everyone, here we go again....public humiliation is about the only way to get through~)  WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU???? Dont you have a bus to drive or clean, or something at that time in the morning? You've threatened small claims court, collection agencies, etc....but still refuse to send a hard copy of any receipt or paid bill through CC, RR mail---do you actually think anyone in their right mind would pay a bill, or a questionable one at best posted on a stupid web page, without some kind of proof? Get a grip and start doing things the way you should-  AND STOP CALLING AND FOLLOW THE COURT ORDERS AND STOP LEAVING THREATENING MESSAGES ON OUR MACHINE, LOOSER.  Wait, let me send you a few quarters so you can call someone who might want to actually listen--fireheart or butternut?  phone number will be changed again, and very soon......what ya gonna do then? oh wait, maybe start using email and US mail like you're supposed to?????  ya know, many times, my husband talks to you and listens to your rants and ravings because of his kids--BUT, I DONT HAVE TO AND IF YOU KEEP CALLING, YOU WILL GET HUNG UP ON WHEN I ANSWER~UNDERSTAND.  7:30, 8:00 IN THE FREAKIN MORNING---WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? POLITENESS?????  FLAME ON---    Date Posted: 05/30/2003 2:17 PM                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  DH requested a print out of all his payments made to cse since the very beginning--and I highly recommend everyone do this....  This is actual hard proof what has been paid and I was like, boy, sure does smell like someone's pants are on fire!!!! And even before any arrears, many many months of overpayment! Not that there is anything that can be done about it now, but  geesh, unbelievable!!!!!  And ya know, kids were born in March, payments began that May!!!  Cry me a river now, Kook~  (I'm on a roll today, huh? guess waking me up wasnt such a good thing to do--lol)     Date Posted: 05/30/2003 4:07 PM                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Not quite sure I follow you, LB as I am not stressed, just agravated that once again, lies been proved as lies. I was personally told many times what a deadbeat/looser my husband was for non-support---- (along with many posts on several boards saying the same thing)now it seems, thats was not the case.(cse printout)  Anyway, as far as the early morning phone calls-- DH is not home at this time, a fact well known by kooky, so I cant hand the phone to him. Due to my job and subbing on Fridays, I have to answer the phone as the automated system will not leave a message. So, sure, there's  a chance an early morning phone call could be for work and then I dont mind being woke up----but to hear that whiney voice when the reason is to bitch about something.....urghhhhh!!!!!  DH has told her on numerous occasions to not call unless it's an emergency....follow the court order.  The phone's in my name and the number will be changed--kids can use pager number or cell phone when he gets it activated, but they rarely call anyway. (not a bitch, just a fact)  Ya know, my husband, out of respect for her family, would never, never, ever call her house before 9 am or after 8 am in the evening...he's never done that, at least since we have shared a home.  I got the calls, my complaint, I guess? lol  much calmer now~~    Posted by me on Flamewars  Date Posted: 05/30/2003 7:15 PM                      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I'm sorry that you can't deal with the fact that Mike is MY EX. And that we have children together.  Mike needs to deal with me directly. I don't call and ask for you. You don't know what the reason is that I called.  Are you soooo sure that there wasn't an emergency? Ya know??   I did leave a message for MIKE. NOT you. If you choose to change the phone number, you'll finally succeed in keeping Mike from his kids, as I am the one that has Jessica call him because he doesn't call.  I understand his fustration in not wanting to call, he'd have you to deal with after the fact...   He has acknowledged that he needs to pay his half of the medical bills from Jan/Feb. Now it is a matter of WHEN he's allowed to pay it.  At one point in time, YOU wanted me to email YOU with my address so YOU could send off the payment that day.  SO, YOU also acknowledge that this needs to be paid.  Anyways, please have a good day!!!!  ~Judy~

      $10.00  Freaking Dollars. How much of an insult is that? Doug owes over $6000 in child support. If I added it all up plus interest, he'd be  a very unhappy person.  So, I received $10 today. It even says for Child Support. Is that all he thinks Jennifer's worth? I know, I should be grateful I got anything. Okay, I'll try.   Mike has NOT paid his portion of the medical bills for Jessica from January. He's a loser too. Dougs' been a loser since March 2002. Mike's been a loser since meeting Shelly, the CUM GURGGLING GUTTER SLUT!  LOL  Today I started a new "mod" semester. I have keyboarding on Monday and Wednesday's. 2 hour class. On Tuesday and Thursday I have Organizational Management for 4 hours, and Business Management for 2 hours. Long day. Then of course, Friday off. YEAH! I am still feeling a bit icky from being sick. Going on two and a half weeks.   I'm gonna go tanning, it'll warm me up and make me feel better.  SO, laters!!!

      DAMN DAMN DAMN! I hate being SICK!  I have a viral sinus infection. It hurts. I can't breathe. When I blow my nose, I feel like i'm on a child's merry-go-round. REALLY not fun.  I've missed too much school and now have to make up tons of work. We've got finals next week.  Tuesday is Payroll Accounting. It's 12 hours worth of work on one payroll sheet. A full chapter of worksheets.   Then I have another class that I can't think of the name. It's gone.My brain feels as clogged as my nose. My ears feel as if they are gonna burst. I blow my nose and my ears do this sucky-squeshey thing, while i'm on the merry-go-ropund. It's too much. Wednesday's class is not gonna be too bad. Just need to review 4 chapters and read 2. Jane Gerrard is the instructor. She's a writer. You can find her books on Amazon.com ~ the hot, steamy ones!.LOL Then i've got Thursday and Friday off and then the next Monday we start a new Mod.  Next mod my classes will be light. 2 hours of Keyboarding on Monday and Wednesday and then 2 classes (total 6 hours) on Tuesday and Thursday.   Gonna go check my ebay to see if i've got any bidders.  Later.

      I've been seriously messing with Magnorfis for the last couple days.  It's been fun.  I finally sent him an email from my email addy and he figured out that all the other posts to his blog was from me. I wonder if he knows I commented on his http://Fotolog.com too???  TOO funny. Ya see, he's got holes in his head. Piercings. I think that over the years, the knowledge he's got, has seeped out of his head slowly... OOZING out of all the holes/piercings. Pretty gross if you just got a visual as I just did... HA HA HA...  Anyways, Mike and Shelly are still DICKS. It's pretty funny that SHELLY has been writing that the money to pay me back for the medical bills Jessica accured, has either been sent directly to me, or sent to CSE and I "should have gotten an extra $100." during a certain month. But then, MIKE says he's NOT gotten any of the receipts I sent. I sent them through regular snail mail, and I also scanned and emailed them to HIM several times. He didn't get any of them... Prolly not, I'm sure SHELLY got them and threw them away or deleted them. SHE does check his emails.   SO, last Thursday, I sent them CRRR. Certified, return receipt, restricted. HE has to sign for them. NOBODY else can. Now, how much ya want to bet that,. him knowing they were sent, HE won't ever be home, and won't get them this time also. HE owes 104.98 in Medical and vision expenses. I'm gonna try to get insurance starting next month. He has to pay 50% of this as he's supposed to get insurance for the kids. He's not, so I have to.   The day after school let out my mother took the twins to Ca. for a short vacation.  Jessica was putting bug repellant on herself. It had 95% deet, which is the bug killer stuff. Usually bug sprays only have 5%... THIS had 95%. Anyways, Jessica was spraying her arm, and the pump twisted and she sprayed in her eye. OUCH!.  My mom rinsed her eye with water, used Visene, and saline solution.  This wasn't enough. She was still swollen and red and irritated. I took her to an eye doctor. He said she shouldn't have any permamant damage, and gave her a prescription for 54.00 eye drops! But, within two days, her eye is really clearing up. Not 100% yet, but doing great. Now, She needs an eye exam for glasses. 95.00 for that. Mike's gonna love us when he gets all these bills. Cuz, Jonathan needs an exam too.   Later...

      If you are from the northern states and are planning on visiting or moving to the South, there are a few things you should know that will help you adapt to the difference in lifestyles:    The North has coffee houses, The South has Waffle Houses.   The North has dating services, The South has family reunions.   The North has switchblade knives, The South has Lee Press-on Nails.   The North has double last names, The South has double first names.   The North has Ted Kennedy, The South has Jesse Helms.   The North has Indy car races, The South has stock car races.   The North has Cream of Wheat, The South has grits.   The North has green salads, The South has collard greens.   The North has lobsters, The South has crawdads.   The North has the rust belt, The South has the Bible Belt.   In the South:   If you run your car into a ditch, don't panic, four men in a four-wheel drive pickup truck with a tow chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help them, just stay out of their way, this is what they live for.   Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and bait in the same store.... Do not buy any food at this store.   Remember, "y'all" is singular, "all y'all" is plural, and "all y'all's" is plural possessive.   Get used to hearing "You ain't from round here, are ya?"   Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed later on how to use it.   Don't be worried at not understanding what people are saying. They can't understand you either.   The first Southern statement to creep into a transplanted Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective "big'ol," truck or "big'ol" boy.   Most Northerners begin their Southern-influenced dialect this way. All of them are in denial about it. The proper pronunciation you learned in school is no longer proper.   Be advised that "He needed killin" is a valid defense here.   If you hear a Southerner exclaim, "Hey, y'all, watch this," you should immediately move aside and stay out of the way. These are likely to be the last words he'll ever say.   If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the smallest accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local grocery store. It doesn't matter whether you need anything or not, you just have to go there.   Do not be surprised to find that 10-year-olds own their own shotguns, they are proficient marksmen, and their mammas taught them how to aim.   In the South, we have found that the best way to grow a lush green lawn is to pour gravel on it and call it a driveway.   AND REMEMBER:   If you do settle in the South and bear children, don't think we will accept them as Southerners. After all, if the cat had kittens in the oven, we wouldn't call 'em biscuits.

      Funny thoughts...  A fiftyish woman was at home, happily jumping on her bed and squealing with delight.   Her husband watched her for a while and then asked, "Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look? What's the matter with you?"   The woman continued to bounce on the bed and said, "I don't care. I just came from having a mammogram and the doctor says I have the breasts of an 18 year-old."   The husband said, "What did he say about your 55 year old ass?"  "Your name never came up," she replied.

      Damn damn damn... I gotta remember that this doesn't automatically save. Anyways, here it is again.  5 more days of classes. Then TWO weeks off. I need a break from school. The new term starts July 7. At that time, the terms go from 5 weeks to 10 weeks.  Ouch. For some classes it's okay, for others it's good. We'll see.  Jd graduated on June 6, 2003.  On June 16, he's registering for college.  For his graduation, we are sending him on this trip...   urlLink   Check it out. It's kewl. He's waiting till closer to his birthday so his friends can go too.  JD also got his drivers' license on June 4.  Jessica passed the drivers' permit test finally. She took it at school on June 10 and only missed 3 this time. Way kewl. She failed it 4 other times.  On June 12, she got her got her picture id. Now she can drive with me. Oh boy, not looking forward to this!!  Jonathan hasn't taken the test even once. I don't think he wants to even drive. I think maybe he's afraid to grow up...   Jennifer leaves here on Father's Day, June 15 to go to NEW YORK. She'll be there for one week then fly to San Diego till July 31. Sandy's not happy about not having her all summer, but oh well. She's my daughter, not hers! Dougs' NOT paying support. The last check I got was $10. WOW! He's not even staying in touch with me like he said he would. Sandy won't tell me anything either.  Danielle was molested by Joe. Joe's in jail.  You don't want to know what I think about it.  Lori's John, well, he got fired on June 8.  He was hired in late April. Not even 2 full months. So sad. Lori gave up housing for this loser.  NOW, he's gonna try to go back into the Navy. He's 38 years old. Do ya really think they are gonna take him back???  I doubt it. Especially when he got a medical discharge the first time. He's a loser, and always will be. He's on probation and out drinking at the bar. He's hanging with his brother and HE"S a druggy. Such a life.  And then of course, the kids.  They don't belong with Lori. She's VERY abusive. Knocks them upside the head all the time. Screams all the time. Trevor acts just like her then gets his ass beat. Mike takes care of the boys, i'd say, 90% of the time. He's making bottles, changing diapers, and watching the boys.  Joe stabbed himself in the foot when he was playing in the backyard. Lori was moving and packing and had the kids out in the backyard. Knives lay around all the time in their house. It's a wonder that something hasn't happened before now.  Well, enough for now. I'll be back though, keep watching this soap. LOL

      It's been awhile since i've posted any real stuff...  2 weeks ago, my step-son, JD, wrecked his 3 week old, *95 Chrysler Cirrus. He was coming down Baker Creek, back into town.  He took the sharp 45 degree turn TOOOO fast. 60 - 65 on a 25 turn. Well, he turned hard once he reliazed what was happening, and hit gravel. He went into the ditch... drove the ditch about 300 feet. No problem there... An alignment at best. Well, THEN he tried to overcorrect to get out of hte ditch and back onto the road. He underestimated how deep the ditch was. He turned hard the the left, and ended up flipping the car. It flipped several times before landing on it's hind end. Then it fell over onto it's roof. OUCH!!!    JD is 17 years old. Still. He'd only had his license for a month and 8 days.  He'd ONLY had the car for 16 days. He was given an *88 Camero for Graduation from my parents. It was a beater, gas hog. He sold that for $1500. to a friend. He bought this BEAUTIFUL Cirrus for ONLY $2100.! PAID IN FULL. The insurance was gonna be a little spend-y so I decided to wait till the 30 day grace period was up to get the car insured.  It was covered by MY FULL CONVERAGE Windstar for the first 30 days.  Since he wrecked it, it was covered. I got a check for over double what we paid for it. (It was in my name as he's too young to OWN a car.) So, we went and got him a *94 Toyota Tercel... BTW, the Cirrus only had 100 k miles on it.   The Tercel has 111K miles on it, but we paid $2950. for it. Oh, I almost got off track... Jd only had his license for just over a month. He's not allowed to drive with ANYONE in the car except FAMILY. Charlie, his friend, IS NOT FAMILY. He was in the car during the wreck. He's got a sprained neck. Gonna be okay, but I expect that we'll be suid. Jd only has a minor sprained neck.  Both front windows were down and the are real lucky they were. Otherwise, there heads would be okay. And they might not have even lived through the wreck. They were both wearing seat belts. THANK GOD!!!  In other news! Jessica is now working with a total of three family's farms. She riding horses and training them.  The latest farm that we found has 3 babies, 5 adults and 2 yearlings. SHE'S SOOO HAPPY. She's also babysitting for 2 different families.   Jonathan is playing. He's camping, shooting guns, playing disc golf, and of course video games.  I just got him a computer, well it's all three kids, but he'll be the one on it the most. With all the computer games.   Jennifer comes home this Thursday. She's been at her gramma's. She went to New York right after school let out. She was there for a week. Then off to San Diego to gramma's house. I miss her, and can't wait to  pick her up from the airport Thursday. YEAH!!  All my grades are still up in the A's and B's. I'm taking Integrated Accounting, Microsoft Word, Excel, Sociology, and Verbal Communications. Big load.  7 hours; two days per week and two hours; the other two days per week. Fridays off! YEAH.  Well, that's about it for now. Till next time.

      A woman and a man are involved in a car accident; it's a bad one. Both of their cars are totally demolished but amazingly neither of them is hurt. After they crawl out of their cars, the woman says,  "So you're a man. That's interesting. I'm a woman.  "Wow, just look at our cars! There's nothing left, but we're unhurt. This must be a sign from God that we should meet and be friends and  live together in peace for the rest of our days".  Flattered, the man replied, "Oh yes, I agree with you completely!" "This must be a sign from God!" The woman continued, "and look at this, here's another miracle. My car is completely demolished but this bottle of wine didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good fortune."  Then she hands the bottle to the man. The man nods his head in agreement, opens it and drinks half the bottle and then hands it back  to the woman.  The woman takes the bottle and immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the man.  The man asks, "Aren't you having any?"  The woman replies, "No. I think I'll just wait for the police...."  MORAL OF THE STORY: Women are clever, evil bitches. Don't mess with them.

      FARM BOY A little boy comes down to breakfast. Since they live on a farm, his mother asks if he has done his chores.   'Not yet,' says the little boy.  His mother tells him no breakfast until he does his chores. Well, he's a little pissed, so he goes to feed the chickens and he kicks a chicken. He goes to feed the cows and he kicks a cow. He goes to feed the pigs and he kicks a pig.  He goes back in for breakfast and his mother gives him a bowl of dry cereal. 'How come I don't get any eggs and bacon? Why don't I have any milk in my cereal?' he asks.  'Well,' his mother says, 'I saw you kick a chicken, so you don't get any eggs for a week. I saw you kick the pig, so you don't get any bacon for a week either. I also saw you kick the cow so for a week you aren't getting any milk.'  Just then, his father comes down for breakfast and kicks the cat half way across the kitchen. The little boy looks up at his mother with a smile and says, 'Are you going to tell him, or should I?!'"

      Subject: Fw:   BITCHOLOGY   (I love this one)  When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they call me a  bitch .  When I stand up for those I love, they call me a  bitch .  When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or  do things my own way, they call me a  bitch .  Being a  bitch  means I won't compromise what's in my heart.  It means I live my life MY way.  It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.  When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak against it, I am defined as a  bitch . The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being everyones maid,  or when I act a little selfish.  It means I have the courage and strength to allow myself to be who I truly am  and won't become anyone else's idea of what they think I "should" be.  I am outspoken, opinionated and determined.  I want what I want and there is nothing wrong with that!  So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame,  try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold within me.  You won't succeed.  And if that makes me a  bitch , so be it. I embrace the title and am proud to bear it.   B - Babe  I - In  T - Total  C - Control of  H - Herself   B = Beautiful  I = Intelligent  T = Talented  C = Charming  H = Hell of a Woman  B = Beautiful  I = Individual  T = That  C = Can  H = Handle anything   "If you can't do something right, get a woman to do it."

      In May 2004, I will finish college earning an Associate's Degree in Business Administration.  I will have 90 credits. If I continue, taking an additional 5 classes, I will also earn an Associate's in Accounting. It's an additional 10 weeks of school if all the classes I need are offered at the same term. I could possibly split my time between both campuses so as to finish within the same term. My new complete date would be July 2004.  Graduation isn't til October 2004.  Should I? I think so. Two A.A.'s?? How kewl would that be? All within 2 years!!   Why would   ANYBODY   go to a junior college to obtain an A.A.???? When you can get done in 16 months. And 18 months for TWO!!!!

Although Lori and I aren't talking, i figured i'd put her here too.  She won't give me back a water caraf that I LOANED her. Her loser boyfriend tells her she can't give it back because HE lost a game that Jonathan had borrowed and gave back... But Loser John lost it and is blaming Jonathan. Lori even agrees that it's not right, but won't stand up for me to him... So, she's just as much a loser as he is..

      Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you,  Happy Birthday dear Jennifer,  Happy Birthday to you!!!  Friday was her birthday. I got her a huge Care Bear; Bedtime Bear, the blue one... :) I got her two pair of earrings, a super long scarf, (just like Megans') and a chocolate FUDGE cake. She had a sleep over on Saturday afternoon. Megan and Freya came. Jennifer wanted Chili with cheese, soda, and of course, the cake and ice cream.  The girls played games, inside and out... They stayed up till 4 o'clock in the morning playing board games, watching movies and I don't know what else... I was in bed by 10pm! LOL! Megan got her Vanilla Fields gift set. Really nice. Freya got her some toe socks, and a key chain.  Gramma Carolyn got her a pretty blue stripped sweater. Gramma Sandy, of course, went over board and I won't even go there... Her dad? NOTHING. Of course, he does have a job- doesn't he? But alas, nothing. Not even a damn phone call.  Well... anyways, Jennifer had a great time.

      My son came home from school one day,  with a smirk upon his face.  He decided he was smart enough,  to put me in my place.  Guess what I learned in Civics Two,  that's taught by Mr. Wright?  It's all about the laws today,  The "Children's Bill of Rights."  It says I need not clean my room,  don't have to cut my hair.  No one can tell me what to think,  or speak, or what to wear.  I have freedom from religion,  and regardless what you say,  I don't have to bow my head,  and I sure don't have to pray.  I can wear earrings if I want,  and pierce my tongue & nose.  I can read & watch just what I like,  get tattoos from head to toe.  And if you ever spank me,  I'll charge you with a crime.  I'll back up all my charges,  with the marks on my behind.  Don't you ever touch me,  my body's only for my use,  not for your hugs and kisses,  that's just more child abuse.  Don't preach about your morals,  like your Mama did to you.  That's nothing more than mind control,  And it's illegal too!  Mom, I have these children's rights,  so you can't influence me,  or I'll call Children's Services Division, better know as C.S.D.  Of course my first instinct was  to toss him out the door.  But the chance to teach him a lesson  made me think a little more.  I mulled it over carefully,  I couldn't let this go.  A smile crept upon my face,  he's messing with a pro.  Next day I took him shopping  at the local Goodwill Store.  I told him, "Pick out all you want,  there's shirts & pants galore.  I've called and checked with C.S.D.  who said they didn't care  if I bought you K-Mart shoes  instead of those Nike Airs.  I've canceled that appointment  to take your driver's test.  The C.S.D. is unconcerned  so I'll decide what's best.  I said "No time to stop and eat,  or pick up stuff to munch.  And tomorrow you can start to learn  to make your own sack lunch.  Just save the raging appetite,  and wait till dinner time.  We're having liver and onions,  a favorite dish of mine.  He asked "Can I please rent a movie,  to watch on my VCR?  "Sorry, but I sold your TV,  for new tires on my car.  I also rented out your room,  you'll take the couch instead.  The C.S.D. requires  just a roof over your head.  Your clothing won't be trendy now,  I'll choose what we eat.  That allowance that you used to get,  will buy me something neat.  I'm selling off your jet ski,  dirt-bike & roller blades.  Check out the "Parents Bill of Rights,"  It's in effect today!  Hey hot shot, are you crying,  Why are you on your knees?  Are you asking God to help you out,  instead of C.S.D..?

       Through a Rapist's Eyes (No Joke)    A group of rapists and date rapists in prison were interviewed on what they look for in a potential victim and here are some interesting facts:   1) The first thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle. They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed. They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair. Women with short hair are not common targets.     2) The second thing men look for is clothing. They will look for a woman who's clothing is easy to remove quickly. Many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing.     3) They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can be easily overpowered.     4) The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the early morning, between 5 and 8:30 a.m.   5) The number one place women are abducted from/attacked at is grocery store parking lots. Number two is office-parking lots/garages. Number three is public restrooms.     6) The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to worry about getting caught.     7) Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries a 3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years.     8) If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isn't worth it because it will be time-consuming.   9) These men said they would not pick on women who have umbrellas, or other similar objects that can be used from a distance, in their hands. Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon. So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it.   10) Several defense mechanisms he taught us are: If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with you in an elevator or stairwell, look them in the face and ask them a question, like what time is it, or make general small talk, I can't believe it is so cold out here, we're in for a bad winter. Now you've seen their face and could identify them in a line-up, you lose appeal as a target.   11) If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of you and yell Stop or Stay back! Most of the rapists this man talked to said they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back.  Again, they are looking for an EASY target.   12) If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him wherever he goes,) yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it out will be a deterrent.   13) If someone grabs you, you can't beat him with strength but you can by outsmarting them. If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner thigh -- HARD. One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands - the guy needed stitches. Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it; it hurts.   14) After the initial hit, always go for the groin.. I know from a particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's parts it is extremely painful. You might think that you'll anger the guy and make him want to hurt you more, but the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of trouble. Start causing trouble, and he's out of there.   15) When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible.. The instructor did it to me without using much pressure, and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly.   16) Of course the things we always hear still apply. Always be aware of your surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts. You may feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble.   PLEASE READ THEN FORWARD THIS TO EVERY WOMAN YOU KNOW,  IT S SIMPLE STUFF BUT IT COULD SAVE HER LIFE

      My sis-in-laws usually make this jelly to give out for xmas. This year we didn't get any. SO, I took it upon myself to try my hand at the process. After reading about 20 different variations of the recipe, I kinda winged it, used a combination of all the ingrediants and make my own recipe. IT IS GREAT. It took all of about 45 minutes to complete.   I used: half a jar of jalapenos~ diced, the kind you put on nachos. 1 red bell pepper,  1 green bell pepper,  6 or 7 pepperchenies (sp?),  6 1/2 cups of sugar 1 1/2 cups of apple cider vinegar (if you can actually make this OUTSIDE, all the better!);) 1 box of Certo (both packages)  If you have a food processor, all the better. Use very little of the juice from the jalapenos. Quarter both peppers, removing the insides and seeds. Remove some of the seeds from the pepperchenies. Put all peppers in the food processor, and chop finely.  On the stove, use a big pot, and stir the sugar, peppers and apple cider vinegar to a boil. Stir often. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.  Stir in the Certo, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.   I didn't use the glass jars. I poured the VERY HOT liquid into ceramic bowls. These bowls were made by Jon during his college days, and the other was given to Jessica by her friend that made it at her high school. I won't even begin to tell you HOW or WHAT to use to store this stuff in.   I have gotten RAVE Reviews on this jelly. It's got a bite to it. It's perfect. I am looking forward to making more. I plan on giving this out for New Years gifts...   I'm so proud of this accomplishment, this is my first attempt!

      I just hope I can remember to start around July or so... LOL Frankie and Matt came over last night bearing gifts for the holiday season. It was a wonderful suprise. A plate full of cookies and a bottle of homemade Kahlua. Wahh hooo! LOL!  I want to start collecting these bottles. Jon said you can buy them with beer in them, and I've already got him to volunteer to dispose of the beer so I can use them for some homemade Kahaua I will attempt to make.  These bottles are really neat... They look like the really old time bottles with the attached stopper... It's gonna be fun trying to do this... Oh yea, I really had to twist Jon's arm to dispose of the beer... LOL

She originally traded Jon colors. And that's when Jon gave the scarf to Jessica. Kristina got an elf and nobody wanted to steal that. Poor kid. Danielle, she got a $15 Anchor Blue gift card and two small chocolate bars.

      We just got home from a long weekend with my husbands family for the annual Christmas gathering.  Everyone arrives from all over to whereever the party's gonna be. Each year it's at a new location. A few years ago, it was on the beach near Long Beach, Ca. Last year it was at Lake Tahoe. This year was in Dorrington, Ca. About two hours South East of Sacremento. Straight up into the mountains. Elevation: 5000 feet! There was snow the night we got there, but it was only raining... The snow was slowly melting. Bummer. BUT, we got up Sunday morning and there was a fresh 4 inches of snow and it was STILL SNOWING! Saturday night was the gift exchange, the infamous White Elephant. All attendies, high school age and over can be involved in the White Elephant. I say attendies and not family members because there are people that aren't "family" in the sense of the word that attend the festivities. Kim joined us this year and I REALLY hope she had a GREAT time! Luv ya Kim! Anyways, I selected a gift that I KNEW was a painting made by Debbie. Jon's sister. These are the BEST. They are family traditions. There was ONLY one this year. I selected it, knowing that it would prolly be stolen from me, but seriously praying it wouldn't... It was. DAMN. Oh well, I stole the best present from my sis-in-law Holly. Who had stolen it from Martha, "Nanny M" My mother-in-law. It was a beautiful hand knitted scarf, a really cute coffee mug, AND a full body massage. Right there at the cabin, full with the massage table! That very night. My neice, Katey, is in school for massage therapy. SHE IS SOOOOO GOOD! I really needed it. The drive to get to Dorrington was 13 hours, we drove thru. less fuel and potty breaks. I feel that I got the bestest gift. The painting was great, but there will be other times that I could get one. I am gonna try to send a really nice family picture down to Debbie and ask her to make a painting of it.   For the kids' gift picks: Jessica got two gift baskets,one  with tea and crackers type of stuff and the other is a soup and bowl basket. Pretty nice, but I don't think she was impressed. She really wished someone would have stolen that from her. Jennifer stole a VHS movie of Pirates of the Carribean and a bag of candy. That was stolen from Jennifer by Rusty for Katey. Jennifer then picked from the big pile, and she got a board game. Gobblet. Weird game... but interesting. I beat Jon.  Jonathan got to steal a drill back from Rusty who had stolen it from JD. JD originally picked the drill. He thought it was great. But, Rusty stole it from him. JD then unwrapped a digital tape measure which was really neat... That was stole from him by Papa, my father-in-law. Jd then stole a corner sander.  To be continued...

      Y.A.H.O.O. Mexico Mission 2004 Jessica is selling shares to raise money for this trip. Each share is $20.00 If you would like to help with this, please click on my PAYPAL button, and give your help. In return, I will email you a copy of the "Stock Certificate" and a link to the pictures when they are ready.  This is Jessica's second year in giving herself to this cause. She gains a deeper understanding of, and commitment to, the Christian faith, as well as giving her the opportunity to develop the confidence and ability to make a lasting and positive impact in the world. Last year, Jessica had a great time, giving of herself to the poor families in Mexico. I believe that this is a great life lesson that she will NEVER forget. Won't you help her with her goal of sales of 23 Stock Shares.  IMPORTANT NOTE: This is TAX DEDUCTIBLE.

      I have a class called Professional Development. We are using the book called The Everything Get-A-Job Book. Or at least most of us are.  I showed up for class today only to find out, IT WAS THE WRONG WEEK! Class is held every-other week. This is my OFF WEEK. A different group has this same class, opposite weeks. Anyways, I stayed because I missed LAST FRIDAY'S class that I was actually supposed to be in... LOL!  Today it came to Jane's attention that there were several people missing the text books. She also relayed that she didn't think they would be getting anymore in, if they did come, she didn't know when.  So, of course, I jump on the computer, come to this website, click on my lil' AMAZON banner at the top of the page, and click. I do an advanced search, searching for the ISBN number found on the back of MY text book. And what do ya know, I find them. The cheapest one was 1.30. But we need several. SO, I ask exactly how many are needed. I pose the inquiry to the class. Someone suggests that they pay for their own so they can keep them. Kewl. Jane wants one too. She poses that the school would pay for them. So, I run to Larry Long and pose this query to him. He approves.   I do some more digging... Uahh Oohh. Now we need  10 ! There are two for 1.30 and one of those is damaged. The next 9 new/used books range from 1.80 to 3.50. Plus shipping. So, I go ahead and order... looking for the total before I actually confirm the order. 10 books, including shipping, comes to $62.05. That ends up being $6.21 each. I get 6.25 from 4 people. One person still owes me 1.25. And Larry Long approves the check from the school for the other $31.05. I paid by credit card. (My first business transaction on the Amazon Associates link.)  And so, this leads to why I just received 10 shipping confirmations for this book.  Confusing? It's okay, I was confused while writing this, but I feel good that I was able to take care of business and order the books for the class. And over half of those people I've never seen before!  Jane was so happy that I helped. I also took care of the dang printer... LOL. Poor Brian thought for sure he was gonna get into trouble for even looking at that printer!   The books should be here by no later the end of next week. I will deliver them as soon as I recieve them!

      There's nothing worse than a snotty doctor's receptionist who insists you  tell her what is wrong in a room full of other patients. I know we all   have experienced this, and I love the way this old guy handled it.    An 86-year-old man walked into a crowded doctor's office. As he approached  the desk, the receptionist said, "Yes sir, what are you seeing the doctor   for today?"    "There's something wrong with my penis," he replied.    The receptionist became irritated and said, "You shouldn't come into a  crowded office and say things like that."    "Why not? You asked me what was wrong and I told you," he said.    The receptionist replied, "You've obviously caused some embarrassment in   this room full of people. You should have said there is something wrong with   your ear or something and then discussed the problem further with the doctor in  private."    The man walked out, waited several minutes and then re-entered.    The receptionist smiled smugly and asked, "Yes?"    "There's something wrong with my ear," he stated.    The receptionist nodded approvingly and smiled, knowing he had taken her  advice. "And what is wrong with your ear, Sir?"    "I can't piss out of it," the man replied.    The doctor's office erupted in laughter.

      Two elderly women were eating breakfast in a restaurant one morning. Ethel noticed something funny about Mabel's ear and she said, '"Mabel, did you know you've got a suppository in your left ear?" Mabel answered, "I have a suppository?" She pulled it out and stared at it. Then she said, "Ethel, I'm glad you saw this thing. Now, I think I know where my hearing aid is."

      I just finished my third batch of pepper jelly. I made it differently this time, and it's got a totally different taste. It's sweeter, but still tangy.  7 cups of Sugar.  1.5 cups of Apple Cider Vinegar. 2 large RED bell peppers. 2 pepperchicies, no seeds 3/4 jar of Jalapenos'. No juice. 1 full box of Certo 8 to 10 drops of red food coloring.  Makes 6.5  8 oz. jars.  Most of this jelly is spoken for as follows... 1 to my Aunt Brenda, 1 to Rick and Barb, 1 to my mom, 1 to Jerry and Sheila, And 2 are left over. I made 6 full jars, and put the rest in our jar that's still got some of the 1st and 2nd batch. So now, three jelly's in one jar. This will prove to be an interesting combo.  If you are interested in receiving a jar of your own, and don't want to attempt to make this yourself, email me at jchallquist@msn.com. Subject line, Jalapeno Pepper Jelly.

          Will we still be the Country of choice and still be America if we continue to make the changes forced on us by the people from other countries that came to live in America because it is the Country of Choice? Think  about it . . .        All I have to say is, when will they do something about MY RIGHTS? I celebrate Christmas, but because it isn't celebrated by everyone, we can no  longer say Merry Christmas. Now it has to be Season's Greetings. It's not Christmas vacation, it's Winter Break.. Isn't it amazing how this winter  break ALWAYS occurs over the Christmas holiday? We've gone so far the  other way, bent over backwards to not offend anyone, that I am now being offended. But it seems that no one has a problem with that.      This says it all!      This is an editorial written by an American citizen, published in a Tampa newspaper.  He did quite a job; didn't he? Read on, please!   IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT.       I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some  individual or their culture.  Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11,  we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans.  However, the dust from the attacks had barely settled  when the "politically correct" crowd began complaining about the  possibility that our patriotism was offending others.   I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge  against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to America.  Our population is almost entirely made up of descendants of immigrants.  However, there are a few things that those who have recently come to our  country, and apparently some born here, need to  understand.  This idea of  America being a multicultural community  has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.  As Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own  language and our own lifestyle.    This culture has been developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom.     We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic,  Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language.  Therefore, if you  wish to become part of our society, learn the language!   "In God We Trust" is our national motto. This is not some Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto because Christian men  and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly  documented.  It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools.  If God offends you, then I suggest you consider  another part of the  world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.   If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle Sam,  then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet.  We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change,  and we really don't care how you did things where you came from.  This is OUR COUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle.  Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his  opinion  and we will allow you every opportunity to do so.

      An officer in the U. S. Naval reserve was attending a conference that included admirals from both the U. S. Navy and the French navy.  At a cocktail reception, he found himself in a small group that included personnel from both navies. The French admiral started complaining that whereas Europeans learned many languages, Americans learned only English.  He then asked: "Why is it that we have to speak English in these conferences rather than you speak French?"  Without hesitating, the American Admiral replied: "Maybe it's because we arranged it so you did not have to speak German."

      School's been closed now. Today is day two of no school. My yard, my driveway, our street and house is frozen. There are icicles on my car, trees, roof line, and on the umbrella for my outdoor table.  The kids and I are pretty much keeping a fire going, removing the ice from the walkway, and poor Jon has to go to work. He's only one of about 3 or 4 left at work. They are staying to answer the phone. Helping people put chains on their cars, how to unfreeze the windsheild wipers and lil stuff like that. That most people take for granted. This town hasn't seen the likes of  this in a long long time.  In Portland, there is ice forming on the Willamette River. Some old timers called up the new and told them, they'd lived there all their lives, and can't remember this happening before. Hard to believe, because in snows in Portland every year. But, the MAX is and has been closed since yesterday. The buses are still running, although really slow.  ALL Portland schools are closed. The courts and other business's are closed. There are people snowboarding down the main streets in Portland. LOL!  There are NO airlines flying in or out of Portland.   There are highways completely closed. This is a serious storm, but not so serious that I lost my precious internet. We still have cable and power. There are tons of people in Pdx area without power. I feel really sorry for them, it's soooo dang cold.  More updates later!  Oh oh, I did sell one of my jars of Jelly! Good news within all this mess.

      That is just TOO DANG cold. Freezing our lil toes off.  Okay, Oregon is known for the rain. But, this is NOT what I bargained for when I moved here.  Don't get me wrong... I like the snow. But I figured out that I like the snow when it's around 32 degrees. You can make snow balls. With the snow that's falling now, you can't do anything with it. It's so light and fluffy. It's just blowing across town, making snow drifts, and then it freezes into ice.   I don't know how people can live in this kind of snow for their whole lives. I miss the sun...

      Off and on anyways. Most of the snow is melted now, but the weather people are saying we should expect between 1 and 3 inches tonight and tomorrow. And then a full blown snow storm on Monday.  Jon is telling me that there won't be school on Monday because of the snow.  We'll see.

      It doesn't normally snow in our lil town.  But it's been snowing since MONDAY! Today they are calling for snow all day with blizzard like conditions.  Last night the kids went to a party, and I had to go pick them up this morning at 8am. They were out at the buyou. About 10 miles from home. After picking them up, on the way home, I drove right through a red light. There was NO WAY I was gonna be able to stop. There was no traffic. The light went from green to yellow to red, tooooooo dang quick. It's a light that is used to slow people down coming off of Hwy 18. There is no cross traffic yet.  We are getting an Albertsons' on that corner, but it's still in the construction phase. Anyways, no traffic, and there was no way I was gonna be able to stop. I was only doing 20, but that light changed just too fast. LOL. The kids were laughing about it... That's when they reliazed that snow isn't always good.  Go to my fotolog and you'll see the pictures. I will be uploading more today.

      Yesterday was the first time the kids went sking. It was great. I have pictures, but my disk in giving me troubles, I'm still working on getting them off and onto the computer.  Anywho... Jonathan, Jessica, Kristina, & Danielle had a blast. No injuries to speak of. Bruises, sore legs, & arms, but that's it.  Jonathan was sking, by 7 pm, he was going up the chair lift to the buttercup area. He came down without falling the first time, but there after I think he fell a bit because he was over confident. He just brushed it off, and went back up. For his first time sking, he did GREAT! He wants to go again for his birthday!  Jessica got the snow board at first, but didn't like it. She just couldn't get it. She finally got a good pair of ski boots, and concoured the bunny slope all night. She was really cheated because she had to change her boots about three times. Different boots fit differently. She did real well, and now is ready to try a lil bit bigger of a hill.  Kristina, she got the snow board and whooped ass. She was good. She was hopping around and falling and just kept at it. She didn't give up once. I don't think she even tried to ski. Snow boarding is her gig. She's gonna start looking for her own boots and board so she can go as often as possible.  Danielle... well, she tried the snowboard, then just gave that up. She just couldn't get it. She grabbed some skis and was great. She only fell once all night, and that was the first time she went off the ski lift with Jonathan. She scared me soo bad, I thought she wasn't gonna stop at all and go over a clif!!! My heart was pounding sooo fast. If she had gone over, she would have landed on the street in the parking lot! SPLAT!!!!  Other than that lil scare, she was a natural on the skis.   Jennifer didn't want to go. She said she didn't have anything to wear! LOL! Next time, she's going no matter what. She will have a blast. None of us were cold.  Jon is an old pro at sking. He's not been on skis before last night in about 20 years, but he picked it up real quick. He played on the bunny hill with the kids for a bit. Then dissapeared for an hour or so. He said he went on the big lift. KEWL... And he came back without any broken bones. In fact, he's not very sore for all the sking he did.  I tried to snowboard and ski. I was SCARED! So, I quit. Next time, I will take a lesson. I've skied before, but, I was just scared of breaking a bone! LOL!    I ended up helping "Hunter" who fell in the middle of the bunny hill. He was on a snowboard and he crashed hard. At first, I thought he was just laying there to rest a minute, get his breath back. But, after just a bit too long, I started walking towards him, expecting him to get up before I reached him. He didn't. I asked him if he was all right (asked that of MANY MANY people!), and he said, NO.  He was face down. I tried to get him to be still. I detached his snowboard and then Jessica came over to see what was up. At the same time, another skier with his little girl asked if I needed help with him. Hunter kept trying to roll over, and neither of us could stop him. So, I put his hat under his head, and Jessica went and got the bunny hill dude. He called for help from the medics. I accessed him, and figured that he only had a lower lumbar strain. His legs were fine, his hips and lower back hurt bad. It was best when his legs were bent. It's all the classic signs.  About two hours' later, after the Dr. took the X-Rays and did her accessment, she confirmed my accessment. Lower Lumbar Strain. He'll be okay. It's funny, at the slope, I told him what I thought, and told him it'll just feel like he's got a hang over... He laughed, he said, "that's funny, cuz i dont' drink." I walked into the Med-Aide area when the Doc was telling him his diagnosis, and she said the same thing. "You'll just feel like you've got a bad hang over" and in perfect timing, I said, "that's funny, cuz he doesn't drink!" He laughed... and told her, "yep, that's right!" Now mind you, I've only met him last night after he fell.   Today, I went to GoodWill, and bought a pair of ski boots, and a pair of skis. The boots fit me, & Jessica & Jennifer. I am looking for more. That way, it'll be cheaper to go sking and then we can go more often.

      Jessica has earned over $1000.00 towards the trip to Mexico.  Jessica has done a WONDERFUL job at meeting the goals set by the leaders of the church group. I'm SOOOO PROUD of her. And to think that the people of our town, her family, teachers and friends have made all this possible for her. (Not Mike though, sad...) Oh well...

      I talked to the dentist this am and apparently Mike (or some male person) called to verify the bills were ligit. Kewl. I even left a message for him to do just that. The money that he needs to pay me directly was the portion the insurance doesn't cover.The duductible and Co-pay.  Now, my question, How do I send the monthly bills for the dental insurance? He is ordered to have coverage for the kids, and at this time, I would be thrilled for him to just pay 50% of the premium. I won't ask for more. SO, his portion would be only 45.00 per month for dental. Not too bad, considering that the total bills for Jonathans' appts so far, which includes an exam, films, a cleaning, and dental work. = $453.00. His future work will be $413.00 Our insurance coverage pays only the first $1000.00 Jessica's appts so far, Which includes the same as Jonathan's so far, =$460. And future is $605.00. And again the Cap is $1000 paid by insurance.  Would it be considerabley cheaper for Mike to get dental insurance? That way he's not gotta reimburse me for 50% of uncovered dental bills? OR at least not till the cap is met by both insurance companies.  What are your thoughts on this?

      The Queen and Dolly Parton die on the same day, and they both go before St. Peter to find out if they'll be admitted to heaven.   Unfortunately, there's only one space left that day, so St. Peter asks Dolly if there's some particular reason why she should go to heaven.  She takes off her top and says,  "Look at these. They're the most perfect ones God ever created, and I'm proud to own them."  St. Peter thanks Dolly, and asks the Queen the same question.   She then drops her skirt and panties, takes a bottle of Perrier out of her purse, shakes it up, and douches with it.   St. Peter says, "OK, Your Majesty, you may go in."   Dolly is outraged. She screams,  "What was that all about? I show you two of God's own creations, she performs a disgusting hygiene act, and gets in, and I don't?!!!"  "Sorry, Dolly," says St. Peter,  "But a royal flush beats a pair any day."

      I can not believe that with one day until finals, I am just now being told that I have yet to finish five weeks worth of work in Keyboarding. I was under the impression that I was finished with all the assignments. I turned in my folder for the teacher to review TWO WEEKS AGO. Now, with one class before the final, I am given my folder with a note, Wheres the production?  What PRODUCTION? What is she talking about? Why wasnt this brought to my attention earlier! Ive been done for two weeks. Or so I thought.  Thoughts are running through my head that I wont be able to finish school when I thought; I am going to fail Keyboarding, and have to retake it I am panicking!   This isnt the first time Ive been frustrated with this particular teacher. Last term, in filing, I was able to grasp the concept very easily and started working a bit ahead. She got upset with me and told me to not get ahead of her, she wasnt there yet. She even yelled at me to put my pencil down!  Earlier this term, in Keyboarding, she yelled at me while in class because I knew how to print up my completed work, and she was trying to tell me a different way. The only way, according to her. I just sat there, and bit my tongue.  I run to Merrily, so upset, asking WHY Why after all this time, I am just finding out. WHAT is production? What did I miss? I did every thing in the book. Where is this? Is there another book??? Merrily explains to me what production was, its transcribing. Okay, I thought that was ONLY for the medical students. She says she will bring this to Larry Longs attention, and speak to Jill. Great! How does this help me now? I have a full schedule next term and the final is Monday. So, she decides to give me two weeks to finish the production. Wonderful! I can do this. Everything will be okay. I am still upset, but starting to calm down. I will be able to do this and still finish school when I expected too, May 4.

      (an email I got this am, I just HAD to share!)  Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable.  No matter how legitimate my excuse, I always get the feeling that my boss thinks I'm lying. On one recent occasion, I had a valid reason but lied anyway, because the truth was just too darned humiliating. I simply mentioned that I had sustained a head injury, and I hoped I would feel up to coming in the next day.  By then, I reasoned, I could think up a doozy to explain the bandage on the top of my head. The accident occurred mainly because I had given in to my wife's wishes to adopt a cute little kitty. Initially, the new acquisition was no problem. Then one morning, I was taking my shower after breakfast when I heard my wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen. "Honey! The garbage disposal is dead again. Please come reset it." "You know where the button is," I protested through the shower pitter-patter and steam. "Reset it yourself!" "But I'm scared!" she persisted. "What if it starts going and sucks me in?" There was a meaningful pause and then, "C'mon, it'll only take you a second." So out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping that my silent outraged nudity would make a statement about how I perceived her behavior as extremely cowardly. Sighing loudly, I squatted down and stuck my head under the sink to find the button. It is the last action I remember performing.  It struck without warning, & without any respect to my circumstances. No, it wasn't the hexed disposal, drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth. It was our new kitty, who discovered the fascinating dangling objects she spied hanging between my legs. She had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I reached under the sink. And, at the precise moment when I was most vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged them with her needle-like claws. I lost all rational thought to control orderly bodily movements, blindly rising at a violent rate of speed, with the full weight of a kitten hanging from my masculine region. Wild animals are sometimes faced with a "fight or flight" syndrome. Men, in this predicament, choose only the "flight" option. I know this from experience. I was fleeing straight up into the air when the sink and cabinet bluntly and forcefully impeded my ascent.  The impact knocked me out cold. When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me. Now there are not many things in this life worse than finding oneself lying on the kitchen floor buck naked in front of a group of "been-here, done-that" paramedics.  Even worse, having been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics were all snorting loudly as they tried to conduct their work, all the while trying to suppress their hysterical laughter......... and not succeeding. Somehow I lived through it all. A few days later I finally made it back in to the office, where colleagues tried to coax an explanation out of me about my head injury.  I kept silent, claiming it was too painful to talk about.  Which it was. "What's the matter?" They all asked,  "Cat got your tongue?"...............  If they only knew

      I bought a used guitar at GoodWill. It's a cheaply made, Johnson. But, I've taken it to two different music stores, and they both said it's got great sound. It's got this horrible custom paint job too. I will rinse it down with paint thinner, and repaint it. This is a MUST! The first place I went to, to purchase strings, was too expensive. $11 for the strings and $10 to put them on and tune it. Not too bad you might think...  Well, I went to the local pawn shop after many many stops on Third Street in Mac. The strings were the same brand from the first store, and they were ONLY $5. AND to top that, he put them on and tuned it for free!  While I was at the Pawn Shop, there was this "kid" playing around with a guitar there. I waited and listened to him while my new guitar was being re-strung, and he was good. After my guitar was finished, I walked to the "kid" and handed him my card and asked him if he'd be interested in giving me lessons. This "kid" is a high school student at Mac High. He was elated. His whole face lit up in disbelief. He stuttered out a "SURE"! And I said, "great, call me." As I was putting my new toy in the van, he came out of the shop walking on air. He started telling all of his friends about our conversation. He sounded so excited. More so then i feel, learing the guitar.  I found a site where I downloaded four free lessons for the guitar. These "lessosn" weren't what I was expecting, it's more to get you to buy their whole program... But I did learn how to  correctly  strum. That's good for starters. And the notes, and placement of the fingers... another good. The more I know before this "kid" starts to teach me, the better i'll learn.  TTFN, Judy

      Look to the right, the post by SJC... She's thinking that she's gonna get me into trouble? For using the school computers to write in my blog??? OMG! That is hilarous! I show my instructors what I do. In fact, I am giving a presentation to a class on posting on Ebay. I am actually going to be going through the complete process of selling on Ebay. IN CLASS. There are two instructors that are going to set up the networked projection system so I can do this!!! This A.M., I showed Leanne some stuff on Ebay that she said she's interested in.  Shelly, puulleezzzeee. Give it a rest. You are sooo funny. OMG! Do you not have anything better to do than to SEARCH me out and what I am doing???  Aren't you MARRIED? Why don't you put this much energy into your marriage, so you don't have to EMAIL your hubby regarding why you aren't with him?  "I miss you every nite beside me and I love you with all my heart- sorry Ive been on the puter so much--I am a part of these folk's lives that have been fighting for years...etc. Your wife   Did you two seperate? Is this why you are searching me out? Is this why YOU accused me of having marital troubles? Because YOU are? What's wrong? Is he tired of your shit? Get a life...

      I just applied for about 10 different jobs. All on the HotJobs on Yahoo. I will now sit back for a day to so and wait. If I don't get any bites, then I'll move on to more resources.   Later today, I'm going to talk to our mortgage broker about volunteering in the office, just to get some hands on experience. It can't hurt. I can do this a few days a week, and it'll look good on my resume.  I'm getting more excited every day about graduating.   I also sent several job listings to my youngest childs' father. He's a tad bit slow in paying support. Like 11k slow. I hope this helps him. In return, it will help me and our child.  I do wish him/us the best of luck.

      and I don't know what to do. It's funny really. I've been working off and on for the last 9 years. The last job I had was driving school bus, and that has NOTHING to do with the degree i'll have in 4 1/2 weeks. So, I can't use it as experience. Plus, my ex-boss wouldn't give me a FAIR evaluation. It has something to do with the Worker's Comp claim, on the job injury, and that mess. I've never been fired, I didn't quit, and I still have life insurance through First Student Services. So, am I still an employee? How do I use them in my applications and resumes? I don't think I should, but am at a loss as to what to do. I will have an A.A.S. in Business Administration. Pretty kewl, after 15 months of school. I'm excited.  Any suggestions that may have worked for you?

      On The Plane  Two Arabs boarded a flight out of London. One took a window seat and the other sat next to him in the middle seat.  Just before takeoff, an American sat down in the aisle seat. After take off, the American kicked off his shoes, wiggled his toes and was settling in when the Arab in the window seat said, 'I need to get up and get a Coke.'  'Don't get up,' said the American. 'I'm in the aisle seat. I'll get it for you.'  As soon as he left, one of the Arabs picked up the American's shoe and spat in it.  When the American returned with the Coke, the other Arab said, 'That looks good, I'd really like one, too.'  Again, the American obligingly went to fetch it. While he was gone the other Arab picked up the other shoe and spat in it. When the American returned, they all sat back and enjoyed the flight.  As the plane was landing, the American slipped his feet into his shoes and knew immediately what had happened.  'Why does it have to be this way?' he asked. 'How long must this go on? This fighting between our nations? This hatred? This animosity? This spitting in shoes and pissing in Cokes?'"

      A teacher in a one-room school house arrives one morning to find a nice red apple on her desk.  The apple had a tag tied to it saying T.O.T.  Knowing that she had some pranksters in her class, she cautiously asked, "Can someone explain what T.O.T. means?"   Little Mary in the front row raised her hand to explain, "It means 'To Our Teacher."   The next morning the teacher finds a bigger and prettier apple than the day before.  This time there is a tag with T.O.T.W.L. written on it.  She asks for an explanation for this note and little Timmy waves his hand to explain, "That means 'To Our Teacher, With Love".   The next morning, the teacher arrives to find a great big watermelon sitting on her desk with a tag saying, "F.U.C.K."  Her jaw drops and she screams, "Who can explain this?"   Little Buckwheat in the back row raises his hand and says, "That means 'From Us Colored Kids!"

      I was sitting alone in one of those loud, casual steak houses that you find all over the country You know the type--a bucket of peanuts on every table, shells littering the floor, and a bunch of perky college kids racing around with longneck beers and sizzling platters.  Taking a sip of my iced tea, I studied the crowd over the rim of my glass. My gaze lingered on a group enjoying their meal. They wore no uniform to identify their branch of service, but they were definitely "military:" clean shaven, cropped haircut, and that "squared away" look that comes with pride.  Smiling sadly, I glanced across my table to the empty seat where my husband usually eat. It had only been a few months since we sat in this very booth, talking about his upcoming deployment to the Middle East. That was when he made me promise to get a sitter for the kids, come back to this restaurant once a month and treat myself to a nice steak. In turn he would treasure the thought of me being here, thinking about him until he returned home to me.   I fingered the little flag pin I constantly wear and wondered where he was at this very moment. Was he safe and warm? Was his cold any better? Were my letters getting through to him? As I pondered these thoughts, high pitched female voices from the next booth broke into my thoughts.  "I don't know what Bush is thinking about. Invading Iraq. You'd think that man would learn from his old man's mistakes. Good lord. What an idiot! "I can't believe he is even in office. You do know, he stole the election."  I cut into my steak and tried to ignore them, as they began an endless tirade running down our president. I thought about the last night I spent with my husband, as he prepared to deploy. He had just returned from getting his smallpox and anthrax shots. The image of him standing in our kitchen packing his gas mask still gives me chills.  Once again the women's voices invaded my thoughts. "It is all about oil, you know. Our soldiers will go in and rape and steal all the oil they can in the name of 'freedom'. Hmph! I wonder how many innocent people they'll kill without giving it a thought? It's pure greed, you know."  My chest tightened as I stared at my wedding ring I could still see how handsome my husband looked in his "mess dress" the day he slipped it on my finger. I wondered what he was wearing now. Probably his desert uniform, affectionately dubbed "coffee stains" with a heavy bulletproof vest over it.  "You know, we should just leave Iraq alone. I don't think they are hiding many weapons. In fact, I bet it's all a big act just to increase the president's popularity. That's all it is, padding the military budget at the expense of our social security and education. And, you know what else? We're just asking for another 9-ll. I can't say when it happens again that we didn't deserve it."  Their words brought to mind the war protesters I had watched gathering outside our base. Did no one appreciate the sacrifice of brave men and women, who leave their homes and family to ensure our freedom? Do they even know what "freedom" is?  I glanced at the table where the young men were sitting, and saw their courageous faces change. They had stopped eating and looked at each other dejectedly, listening to the women talking.  "Well, I, for one, think it's just deplorable to invade Iraq, and I am certainly sick of our tax dollars going to train professional baby killers we call a military."  Professional baby killers? I thought about what a wonderful father my husband is, and of how long it would be before he would see our children again.  That's it! Indignation rose up inside me. Normally reserved, pride in my husband gave me a brassy boldness I never realized I had. Tonight one voice will answer on behalf of our military, and let her pride in our troops be known.  Sliding out of my booth, I walked around to the adjoining booth and placed my hands slat on their table. Lowering myself to eye level with them, I smilingly said, "I wouldn't help overhearing your conversation.  You see, I'm sitting here trying to enjoy my dinner alone. And, do you know why? Because my husband, whom I love with all my heart, is halfway around the world defending your right to say rotten things about him."  "Yes, you have the right to your opinion, and what you think is none of my business. However, what you say in public is something else, and I will not sit by and listen to you ridicule MY country, MY president, MY husband, and all the other fine American men and women who put their lives on the line, just so you can have the "freedom" to complain. Freedom is an expensive commodity, ladies. Don't let your actions cheapen it."  I must have been louder that I meant to be, because the manager came over to inquire if everything was all right. "Yes, thank you," I replied. Then turning back to the women, I said, "Enjoy the rest of your meal."  As I returned to my booth applause broke out. I was embarrassed for making a scene, and went back to my half eaten steak. The women picked up their check and scurried away.  After finishing my meal, and while waiting for my check, the manager returned with a huge apple cobbler ala mode. "Compliments of those soldiers," he said. He also smiled and said the ladies tried to pay for my dinner, but that another couple had beaten them to it. When I asked who, the manager said they had already left, but that the gentleman was a veteran, and wanted to take care of the wife of "one of our boys."  With a lump in my throat, I gratefully turned to the soldiers and thanked them for the cobbler. Grinning from ear to ear, they came over and surrounded the booth. "We just wanted to thank you, ma'am. You know we can't get into confrontations with civilians, so we appreciate what you did."  As I drove home, for the first time since my husband's deployment, I didn't feel quite so alone. My heart was filled with the warmth of the other diners who stopped by my table, to relate how they, too, were proud of my husband, and would keep him in their prayers. I knew their flags would fly a little higher the next day.  Perhaps they would look for more tangible ways to show their pride in our country, and the military who protect her. And maybe, just maybe, the two women who were railing against our country, would pause for a minute to appreciate all the freedom America offers, and the price it pays to maintain it's freedom.  As for me, I have learned that one voice CAN make a difference. Maybe the next time protesters gather outside the gates of the base where I live, I will proudly stand on the opposite side with a sign of my own. It will simply say, "Thank You!"  *Lori Kimble is a 31 year old teacher and proud military wife. A California native, Mrs. Kimble currently lives in Alabama.

      And yet, SHELLY CARPENTER still writes about me and my life. She's telling me to stop, stop posting about her, but yet, she continues to post shit. She's copying all of the OLD OLD freaking posts, editing, and reposting them on her blog. Wanna see? http://drama101.blogspot.com If she were to seek some professional help, they may be able to cure her from following me, writing about me, and get her own damn life. I've talked with a crisis center about her obsessive behavior, they say she really needs to talk to someone. A therapist. The Neveda school district might be interested in knowing her need for therapy. I'm not sure what to think. I had stopped posting, stopped expecting Mike to pay the dental bills. The courts are gonna handle that. I keep waiting for this Detective to contact me, still waiting... This otta be good. Her excuse to continue to post about me after the Mac Police told her to stop. Well, this hasn't stopped.  This is the final WARNING to Shelly Carpenter. Stop writing about me on your blog. Stop writing ANYTHING about me on your blog. Period. Just Stop. YOU are harassing me if you continue to do so. Today is Sunday, May 23rd, 2004. 11:32am.  Written by Judy Hallquist

      After speaking to the courts, I have come to the conclusion, I will let the law handle Mike and Shelly. I have changed my blog, so that it is ONCE AGAIN my blog, not to be taken over by Mike's mentally ill wife.  She's got a load of trouble coming and she's not gonna know from which direction till it hits her.  I am tired of being stalked,  I am tired of being harassed.  I am tired of being deceived when I think i'm leaving messages for Mike regarding the kids, and she's screening the calls and erasing them. Not allowing Mike to get his mail.  But, no... Mike is no innocent in all of this. He's been allowing this to go on for years. It's really simple. If he would pay the dental bill as court ordered to do so, then none of this would be going on.  Only if... but alas, he's not man enough to stand up to Shelly. Maybe because of her mental illness, she has no control of her actions and reactions. What would be said if I had posted their full names and addresses online? All hell would break loose. But, Shelly thinks it's okay to put myself and my children in danger by posting OUR address, phone number, and email addresses online. She's gone so far as to make appointments at Mental Health offices in MY town. Posted that info online a few years back.   I have been dealing with this crap for a long long time. It's time to stop.   ~~ This is MY SITE to rant and rave. If you do not like what I write, then do not come back. It's really that simple. I won't be posting about Shelly's life. I won't be posting about Mike's life. I will only post what affects ME, MY FAMILY, & MY LIFE.

      Here is a link to the explaination of the twins' dental bills. The kids' dentist visit was long over due. I had NEVER before asked the XXXXXXXX Mike to help pay for ANY medical or dental bills. ONCE I asked him to help pay for Jessica's vision bill, he never did. Then I asked him to help with HALF of the kids' eye exams, he never did. So, third time a charm?? Hell no!  I sent the bills / receipts to Mike in April 2004. He received them on April 7th, 2004. I have the tracking number to prove it... He REFUSES to pay, saying he doesn't have an explaination... BULL SHIT! He even called the dental office, spoke to them, and they gave him all the details..... LOL!  He's STILL saying he doesn't have an explaination. I've sent the treatment plan which is also the bill and receipt. Each treatment plan/bill/receipt has all the work/description on it. He's just too dang stupid to understand it, and wants me to spell it out for him. He was in college for years and years, didn't he learn anything??? I guess not.   Shelly's just not worth the motrin...

      Haven't you learned ANYTHING??? You supposedly have a Masters' in Teaching... but yet, you are able to sit on the computer day in and day out... Let me show everybody what she's up to now...  Posted by: oneandonly 115 mins What? no comments? lol Here's a scenario to think about (sorry, scenario might be too big of a word for ya--let's say, "pretend") First one-let's say that AA in Business actually means something and you actually get to interview with some reputable company.... Most reputable companies do a complete background check on possible employees. (of course, we all know your work history, or lack there-of, is null and void). And oopsies! Judy Hallquist has several things that are cause for alarm in her past. Recent past that is. A restraining order in regards to internet stalking? harassing phone calls? internet email hacking? not to mention a complaint about using schools puter for harassments? See, if I was the future employer, I'd say, "thank you for applying, but no thanks." You need to think about the future and the actions you are partaking in now...at least I would. We realize you are probably in the manic phase of your disease and probably not in control of too much at this time.....take those meds. *side note-I always wondered how you managed to get a school bus driving job with a child abuse charge against you?* but keep posting~    End...  I posted a reply, basically showing her she's just S.T.U.P.I.D. and she goes and deletes it... Then she brings up lies and trash. She's really got to get a life.  I do have an A.A.S. in Business, that's about all she's got right on her post. Meds, she's the one that's been to the doctor lately. Child abuse charge, she needs to go back to her source, and verify because I will press slander and liable charges.  Trying to scare me with my future employment, ha ha ha, I've got a GREAT job and you are scared that when I get sick of this shit beyond belief, I will file for mod of support. I will do that too. You do need to be fearful of that, because as you know, as both parties incomes go UP, the support goes UP. So, you better hope Mike pays the medical bills soon because I will be pursueing this  very soon if i'm not happy with this arrangement. And yes, I know YOU, SHELLY, are the reason Mike's not paid to date. But, that's okay, i've spoke with someone... taken care of the formalities... Remember my post on FA? Regarding the lump sum of money i'm getting soon? I will be able to file all the papers I need... Then Mike will be traveling to Oregon... Kewl, HUH??? Prolly without YOU. Did you even give Mike his mail, with the copies of the bills and receipts???  Oh yea, Ya know that saying, "This is an attempt to collect a debt." Anything will be used to collect on this debt. Including but not limited to contacting employers, family, friends, and other debtors & creditors.

      This is just so fun!!!  PPC's policy is to be able to use the computers to post and reply to jobs online. This includes but NOT limited to Posting my Resume to a BLOG. I've shown several people this and they are going to create there own. Some employers cannot open different formats of attachments or they do not want an attachment. So, in creating a blog for my resume, they are able to go directly to the site to view my resume. Thus, lessing there chances of a corrupt file, or just bypassing MY RESUME & application all together.   YOU, SHELLY RYBICKI, need to get a life. What's wrong? Were you FIRED? Still LOOKING for work and not having any luck? Go Away. Make amends with your husband, try as you might, your not ANYTHING, ANYBODY, nor WORTH THE AIR YOU BREATHE. You have NO IMPACT on my life.  Again,  I am better than you. I will ALWAYS be better than you.

      So hot that people are PAYING for the invitations! The first invitation that I listed on Ebay, sold for $81.00! The second sold for $30.00.  Then, after using my account for a few weeks, I got THREE MORE INVITES. I promptly listed two of those, also on Ebay for $30 each. Still waiting for those to sell. I cannot believe it. So, I go check my mail once more, and low an' behold; I got THREE MORE Invites. This time, I gave one to a friend, kept one for myself as an alias, and saved one that could potiently be a VERY VERY hot seller. Who knows? I may just end up giving that one to a friend too. It's a  very hot  name. LOL!  If you doubt the hot issue of Gmail, go to ebay and search gmail. There are TONS of them for sale. They aren't selling for quit as much as they were two weeks ago, but they are still selling.  I also sold, on Ebay, a $1000 gift certificate for $81.00. The purchaser only needs to pay for a per item shipping charge. I don't think the certificate was worth it, but apparently someone did! And I got the gift certificate for FREE!

      I can't believe it's already the middle of July.  Jennifer goes to San Diego in 2 weeks. Michael comes home from San Diego the same day Jennifer goes. I'll be dropping Jennifer off, waiting for mom and Chuck to come in from Alaska, then we will wait a bit more for Michael to come in...  Anywhoo, been really busy with work, Matthew, and planning our anniversary vacation. My mother is gonna help with the kids, the house, and the pets while we are gone. The family vacation is in the works for the end of July, it's just not coming together like I had hoped. Condo on the beach...  I think we may just go camping. Or maybe rent a place up at Detriot Lake.   Larry is here, on his way through to California. He got here yesterday, and will be leaving next monday or so. I don't think he'll last long. He's going to the HIGH desert. VERY freaking HOT!!! He's used to SNOW 9 months of the year. LOL!  Gotta get to bed, early to work tomorrow. Boss on vacation & I'm bringing in a temp tomorrow. Matt's last day of vacation. Payroll to enter, and interviews to schedule. I love being the Office Supervisor. Thank God i've not had to fire anybody yet. Times are tough out there, and I feel very blessed to have this job.

      Today I got to go shopping at Nike. The store for employees ONLY!! I got a guest pass from my company and I bought all of us nike's that aren't even out at the retail stores yet. TOO kewl!  Jon's never had a pair and he was just loving his.  Jonathan likes his alot, too. He's not taken them off yet. Jessica got to go with me, and she helped pick out Jennifer's. Jessica's shoes are a bit big, but she picked those out herself. I called Jennifer while I was shopping, I knew the style she wanted, but once I got there, I found some real cute pink and white shoes that I thought she's like better, so I described them to her on the phone. She said yes. She loves them. (5 pair of Nike's) I also bought 6 water bottles, 5 bracelets (Lance Armstong ~ "LIVE STRONG".), an OSU hat & four 6-packs of socks. All for $235.00 Retail, that would have been at least $400.00 easily.  Such a kewl perk. I can go back once per month on a guest pass. Nike employees can go as often as they like. I wouldn't be able to afford to do that. But then again, if I had the chance to go all the time, I wouldn't be buying in bulk for the whole family.  Next time, I'm taking sizes and styles for my friends for shoes. LOL!!! The t-shirts are $10.00 our cost! The kewl nike ones!!! And yes, the security front desk said if I was buying for other people to make sure that I got the right size, If they were a 11.5 or maybe 12, get both cuz there are no exchanges. Only refunds. There were two gals in there buying at least 20 pair of shoes! They had them all stacked up!!! And it was okay!  Anyways, I was so excited to get to go. I am very happy with my purchases, and look forward to the next time I get to go shopping! OH oH, Nike backpacks are $16.50!!  I have been so busy with work and my newly adopted 17 month old, that i've not had time for the blog time like I use to have.  Matthew is 17 months old. His parents were found to be abusive, and the state took him when he was 1 years old.  The parents signed over the right to allow the adoption and he's now ours. I'm so happy, but so tired. He's blonde and blue eyed, very healthy now. He's slowly learning to follow simple requests, like no, and come here Matthew. He calls us momma and daddddddaa. LOL! He's not fond of Jessica only because he gets into her stuff and she tells him no and removes him from the area. He hates that.  Callie, my kitty, is so tolarant of him. Matthew will lay on the kitchen floor, looking under the dish case (old bookcase), and Callie is under there -hiding. But not running away. It's funny. She's wanting to teach him to be nice, she take a step or two away from him, and he follows her. Only when he pets her nice, does she stay within reach. Otherwise, she slowly moves away. Step by step... LOL! Parker is still afraid of Matthew when he cries. He doesn't know if he's coming or going when Matthew's crying. He just runs and hides.
