       We haven't had a drink. Promise.  We've opened a betting account each, and deposited ten bucks in each.  We will come back at the end of the week (ie Friday if you please chaps) to get a run down on how much we've won/lost/frittered away.

       Now then chaps. Since this is perhaps the geeks version of doing a car up, see if you can make some sense of  urlLink this article  Mr P. W. Heaney.  I'm positive the site can have a musical background, that would be a cool feature. And of course Lily and her "impressive baps" as Pete so eloquently put it is on hand with thumbnail tips. Though why we want a manicure is beyond me. Ho-ho!  What would our regular readers think to a template change? You know where to comment.  So I've decided to take up  urlLink Beatlism  as my new religion, all makes perfect sense to me. There are some strange people about isn't there.  Smashed my head with my car door tonight. Actually took me a minute to regain where I was and who I was! Nearly knocked me out. Right in the wars this past few days after me run in with the Truck doors yesterday (a truck door hit me in the back at very high speed). First one to complete Roadies gets a free drink on the rich man - me. Cheers for the £80 Mr Groves. I like a man who pays his debts.

       So I played footy last night.   It amounted to me nearly getting crippled by an onrushing goal keeper, letting a throw in go through my legs, nutmegging a bald fella and taking 2 of the worst corners in western europe.  Came off at half time to be replaced by what appeared to be Shaun Ryder's skinny brother.

       In CDT (Craft Design and Technology for all you acronym freaks out there) once upon a time, I saw a belt sander majestically soar off a workbench and leave a 2 metre long trail as smooth as a babies arse on the newly varnished floor. It would still be going now but for the inadequacies of the power cable.  It sort of resembled one of those weird  urlLink programmable tank  things you could get years ago.  Hilarity prevailed. Or did it? Or DID it? OR DID IT?  Yes, it did.

       Tonights the night........No seriously, I havce consumed 7 pints of Stella Artois, which is strong lager, am I entitled to more than 2 Units a pint, considering its stella??  If not I have had 14 units so far this week!  What have you Kids Bellies had??

       Will Peter be able to move again after his magnificent effort for Brian "I'm blind in one eye, but I still play in goal" Millers football team this evening? I seriously doubt it but full marks for being bold enough to get down there and give it some on the astroturf. Oooh, matron.  Keith secured 14 units on the Drinks-o-meter tonight. Does he score bonus points for it being on a school night?   7 pints of Stella Artois. The lads liver must be knocking 50 year old now.    Been wracking me brains for school memoirs that featured the big guy KG himself. I need them e-mails...tell me you still have them?! Glad the Soldering Iron story amused you. I've got the true classics safely etched in my mind forever. I'm sure Pete's got a shedload of school memoirs we've never heard.  The Burnley Wallet phenomenon steadily grows, the word is spreading, from Milwaulkee to Florida and even to Billingham (asked a lad at work to have a look the other day, he had nowt but good things to say). You know, the railway only went from Stockton to Darlington to begin with. We've reached the US already.

Them 2 are made for each other and I wish yas both the very best for the happy years to come.  So Mikey as best man, where are we gunna hold the Stag weekend to end all stag weekends??  This will ROCK!!!!  No doubt it will be truly awesome!  So after work today I decided to go for a couple of pints of Stella, well a few turned into about 7!  A wish the hog's Head didn't produce such fine STELLA!  Can't believe its only Tuesday, that's 3 days until were off, but hopefully a Blackpool reunion this weekend!  Pete Playing football..........AGAIN...........I hope the ambulance is on stand by!  Mikey blowing up the soldiering Iron..........That was so funny....No doubt over the weeks and months ahead there will be numerous school memories that will be mentioned.  I have an admirer who was scared of that scary optical illusion...........Or well one born every day!  Anyhow hats off to the future Mr and Mrs Peter Heaney, can't imagine a more perfect couple!  P.s I'm pissed!

       Well, I've run out of things to blog! How about a classic school memoir?  Way back in second year at the tender age of 12, myself and Keith , fellow Blogee, were taught the intracacies of soldering wires to other wires and microchips etc. Well away we went. Prone to silliness at times we kind of let the rules slip and after about my third or fourth failed attempt I decided the put the iron down on the desk rather than its spring holster to save a bit of time.   Anyway about two minutes elapsed before a huge bang and flash of light sent me and Keith flying!  The teacher ran over, Mr Riley, a true Maccum, "Wor Michael, whats going on son, ya alreet?"   "Yeah, yeah I'm fine."  "What happened?!"  "Well were just soldering this and it just...went...pop!"  Apparently, having left the iron on the desk, a fact kept well out of Mr Rileys reach, it melted through the wire casing and hit the live bit, scaring the shit out of me and Keith!  Eeeeh, those were the days. I get the feeling Keith might laugh a bit at this.

I'd like to thank mine and Joanne's parents for not flipping out in any way, shape or form when they heard the news.  I'd also like to thank Mikey for agreeing to be my best man and Dale and Phil for agreeing to be ushers. Cheers lads.

       b. February 22nd 1999 d. June 27th 2004  I regret to inform you but the fish bought for me as a "silly" present on my 16th birthday all those five years ago has sadly died. I'm not too sure what it was called but it hasn't lasted as long as Itchy and Scratchy the two goldfish who are still alive and kicking and managed to do enough to earn themselves names.  Having asked my mother what his name was, and I'm not sure if this was just agreed because it was the only thing I could think of, apparently it was called Casper, because it was a ghost fish. How original.  Casper began life at Dogsbody's, Estons premier pet shop. In fact its only pet shop. Bought as a joke, he spent his life in a 15 x 8 x 8 inch tank in the corner of the dining room, spending most of his time deciding whether to swim left or to swim right or two attack the other two fish and then forgetting it just a moment later. He'd seen all kinds of stones, weeds and even a little porcelain tower and every 3 months or so he'd go on holiday to the kitchen sink so his home could be cleaned out.   His heart was broken when he realised the love he once received had been been passed on to the latest acquisition of Goldie, the canary and as today has proved, he never got over that moment.   Gone but not forgotten, rest in peace Casper.

       In a fit of foolishness, I drunkenly agreed to resurrect my shambolic football career.  In a haze of Redbull, I remember telling somone that I was a 'midfield general'. I haven't kicked a ball in anger for at least 7 months, and don't exactly eat salad a lot.  However, I can still lug my considerable frame around for a bit, I don't think it's a question of being thin. Take Steven Hawking for example. Built like a washing line, but totally shit at footy. I reckon I could take him at most sports, except maybe wheelchair races. But that's only assuming he can't put a turbo on his chair.  But I'd never beat that big fat geezer at darts. He's mint.   So there you go. Try being skinny and athletic if you must, but I like to eat food and have a stomach the size of West Yorkshire. I might die ten years before those healthy eaters, but I won't have to worry about Alzheimers will I?

       My Drinks-o-meter total for the wedding I attended, which believe it or not was £2.75 a pint. £3.50 for a Smirnoff Ice, was 20 units of lager and 12 units of Smirnoff Ice.  A grand total of 32 units. Are we going to do weekly tables or will that just encourage Grovesy into becoming a fully blown alcoholic?  "Hean, I'm going to the pub, hic. I wanna be top of the, hic, league."

       Well. What can I say.  First, official Burnley Wallet congrats to Tony and Debbie Lane for tying the knot. May they have many happy years together.  Right. The beer total. I think we should go on a scale of units:  1 pint Lager/Beer = 2 units 1 Glass of Wine = 2 Units 1 Alcopop = 1 and a half Units Single spirit = 1 unit.  So a double vodka redbull is the same as a pint. Comment if you disagree, but this is the medical way of doing it.  I had (I think):  2 Pints of Lager = 4 units 5(ish) single Vodka Redbulls = 5 units 4(ish) double Vodka Redbulls = 8 units 1 Complementary Whisky chaser = 1 unit  Then went home for an hour, had a glass of coca cola and a ham sarnie.  Went back to the party. Only me there. Texted dickfingers to sort his ass out, and drank from then:  4 Smirnoff ice = 6 units Another 5 or so double Vodka Redbull = 10 units.  So we're talking 34 units +/- 3 to be totally sci-fi about it all. The healthy limit for a week is 28. To be consumed in a week. NOT ONE DAY!

       This is the run down of Tony and Debbie Lanes, Wedding night do thingy.  It was held in "The New Whale Hill social Club" where the lager was very nice and at a well low price of £1.70.  After getting a text from pierre saying get yaself out man, i decided to go, afterall I did go to his Stag weekend, as mentioned in previous posts.  Got there at around 7.15pm, to find most of the group well pissed!  Gotta say Pete, Joanne was well gone!  Had a couple of games  of pool, with Pete, Russ and Stevie, I was on fire, altho I was the only sober one!  After Pool, mingled with the group, then Totsy arrived, he looked as tho he had been attacked by a stapler, apparantly he fell over and smashed his head on the kitchen work top! OUCH!!!! Split his head right open.  Peter then decided to baffle us with his now infamous Foster beer mat trick! Still not sure how this works!  After this all the lads decided to invade the dance floor, we were in a circle (which I have renamed the "Circle of Death") we then took it in turns to do our own little individual dance in the middle of the aforementioned circle. Note: I made a fool of myself with my sheer lack of dancing ability.  After all that exercise i was knackered so we all sat back down, when the whiskey came round, after knocking back 2, i felt sick (no change there then lads eh?) so i went to the toilet, altho i DIDN'T spew. When coming out of the toilet a mole kindly informed me that my drink had been vicously spiked with about 5 Whiskey's!  Oh well you only live once.  Starts to get a bit hazy around this time, think we left the club about 11.30pm, when we were outisde a rendition of E-I-O burst out between me, Tom , and Stevie!  Great night had by all.  Cant wait to read Pete's, he was there all day!!!!

       Newcastle have moved quickly to halt rumours of a rift between Bobby Robson and Alan Shearer. A club spokesman said, "It's ridiculous to suggest that there is a personality clash between the two - everybody at the club knows that Shearer hasn't got one."   Why do Geordie Supporters have Moustaches? A: So they can look like their Mothers.   Q: What do Toon fans and laxatives have in common? A: Both irritate the absolute crap out of you.

The lad plays and scores a hat trick and after the game runs to the dressing room to phone his mum.  "Mam, mam, I LOVE it here ! I scored a hat trick against United, the crowd were cheering my name, everyone loves me, it's great !!!"  She replies "Well I'm glad you're f*****g happy. Do you realise your sister's been raped, you're Dad's been shot, and the house has been burnt down, and it's all your fault!"  "How is it my fault?" he replies.

       Well its almost 24hrs after the final whistle, I've eventually calmed down after 7 pints of stella. (i had to take half a day to get over the dissapointment).  So close yet so far.  We were robbed, everyone in the club was jumping up and down when Sol Campbell scored it wasn't until a good 45 seconds after he had scored did we realised it had been disallowed.  So 2-2 after extra time, the dreaded penalty shoot out, I text Mikey saying "Memories of France 98 Here, i told him to tell me to shut up and fuck off, he did". But to no avail.  Beaten on pennas yet again, how many times is this??  How shit was our so called captain??  Why didnt Vassell score??  Its all ifs and buts but it still hurts!  We had a great tournament, Campbell showed he is the best centre half in the world, Ashley Cole was Awesome, Frank Lampard keeps getting better and better, and Wayne Rooney well what can we say he lit up Euro 2004 for me, the lad is only 18, he is World class!  So another tournament and another disappointment, we should be used to it being England fans but it still hurts!  Roll on the start of The Premiership 2004/2005 season, when BORO march on to European glory!  Red Army!

       Think its a good time to start this whole monitoring drinkin-a-ninge type thing. So you weirdo's who can actually watch the match with other people take a note of your ale intake.

By the way KG, you saw To Kill a Mockingbird over several months whilst in English at Senior school.   Il buono, il bruto, il cattivo is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly starring Clint. Great film. And C'era un volta il West is Once Upon a Time in the West....another classic but not as good as the former. Now Once Upon a Time in America...don't get me starte don that...what the hell does the ending mean? After 3 hours I couldn't take anymore!  Keith, where's Dumb and Dumber? Are you gutted? Groundhog Day made it. Where's Total Recall and Commando? What about the first Rambo? Human Traffic? 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag? OMG! Where's Casino? Its as good as Goodfellas. Finding Nemo made it but Pinnocchio never....whats up with that?  Here's some films from my collection that never made it (please correct me if I missed them)..  Catch Me if you Can Clear and Present Danger Deliverance Donnie Brasco Easy Rider Enter the Dragon Falling Down Heat Kingpin Phonebooth Scarface Speed  How can't these films be in there? They are all superb. They have to be close to the top 250, especially Deliverance, Enter the Dragon and Scarface. How did Pirates of the Carribean get in ahead of any of the films listed above?  Oh and I own 43 of the ones I've seen on DVD. I know my good films me like.

       You did ask...  Three rats in a pub, had a few pints, and anyway they get on to talking about how tough each one of them is.   The first rat pipes up, "Now then lads, I was down in the pipework last night having a mooch about when I saw this great big piece of rat poison in the corner. I felt a bit peckish so I fucking ate it straight down. Got up this morning, shat it out whole, I feel great."  The second rat interrupts, "Thats bollocks, rat poison is part of every tough rats staple diet. Last week, I was in the kitchen and I spies a big lump of cheese on a trap. I walks over, takes a bite and WHAM! The trap swung over. But, me being me, the metal simply simply bent around my spine. I ate the cheese, lifted the trap off and went to bed."  The third rat tuts. "I've had enough of you two poofs. I'm going home to shag the cat."

       As if the story of Freja Svea coming aground Redcar wasn't interesting enough boyos. Just reading this little snippet. This was the  day before  it got stuck on the rocks.    "The crew of the Hartlepool Lifeboat, (The Scout, 44-018) must have been very thankful when their Waveney successfully self-righted itself after twice capsizing while on service to the tanker Freja Svea on the 28th February 1993.  Crew member, Robert Maiden, was washed overboard during the first capsize and spent 35 minutes in the water before being picked up safely by a RAF helicopter. Otherwise the crew only suffered some minor injuries.  The lifeboat did sustain some damage mainly to its communications, though it was structurally intact and seaworthy."   Oh and before you start singing it...here's the true lyrics...  Down on the beach on 1st of March in Ninety Three I got some news for you man there’s something in the sea The kids are there but Mum don’t mind They’ll remember this for all their time  	There’s a ship stuck on the rocks  	Down in Redcar Bay 	To see it with your own two eyes 	Will take your breath away 	There’s a ship stuck on the rocks 	Surrounded by the grey 	97,000 tonnes  	They call her Freja Svea  On her way back to set sail, but she’s been lead astray We read the papers, see the news and don’t know what to say The black and red in the midnight sky She disappeared overnight

What if Rooney's legs fall off? What if Heskey has a stormer in training on Thursday morning?  Quite happy to stop the tournament now, if you don't mind. Not sure I can manage another Argentina/Germany/Liechtenstein thriller.  PS: Isn't Roo-mania a country already?

       The best England performance since the 5-1 against Germany? No. But they did the job better than they usually do. Cue a Cristiano Ronaldo inspired backlash from Portugal. Rooney was superb though, Gascoigne, Shearer and Owen rolled into one.  COME ON ENGLAND!   By the way, white wine and peanut M & M's do NOT mix.

       Had enough of Lawrenson. Pressed the red button and listened to the Radio 5 commentary instead.  After ten minutes of thinking, Jonathan Pearce came up with the same Juliet Bravo gag!

       The start of the Premiership season draws ever closer.  Total excitement now, as the Boro have assembled possibly their strongest starting XI ever. Not one player can be classed as a weak link.   Internationals everywhere (except Francky Q, god bless his forward roaming cotton socks) and England's finest manager. It says so much that McLaren might tell England to stick it because of how his pet project is proceeding. Imagine that 15 years ago? No way.  Where could it go wrong?  I think we know where. West Brom. Bolton. Norwich. Must win this season I think.

       Back again, Ruxspins back, tell a friend!!   Back once again with the renegade master, people power, power to the people, back once again with the ill behaviour, with the ill behaviour.................   As you can guess, I'm back!!!   Been away for a while, doing a little bit of this and a little bit of that, but the good news is, am BACK!   A lot has happened since me last blog, Mikey has turned into a raving alcoholic (still not as bad as me tho) andPeter has (tried to)&nbsp; resurect his footy career.   Al start me review from last friday, it was a double birthday celebration at work, so on the Thursday a few of us banged in a half day to go out on the lash. We started in the Hoggs where I consumed 5 stellas in about an hour and half, we then moved up to The Dickens, sat outside had 2 pints of Carling (Does the Dickens have the best beer garden in the Town??), we planned to meet more people from work back in the Hogs for 3.30pm, so after the Dickens we moved back to the Hoggs, 2 more Stellas in here.&nbsp; I was really starting to feel in here, I think I had just finished me 9th pint when we moved to Llyods Resolution Bar, (It's a J D Weatherspoon's pub which serves really cheap drinks) I consumed a double vodka and Red Bull in here, we almost got shot out of Lloyds for "WRESTLING" in the middle of the pub, Oh man so funny! It was getting on for about 8.30pm now, and I was really feeling it, we moved on to Barry Cuda (as it will now be known as) I "think" I had a vodka and Coke in here. Half way through me drink, my&nbsp;liver was telling me to go home, so I rang around a few people scrounging for a lift, and Mikey came up trumps, he picked us up from Barry Cuda about 9ish, as he has already blogged I was destroyed, so drunk, I fell asleep in the car! Got in and went straight to bed!! Slept like&nbsp;a baby until I woke up, fully clothed at 9am Saturday!!! A top afternoon sesh was had by all!   On Saturday I took Mikey to his works for his fun day, I apparently agreed to take him pissed up the night before!&nbsp; As for the rest of Saturday, not much happened!   Sunday was a snooze fest!   Monday was back to work!   Tuesday, went to the Hoggs at dinner time and then after work.   Wednesday went to the Hoggs at dinner time and then after work.   As for the rest of the week I'm on strike thats right readers, we Civil servants are striking due to the lack of a pay rise and the new appraisal system, management have brought out! Read all about it on the  urlLink Unions web site .   Last night, went down to watch the footy and saw the best kick off ever, as reported by Mikey, Disco Dale's team lost 2 or 3 nil I think, Dales Dad was kicking off big style at the end with the Ref, not sure why!   The Boro's pre season campaign is going smoothly, they beat Preston 2-0 on Saturday and then destroyed Notts Forest last night 4-1, J F H grabbed his first Boro goals, big things are expected from him this season.&nbsp; Since I last blogged Boro have added Ray Parlour, I think he is a good signing and will do a good job in the midfield.   The Burnley Wallet possee plus invited guests are heading on down to the Super Riverside Stadium a week tonight to watch Boro in action against Real Mallorca, should be a good laff and Boro should triumph!   So lads enjoy work Tomorrow and Friday, al be thinking of ya when am sat in the back garden, in the glorious sunshine!!!!   P.S this is our 200th POST WOOHOOO!!!!!

       As soon as work finishes on a Wednesday night, my thoughts turn to the weekend, I have a monster works night out on Friday, this lass is leaving, well she left 2 months ago but this is the first opportunity for a works piss up, meeting in the Hoggs (man what a pub) at 4pm!   Then on Saturday, am not sure what am doing, probs end up going out with Mikey!   What are the rest of the boys plans for the weekend??   By the way August is going to be a monster month for me, this is am insight of my planned activities for this epic month, This Friday works night out, 14th Petes Birthday, 14th first game of the season, bring on the mags!. 19th York races, its a mega day out. 21st Dale and Emma's wedding, and before that I have to purchase my first suit, am a bit nervous like!

       Walked to footy last night to watch Pierre strut his stuff on the pitch, well on the touchline anyhow. Got there and talked the talk with the Newton sisters bless 'em. Got a bit dizzy spinning around to watch two games at once.   Anyhow, can't recall any of the scores or owt but saw the best kick off in the history of seven a side football if not football. Tony Lane just booting the ball against his fellow team-mate and&nbsp; calling him a f**cking wan*er had me laughing my arse off.   Perhaps Peter and Keith would like to elaborate.

       Excitement is mounting here at the Wallet, the official fixture list for our Serbian heroes Vojvodina Novi Sad (from here on in known as VNS) has been announced.  They start the season at home to Obilic, whomever they care to be, on the 7th of August. I always thought Obilic was that fat twat from Asterix.  You can see the full fixture list  urlLink here .

       Yesterday I attended the first ever works Fun Day organised by&nbsp;my employer. To be honest I was looking forward to this as much as Chris Davies used to look forward to getting an injection at school. Got there at about 2pm and just hit the bar hard. First drink was free. Wahoo! There was barely anyone there from work, about 30% of all employees I would say.   Anyhow the actual fun consisted of a bucking bronco, an inflatable slide, two, count 'em, two&nbsp;bouncy castles, sumo wrestling suits, a tombola stand, a weird tent where you could have your hair braided or get a henna tattoo (yeah, like there coming off!) and of course David Llewellyn's fantastic Punch and Judy display. Papa Lazarou as he became known, with the best Phoenix Nights fairground music you've ever heard.&nbsp;It was basically a bunch of gypo's trying to earn a couple of bob.   The most fun though was in the bar. Of course.  Got absolutely hammered on Fosters and Smirnoff Ice mixed, Turbo Shandy if you will and soon I descended into a foulmouthed train wreck of a human being! No change there then. A barbecue spread was put on, hot dogs and burgers! Hotdogs were overcooked and the burgers were greasy as. But the bread buns were nice.   Soon the auction rolled round and, me being me, I&nbsp;managed to put a bid in on every item just to piss people off who really wanted it and keep raising the price. It was a dangerous game!!&nbsp;I've acquired half a gym membership for two months for free&nbsp;apparently! Can't be bad.  So a bit later on, since quite a few people never showed, there was lots of free beer tickets going round. Think&nbsp;I blaged two free pints and a vodka and coke and a couple of bags of crisps. Got asked to bring the sumo stuff in and give a hand but as I got over there I saw a goal was out so you know just had to have a kickabout for half hour, cracking goal I tell ya. You had to be there.  7pm rolled round and it was decided to go into Middlesbrough and carry on the drinking. I was pretty much well gone by now and the bus from Darlo back to Boro was hilarious. Telling kids to "shut it son!"&nbsp;and "be quiet" is strangely great.  Got to Town and went to Lloyds, PVRB here we come, oh yeah!! That'll be a Pint of Vodka and Red Bull no less. Aaaaaah, so sweet, so alcoholic, so good.  Think I had something else in here, can't think what but then we moved onto Yates which was class. So much booze in here, it was two for three quid, reckon I had five bottles in here (I was in rounds you see). Some serious dancing and boogeying on down to be had in here. Got attacked by some birds, which was nice! Plus got the Daft Punk, Franz Ferdinand Take Me Out remix played which got a thorough stamping to.  Got rather bored in here after a while waiting for the rest of the gang, so me and Matthew (a regular BW reader!) moved on to Barry Cuba and had a Blue WKD in here. Shite in here as well so we went to Walkabout.  Some top quality tunage in here, all the singalongs, Wonderwall, Put Your Hands On, Take Me Out (again), I Beleive in a Thing Called Love&nbsp;and loads more I can't remember. Got a "Happy 40th Michael" message played for me and then got attacked by them women&nbsp;from Yates again. Must have been that aftershave I was nicking from the&nbsp;Nigerians in the bogs.  "One for tha ladeeeez?!?"   Yes please and I'll have a handful of chuddy and a couple of Chupa Chups too while I'm at it.  Anyhow, Matthew lost all his energy whilst I was still buzzing about like a demented child so we decided to see if we could find the rest of the group who we left in Yates, but they weren't there so we went home. Well, I did, I dunno about him, he had £3.80 left and lives in Billingham but being a divvy he refused my offer of money. Hope the bus station was comfortable fella.  So to sum up me&nbsp;pretty low expectations turned into being a fairly decent day/night out. Reckon I had eight or nine pints, two Turbo Shandies,&nbsp;one PVRB, four Red Square, one Raspberry poof juice,&nbsp;one Blue WKD and two pints of water in Walkabout. Can't be bad! Just for my liver.  How was your Saturday boyos?

       I can't think of anything to Blog lately.  Things are moving pretty damn slow on the Wallet at the moment.  If it wasn't for Mikey's hyperactive brain then we'd have nowt.  This is that horrible down time of the summer. No-one is doing anything and no-one can be arsed to get out and find something.  Let's get this shit back on track eh lads?

       Thanks for the comment Corvis.   Big Brother houses the finest set of human beings on TV in Britain, and quite frankly I'm sure Big Brother USA is just as good, don't diss BB. He's watching you ya know!

       Well I decided to leave the palacial content of my bedroom and get some fresh air last night by attending Peter's third foray in Eston's league of 7&nbsp; a side football. Got there about 20 minutes too late as Pete (pronounced in the same style as Pele, sort Pet-ay) had already been brought off. Oh&nbsp;and been substituted, Oooh matron!!   Yeah, so a bunch of peeps who I didn't particularly know played out a 3-1 I think. South Cleveland Garages? Who knows!? There was a far more interesting proposition on the pitch next to it.   After few meaty challenges, shoves and altercations it descended into chaos. The ref, some 45 year old pleb from New Mar'th'ke or somewhere like that struggled so hard to keep the peace giving it his best "Its only a game lads!!" . Football isn't a game, its not even about life or death, its more important than that.  Then after a few minutes the keeper of one team came rushing out and threw a punch! Then had his shirt ripped. Then about 4 other teamsters joined in, one of them landing a right hand worthy of Tyson. I tell you the noise it made when it connected is still echoing around the world. It was a corker!! Some fat geezer, the ref of the other game ran over and split them up.   Well anyway, after that Pete's team, the Game"snatch"ers played out a 0-0 draw with Disco Dale Millers&nbsp;team.

       It came as a surprise but I got the text through some time yesterday afternoon. &nbsp; "Hean, need to be out at 6pm tonight." &nbsp; Oh, I thought. Whats the crack here then? Rings him up, tiredness and skintedness had set in and wasn't up for a mega night out down town with that crazed up beer loon KG. But...the temptation set in, a few texts from Keith, a quick read of my blog of the night before and I soon changed my mind. Middlesbrough here we come!!! &nbsp; Chris Groves, Keiths little bro took us up there, started in TS1, pint of Carling and a mega chat about the night before, Groves had been to Normanby but he hasn't even posted anything on it yet?! Including a truly hilarious 'never to be blogged' story about David Carr. &nbsp; Supped that, the sun was shining on the poor lad and we all know how much he sweats! Moved down to The House, straight onto 'Word Up', the ultimate touch screen game. Got bored of that quite quickly and tried our hand at Millionaire and Stand and Deliver, or Hangman, as it should be&nbsp;known. When in marched Peter Duffy a former schoolmate and sent Keiths pint all over the place as he swung his arm round him! Two pints in here. &nbsp; Cracked on to the pool game as well, KG actually won a quid on it!! I reckon you should enter the tournament. &nbsp; Then we moved onto The Dickens Inn where we hyped up the Premiership season and Boro's chances, my prediction is 7th and quarter finals of the UEFA. Man Utd to win the league. Clocked a pint off in there. &nbsp; Flagged a taxi down and went to Lloyds, taxi driver was a complete wanker who disagreed with everything I said, although some of the things I was saying were pretty bad!  &nbsp; Went to Lloyds and enjoyed for the first time in so long&nbsp;the sweet sweet taste of a pint of vodka red bull. A 'PVRB' as we christened it one mad night down Redcar. Class thing in here was Big Brother was on the plasma screen but there was obviously no sound so we had to do the obvious thing and make our own sound up with our fantastic impressions! "Pu pu pu pu pu pu!!" cried Victor. &nbsp; Went next door to Yates, bumped into Pez (Lee Perry is his proper name, I think) who was a mate from college, got invited to his 21st birthday party at the Parklands. Got bought some stupid pink&nbsp;poof juice&nbsp;of a drink by Groves. It was quite nice actually! It was packed in here so we drank up and moved on now in a group with Pez and his mates. We were meant to all go to Huxters but the temptation of the Hogshead which is just before Huxters on the same road was too much. Drank a bottle of Reef in about 3 gulps which nearly made me chuck and KG won a&nbsp; fortune on the Monopoly fruity and managed to lose Pez and his mates. &nbsp; Gave the 'leaflet giver-outers' the usual stick who were outside the Hogs and went in Huxters. How packed?! The bar was four deep. So we 360'd out of there and went to Placid bar. &nbsp; Again, another unbelievably packed pub, moved on again, getting thirsty now!! Two pubs, no success. &nbsp; Barracuda....surefire hit and it was, got a Blue WKD in here after about ten minutes at the bar. Middlesbrough was truly packed last night. &nbsp; Then where? Mind is fuzzy now. Oh yeah Absolut bar, fucking hilarious in here doing a 'rap off' to the beat of the music that was playing, oh man I was in tears. &nbsp; God, covered some pubs last night. Marched across the road to Aruba, bumped into Darren Halpin a lad who used to work with me, he's in the Navy now. I think that's what he said but he might have just been singing YMCA songs. &nbsp; Never noticed this before in there but there's a massive cinema screen type thing on the back wall which I thought was rather impressive. Dunno what we drank in here. &nbsp; After Aruba we went to, jeez, memory is going, must have been Vienna. Oh yes its flooding back now, some truly memorable robotic dancing in here, some dangerous moves from the boys. &nbsp; Then we went to Hush, the nightclub above Absolut. &nbsp; Hush is one of the worse, most boring, featureless Nightclubs I've ever had the pleasure to have known. The silver stairs were more interesting. Absolutely shit in here. Don't go in. Ever! &nbsp; Left there after one drink and went to Walkabout. Shut. Had a major argument with the bouncer, lightheartedly of course. "£12 an hour" he yelled at my offer of a bribe. So what! He only works about 10 hours a week. £120 a week? Yippee!!! &nbsp; So we walked back down Albert Road to try Flares and that was closed!! Oh man. &nbsp; "Lets try Cornerhouse Hean" suggested Groves. So we did, and it was empty. A subdued end to the night and I think we both knew it was time for home, taxi'd back after a double rat burger from the stand which I brought back up when I got in. &nbsp; To summarise for the Drinks-o-meter: -   TS1 - 1 pint of Carling  The House - 2 pints of Carlsberg  The Dickens Inn - 1 pint of Carling  Lloyds - 1 pint of Vodka Red Bull  Yates - 1 bottle of poof juice  Hogshead - 1 bottle of Reef  Huxters - nowt  Placid - nowt  Barracuda - Blue WKD  Absolut - 1 bottle of Corona  Aruba - 1 bottle of something  Vienna - 1 treble vodka and coke. That might be why I feel so ill today.  Hush - 1 bottle of something, again not sure.  Walkabout - didn't get in  Flares - didn't get in  Cornerhouse - 1 bottle of lager   A classic night out I thought. I'll give it 8/10.  End of report. &nbsp;

       Woooh!! What a corker of a night out, I can't really remember much but I'm sure as I type it will all come flooding back!!  I excidetly left work at 4pm, the coat was on at 3.45, sped home, within the limits of course and got ready.   Got picked at 6 by Andrew Garrens missus and took to Joe Rigatonis for our evening meal. Table for 30 no less. One end of the table was in Joe Rigatonis, the other was in the Dundas Arcade it was that big! I got completely wasted in there as I tucked into my delicious burger (how adventurous!). I think the mixture of five pints of fosters, the introduction of "Did she just shake her tic-tacs at me!" (which went down a storm all night), a hilarious atmosphere being sat next to Mr Garrens and the fact I was so pumped up for the night out.   Hilarious scenes ensued when the food was brought out, 30 people take some serving, talk about confusing!! The waiters were even having a go at each other, it was class. I have to say Joe Rigatonis is one nice place, now they've done the upstairs out as well.  Left there at God knows what time and wondered down to TS1. Had a pint, really starting to feel it in there, my threshold for booze is sorely lacking!!  Then we moved on to the Dickens Inn, where I really did lose the plot!  WARNING: Mobile phones and alcohol do not mix.  Rang the boss, rang Neil, rang Marie, rang Martyn, rang Keith. I was completely bollocksed. I was staggering about the place, taking photos and generally making a total arse of myself.  WARNING: Arc Lager sends you completely mental. See above.  Managed to compose myself a bit and sent a few apology texts before we were dragged to Yates Wine Lodge. Got a double vodka and red bull in there which cost about £7 (is red bull an endangered species?)then proceeded to have it knocked out of my hand by an overactive Andrew Garrens! He bought me something shit as a replacement, Red Square or something.  Moved on from there to Barracuda I think. If anyone asked me anything that happened in here, I would genuinely not be able to answer I was so far gone.  Then I'm not to sure where we went, I think we walked down Albert Road a bit and along towards Chicago, rang Emma and she was in Walkabout with the rest of the crew so we wondered up there.  Walked straight in to Walkabout without paying, "Big guy's paying for me". He got his comeuppance for spilling my red bull!  There was a band on in here, Radiostar, pretty good, I think I moved onto water in here, saw Mark Nevison in here as well. Andrew G took an almighty slip on the dancefloor and took a hell of a fal, how we laughed!! He left shortly after as did everybody else one by one. Mikey is the last man standing once again!!   Top class night out, 20th August is the next one I believe. Bring it on!!

Middlesbrough is in for a full on attack of madness from yours truly. I'm fully kitted out in new gear, shoes, shirt and jeans..even some new aftershave.  The gang start in Middlesbroughs famous Italian restaurant, Joe Rigatonis, and then we'll move off down Southfield Rd. Watch out tomorrow for the full rundown.  Looks like Keith had fuck all to do today. Except find that putting a link in creates quite a cool little three dots in the heading...how sweet.  And Pete got home at 2pm.....do you guys ever work?  Jesus, its 4.43pm...I'm off out at 6pm.   Bring it on!!

       Ahh, must just be me!!!  Well I have finally got out of the pit, stayed up late watching Telly.  Honestly right lads can you imagine life without SKY DIGITAL. The terrestrial channels are Shite.  Every now and then you get a corker of a programme like, Big Brother or Bad Lads Army. But these programmes are few and far between, This is how good SKY is, after Big Brother last night, i watched The Office Xmas special, follwed by a Classic episode of Only Fools and Horses (the one where Uncle Albert falls down the cellar) and then after that I watched Dirty Sanchez. And thats not to mention all the porn!!! I finally went to bed about 1am!  Aint done a lot so far today, chilled out watching The Golf on the owld BBC, however this tends to get a bit boring after about an hour.  Am going to the pub for my dinner, Norman Conquest, aint been in for years, so that should  be alright.  No real footy news, however how lucky is Hernan Crespo?  According to the Sun, after being loaned out to AC MILAN, Chelsea are still going to pay him £74,000 a week, plus the £20,000 a week he'll recieve from MILAN. Why dont chelsea just sell him??   Boro in NO new signing shock horror!!! However we look like having a healthy following next season, with season ticket sales near to sell out. And so it should be with the signings we have made, lets hope they all gel together quickly.  So Mikey's big works night out is tonight, no doubt he'll have ridiculous amounts of alcohol, and may even beat me in the old Units stake this week.   Later.

       It's called the Burnley Wallet after the horrendous assassination move described by Paddy to Max in Series 2 of Phoenix Nights.  This was one of the funnier talking points of the night out in Redcar the night before the creation of said Blog.

       It's Thursday tomorrow, already!!! Hurrah! Night out with work is shaping up into a corker, over 30 peeps going out for the meal to begin with and abhout 15 staying out hopefully! Plus all the top night out people are going. Every workplace has them...the people who 'make' an average night out a memorable night out.   Introduced The Wallet to my boss Martin at work who's first question was "Why 'The Burnley Wallet'?" and do you know, it was damned difficult explaining...perhaps Pete could enlighten us!? Anyway he was most impressed with our efforts. Here's his dodgy bands  urlLink website . The Directors, he's the maniac in the red shirt in the middle.  (That'll be £10 please Martin.)   A massive 276 unique hits!!....celebratory pint for the 300th anyone?

       I decided to take Pete's advice and attend the football, only as a spectator mind.  There was Blood, Sweat and Tears, and that was just me on the sidelines!  Disco Dale and his side went down 2-0, two poor goals to give away, altho the other side, had a blonde streaked Robbie Fowler lookalike up front, it may even had been Robbie Fowler. He were a good player.  It was a good laugh stood on the sidelines with Pete, Russell and Tony M.  Mid way through the game, Billy from Blacky turned up to a scream of 'Billy dya wonna a half?' laughter of 'Dont give Billy a half he'll be dancing round the goalpost' entertained the crowd.  All in all it was a good night, something different to do on a Tuesday night, al defo be there next week, Hopefully Pete will be back to full fitness, so I can shout abuse from the sideline.  Anyhow am off to watch Big Brother.

       Yet another cock up from Mikey, can't you count man?  Can I just echoe, Can I just echoe! Mikey's comments on the 150th Blog, lets keep it going lads.  I know it gets hard at times for things to blog about, but together we can achieve the best.  So a see Pete has injured himself at home, he'll do out to get out of any exercise!  A think I'll go and watch some of the other lads (try) and play football tonight.  I can't belive its only Tuesday, thats 3 whole days until the weekend, think I'll sample the delights of Normanby again on Friday, then do the huge pub review on Saturday night.  The plan is to try and get it finished for about 10.30 - 11.00ish then head on down to the town, to finish off the night.

       150 posts in the bag. And now I'm all blogged out, it's tiring stuff this blogging malarkey, particularly midweek when at work, damn you!  Still questioning where Peter got the dancer from. I really don't want to know.  The mighty Boro have slowed right down in the transfer stakes. They haven't signed anyone for four days now! Can't wait for Vojvodina to kick their season off so we can get right behind them.  A works night out awaits me on Friday night which is looking like a similar route to our last night lads....expect the full report on here before 10am Saturday morning. Can't wait for that one. We've tricked one of the lads into thinking it was a Hawaiian theme night so hopefully he'll be fully kitted out in  urlLink Karmakula  shirt....Keith, why don't you sell him yours?  Saturday night, me and the Keith will be giving it full on steam ahead in his bedroom. Working on the pub guide that is. I tell ya, some people have filthy minds.  My weight loss challenge has been taken in good spirits, particularly by me and Pete who have both lost a good ten pounds between us. When I picked Keith up from work tonight and asked how much he'd lost...  "I can't be f***ing arsed."  "You are gonna have major problems soon you know!!"  "Don't care, had a good life."  So, I'm urging all the BW Readers to voice their support in what I'm going to call  "Lets get Keith into shorts for the stag-do"  campaign. Please contact us if you would like to leave donations for gym equipment.   urlLink I am Bored , the source for most of our links is dissapointing today, in fact its totally frigging useless today.  And to end, it aired on Channel 4 last night, 101 things removed from peoples heads. Now, you all saw the advert....what, just what was removed from the black boys head? Other than half his brain.  So from me to you, happy 150th post Burnley Wallet, may you have many more.

       No football tomorrow night loyal readers.  I had a small accident you see.  Myself and my lovely girl were shifting some old, unwanted, space consuming magazines.  Now, if you know me (and I know 2 of you do at least), I like to buy the odd magazine here and there.  So bin bags were torn as we tried in vain to shift 3 years of 4 magazines a week.  Lightbulb! Put them in the box they used to live in and then carry them out to the car!  So we got to the bottom of the stairs, when the f*****g box caved in.  And 70-80 magazines fell on my ankle.  Convinced that I'd broke it, I did the honourable thing and went pale green. I then applied a bag of frozen chips to the injury. We don't have frozen peas in our house, only the tinned variety, which would have caused more harm than good. Anyway, I digress.....  So no footy for me this week. I fear a kick in the ankle will finish me off. So a week away from the ultra competitiva second division for fat blokes who can play a bit and skinny blokes who look like they've never laid eyes on a football before.  I'll still go and watch though. Shout the lads on.

       The offical (unoffical) Burnley Wallet pub guide, should be on your computer screens this time next week.  Me and Mikey H are gunna get our thinking caps on next weekend, and try to review the pubs we currently have in our list. Whilst getting pissed in the meantime.  The list contains pubs we have visited and had at least one alcoholic drink in.  I can tell you this, so far we have over 100 pubs in the list, its gunna take a few hours but it will be well worth it.  So keep tuned for the Ultimate Middlesbrough Pub Guide!

       After the barrage of booze, burgers, parmo's and all the other shite we have rammed down our throats (oooh matron!!) over the years, the BW team has grown hefty round the midriff.   So I challenge you, fellow Burnley Walleteers, to lose a stone of lard by the end of August!!   I would like: -   - Photographic proof in the form of a picture of your bathroom scales   - A print out from a Boots/fellow chemist weighing machine.  - Witness testimonies, preferably from a fellow Walleteer.  I gave myself a head start with a heavy session on the exercise bike this afternoon though absolutely no pedalling was involved. Ho-ho!  You don't even have to be in the BW Team....the offer is open to all our readers!! Lets lose weight before the government makes us!!

       Slightly feeble this week. Can we have your Unit total for this weekend?  I trust Dundas Dickfingers and his sorry excuse for a liver will have won again.  I drank 10 bottle of Corona while sat on my arse at home.  So, 10 x 1.5 = 15 weedy useless units.  I'm just SO ROCK AND ROLL!

       Well Saturday night is here, I've managed to stay in. Two reasons, no-one to go out with and the thought of £70 odd quid going down the drain persuaded me to stay in.  Episode two of  urlLink Dreams of Surreal  has aired tonight. Part 3 of the 6 part series is approaching fast.   Fulham made their return to Craven Cottage today,  urlLink this  was an interesting story coming from the world of fussball today.  Just watched Big Bro, it is superb...but where was the live task?  In my last post I gave up on Saturday night TV which is funny because on Channel 4 as I type there is the "Who killed Saturday Night TV?" programme. Must have noted it sub-conciously.   The Cassini Huygens Saturn Probe is starting to show off  urlLink now .  Er, well I'm tired, so I'm off to bed.

       After giving up on Johnny and Denise, and basically Saturday night TV all together, I returned to my study and saw on my monitor...a conversation had been started by Keith....  "What ya up to Hean?"  Obviously I never responded, being downstairs in the entertainment lounge at the time.  "We have to do better than this mob. Followed by this  urlLink link .  What is so unbelievable is that I had actually added the very same link to my favourites several hours earlier!! Great minds think alike.

       That's right its that time of the week again 'The Weekend'.  The place where you can chill out and forget going to work for 2 days.  And for me its the time to get really drunk.  Last night I sampled the delights of Eston and Normanby's finest drinking establishments. I started off in the Eston Institute WMC, where the lager is really cheap, then it was down to the Normanby, on to the Woody, down to the Stap and then finished in Club G. Which was Rocking on 'E' as the local phrase goes.  How cheap is going round NBY?? Went out with £20, came back with £3 in me pocket, must of had 9 drinks and a full parmo couldn't eat it all, so I shared it with me sister). I can just hear Pete and Mikey now, 'Yeah Right'.  Not sure what al be up to tonight, probs give Mickey H and bell later on, see what he's up to.  As Mikey said last night Boro have gone transfer crazy anwithrh the possibility of Geremi and Zenden to follow, its a good time to a Boro fan, just cant wait for the season to start.  I'm defo up for the 4th August, Middlesbrough (soon to Uefa Cup champions) Vs Real Mallorca at the Riverside Stadium in a pre season friendly, we'll find out who's up for it and I'll sort out the tickets and what not.  My Sky Bet account still reads £138, I think I'll keep that money in there and that will pay for my day at York races next month.  I See Becki has gone from BB5, never really liked thought she was well WEIRD!  As Mikey put it, HACKMEAD to win anyone??  'HACKMANIA' will be be running wild if he does, it may even top 'ROOMANIA' when that was at its peak! But somehow I doubt it!  So lads enjoy your weekend!

       Friday has reached us, already. It seems like only seven days ago I was berating Skybet for my rapid descent in fundings. Thats right, it was seven days ago.  I would on behalf of The Burnley Wallet team like to thank all the readers, regular and non-regular, who have made it possible for our hits to sail through the 200 mark!! Heres to another 200.  Now, clicking on the Wallet to have a read through this afternoon, I noticed 5 comments for Peter's fantastic idea of the car vs train Top Gear rip-off. I can only see 4. Is anyone else getting rather annoyed at Blogger.com's reliability? How many times must a man refresh!!  I noticed under my "30 things to do before you're 30" post some Anonymous Loser has posted a defense of Dean "Dude, please" from Big Brother. Ha-ha! It must actually be Dean-o himself cos I'm quite certain he has no fans. And he was by no means funny.  My artistic outlet has hit the airwaves in the form of  urlLink Dreams of Surreal . It's weird I know but you know, I enjoy that kind of stuff and it is no way affiliated with the Wallet. Episode 2 coming this weekend some time I imagine. Free advertising, can't beat it.  Hoping the Grovesy gives in to temptation and accompanies me on a pre-emptive strike of Middlesbrough/Redcar town centre for top lashings of ginger beer! Or indeed, several Coronas and lime. Perfect conversation material being the Pub Guide which I'm led to believe has surpassed the 100 pubs mark wihtout even adding Peters list!! Keiths got the cogs turning and is giving it 110%. And thats just in the Eston Institue tonight.  Becki vs Hackmed in  urlLink BB5  tonight, who goes, we decide apparently. My pick is for Hackmania to be still running wild come 9.30pm. "I'm coming for you Davina!!". The loon. Becki to go.  Football appears to have gone insane over the last few days. Middlesbrough FC at the core of the lunacy with three amazing signings, Michael Reiziger, Mark Viduka and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. I'm expecting big things from them three, particularly the strikers. Keith Lamb, Boro's Chief Exec has promised more signings!! Peter Crouch has put to pen to paper with Southampton. Ian Harte has signed for Levante as well.   I'm well up for the Boro friendly on the 4th August, you will have to remind me who its against. Perhaps it could be a birthday present, a ticket that is and not a place in the first eleven! I remember how good Alaves was two years ago....do you? Apart from the rain that is.  Staying with football, Vojvodina Novi Sad's early history is  urlLink here .  Had a half day holiday today, went to Asda, Southbanks favourite supermarket and treat myself to £20 worth of unleaded for the Punt-oid and two DVDs, Big Fish and Lost in Translation. Both are superb. Well worth a viewing. Borrowed Dumb and Dumber off Keith "its my favourite film" Groves. I have to say it was just pure genius. Just cracked me up. It's such a cack story. There's just something about it.  Say goodnight JV! Goodnight JV!

       Remember that mad Car/Train race thing on Top Gear?   We should do that. Mike and Grooves on the Intercity and me pegging it down the motorway to London in the motor.  We could start from M'bro railway station, then you'd have to go to Darlo, change trains and we could see who was first to get to a certain place.   What do you reckon? You'll have to wait until I get paid though.

       Well, it doesn't seem like Breaking news anymore as you probably now know, that Jimmy Floydd Hasselbaink looks like signing for The Boro, this would be a great signing and I think he would link up great with Boro's other new signing Mark Viduka.  That takes our summer signings to 2 at the minute, (jimmy aint signed yet)it promises to be an exciting season at the Riverside this season. We still need a left sided midfielder and if reports are to believed that seems to be Bolo Zenden.   urlLink Come on Boro!

       Those that read the Evening Gazette will know they are running a competition, 'Grab a Grand'  Well after returning from the hospital, our mam goes. Go and enter that Gazette competition Keith, so off I went to the phone to answer the simple question, How many pennies in a pound? (even I couldn't get that wrong)  The rules are the winner will be contacted by telephone shortly after 8pm  So it gets to 7.55pm and I decide to go upstairs with Mobile phone in hand!  I dialed our home number, and in my most suave and enthusiastic voice I said the following "Good evening, could I speak to Keith Groves please?" our mam replies "who's speaking please?" "Its Michael from the Evening Gazette's, Grab a Grand competition, I'm delighted to say he's won tonight's draw" is my reply, An over excited Mrs G shouts up the stairs "Keith you've won the Grab a Grand". I got to the phone and said "Sorry not interested" Our mams face dropped, I then revealed to her it was all a joke! Our mams reply "you bastard"!!

       From the hospital, finally got that lump removed from me left testicle!  Only joking, been visiting our Kathryn who has had her tonsils out, she's alright and will be home 2mrw.  With us half way thru the week, my thoughts now turn to the weekend, whats the crack, Pete cant make it so does that just leave me and Mikey? Doesn't matter how many turn up I know I wil be pissed so I dont care!  A repeat of last weekend will go down a treat, the route we took last week may be the best route in the town, altho I would swop Chicago Rock for another night club!  So roll on Friday @ 3.30pm when I leave work and start drinking!

       Right lads considering I aint blogged for a few days, well one, thought i would, well basically,  BLOG!!!  It looks like Pete is getting a bit bored of the wallet and needs something to keep him entertained.  So fans of the wallet get suggesting, we NEED you! Without you we are nothing!  Talking to Mikey yesterday I came up with a corker of an idea for a little side venture to the blog, THE BURNLEY WALLET PUB GUIDE, Mikey has sorted the website out, so watch this space for a monster review of every pub we have visited. (it may take a while like)  Am sure Pete is at Footy tonight, wonder how he got on, no doubt he will let us know later on.  Boro have today made there fist summer signing,  urlLink Michael Reiziger  on a free transfer from Barcelona, and with Mark Viduka and hopefully Bolo Zenden arriving shortly, things are shaping up nicely for us Boro fans.  Hey Mikey, crackin blog lad on the 30 things to do before 30, I will try and comply mine in the near future.  Altho one point I noticed, you r gunna have to learn to swim first before you can accomplish SWIMMING WITH DOLPHINS!

       This is how I spent most of last night.  I was on the net, Keith was in the 'ogs (+) at their weekly pub quiz.  The mobile rings....  "Hean - at the 'ogs, pub quiz. What was the name of the lottery winner from South Bank?" Vast amounts of background noise.  "Eh? Can't hear you. Speak up. Tell that woman (the quiz hostess)"  "Hean - what was the name of the lottery winner from South Bank?"  "Hang on, I'll search the net..........Iorworth Hoare"  "What!" More noise.  "I, O, R"  "That's not a name ya lardhead!"  "Ow daft c....ya listening?"  "Yeah go on....here Alan what was question 6?"  "KEITH!!!!"  "Go on Hean, I'm listening."  "I, O, R, W, O, R, T, H"  "H, O, A, R, E"  "Cheers Hean, tra."  But sadly that wasn't the end of it....I received 6 or 7 texts which all needed a reply because Mr Gropves couldn't type because he was pissed. I also got about 18 phone calls all far worse than the one above. Frustrating? I nearly drove to Middlesbrough to strangle the bastard.  They did however win the quiz thanks to our cheating capabilities and total lack of respect for the law.  What did they win after all my efforts?  £25.

       We had left Vienna and on our way to Chicago, when this Renf was being an arse and banging into everyone on purpose. If I can describe him, Scruffy, quite short and skinny, pretty drunk, Jack Duckworth style glasses and moustache.  He had just dished out some stick to these lads and a group of lasses in front of us, so Mikey being Mikey decides to walk straight into him and almost knocks him flying, he then mouthed off some verbals to us, to what I responded with  "You should have gone to specsavers ya scruffy c**t"  The lads and lasses in front of us where pissing themselves!  Apparantly the laffs could be heard in redcar. Very amusing and I felt very proud of myself.

       I tend to agree with Mikey's blog about last night, I must admit I have had better nights out, for some ereason or another everyone seemed to be dead serious. Never mind plenty more nights out to come.  Before the night out me and Pete went out for a few pre match pints, started in the Hogs (sign of the cross please) where we won £10 on the Fruity, by the way they have replaced the HOLD/LO button with a white plastic button, where someone has wrote on in permanent marker, HOLD/LO. Pete found this highly amusing!  We watched the footy scores coming in on Soccer Saturday, where would we be without that magnificent programme? (I guess back to the old days of watching TELETEXT)  We had 2 pints in the Hogs (Sign og the cross please) and as it became harder and harder to get served we moved onto Walkabout, swift pint in here before we ended up in Barry Cuda again watching the scores come in and a few games of pool.  We then walked all the way to the match (God I did some walking yesterday man).  Check the BW Premiership site for a match report.  After the match the plan was to meet Tony M on the roundabout and then walk back into Town, after waiting a good 20 mins for him, Pete finally got hold of him to the sound of 'Am at the UGC cinema' Nice one Tony. Whilst on the roundabout we met Newcastle's hooligans, it took a good 20 coppers, 4 police horses, 4 CCTV police vans and several police dogs to prevent Me and Pete from getting at them, they were bricking it! Eventually the police escorted them back to the train station I presume.  So we finally ended up back in the pub a good 40 mins after the match had finished and met up with everyone else.  Mikey has covered most things in his review but he has missed out arguably the best part of the night, it was around 12.30am, I think, and the new sandwich SUBWAY had just shut, but me and Mikey were having none of it, cries of 'Please re open were starving' after a firm NO by the cleaner who looked a lot like Mikey, we decided to rip him to bits, am sure this line came out 'What gives you the right to look like Mikey??' the poor he will be mentally scared for life. They still wouldn't open up so we rubbed our sweaty palms all over the clean windows, and pulled faces up against the window. God what must we have looked like??  So after the actitvities of last night, I'm totally cream crackered today I was going to go out tonight seeing as tho I'm off for the next week, but I aint got the energy.  Roll on next week for the wedding!

       I was also highly disappointed by last night.  Whilst the people were in and the hearts were willing, Middlesbrough's feeble nightlife once again failed to match the expectation.  We went in, ooh, 6-7 pubs, and they all played by far and away the worst music I've ever heard. If it's not Lionel fucking Richie then it's anonymous house "beats" played by some moron who considers himself a DJ just because he's got some "Decks".  Chicago Cock Cafe is the worst offender. You can time the order of the night in there by the same music every week. Very nice if you're a 35 year old slapper with too much gold on your fingers and too much blonde in your hair. But no.  My favourite pub in the town is Isaac Wilson's. No music you see.  I heard one good song all night, and that was in Yates (not known for it's music) but the other pubs were a fucking tragedy.  Is it too much to ask for pubs to play Dance music or uptempo pop songs that everyone knows without having to play Don't stop me now by Queen or indeed, in times of need, The Grease Megamix. We're not fucking 11 you know.  It really puts the mockers on my nights out, and was 20-30% of my reason for rejecting Chicago Rock.  Don't get me wrong, I like Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. But I'm 25 years old. 5 years younger than the aforementioned song.  I rest my case.

       So despite all the planning yesterday panned very unlike what we said. I'mk going to be honest, last night was a major let down.  Everywhere was packed to the rafters, there was too many of us out and we couldn't agree where to go.  The attendees - Me, Keith, Pete, Joanne, Emma, Dale, Claire, Steven, Russell, Rachel, Charlie and Tony Tony M.  Started in Yates - packed from the match and had a couple in here. Then we went to the 'ogs to give thanks - had a few more in here - again it was packed and uncomfortable.  Moved on to Walkabout where myself and Keith managed to lose everyone - even though we saw them queing outside and were banging the windows. They decided against it and went onto Cafe Placid - or so the text said.  Gets to Cafe Placid - not there. They are in Barry Cuba - goes in there - not there.  "Where are you" I cried!  "Barry Cuba" They replied.  Could we fuck see them - moved further on down to Absolut Bar and had a traditional Corona and Lime then as we left bumped into the others again.  There was suggestions of Southfield Road, swiftly put down and then some wanted Aruba but we finally agreed on Vienna's beer garden. Or yard as it should be known.  Had a two treble drinks in here. Again it was absolutely packed. Precisely nothing amusing had happened yet.   Left here and went to Isaac Wilsons - singing Boro songs in here, pretty good. Left there. Think Pete and Joanne went home when they saw the queue for Chicago Rock. Me and KG walked round to Walkabout I think - no-one else allowed if I remember rightly. Walked up to Europa for a parmo then walked back to the CornerHouse - then walked back all over the fucking shop - lost Groves - had this girl come running up to me in tears who looked like she'd just been battered and didn't know where she was - walked her back to the Empire and made sure she got in the car with her Mam. Local hero me ya know.  Spent about three hours looking and waiting for a taxi - finally got in one with this bird who was going to G-Town. Gave the driver so much stick - threatening to report him, completely uneccessary as well so he decided to turn the car around and take us back to Middlesbrough!! The best line of the night from the bird in the taxi -  "Are we in Eston already?"  Classic. Had a mega barney with the taxi driver but got his number plate down - Groves is going to write to the Council!   Dear Sirs,  What it is right.....   We then walked to the bus stop at Maccie D's near the UGC where Groves fell asleep. I reckon I walked about 10 miles last night and flagged approximately 75 - 100 taxis without success. Walked back to the A66 ramp and finally flagged a Kiwk Cars minibus. Hallelujah!! It turned out to be some bloke Groves knew - he'd taken them to Arsenal away or summat last season to watch the Boro.  Got in at 4am.  Total disaster. Must do better next time!!

       Seeing as tomorrow has seen more planning than D-Day and is quite frankly becoming rather annoying here is the final summisation: -  Keith, Pete and Tony M go to watch Boro beat the Geordie pink-eyes at the "Super Cellnet Riverside Stadium sponsored by Bradley the Jewellers".  They then, once the game has come to its conclusion, walk to the Hogshead (signs of the cross please) where they meet.....  Me, Jo, Claire, Steven, Dale, Emma, Rachel, Russel, Joanne and whoever else fancies it at  approximately  7.30pm. Please note we will watch the match at home!  So we are then together as one! We then follow this proposed route outlined by Peter: -  Lloyds Yates Huxters (please give thanks when passing the 'ogs.) Walkabout Barry Cuba Shush Areeba Del Rasa This means nothing to me, Ah Vienna Chicago Suck my Cock.  We then go home with various items of pub paraphernalia and look back on an evening of merriment and fun and blog it on Sunday. Can't fucking wait.

       What do people do on a Friday night??  I mean I have decided to stay in, it was very hard to say "NO" to the lads at work who left at 3.30 to go get wrecked.  I remained strong to the cause (SaturDAY/NIGHT). Ieven stayed at work until 5ish tonight, what is the world coming to?  So readers I ask you, if your not out on the lash on a Friday night what do you do?? Am sat here watching the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, which is terrible, and pointless, just what is the point, get on with it!!!  Where is Gambling Joey?? Aint heard from in for a few days, I thought he was going to leave us one of his so called tips each week. His team QPR play Sunderland tomorrow so come on Rangers!  As Mikey has already mentioned him, Ray Robocop Mallon, he is our new hero and we will do impressions of him until it gets boring, (Probs Saturday night).  Why isn't it SATURDAY????

Cos if there out early we could all go out early doors we then leave them go the match and then meet back up with them after the match.  Tell ya took some sorting out this night out an it?

       Just another day of stress, heat, snide remarks, negativity - and that's just on the way to work giving Keith a  lift.....and then I will be in paradise - the weekend is nearly here!!  I'm so in need of a serious amount of alcohol I suggested me and KG meet after work tomorrow and get trashed - we finally agreed it was the wrong thing to do and ultimately would ruin Saturday. Look out Middlesbrough there is a lot of pent up agression and energy waiting to explode!  Liking the look of Keith's route - especially if we limit it to one drink in each pub and try and cover a load of them.  Still giggling at the thought of going home with the croc with his tail hanging out the side of the door.  "It's not real taxi driver.....here, have a stroke!"

       As Mikey has correctly pointed out I missed out the ozzie Barrr Wankabout.  Mikey goes 'How are we supposed to nick the croc if we dont go in?'  This is a very valid point so, I say we now end up in there, wait til its gone 2am, when the lights come on, wait til no body's looking then get it!  I can just see us now trying to rip it down, "It's not gunna budge", or "Just sack it"  HAHAHAHAHHA!!!!  Can't wait!

What does this do to the plans, I presume Me,  Pete and Tony M (will his jacket be with him?) will meet up after the match and walk to the pub ( Hog's Head ) together.  What about if we meet in the  Hog's  and then jump in a taxi to  TS1 , do the  House ,  Southfield Rd  Area, then work our way down to  Lloyds Super Duper Extreme Resolution Bar , then  Barry Cuda , then mebs  Aruba , possibly  Vienna  before probably ending up in  Chicago Cock .  Thoughts People!!!  Am not really arsed what the route is, I just know Boro will do the business and the town will be BOUNCING!!!!  Come On!

       It's been a slow few days, all the talk and thoughts this week are about Saturday, I can't remember looking forward to a day as much as this since Blackpool!  There should be a good turn out for the night, and it will be of epic proportions!  Not too sure about ending up in Chicago Cock, I always seem to make an arse of meself in here. (Dancing on the table and Sir Bobby Groves, are just two occasions that spring to mind)  Yesterday I left work and poped in the 'Ogs for a quick pint' this was at 4.40pm, I left my place of worship at 8pm!!!  I have decided to knock the booze on the head, during work days, spending far too much money.  A see Gambling Joey's side got a good pasting last night eh?? It may be a long old season for them.

       Man, this is turning into one seriously slow boring week. If it wasn't for the excitement of work and all this beautiful weather where having I'd be depressed. I think the excitement Saturday is growing to epic proportions - its going to be a humdinger of a day and night. Been listing various items that I want to bring home - the bike and the croc obvious exceptions - and I have some classics up my sleeve.  I'm still recovering from my minor heart scare after viewing that Mary thing - pretty much fell off my chair when I saw it.  Also lads, when was the last time we hit Redcar hard? I'll tell you - the first day of Euro 2004. That's when. About time we visited before the sun dissapears completely.

Then  Walkabout  before it gets too rammed, then  Barry Cuba , then  Aruba .  And all finished in  C. Cargos Ruck Cofféé . For a top night out.   I can't wait!

I would like to shake his hand, for not once breaking into a run when he had nigh on 60 stone of drunk, annoyed Whale Hill geezer striding purposefully behind him. Ready to part his head from his shoulders.  Sadly, the fuzz intervened, and said Poofters head remained part of his physiognomy (is that a real word? Is now.).  Memories are made of this! Ah, Kudos.

       Could be an EPIC!  First of all its the first day of the new Premiership season, and the mighty Middlesbrough kick off against our local rivals, Newcastle United, it promises to be a corker a game with new signings expected to make debuts on both sides. However as always am mega confident of a Boro win, to set up what will be an AWESOME atmosphere in the town.  With the game live on Sky, and not kicking off til 5.15pm, after the match the town will be bouncing.  I'll meet up with Tony M after the match and walk to the town with him to meet up with the gang, who will be half cut by now anyways, as there out to watch the match. Me and Tone will have some catching up to do!  The Hogshead or the 'Ogs' as Mikey has renamed, is an obvious meeting point!  So I'm well up for saturday, BRING IT ON!

       "Hean, fancy coming out?" - text received 7.19pm.   Phone Conversation 7.20pm   "Yeah where are ya?"  "In the 'ogs"  "Who's out?"  "Just me."  "Er, aye go on then!"   Phone conversation ended - 7.21pm   Its as simple as that. Pete took us down there and met up with the big guy who had already sank eight or nine pints and was shaky to say the least - he was already singing songs at the top of his voice, so it was up to me to play a bit of catch up. Downed a couple of pints Stella as Keith and myself sent about £45 into the fruity and won back about £41. It's the only one I've known keep you playing so much. Plus one of the buttons was stuck so we acquired a knife and set it free and I am now the proud owner of a Hold Lo button!!  Got Keith a pint of water to calm him down a bit. It seemed to work before the arrival of Big Brother - The Final on the plasma screens. Who's first go? Shell!! Woooh! Straight onto the phone lines to vote for the Honest Scotsman Jay.  Onto HSBC Bank for Keith to get some hardearned cash out and then down to Yates. Empty. Took about 15 minutes to get served so I had a go at this pleb behind the bar - greasy haired student scum. Get a wash! Anyway finally got served by the gayest barman ever. Got two Reefs - is it non-alcoholic orange juice or what? - it sailed down the throat. KG meanwhile played some more fruity.  On to Lloyds Super Resolution Hyper Screen Pixelation Bar - wow I have never seen it as empty as this. Unbelievable. Pint of Vodka Red Bull in here - PVRB (a K&H Trademark) - Keith still managing to keep up and showing no signs of flagging. Eviciton number two - who's third? Dan!!! - Super cool eviction.  Classic bust up with a homeless guy - who was wearing an Inter Milan shirt - "Ere mate, how come you've got a inter shirt on - £40 that ya daft c...."  "Mumble...mubblle"  "Eh?! Speak up eh!"  Its not big and its not clever but its damned amusing especially when Keith proclaimed: -  "I'm gonna boot him in the face!"  We marched up the road, well stumbled anyway. Paid homage to the 'ogs with the sign of the cross and onto Walkabout where the lunacy began - it was a mega BB night in Walkabout!  Gets in there - it was rocking, some mega tunes band was about to start, plenty of women and then the Big Brother Tickets competition. Two tickets to the aftershow party next week in the BB House! Huzzah.  Up steps a very drunk Mr Groves and four other misfits from the energetic crowd - this was going to be a popularity contest based on numbers of cheers. Keith first.  "What's your name?"  "Keith..........from Eston. YEAH!!!"  A few coughs from the crowd. I gave a hearty cheer.  "What will you do on camera at the BB Aftershow Party?"  I was literally screaming and making the actions "Scuttle Davina - come from behind!!" - a surefire line (stolen from Chubby Brown) to win tickets and please the audience.  What was Keith's reply?  "I'd get me big fat belly out!"  I nearly left the place - bang goes my ticket to stardom. It wasn't going to be difficult to beat.  Up next some bird from Redcar who was asked the very same question.  "Er, I'd get pissed."  Riiiiight? Well of course you would pet, it's a bleeding aftershow party. I tell you, some people eh? Keith was leading the pack in terms of popularity. Come on Groves - were going to the BB House!  Up next another duffer from Boro. Same Question.  "I dunno really"  Jesus Christ, the worst answer ever - KG is going to be rapping with Victor come next week!  The next one was some fit bird with delightfully ample breasts. She had massive tits basically. I could see it coming a mile off and quite frankly I think we have a case for artisitc infringement.  Her reply,  "I'd get me tits out!!" in the best Boro scally accent you've ever heard.  Now this obviously got a huge roar!  And last but not least some seriously ugly weird bloke who replied,  "I'd have a threesome with Dan and Nadia."  Ouch - stunned silence from the audience.  The DJ then gave it his best "Who should go to the BB House? Do you think it should be him (threesome weirdo)?"  "BOOOO!!!"  "Do you think it should be her (tits woman)?"  "YEAHHHH!!!"  So the lovely lady won it. And KG got a t-shirt with BB on as a consolation which was nice. Anyhow we danced the night away - Groves got stuck into a minger, I talked the talk with the lovely lady who'd won the tickets and the band who were setting up. Managed to win a BB Shirt of my own just for cheering the DJ for putting a good song on! On it went - a tad tight I have to say. Anyhow the band hit us with some classic tunes, Day Tripper is the only one I can really remember, they weren't on very long either to be honest.  Groves disappeared and, checking my phone this morning, I'd sent him 9 texts all asking where he was, get back in here and where are you? Got some seriously weird replies so I couldn't tell where he had gotten to.  Anyway time for home, can't stand being alone in a nightclub so into a taxi I got. being a complete tightwad I decided that breaking into a note wouldn't be a good idea so I challenged the driver to see how far he could get for a fiver. He then proceeded to turn the turbo on the meter but managed to get to Normanby - a good 20 minute walk from my house. Oh man, guess I'm walking the rest! So I rang Keith to see if he was home and if he would pick me up. "Yeah course I will Hean!". Obviously as a wind up because we don't condone drink driving here at the Wallet. and every twenty yards I would ring him back up.  "Where are ya?!"  "I'm coming down Normanby Road now! Be five mins, don't move!!".  Guess you had to be there!!  Is that it Keith, can't think of much more? Thought it was a top night out once it got going - can't wait for next Saturday.

       It looks like I will be spending my Friday night indoors and missing out on what was promising to be a mega 'piss-up'. IBS carried on in the internals of my colleague at work and he managed to blag his last day off, but seeing as we have several personalities who won't stand for this sort of thing he is having to come in next week on his holiday's to sort everything out! He he he! They don't fuck about if stuff needs doing.  Of course that part time alcoholic Keith groves was called on the mobile, as usual at about 4.50ish, to see if he required a lift home from work.  "Nah Hean, its Friday innit, in the 'ogs".  That'll be The Hogshead, Keith's second home. If not first.  So roll on Big Brother Finale.....Jason to win by some weird fix just to prove it isn't a fix....if you know what I mean. You see, every paper has been lambasting Endemol and Channel 4 for overzealous editing and very clever stuff to make Nadia appear as the favourite. Wouldn't it be sly of them to fix it then for someone else to win to clear their names and prove a point? Just a theory. I know for a fact it won't happen.  For the uninitiated its Peter's 25th (ouch) birthday tomorrow and we're staying in apparently and saving it for the week after! Can't take this lack of alcohol!!!

       BB5 fans out there and Big Brother 5 non-fans I have to express my dismay at the complete shock of Stuart's eviction! May have been the fact I bet on him in the early stages to win but didn't anyone else think he brought a lot to the house?  If Nadia wins, God help us.

       Of course for all you BB5 Nadia fans out there she did of course spell Balloon, Balon and I'm quite sure if you asked her to spell 'gender dysphoria' and she'll have reeled it off like a Countdown veteran!   urlLink Have fun here!   Reminds of my wasted youth spent trying to do Yo-Yo tricks but only for it to just go back to its original state.

       Regular BW reader Matthew "Mario" Scarth comes up to me nigh on every day at work to say how he's read about my latest escapades on 'The Wallet' and how robotic tag dancing had him pissing himself cos he and me were doing it just a few weeks ago!  So, Scarthface (although we all know who the true Tony Montana of Teesside is), here's your opportunity to say a big hello to the BW Team. Sign the guestbook as well please dude.

       Ah, Saturday night rolled round again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cos he had the shits and had been out Friday night (Though why its not blogged is a complete mystery) and didn't fancy going down Redcar with the Rushby twins, Carl et al who were bombarding me with texts and phone calls asking if the K&H connection would join them Keith Groves was firmly staying put.&nbsp;I was tempted by the invite but the thought of a solo taxi home put me off.   So it seemed I seemed to be spending my Saturday night with Johnny and Denise but my power of persuasion is just too convincing. Yes, me and the 9r00v3s (who's name is including more and more numbers) decided it was time to hit the town hard. Again.   6.45, the two Heaney lads Dad picked us up and drove us to...    Hogshead     &nbsp;  Started in here, a regular fave of Mr G. He's in here daily after all. Two pints of Stella and then we were joined by Paul, Keith's workmate.&nbsp;Now Paul had been to the races the day before and produced a wad, like a good 30 - 50 betting slips which were all losers!! We hit the Monopoly fruit machine and poured a good £35 into it&nbsp; between us but slowly teased it back out in remarkable fashion only for Keith, the apparent seasoned pro, to keep selecting the hidden features and lose out on £8. Grrr. I stayed firmly back and let them go at it. Oooh, matron. Next pub please!    Lloyds Bar (Super Resolution McDoofer or whatever the hell it's real name is)    After the 'ogs we marched here and after nearly getting run over by a taxi went upstairs and was bought a double Knob Creek (50% whisky)&nbsp;and coke (50% sugar) which knocked me for six. Bumoped into Darren Halpin a former workmate and we pulled off the best&nbsp;Pollard impressions you've ever seen (For KG and Pete only)!!&nbsp;Oh and as for the addicts the went straight back downstairs for the fruit machine, wasn't paying attention so don't know how much they lost or won.    Yates Wine Lodge    Went next door to Yatesies. 2 for £3 can't be bad. Orange Reef is so easy to drink. It's just still orange!! After clocking three of them in approximately 7 minutes, Keith made a hasty visit to the lav to try and bring some of it back up but apparently failed. Yeah right. Also bought a test tube of blue-spirit for us all in here which was manky.    Huxters     &nbsp;  Felt like I was dying in here, drinking the warmest VK Ice ever, absolutely minging, visited the bogs to try and cool down and swill me face only to scald my hands in the lava that was coming out of the taps. Nigerian was in here selling aftershave etc. For&nbsp;£1&nbsp;I got a few squirts of aftershave, two chupa chups and a handful of chuddy to a rapturous applause from the rest of the lads in the toilets. "How much dya want for a quid mate!?" "As much as possible lads!!" including "One for da ladeeezz!"    Walkabout    Went in here and it was&nbsp;very packed I think, took me ages to get served, again can't recall what&nbsp;I drank. God, not a clue what happened in here. Not a good thing when your trying to write down some classic memoirs to look back on in future. Ah well, can't have been anything interesting.    Hogshead Revisited    Went back in here for some reason, ah yes, Groves was meeting more work mates who just looked bored or could have been half dead, I think they'd been out since 2pm or something. Groves will fill me in on the details. Can't recall what I drank in here.    Placid    Did we go in here?    Barracuda    Here?    Absolut Vodka Bar    Mmmm, Corona and Lime after all them sweet drinks. Bleeeuuurgh. Think we met up with Paul's bird in here. There were some seriously nice women in here, unreal! More fruity action in here, sad as fuck some people I tell ya.    Vienna    Pretty dull in here as well actually, looking back it was a pretty dull night out actually so far.&nbsp;Had some robotic dancing in here which cheered me up!! Tag-robotics with random people joining is classic with the hardest tags you've seen! For&nbsp;the uninitiated one person starts robot dancing tags the person next to him, freezes and perons two begins and tags the next person, freezes and so on and so forth! Must be hilarious for other people to see us big guys carrying out&nbsp;such athletic moves.    Walkabout again?    Not sure if I've missed anymore pubs out but we went back in here and whilst in the cue, met a St Peter's teacher who was decidedly fit so you know, paid her in but then she promptly dissapeared! Could have been fun!&nbsp;   However, ended giving it some seriously &nbsp;raunchy dancing with a dangerously old woman. Oh Christ, you always remember the bad things! I kept looking across at Keith and every time&nbsp;I did I was met with a "You bucking her tonight?" which I replied with a very slow firm shake of the head.&nbsp;   Some classic tunage in here. My Generation especially. Bumped into another workmate, Aaron who was completely out of it. We went upstairs for some reason but when got there we'd forgotten why so we came straight back down again.   Groves was dying of exhaustion&nbsp;in here so he decided to go. Had a mega barney with this old woman and her mate, in jest of course, and left to see if I could find the other half of my taxi fare.   "Grovesy where are ya?"   "Pizza shop"   What a waste of a phone call, of course he's in the pizza shop.   So he got his parmo I got a double rat burger off the van and we headed for home, bumped into Darren again so he joined our taxi and then this lass as well who heard we were from Eston asked if she could join our taxi as well cos she lived in Bankfields. What sane woman would get in a taxi with three blokes she doesn't know? Man alive. A hilarious taxi drive ensued, lots of tickling, groping and hair stroking. And that was just me and Darren. No seriously though we got her home safe like the kind gents we are and pulled round into Eston.   Now I'm not sure on the legalities of posting this but I had the brainwave of getting this taxi for free. I'd acquired £3.50ish of this bird and started rambling on to keith how he was going to pay for this taxi and that&nbsp;I only had £3.50. It must have been the drink as I've never done this before but asked the driver to stop and then legged it leaving Grovesy to pay the taxi! But KG being the ever oportunist legged it as well and we were outta there, free taxi home and £3.50 up. It can't be bad. Illegal? Probably. Exhilarating? Oh yes.   Spent about 30 mins talking to Keith as I walked the short distance home claiming it&nbsp;to be the funniest thing we've ever done. What sad lives we lead.   When I got in the rat burger came back out. Babes in Sherwood Forest was on Bravo. Passed out. Classic, truly classic&nbsp;night.   End of report.&nbsp;
