      And I love the audience.  And the audience loves me for loving them.  And I love them for loving me.  And we just love each other.  That's because none of us got any love in our childhood.

      Why do I always like the gay ones?! What the hell is wrong with me! It's as if I don't realize that they will NEVER FUCKING LIKE ME! Because I'm unattractive, not fun, no personality, and I have a VAGINA!

      what the hell is this about? ok now what the hell happened to my goddamned New Years resolutions!! 1. Stop biting fingernails...NOTE TO SELF-keep getting nails done  2.Lose mass amounts of weight before spring break.....ok I hate this whole goddamned society and how fucking pressed it is on everyone looking like CALISTA FUCKING FLOCKHART! I mean seriously, if I was meant to be thin, would god have given me the best ass in the universe?!  3. Be true to myself- ok now everytime that I think that I am getting ahead on this one, I slip into one of my bottomless mood swings....I seriously need to go see a shrink or something because besides the fact that I am like way ADD I am MAJOR bipolar...  Sometimes, even with all my friends and family and my "booming" aura, I feel completely alone. Like I'm standing in a pit, flailing my arms around for someone to give a shit and when my open my mouth to scream nothing comes out....just a monotonous drone like the sounds that are constantly flailing around me. So I say that I am going to try harder, work harder, consume myself in life so that I can't get hurt.\ But I always do. We always do. And I always hold everything to myself. I hold it tight tight tight so that no one can touch it and then when I let lose, when I finally lose touch with reality, it's too late and I'm screaming out at the top of my lungs to a crowd of uncaring foes. And I can't cry because that will make me weak and I must stay strong for everyone else. I must.

      I am such a hypocrite that it really disgusts me....I mean I always complain about how much other people complain to me about shit that I seem to think is utterly unimporant....Ewww it's so gross thinking about all the aspects of your personality that you dislike isn't it....       Me and Bryce were discussing the inner workings of the mind of a cat. He said that cats must be so lazy because they just sit on their asses all day. He also said that maybe they have no brains because they are so lazy all the time. I said that I think that cats are really sexy and that maybe this means that all sexy people are brainless. Then he said" Jess you're the sexiest girl I know and you're definately not brainless".      Damn I'm random.

      And although it's always crowded, you still can find some room. Where broken hearted lovers  do cry away their gloom.  You make me so lonely baby,  I get so lonely, I get so lonely I could die.  Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin', and the desk clerk's dressed in black. Well they been so long on lonely street  They ain't ever gonna look back.  You make me so lonely baby,  I get so lonely, I get so lonely I could die.  Hey now, if your baby leaves you, and you got a tale to tell. Just take a walk down lonely street  to Heartbreak Hotel.

      if i had a boyfriend i would much rather he tell me he likes my sex  than tell me he loves me cuz then at least id know he was being honest. so in light of that, i suggest you send notes of this nature to your special friend instead of "i love you, you complete me" notes.   hiya sex pot you TASTE GOOD i like it when we SCREW um.. i like it when we SCREW so call me so we can SCREW because in high school it's all about the SCREW -Molly Bardou  I love this kid.

        urlLink       Your Sex Sign is Cancer!  You're a total pleaser.  One sample of your touch, and anyone is hooked.  You're so good that you've gotten people off just with your incredible kissing.  You're a bit of a romantic, and you only have sex that's meaningful.    Cancer, you are a born pleaser.  Few people can resist your passionate, playful allure.   An incurable romantic, you adore being courted.  You'll do anything for a lover that sends you flowers or love tokens.    You like lots of cuddling, touching, and kissing.   You are a celebrated kisser.  You also like to touch and fondle yourself.  Typically, you learned to give yourself pleasure at a very young age.  As an adult, you are easily aroused and multi-orgasmic.  Mutual masturbation is very satisfying for you.    You are extremely aware of your sexual attraction.   You telegraph your sensuality with every move you make.  You have the most communicative body language of any sign.    You are very emotional, and you constantly need an emotional outlet.  Frequent sex seems to calm you down.  But you are old fashioned, and a quickie is not your style.  You prefer long, slow seductions, erotic masasages, and lots of oral sex.        urlLink What's *Your* Sex Sign?       urlLink More Great Quizzes from Quiz Diva

Gonna move to the mall!  Gonna live in the pool!  Gonna talk to   and not feel like a fool!  'Cause after today I'm gonna be cruisin'!  After today she'll be mine!  After today my brains will be snoozin'!  If I don't faint I'll be fine!  I've got forty more minutes, of home economics  Then down with the text books  And up with the comics!  Just think of all the time I've been losin'  Finding the right thing to say!  But things will be going my way, after today   She looked right through me, and who could blame her?  I need a new me, plus some positive proof that I'm not just a goof, and  After today I'm gonna be cruisin'!  No more pep rallys to cut! Yech!  After today my brains will be snoozin'!  I'm gonna sit on my butt  I've got less than an hour, and when this is ended  I'll either be famous..  Or you'll be suspended  Just think of all the time I've been losin'  Waiting untill I could say ...  Gonna be on my own, kiss the parents goodbye  Gonna party from now 'till the end of July  Things'll be going my way, after todaaaaaaay ...  I wish that this was the day, ... after today

       Jessamyn's confession  Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. But Jessamyn you're not even catholic. You're not Christian at all. I know father. Ok well what's your confession. Father....I have been having.....impure thoughts. Well that's perfectly natural my child. No father I mean REALLY impure thoughts.... Jessamyn, masturbation is completely fine. NO FATHER not  MASTURBATION! ....and it's not just my thoughts.... what is it Jessamyn? Well, I have been inciting impure thoughts in the opposite sex. and how do you know this Jessamyn? Because Brian told me father. And::she gasps:: he showed me his boner. and also, I have been doing things.with boys. Like what kinds of things my child? The things that you and the nuns do in the Cloisters at night. oh. So what should I do father? Hmm.....this is a tough case.......*   * The above scenario gives full reason as to why I am not catholic.

       I want someone to share all my secrets with.. Someone to talk to late at night when I cant sleep,  Someone that will wake me up in the middle of the night, just to find out what Im dreaming abt.  Someone to comfort me when Im scared and to hold me when I'm sad.  Someone that doesn't need to say they love me..for me to know it's true.   All I want is a guy who will accept me for who I am..  a guy who will understand that at times I will confuse him cuz most of the time I confuse myself..  A guy who will understand that Im not perfect..  that I make mistakes just like everybody else..  A guy who will cheer me up when Im sad..  A guy that will give me the attention I need but still give me space..  A guy who will stand up for me evn when Im not around..  I don't want a guy that's perfect. just a guy who is perfect for me.

      god help the girl who ever really loves you. youd break her heart, my darling, cruel, destructive little cat who is so careless and confident he doesnt even trouble to sheathe his claws   for the first time in his life he had met someone, something stronger than he, someone he could neither bully or break, someone who was bullying and breaking him.

      ok major realization: I don't want to seem like a bitchy complaining whore because I really am trying to be a better person( one of my mid-year goals) but I am really really fuckin tired of being treated like someones cheap fuck and you know what I'm just going to use names because I am very upset about this and I think that every emotional tie that have with this person has totally deteriorated so here we go:  To Brian, when after a little over 2 months you STILL treat me like crap, even though I have given myself to you on numerous occasions and physically more than once and I'm really fed up with your asshole tendencies. You make me feel like a streetwalker and quite frankly I don't think I should have to feel like that anymore do you? does anyone? I mean, maybe it's just me but I tend to think that after a guy tells a girl that he feels all these things for her , lets her put down her guard and give herself to him which is the HARDEST thing for her to do nowadays......and then he just uses her?   Well that's it Brian because I'm not takin your bullshit anymore. I really want for you to be in pain and lonely and hurt and say to me,"Jessamyn, please date me, I'm hurt and lonely...." Because you know what I'll say in return, you cock sucking muther fucking asshole?   "TAKE IT ALL BITCH! TAKE IT ALL!    Ok I'm done now.

        Jessamyn's top CD's of the summer( so far)    The Donnas- Spend the Night  ok so this is just an all around amazing band....I mean the demise of our generation has been predicted but with kick ass musicians like these girls......we're hittin the big time..  Justin Timberlake- Justified  One of THE sexiet men on MY planet...who cannot only sing but he can dance....and he's like FINE while doing it all...  Christina Aguilera- Stripped  As Bryce would say "Damn she's fine!". This is one lady who has pipes like none other, a body like none other and my only question to her is: Christina, can you fix your eyeliner please???"  Dixie Chicks- Home  These dixie sirens are some of the most talented chick groups ever and I am always so inspired by their harmonies especially in numbers like "Long Time Gone"  Madonna- American Life  My idol. Ever since I was two I have wanted to embody this woman because she is always herself and on this record she does not disappoint. My hat's off.  White Stripes- Elephant  A totally phenomenal band. They truly do rock my socks off. With their totally live riffs and classy beat styles, they are a legacy waiting to happen.  Diana Krall- Live in Paris  the sexiest, smokiest voice inm the industry. Diana Krall is like the Billie Holiday of our time. She's a wonder to behold. When you hear her belt those notes you will  never  forget it.  Norah Jones- Come Away With Me  You know it took me awhile to truly get in to Ms. Nora and now that I have I'm in love with her.....she kicks my ass with her piano playing. My favorite song has got to be "I've got to see you again". check it out it's numba 9.  Coldplay- A Rush of Blood to the Head  Such an amazing group. So original and so chockful of talent. They're really what the industry needs right now: CREATIVITY! Please tell that all of the Blink 182 wannabees-please get a gimmick!  Sublime- Sublime  Seriously kids, this is like my favorite band of all time....no one can touch them in the area of beats, lyrics, depper meanings....shit they are just PHENOMENAL.....it's bands like this that show what the pressures of the industry can do to you.....they may be broken up but the beauty of sublime is withheld in their music.  Matchbox Twenty- More Than you think you Are  Pete Yorn- Days I forgot  Linkin Park- Meteora  Incubus- Morning View  Beck- Sea Change

       How I spent my summer Vacation by Jessamyn Olivia "DiAmOnDeEvA" Stanley   This has been one of the most rewarding summers of my entire life. I've made some great friendships, renewed some old ones and made a complete ass out of myself( but had a blast doing it). Holla to the  Pegasus Project kids : ZOR-RO!Kudos to the Coldstone kids:  Niki, Carmi, Huddy and Katie ....Muchos love to all of my men of the summer ( even you Twenty ) and lots of love and phone calls to  Joshie . Unbelievable love and memories to  Bryce , you're my big brother and never forget that. Love to my  auntie tracy  and thanks for the Cook-Out milkshakes. Kudos to  Emma  for tons of rides, trips to Wally World, love and guys. Don't forget to visit this year. Lots of love to the  "No Words" kids :VeeRee, Simone, Ajouli and Crystal . Lots of late nights online with  Zach, Pokey and Hakky : Speaking of  Zach Morris , much love and kudos for being there for me the whole summer. I hope we continue our friendship and allow it to grow and progress as it will. Thanks to  Jen and Arlane  for keeping me up to date on the Salem gossip. Kudos to  Nata N. and Nata A.  especially for listening to all my bullshit without complaints.  And continuous love and kudos to my gangstas and the SSSS.  Party on kids. I hope you all enjoyed this summer as much as I did.

       Shirin:  you know, our mom used to get us in so much trouble when we were little.   Remona:  YOUR MOM, Joyce? What'd she do?   Leila:  yeah our mom used to make us do all of these things that were against the law.   Shirin:  yeah Leila remember that time she made you drive down the freeway in the broken down car? Leila goes, "But mom I'm only 14, I don't have a liscence!" and mom goes, "Oh Leila don't be a wimp no one will see."   Leila:  So of course I got pulled over.   Shirin:  And then this other time when we were getting mangos out of a tree in Costa Rica, and mom goes, "Shirin, I want that mango up there at the top" , and I go, "But mom that's really high up" and she goes, "No not that one! I want the one at the VERY TOP! Go get it for me Shirin!" and I started climbing and I said, "mom this branch is kinda thin" and she'd go, "oh just get the mango you big baby!"   Leila:  (dying of laughter) Remember when we would go to the pool.? Mom would say "you don't need swimming lessons!" and push us into the pool! And we'd be flailing around saying, "Mom we can't swim! We need the float arms!" and she'd say, "Oh you don't need those things. Just do your arms like this (she makes a swimming motion with her arms)  (Just then  Joyce  walks into the room, lecturing my cousin Laura on something. Joyce leaves the room and Laura sits next to Shirin)   Shirin:  It's ok if you think our mom is weird Laura. Everyone else does to.

      It's in the reach of my arms,  The span of my hips,  The stride of my step,  The curl of my lips.  It's the fire in my eyes,  And the flash of my teeth,  The swing in my waist,  And the joy in my feet It's in the arch of my back, The sun of my smile,  The ride of my breasts,  The grace of my style.  I'm a woman Phenomenally.  Phenomenal woman, That's me.

      Ok I gotta get somethin off my chest. I don't have a therapist to tell it to either so I just have to tell it to you. I'm in love. And I dont mean high school puppy love. I mean I love this guy. I want to marry him and have his babies. Well not just yet but one day. I want to wake up and be in his arms. I want to be able to give myself to him completely. But there's a problem. He's in love with someone else. Or at least he thinks he is.  And that thought is tearing me into pieces. It's ripping my heart away strand by strand and making me bleed to death. The only thought that keeps me sane is knowing that one day we will be together. I know we will. We have to. It's our destiny.

      wow.....Simone just told me how hot I looked at the car wash today. Quite personally I thought that I looked like a giant fucking beach ball but she was like " Jessamyn have you been doing something differently?" and I was like "no except for the fact that I've gained about fifty fuckin pounds" and she was like "more like you LOST fifty pounds. You looked really really hot" and then I said " Ashley Rouse  and  Virginia  told me that I looked 'hot' and that I should have flashed the street and gotten more business for the carwash........" and she said "yeah if I were a guy I would DEFINATELY pull over".....  And since she  is  a lesbian, I decided to believe her.

        You're... Clocks! Arguably Coldplay's popular single, you were/are everywhere people turn. You're also the most unique of them all, you follow your own beat and care nothing of what anyone else thinks. You're also one of the few piano-driven songs out there, so that probably adds to your mystique.    urlLink   Which Coldplay single are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

The one I love the most is about two mayflies on a date; they watch a nature documentary about themselves and discover their life span is only one day long-after mating, they'll die."       Leaving the theatre, Robert and I are both dazzled and exuberant, talking at once and laughing, and we spontaneously kiss.

      As most of you know, I'm doing a lot of surveys for a service project: I'm asking guys for their opinions on girls and their looks and then at the end of the year probably I'll put everything I find into a paper......And every once and awhile I'm going to post some of the things that I find on here, Like this:   Butterbrown123:  like what do u mean larger?   Uneeksperit:  I don't know....like not average or medium but just....heavier? I don't know   Uneeksperit:  you would probably say fat   Uneeksperit:  but I hate that word   Butterbrown123:  well   Butterbrown123:  i wouldn't say hot   Butterbrown123:  but likeable yes   Butterbrown123:  because the hot is physical   Uneeksperit:  aha   Uneeksperit:  so in order for a "fat" girl to be likeable, she has to have a good personality to cancel out her looks?   Butterbrown123:  no'   Butterbrown123:  i'm just sayuing   Butterbrown123:  everyione is different

       FlashOfThunder18:  read these! i promise i'll stop but i love these! &quot;nothing gets crossed out&quot;  The future has got me worried, such awful thoughts. My head is a carousel of pictures. The spinning never stops. I just want someone to walk in front and I'll follow the leader... Now I try to be assertive. I'm making plans. I want to rise to the occasion, yeah, meet all of their demands. But all I do is just lay in bed and hide under the covers. I know I should be brave but I'm just afraid of all this change.    FlashOfThunder18:  It's hard to focus through all this doubt. I keep making &quot;To Do&quot; lists but nothing ever gets crossed out. Even working on the record seems pointless now. When the world ends, who's gonna hear it? But I try and take some comfort in written words, yeah Tim I heard your album and it's better than good. When you get off tour I think we should hang and black out together.   FlashOfThunder18:  Because I've been feeling sentimental for days gone by...all those summers singing, drinking, laughing, wasting out time. Remember all those songs and the way we smiled in those basements made of music. But now I've got to crawl to get anywhere at all. I'm not as strong as I thought  Kate is possibly the most amazing person I've ever met. Next to Mollie.

      you know, if there's one thing that I cannot ####### stand, it's preppy pop princesses. And even more than that I hate poppy punk princesses. And even more than THAT I hate poppy punk princesses that are under the impression that they are ######## punk goddesses.  And the only reason that I, the broadway singing, all-knowing musical diva can pass judgement on these people. Is because I am EVERYTHING!

      oOSuGarcULtOo782: my boyfriend.. wow, i finally am used to saying that. took me 6 months, but i can finally say those words without feeling weird. he's my first boyfriend. we were friends for about a year, then became bestfriends and two years of being bestfriends bloomed into this relationship of 6 months and it has been great. we haven't even kissed yet, not as a thing for moving slow or anything. just because we want to do it at the right moment. in our mindset, we are going to be together for really long time; so why rush?  oOSuGarcULtOo782: and we didn't want to become a part of the millions of 2-week makeout sessions that most highschoolers refer to as a "relationship"  that's so beyond kickass.

      bulimia is really selfish.  I mean, you're just wasting all of this food when there are starving people in third world countries that would shoot you to eat those five tacos you puked up.   So if you're going to have an eating disorder, don't be selfish and choose bulimia.  Be anorexic and save some lives.  -Caroline and Jessamyn's words of wisdom

      You know, one day, I'll die. And my physical body will rot away into a worm eaten oblivion but I don't want for people to think of me as "Jessamyn, that girl I knew" or Jessamyn "the girl with the weird name". I want to live my life with the turbulance and vivacity of a wild night that never leaves your mind. I want to be interesting, and dorky, and totally off the wall.   I want to give people something they've never had before.  I want to live.

      Ok so last night I had this very off the wall set of dreams... In the first one, I was Marilyn Monroe....except black....and Will was Elvis or somebody. And we were on the Price is Right and Bob Barker kept trying to feel me up. And then I ran outside wearing no shoes and I ripped the toe of my pantyhose. And I distinctly remember thinking "goddamnit, I ripped my fucking stockings."  And then I woke up and ate a slice of pizza.  And then, when i went back to sleep, I dreamt that I went to NYU (yeah, I know, they must have gotten the wrong transcript). Anyway, so one day I'm in this random New York cafe and this guy comes up to me and tells me that I'm an X-men or something and I'm thinkin "shouldn't I know if I'm a fuckin X-Men" and then we get into this fight and I pulled some Lara Croft ass kicking moves out on him and then I clenched my fist and I was fucking Wolverine....  And then I woke up, asked my bro what time it was, and went back to sleep.  And then I dreamt that I was auditioning for Spirit for the millionth time and Linzi was there (which was weird since she dropped out) and Mrs. Burnett told me to sing my solo piece and I had every intention of singing what ever song I had prepared but I opened my mouth and started rapping "Holidae Inn" and then Linzi started doing the backing vocals and then suddenly Courtney was there and she was doing the fucking beatbox. And then Mrs. Burnett finally put me in spirit.  And then I woke up again and thought to myself "I gotta stop getting high off of ibuprofen"  The end.

      From an e-mail from Kate:  i miss youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!  i just hope you're having a damn good time and making it worthwhile since you're not hanging out with me!  You know, I think I can say this because not many of the Jamestown kids read this blog, but sometimes I wonder if I actually am spending my time wisely. I mean, sometimes it just seems like I could be doing much more worthwhile things at school or rather  with people from school.  I guess what I'm trying to say is I love all of the Salem girls (even if I was about to kill some of you) and when we get back together we'll make some memories...  Oh and I miss you too, Kate.

      I have nothing to post. Actually, I have several things I would like very much to post, but I can't express my actual thoughts without facing consequences. I wish I could say things, and for once, people wouldn't have a snappy comeback. They would stand there stunned. Maybe they would even cry. And maybe I would even be happy that I had made them cry. Because that means I actually have some sort of power. And that's all I want isn't it? To be powerful and enigmatic. I want to be noticed when I enter a room. To have some kind of presence. To leave people in awe. But that only happens in movies. There aren't many people like that in real life.  Posted by: Caitlin / 8:56 PM  Ok it's official: Caitlin is my goddess.

      Wow. Jan Term's over, kids.   It feels like just yesterday I was bitching about how much I hated everything and everyone even slightly associated with Salem (except for the people that I, you know, like) and that I was prepared to never see that building again.  And now I'm coming home. Back to homework, back to bitching, back to constant PMS, back to physics, back to ms. Wildrick...  and I can't wait.  I hope everyone had a fabulous January. Let's make this next semester fabulous children.

      Man, all of you kids that are stuck back in the Piedmont missed it last night because your very own designated driver, Jessamyn Olivia, was gettin a little buzzed off of non-alcoholic chardonnay and fondue ( which was chockfull of wine, might I add)......  Johnathan enjoyed it, for sure.  And THEN, my mother tells me that she was practically an alcoholic in college AND she wasn't a virgin when she got married.  Now this may be no big thing for anyone but for a RESPECTABLE, CHASTE,  TOTALLY VIRGIN  girl such as myself.......  let's just say after hearing that, I needed more than just a flute of fake chardonnay.

      Ok so I dreamt of  Kate  last night. Twice in a row. Really fuckin' weird dreams.   In the first dream, Kate and Sarah Campbell were chillin on a bench somewhere near school, smoking. And then I came up to them and then we were all smoking. And then Caroline Phillips and gave the two of them joints but the joints were weird. They were in mechanical pencils so you have to suck on the eraser part of the pencil in order to get buzzed.   And those were some hardcore pencil joints.   Kate and Sarah were getting ROYALLY fucked up.   And then Ms. Ellis walked up to us and was like "are you two smoking marijuana?" And Kate and Sarah were like "uhhhh no?" And then Ms. Ellis was like "You two are getting 1500 demerits and will be expelled immediately". And I remember distinctly thinking two things:   1. Why would Sarah be getting expelled, she doesn't go to our school?  2. Why would they get demerits AND expulsion? If they're expelled, what difference does the number of demerits make?  So then Ms. Ellis was pulling them to Dr. B's office by their ears and on her way out she grabbed my physics book. And I was like " SHIT ! THAT'S MINE!" And Ms. Ellis stopped dead in her tracks and said "what did you say?" and I said" ohhh you're mad I said SHIT. Well I think I'll say it again: SHIT, SHIT, SHIT, SHIT, SHIT, SHIT, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, MOTHERFUCKER!" and Ms. Ellis got really mad and threw this random bag of mozzerella cheese at my head. And then I picked up my cigarette, took a really, ridiculously long drag and tossed it in her hair and walked away.  Then suddenly I was in the library and Ms. T came in with Ms. Ellis and asked me if I had used obscene language towards her. And I looked all shocked and said "Of course not! Ms. Ellis is my absolute favorite teacher! But she did throw this at my head" And I pulled out the bag of mozzerella and Ms. T was SO APPALLED at Ms. Ellis' behavior that she fired her. And she believed every single word that I said.  And then Kate told me that I was her hero.  In the next dream, I was walking through the rec room late at night with Gabrielle and we saw this big hump in the couch cushions and we picked up one of the cushions and Kate was underneath it, snorting coke off of the couch cushion. And then she told us not to tell anyone that we saw her there. Then there were all of these junkies like allover the room, and Kate ran out of the room and Gabrielle and I were left there with the zombie junkies. They were like searching our pockets for drugs and when we said we didn't have any, they went crazy.  I remember they were all wearing random band t-shirts, but they were all different. And then the cops came in and started chaining people to the walls and Gabrielle and I started running away and then we saw these two police officers carrying Kate down the hall to the rec room to chain her up. I remember she looked so incredibly sedated that I was scared for her. And I remember she was wearing a t-shirt that said "Brian Molko, will you marry me?"   And she looked at me and I couldn't just leave her like that. So I ran up to the police officers and started kicking them, trying to make them drop her. But then they stood her up against the wall and pressed a gun to her temple and told me that if I didn't move then they would shoot her. And I pushed her out of the way and put my forehead where the gun was and told them that they'd have to kill me instead.   And then Kate pushed a gun into my back and said she was going to kill me.  She told me I shouldn't have trusted her.  And I thought to myself, "You two-faced junkie ass bitch, I'm trying to save your life"  And then I woke up.  And the moral of this story is: Don't sniff glue.  The End.

      So last night, I hear a knock at my back door. and it's incredibly late so I'm kind of scared. The knock woke up my dad so he went to the door with me and when we opened it and it was Max, I can't say my father was all too pleased. He asked why the hell Max was here and it was practically midnight. Max had no legitimate reason except that he was bored and in the area. He wanted to go to IHOP but my dad was in a bad mood so he told us to stay in the house and shut up. So Max and I made cookie sandwiches and sat around in the basement, swapping "manly stories".  It was actually kind of sad, since he's moving to Georgia to live with his father. But it's weird because he came all the way over to my house to say nothing. And we're not even very good friends.  (I really think the only reason he came over is because he gave up drinking for lent and he needed to be around alcohol-free/boring me to keep him sober. Whatever).  But we had fun. And a few things happened that I can't say online for fear of who reads this but I will say: Max has some of the best lips on earth, fo sho.

      The film will be an edgy and stylized story centering around a young adult/middle aged man who becomes increasingly paranoid about government secrets and actions, most of which are actually based in fact. Supporting roles include:  a sarcastic friend/co worker, his girlfriend, and one or more street evangelists/bums.    Ok,  I  thought it was funny.

      1. Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 5. Write down what it says: "of the part of Dogberry in  Much Ado About Nothing "  2. Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?: the comp next to me  3. What was the last thing you watched on TV?: Insomnia with Dave Attell(sp?) BEST SHOW EVER!  4. WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time it is?: 11:50  5. Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?: 11:52...hmm...  6. With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?: the copy machine and Ansley's mouse  7. When did you last step outside? what were you doing?: last night when Georgia and I were strolling around downtown....ooooh and we went to the fountains...very fun indeed..  8. What are you wearing?: Rosalita's AE t-shirt and Gap denim skirt with Old Navy flip flops..  9. Did you dream last night?: yes, but I'm blanking out about what happened in it...  10. When did you last laugh?: lol when Ans said she was doing her hair like Cristina Aguilera for prom...  11. What is on the walls of the room you are in?: posters that say "please save all files to diskettes! Do not save to the hard drive- all files will be automatically erased. Thank You!"  12. Seen anything weird lately?: I think I have a relatively skewed view of what weird is, but when Mary Oldaker said that The Wife of Bath was self-absorbed, I thought that was rather hypocritical...  13. What do you think of this quiz?: it's a good way to kill time during study hall  14. What is the last film you saw?: I was watched  O  but it was so sad, I couldn't finish it....and I saw Cheaper By The Dozen before that...  15. If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?: a really nice lunch  16. Tell me something about you that I don't know: I love my life  17. If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?: I'd probably want to take away greed because I really feel like that's the root of a lot of problems we have today...however, Theresa's answer was also good  18. Do you like to dance?: I love it  19. George Bush: I think that when you can't speak correctly, you can't read correctly, you can't match your tie to your suit, and you wave at Stevie Wonder, then you're definately not capable of running a country. And seriously, there is no excuse for killing innocent people because you want their oil. End of story. Please give me a one term president. However, I'm not too keen on the idea of putting Kerry into office, either, nor Nader. So I say: Yay for AL SHARPTON because his hair is kickass, YAY CONDELEEZA RICE because she's badass and scary, and BILL CLINTON is my god! Oh and by the way, whatever happened to OPRAH being prez? How about OPRAH as prez, HILLARY CLINTON as V.P, and MARTHA STEWART as financial advisor? Just an idea... and let's throw Ross Perot in there for kicks..

      ohhh, I feel so bad, so bad, so bad....  It's been awhile since I've been this depressed. But the last time I was like this, it was because things were going really really shitty. And now they're not. In fact, they've been really, really good. But for some reason, in the middle of the day today I realized that I'm incredibly depressed about something but I'm not even really sure what it is. And I cried. For the first time in ages, I really cried. I hadn't cried like this since like, February after MMISL audits. I got up to put out my candle and I was listening to Jump Little Children and I fell down, I don't know if it was the song or I was just crying too hard. Either way I just couldn't control myself.  And I have no reason to be upset. Everything has been going great. I just can't appreciate what I have, that's all.  I want to see them.  Fuck this sad shit. Let me smoke my marlboro and I'll be on my way.  Have a great weekend, children. Oh and looking past the sadness, I have some additions to my 'I love' list: nail salons, lotion, body parts, cd covers, drum solos, and big headphones.

      A send-off to a very interesting/exhausting/fanTABulous Alabama Adventure By Jessamyn Olivia "DiAmOnDeEvA" Stanley*  So yes, this weekend has been really off the wall. A bunch of royally fucked up events strung together in a really wild series that I'm still reeling from. From kick ass eggrolls (and YES, I  AM  a connoiseur of Chinese Takeout, smartass) unbelievably hot/humid temperatures, and swapping 'manly stories' to fabulous breakfasts at IHOP (not QUITE the new Waffle House, Wilhem), dressing up like a princess, and swing dancing at the Jazz Festival ("I've never swing danced with a BOY before!").  But first, although I am the reigning diva and queen in the story of my life, I must thank certain members of this weekend's rather eccentric  cast of characters :  To  WILL  (aka Willy Boy, WILLONEY, and dipshit)- Lover, even though I treat you like shit, I have never met anyone nearly as consistant in true, raw emotion as you are.  You may think you mean absolutely nothing to me romantically and (while this is not entirely untrue :/) I am always appreciative of the lovely compliments that you constantly bestow upon me ("Wow, you look really great, Jessa. Can we fuck now?"). Through it all you'll always be my best pal and I'll never forget a time when you meant something to me romantically. Ok so let's get to the real shit: Thanks for cheese omlettes, running shoes, vinyl records, sports bras, great fortunes, "super duper" chinese chicken, Guys and Dolls, fabulous dancing, obscene t-shirts, and bad, bad, BAD directions (I must say, you really are the WORST backseat driver that I've ever had the pleasure of carting around in a rental car).  To  ABRAHAM  (aka the sexy beast and King Bone)- Ok you know what, you'll never fucking read this (unless by some strange twist of fate you get this link) so I guess I can say: YOU'RE A SEXY BEAST. Seriously, Bone, if you were ever in the mood (because god knows, I always am) you could DEFINATELY have your way with me...Ok so thanks for teaching me to REALLY play the piano and that dancing isn't just for Christ School dances. Also, thanks for great mix cds, having my back and babysitting techniques (I might try them out one day.  To  SIDNEY, BRIANNA, and JORDAN  (aka my " deevas " in training)- You three are fabulous. Fabulous singers and people (not just little kids). I promise that this time I WILL write you, Sid, and when you guys get to be my age and I'm old (like   26  ), I'll tell you stories of when you were young and used to think that boys had cooties (which is true) and that your whole lives revolved around sprinklers. Thanks for makeup tips over coffee, peppermints, loose change, bathroom breaks, SOLOS, torturing Will (and yes, it's confirmed: he does have a crush on me), great hugs, spankings, whispering during concerts, dressing up like princesses, and teaching me that being a girl= AWESOME!  Eh, I'd write more but I'm awesome. To all of you who haven't been mentioned, please remember me with all of my good moments and *sigh* my not so pleasurable ones. I love you all immensely even when I forget to mention it. Thanks for a wild weekend. Maybe we can do it again some time.  *For those of you who are unaware of the origin of the  DiAmOnDeEv a, please remind me to tell that story sometime soon.

      Instructions: On your current playlist, hit shuffle and pick the first twenty songs on the list (however embarrassing), and write down your favorite line of the song. Try to avoid putting the song title in the line. If you want, have your friends comment and see if they know the songs.  1. I’ll be waiting with a gun and a pack of sandwiches. 2. I asked your name, you asked the time. 3. What I am to you is not what you mean to me. You give me miles and miles of mountains and I’ll ask for the sea. 4. Look at the stars, look how they shine for you. 5.  She smiles and it’s a rainbow. And she speaks and she breathes… 6. Her ass is a spaceship I want to ride (her ass, she’s SEXY) 7. I lick my lips like I’m L.L (and I’m doin it, and doin it, and doin it well) 8. In the real time world no one sees her at all, they all say she’s crazy. 9.Teen drinking is very bad- Yo, I got a fake id, tho! 10. Tell me who’s invited: you, your friends, and my ****… 11. Now everybody in the club lookin’ spiffy; mama got her a new dress, boots from the 60’s… 12. It only leads to trouble and…seat wetting. 13. Good bye beloved one, do you know what I am? 14. I tried my best to feed her appetite- keep her coming every night.. 15. You are my mission, impossible at first, but like cool fission I feel an energy flow, flow… 16. Meet me in outer space…we could spend the night watching earth come up. 17. Instead of stressed I lie here charmed. 18. When the summer came, you were not around…Now that summers gone, love cannot be found. Where were you when I needed you last winter… 19. And all my armor falling down in a pile at my feet. 20. I could make a habit out of you.

      Ok so, a lot of people in J-town are really upset with Dr. Rogers and Terry Grier because they are banning flip flops from school premises. There are petitions and all kinds of hoopla going down. Although I do agree with the absurdity of this new rule, I also think that there are much more important things going on not just in the world, but in Guilford County, that are whole lot more vital than whether you can wear your rainbow flip flops to class. It just seems to me that if you're going to crusade for something, make it something that isn't totally self-righteous. Some people can't even afford to buy flip flops. It is amazing to me that in this time of great poverty and turmoil, the number one problem that being attacked is footwear in schools.    I guess that's the worst thing a suburban girl could imagine.

      So Rich (one of the guys that works here) just walked up to me and goes  "Do you think this is true" and put a newspaper ad under my nose.   It was an ad for CHRISTIE'S CABARET, with a picture of some blond girl and across the top it said "This is my first time".  I told him that the chances of it being true were very, very slim.  But that was definately a ray of sunshine on an otherwise incredibly shitty morning.

      So Urban Outfitters is selling an ashtray that features of picture of Jesus wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette and wearing a t-shirt that says "my dad created the universe and all I got was this stupid t-shirt".      So if anyone wants to buy me a gift, you know what to get.  (oh and btw- for the cheap person who wants to buy me a gift, they also have an ashtray that says something to the effect of "smoking is my choice so fuck off". Yeah.)

             you are violet  #EE82EE         Your dominant hues are red and blue. You're confident and like showing people new ideas. You play well with others and can be very influential if you want to be.  Your saturation level is lower than average - You don't stress out over things and don't understand people who do. Finishing projects may sometimes be a challenge, but you schedule time as you see fit and the important things all happen in the end, even if not everyone sees your grand master plan.  Your outlook on life is bright. You see good things in situations where others may not be able to, and it frustrates you to see them get down on everything.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

      Remember when we used to be obsessed with Clone High? And I was Joan of Arc, Linzi was Cleopatra, and Arlane was Abe? lol and Sadia was Ghandi....  That was a great show.  For those of you who don't know about Clone High, the photograph of the red headed girl on my sidebar is my character 'Joan of Arc'.'  If that doesn't help (which it probably won't), just ask any former boarder cult member.

      So yes, I made this huge list of all the characters in my life, as if it were this great movie. Here are some of my favorite character descriptions:  Jenna T., the  accomplice   (ok that may only be funny to select people)  Arlane B., the close  "let's brawl"  friend at SA  Mike S., the close  "yeah I'm an adult but I still act like I'm in HS"  adult friend at SA  Mr. Small,  another         (hahaha.)  Sharii J., the close  "The Simpson's rule, let's break into the kitchen"  friend at SA  Anna B., the close  "Zorro!"  friend at SA  Holley S. (S for Shearburn), the  "Hi, I'm gonna be a stripper when I grow up"  friend at SA  Meredith M., the  rude yet somehow entertaining friend  at SA      (you know it's all with love, Mer)  Katy W., the close  "GGB/BGB"  friend in J-town    (ooooh 8th grade...)  Nata N., the close  "Lebanon Pride"  friend in J-town  D.J, the  "You can't pimp me/Look at my car"  friend in J-town  Liz G., the close  "Jessamyn is my disciple"  friend in W-S  Will O., the close  "let's fuck in a closet"  choir friend  Zach B., the  "fuck you, you bastard"  friend outside of SA  If you're reading this then it's most likely that you're on this list but because of some of the descriptions that were given ( which could be passed as offensive) and the great length of it, I won't post the entire list on here. However, if you're curious about your description,  just ask .

      So last night I dreamt that we were having this random Salem review of very random songs from musicals. It involved me singing "Diamonds are a girls best friend (in  Moulin Rouge  style with me as Nicole Kidman and Gabrielle as Harry Z)" and then Elizabeth King and someone else singing "Nowadays" from Chicago. Kind of strange.

      So today, while I was daydreaming (ok, sleeping) at work, I dreamt that Linzi and I were just strolling through Thruway one day when this random guy walked up to us in Borders and told us that we were just the kind of girls that he was looking for. So he herded us out into this limo (ok, one question: this guy could have been totally psycho. Why the hell were we going with him?). When we were in the limo he put us on this camera phone with this old guy, obviously his boss. The old guy said he was looking for two young and gorgeous girls (oh, the flattery) to use his Guilford County estate for our entire spring break and he would foot the bills for everything. ‘Twas his final wish.  (Ok, as unrealistic as this may sound, bear with me here..)  Of course Linz and I graciously accepted his offer. It was, after all, the VERY least we could do.  So after school let out for SB, a stretch hummer arrived at Salem, picked us up and drove us out to his massive estate in the foothills of the piedmont. Seriously the house was fucking ridiculous, just like Salem only bigger. And to be used only be the two of us for almost two weeks. We promptly decided that every night we would give a massive dinner for all of our friends and then on our last night in the house we would host a blowout party where the key ingredients were liquor, sex, and blasting music. But for some reason the house was totally unfurnished so we went through every furniture catalogue on the planet and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars furnishing it. It cost a lot but who cares? We weren’t paying for it.  And then each night we threw these great dinner parties in this huge dining room/ballroom and each night, we would serve these gourmet dishes prepared by our own kitchen staff and served by our butlers (we had all the silverware and everything).  And then on the last night we threw this massive party. It was like the party of my dreams but sadly, I remember basically nothing from it except that Linz wore a green, blue and white striped polo dress, green and white push down socks, and green, blue and white high top Reebok heels. And I wore a pink garbadine skirt-suit edged in purple, silver, and black (my favorite colors), black tights with silver edging, and purple, pink, silver and black Chuck Taylor heels.  But after that I just remember a lot of drinking (and I mean A LOT of drinking) people swimming naked in this random lake, and a lot of popcorn. And there was this great pillow fight at around 2am. And at some point Arlane, Joanna Faulkenberry, Veronica, Maebeth, Mary Layton and I went out for pizzas and beer (not even like we were bringing pizza back for everyone else; we like, went to Little Ceasers and ate inside). And somehow we ended up in this tiny bar and we all danced on top of the tables in our underwear (I remember that I was wearing black tap pants and Joanna was wearing a g-string. Kind of funny…)  And then the next thing I remember is that it was the next morning and some people had left but most of them were just sprawled around the house. Linzi and I woke up late and we were still like, some of the first people to wake up. After I made myself this huge bowl of cereal, I walked through the living room where Kate, Joanna F., Sarah B., Scott (that kid from Borders), and my friend Josh (very random) were watching cartoons and eating cereal. Then I walked out to the back deck where Linzi was eating a slice of pizza and smoking a philly and I lit a clove and she looked at me and was like “best party ever” and I was like “amen”.  It was amazing.   So now I’ve resolved that because of this dream, next year the whole dance scene will be tremendous (what with me as Dance committee prez and her as fellowship council prez). In fact, now I really want to have a party like, during orientation. A sort of “get to know how fucked up we are” kind of thing, what do you think?  Any comments?
