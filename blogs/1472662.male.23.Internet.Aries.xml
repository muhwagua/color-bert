Stace, my wonderful 'other arf' has burnt her arm with industrial strength cleaner  so the poor lass has had her arm bandaged up.

      Oh, hello campers and welcome the Basingstoke Life blogspot,  the chances of a probable web success coming from this are so remote i feel i might be wasting my time. Every so often i will thrill you with the not-so-amazing goings on in a Basingstoke suburb (Brighton Hill), the birthplace of Liz Hurley ... Basingstoke that is...not Brighton Hill, because when she was last here 'The Hill' was a field and Liz wasnt born in a field... it was a Barn.

      Bloodninja:Wanna cyber?  DirtyKateK, but don't tell anybody ;-)  DirtyKate:Who are you?  Bloodninja: I've got blond hair, blue eyes, I work out a lot  Bloodninja:And I have a part time job delivering for Papa John's in my Geo Storm.  DirtyKate:You sound sexy.. I bet you want me in the back of your car..  Bloodninja:Maybe some other time. You should call up Papa John's and make an order  DirtyKate: Haha! OK  DirtyKate:Hello! I'd like an extra-EXTRA large pizza just dripping with sauce.  Bloodninja:Well, first they would say, "Hello, this is Papa John's, how may I help you", then they tell you the specials, and then you would make your order. So that's an X-Large. What toppings do you want?  DirtyKate:I want everything, baby!  Bloodninja:Is this a delivery?  DirtyKate:Umm...Yes  DirtyKate:So you're bringing the pizza to my house now? Cause I'm home alone... and I think I'll take a shower...  Bloodninja:Good. It will take about fifteen minutes to cook, and then I'll drive to your house.  **pause**  DirtyKate:I'm almost finished with my shower... Hurry up!  Bloodninja:You can't hurry good pizza.  Bloodninja:I'm on my way now though  **pause**  DirtyKate:So you're at my front door now.  Bloodninja:How did you know?  Bloodninja:I knock but you can't hear me cause you're in the shower. So I let myself in, and walk inside. I put the pizza down on your coffee table.  Bloodninja:Are you ready to get nasty, baby? I'm as hot as a pizza oven  DirtyKateooohh yeah. I step out of the shower and I'm all wet and cold. Warm me up baby  Bloodninja:So you're still in the bathroom?  DirtyKate:Yeah, I'm wrapping a towel around myself.  Bloodninja:I can no longer resist the pizza. I open the box and unzip my pants with my other hand. As I penetrate the gooey cheese, I moan in ecstacy. The mushrooms and Italian sausage are rough, but the sauce is deliciously soothing. I blow my load in seconds. As you leave the bathroom, I exit through the front door....  DirtyKate:What the f**k?  DirtyKate:You perverted piece of s**t  DirtyKate:F**k

      Intresting day at work, if only i could figure out flash 5.....doh! And yet again, iam on the subject of a certain FA Cup Final...one in which iam now getting nerves for. Iam getting shakes and goosebumps when reading articles about the saints, butterfly's... and a sense of joy that iam fortunate enough to be going to Cardiff, not to watch of course...till mill around outside and savour the FA Cup fever!  Not everyday saints play a cup final and i have never felt this feeling before, hope it happens again. UEFA Cup next year.... so you never know...lol

      THUNDER!!!!......sitting in a classroom full of over active teens who repeat the same word everytime it cracks with thunder outside. Thing is after the first few bangs even the most stupid could have worked out its THUNDER.....so why they feel the need to enlighten everyone with this is beyond me.  Whilst i have been writing this they have mentioned THUNDER over 11 times, roll on lunch break.

      Last day at work before the half term holidays, then a whole week off..... This weekend starts with a small thing called  urlLink Homelands , but a feeling i have makes me think that it wont be the best yet. Iam not really keen 'The Streets' or 'Kosheen', but at least Paul Oakenfold is there this year...even if his music is pap.  And on sunday providing i havnt got the flu ill be watching the Matrix Reloaded, which we should have watched last sunday but we cocked up the dates.

      What a day, had to go to work to make up for having saturday off. It actually seemed weird going to work on a tuesday, i havn't done that in ages. Looking forward to next academic year at the college as i am running out of ideas on designs and i am getting bored. Homelands is only a few days away and the weather should be alright,  urlLink BBi  reckons that there will be a downpour allday but they rarely get it right. I will be keeping everyone posted on the event and how it went. Also, it would be great if you could visit some of the links on the side, support some of the campaigns...  Today i also started a new blog on music called urlLink  'music i blag'

      BREAKING NEWS!! BREAKING NEWS!! BREAKING NEWS!! BREAKING NEWS!!  A major earthquake measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale hit Portsmouth in the  early hours of Wednesday 14th May 2003.  Epicentre: Fratton, Portsmouth .  Victims were seen wandering around aimlessly muttering "mentill " and "  innit".  The earthquake decimated the area causing approximately £30 worth of damage.  Several priceless collections of mementos from theBalearics and Spanish  Costa's were damaged beyond repair. Three areas of historic burnt out cars  were disturbed. Many locals were woken well before their giro arrived.  Portsmouth Evening News reported that hundreds of residents were confused  and bewildered, still trying to come to terms with the fact that something  interesting had happened in the area.  One resident - Tracy Sharon Smith, a 15-year-old mother of 5 said "It was  such a shock, my little Chardonnay Mercedes came running into my bedroom  crying. My youngest two: Tyler-Morgan and Megan-Storm slept through it all.  I was still shaking when I was watching Kilroy the next morning."  Apparently though, looting, muggings and car crime did carry on as normal.  The British Red Cross has so far managed to ship 4,000 crates of Sunny  Delight to the area to help the stricken locals. Rescue workers are still  searching through the rubble and have found large quantities of personal  belongings, which include benefit books, jewellery from Elizabeth Duke at  Argos and Bone China from Poundland.  HOW CAN YOU HELP??  This appeal is to raise money for food and clothing, parcels for those  unfortunate to be caught up in this disaster.  Clothing is most sought after, the most needed include:  Fila or Burberry baseball caps,  Kappa tracksuit tops (his and hers),  Shell suits (female), white sport socks, Rockport boots and any other items  usually sold in Primark.  Food parcels may be harder to come by, but are needed all the same.  Required foodstuffs include;  Microwave meals,  tins of baked beans,  ice cream and cans of Colt 45 or Special Brew.  22p buys a biro for filling in the compensation forms,  £2.00 buys chips, crisps and blue fizzy drinks for a family of 9,  £5.00 will pay for a packet of B&H and a lighter to calm the nerves of those  affected.  Please do not send tents for shelter, as the sight of posh housing is unfair  on the population of neighbouring areas.

      This artcile was taken from the Saintsfc.co.uk website, i think this reflects Southampton and its people very well.   Hiley Controversial is a personal comment piece by web site editor Graham Hiley. It dos not reflect the views of the club or any of its staff.    A hastily scribbled sign in the back of a Southampton mini-bus said it all. It read: "Cheer up Arsenal, you won!" To look at many of the Gooners anyone would think they had lost the FA Cup final!  They may have won the trophy but bizarrely there was little joy from their fans many of whom were sitting there with faces like a slapped Arsenal! Contrast that to the Saints supporters who were determined to party even in defeat.  Although they lost the match, they were winners off the field. Even when Arsene Whinger's side were going up to get the Cup, it was the hordes of yellow and blue who were making the most noise.  The announcer said it was his ninth Cup Final and he had never seen so many supporters of the losing side staying behind to applaud their side. And never can the fans of the winning team have been taunted with chants of: "Shall we sing a song for you?" while they were celebrating success!  But then somehow that epitomised the difference between the two groups. Maybe it was the fact it was their first final for 27 years, but Saints supporters really captured the spirit of the occasion.  The Arsenal contingent arrived late, filling their end of the ground only in the minutes before kick-off. The Saints got there well beforehand, determined to wring every ounce of emotion out of the day.  The Doom and Gooners turned out in their replica shirts as though it were a uniform; there was no sense of fun, no silly hats or spontaneous fancy dress. For most of the match they sat impassively with arms folded.  The south coast section was filled with painted faces, wigs, kilts. They had come dressed for a party not an event.  Well before kick-off, the north end of the ground was a bouncing, swaying mass of yellow and blue. With the roof on, they really made the rafters rock. The other end of this magnificent stadium was strangely subdued even when their team were winning.  They would have been far more animated and passionate if their side had lost, that's for sure! There was very much a feeling that the Arsenal fans wanted success for its own sake rather than for what it meant.  Having missed out on the coveted Premiership title they demanded a trophy, any trophy just so they did not end up empty-handed. We can't have the one we really want so we'll make do with this one!  But maybe that is the knock-on effect of so many distant plastic fans attaching themselves to a club. They are the sort who know the price of everything but the value of nothing!  And they were fuelled by an arrogant expectation of victory as of right; anything less would reflect badly! It seemed the fear of failure somehow outweighed the pleasure of winning.  They came, did what was expected and moaned about the traffic on the way home. They almost went through the motions of celebrating as if it were expected of them rather than truly savouring the moment.  Meanwhile the Saints supporters were giving an emotional and genuinely warm ovation to their side who have achieved so much this season. The players looked moved by the response as they tried to shrug off the unworthy feeling that they had somehow failed the fans.  Not so. We are all in it together - the players, the supporters in the stadium, those watching at home or in pubs or even abroad. There was hardly an empty seat as Gordon Strachan's men trudged mournfully round the pitch to the dressing room.  Those who left once the team had gone past their section were astonished to find an equal number of Arsenal fans skipping their celebrations to get back to suburbia half an hour earlier. How can you leave when your team is parading the Cup?  Can you imagine the party if Saints had lifted the trophy? It would be going on for weeks. Arsenal fans will no doubt look down their noses, patronise plucky Southampton and sneer that it is an indication of lower expectations.  But the truth is that Saints supporters share a much stronger bond with their side because of it. We felt the pain of the team and vice versa. Players, staff, fans, local media and indeed anyone connected with the city all desperately wanted to see Chris Marsden lift the trophy.  And when it did not happen, the pain did not turn to anger but to a defiant desire to milk the moment anyway. In the traffic jams which are an integral part of any game at the Millennium Stadium, it was the yellow and blue flags which were flying highest.  It was Southampton supporters who were leaning out of windows, swapping drinks and banter. The Saints songs rang loudest, the south coast cars still proudly decked in their colours which should now stay up round the city as a symbol of pride in the team despite the scoreline.  Most of the London-bound drivers had brought their flags and scarves inside - in case they got wet! They might have got the trophy but Saints had the spirit of the occasion. And that is something you cannot put a price on.

      Congrats to Arsenal, you were rubbish but you managed to score ...and that wins games! Your fans were a nice bunch, the ones who bothered to turn up, Saints fans outnumbered you guys at least 7 to 1and the sea of yellow was really good to see. What a season , 8th in the league, Cup final runners up, James Beattie scoring goals...Cardiff locals being so friendly seeing that we gate crashed there city for 4 hours and left a mess behind. Oh well, were all going on a European tour!!

      Ah, what a weekend and a half! Homelands wasnt a patch on previous years and i feel sort if dissapointed with the whole thing, but it didnt stop myself, Steve & Louie all having a good laugh.After seeing Paul Oakenfold we got kind of drunk, took herbal highs that were more of a placebo than a trip and hurled ourselves around on rides....My back and neck still sore after the waltzer!  TIP: Anyone who gos to a music fest this year look out for a market stall tent called 'Brainmachine'.....what a trip...!  Sunday night we finnaly watched the long awaited  Matrix:Reloaded  at the local cinema, brilliant film but the ending really pissed me off...lol Iam beginning to think Neo is in fact a program, and not human after all.and that all the Matrix is a 'Hall if mirrors'. Anyways,nuff gassing...should be posting the photos from homelands on here as soon as i have scanned them.

FACT  - The Vicar is infact the former drummer of 60's band 'The Troggs'.  The rehersal is on 23rd of that same week,so we need all hands on deck to make sure everyone knows where and what there doing.

      A few things have bothered me recently, our nations obsession with Eastenders, Tony Blair's sweat after being asked a few 'un-taxing' questions and why everyone is going nuts about the new ASDA store they have just put in near where i live.   Eastenders  - same old shouting and depressing characters.All the show is based round the dreadful Kat Slater (Jesse Wallace a.k.a Keith Richards).And someone always dies at Christmas!   Tony B  - should have listened to us Tony, we told you it was wrong to go to war with out solid proof of WMD.   ASDA  - And Basingstoke, who cares if we have a new ASDA! It looks just like everyone elses.

Because the fall out if they win the case of it gets ajourned for the day would be unbearable, and besides....cant they go by police records and have them for criminal damage to a property that isnt theres??

      Today is finnally drawing to a close, iam a bit tired seeing that me and Stace were up at 5 this morning. Today was the funeral of her Grandmother from her mothers side. I had never been to many things before (still a bit naive), and it was only a little while ago i had been to a Greek wedding. But it was a nice send off for her and she was buried with her daughter.  After the journey home, which was a long slog as the traffic was bad, we got home.... i have changed out of my suit and iam now chillin with a bevvie!

      Lately the entries to my blog have been coming thick and fast, but this is because I have such a busy period of my life happening right now.Today is exactly 4 weeks till my wedding to  urlLink Stacey , and 5 weeks till the honeymoon ..... Today I  added the blogrolling link, so you can get a update on what iam visiting lately.... I was considering a mailing list but that would be a waste of time. As things are in my life I can safely say i have never felt so content, Stacey is a wonderfull women... i cant really remember what life was like before her.I used to sit at home (when i lived in southampton) and wish i would meet someone who understood me and would love me, and i really felt that it wasnt going to happen, that will teach me! I owe her my life for beng such a insiprational,loving & most of all 'love of my life'...coz without her i dont know if i would still be here.

      Here is something I found on seethru.co.uk, the now defunct webzine.  its Called 'JobCentre Lottery' 01 Enter Jobcentre and take numbered ticket from dispenser 02 Check LED wall display to see how many people are supposed to be seen before you 03 Check who's on the desks and give each a 'gestapo rating' 04 If someone's taken a ticket since you did, help yourself to another 05 Go outside and smoke a fag 06 Walk back in and take a few more tickets 07 Wait. Take the occasional ticket while you're at it 08 Think about the universe while memorising your ticket numbers, which are 78, 80, 82, 83, 85 and 86 09 Your first number, 78, is now being called by Adolf Hitler (Gestapo Rating: 10/10), so naturally you ignore the announcement. He moves on. "79" he says. No takers. "Aha, someone else is playing the game too," you realise 10 "80" says Adolf. That's yours. Keep your head down 11 "81" snarls Adolf, clearly irritated. Some idiot walks over 12 The blonde jobcentre chick (Gestapo Rating 5/10) has finished with her current punter and is getting ready to call. She's usually not too bad, but looks in a bit of a mood today. You notice that ponytail bloke (2/10) is also moving into call mode. You have a quick glance at your remaining numbers - 82, 83, 85 and 86 - and remind yourself that somebody else in the room is also playing. 13 Step 13: "82" says blonde chick. Do you settle for her? No, you decide to hang in there. You check Ponytail bloke. He's almost ready! 14 "83" says blonde chick 15 "84" says blonde chick. Whoever's got 84 doesn't want her either. You suspect this player - your rival - owns ticket 87, and is also waiting for ponytail bloke 16 "85" says blonde chick. Come on, come on, come on... 17 "86" says ponytail bloke. Bingo. You have won a game of Dole Lotto

      Currently messing about with the world of online gaming.Check it out and you might even see me hacking up the virtual Roy Keane on Fifa 2003. urlLink World Cyber Games   Pimms on the lawn was ok, spent a hour there drinking Pimms....(No shit I hear you say!).. They presented me and Stacey with a bottle of Champagne and £100, I think my employers are quite generous...it was a really nice thought from the college & my collegues.Last night it was Ruperts leaving bash...kids had a good time and Stacey dressed up in 80's rock star clothing, along with Kevin,Shelley,Tracey & Stuart.

        David Beckham displaying his new number, Man Utd fans I am sure will not miss him.  He had a good career in which he done alot for the club, but we can they without him and he can be a bit of a distraction to what Man Utd are all about....football! I wish him luck at Real but i dont think he will last.

On Thursday i have been invited to 'Pimms on the Lawn' with the Headmaster, but that was only because Alison gave the guys down in admin a call to ask them where my invite was seeing that i have worked my arse off for them for the last year.

      Stace is on her final evening of work this week.... and iam glad, i know she is doing it for the extra cash we need for the honeymoon. But it doesnt stop missing her, I love her company. The photographer visited today to discuss some of the pictures that need taking, we have selected a few modern looking ones that he does using his computer.A sort of black and white picture of our hands with our rings on, but the rings are in colour when everything else is in black and white.For people that regularly visit my blog, or Staceys ... we are away on our honeymoon from the 3rd of August till the 17th ....but there still will be posts, ill just have to use the hotel internet cafe.  We are planning to stay at the Amarylis Aparthotel in Kalamaki on the greek island of Zakynthos.The island itself which we went to last year was stunning, the most enjoyable memory being the visit to Smugglers cove. The story of smugglers cove came about when a drugs baron was carrying drugs in two container ships, but in a bad storm one got caught by the coastguard and the other ran aground.In the morning the locals climbed down the cliffs to loot the free rum and drugs... and its still there now. When I was last there I put my name on the hull of the ship, might still be there...unless some bugger has washed it off!

      Charlie Dimmock was doing a show in our street yesterday for a program called 'Garden Invaders', so as you do you go out and take a few snaps to post on your blog...or so you intended.Instead, when I turned the camera on this morning it had decided to wipe the memory so we now have nothing to prove the ginger chunky one was ever here. Instead I have the photos of Ruperts Leaving party which was on friday last week. I think these pictures are probably better viewing.  urlLink Ruperts Party Snaps

       Latest Developments  Stacey had her Hen night, she looked like she really enjoyed herself and didnt come back to pissed....hehe...no, she had a couple but Stace doesnt need to drink to have a good time.  After a quiet weekend in which we thought we had seen the last of 'Cliff the mong' he decides to give his violent and often weird relationship with out next door neighbour another go...much to our dismay!The guy is a fucking head case, he is like 'Begbie' from Trainspotting, but without the scottish accent.I dont think he lives next door now, but sort of visits when he needs to snort in privacy or drink dangerous amounts of booze whilst on a class 'A'. I dont want you thinking my street is rough, because its not. 99% of the people are really nice and me and Stace get on quite abit with them, Like Dave & Sam...great couple...and Kerry & Michael.... And the housing association are quite respectable as well, with many posh looking houses all over the country. Iam not a religous person, but if god was to strike down upon those who cause pain and suffering to others....then you would find my arse sitting in a seat in a church this sunday saying ...THANKS...to the almighty.

      Oh, now this is sad, there is an official site to the modern roundabout system.For anyone who has visted or lives in Basingstoke we all know there is only one way of doing a roundabout..... its ideal for them to be circular! This great little site has gems such as ' This Web site serves as one of the definitive sources on Modern Roundabouts and is a complement to the Federal Highway Administration's research project aimed at developing a comprehensive guide to roundabouts design. ' and ' Methodology for identifying appropriate sites for roundabouts and the range of conditions for which roundabouts offer optimal performance '.  Who thought this shit up? Most websites are useless anyway e.g  urlLink Kitten Grooming  and  urlLink David Hasselhoff is the AntiChrist - And i have proof! .  But who on earth would waste server space with such dribble, if there is a site for traffic lights or road cones please tell me....   urlLink Modern Roundabouts

       In the news today , researchers have apparentley disovered that men do not suffer from a 'male menopause'. Thats right guys, so if your feeling down or you have a lack of libido then its not the menopause....its laziness....why does this sound like a women was researching it? ;-) I mean come on, are you girls the only ones who can have all the illnesses and us gents have nothing. We all know you have many illnesses like...not being able to throw a ball, run fast, play football (soccer)....but men have illnesses as well! Like not being able to lift the toilet seat, wearing underwear for more than a day and scratching pubic hair whilst in front of guests.   Quick Note from Stop Esso website - Greenpeace  Esso (ExxonMobil) is trying to get the world to believe that it has taken on a new, caring attitude on climate change and takes the issue seriously. But a number of organisations are waging a full-out war on US action on climate change. And the money they get from Esso has increased.  While Esso says it "takes the issue of climate change seriously", organisations like the George C Marshall Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Frontiers for Freedom are running an aggressive campaign against President Bush's ratification of the Kyoto protocol and continue to fight against any cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Many of them have also been fully behind the war on Iraq.  Over the past ten years, the company has spent millions of dollars bankrolling these groups, but in 2002 the support was ramped up, with funding for some groups increasing as much as ten-fold.  In November last year, ExxonMobil head of environment, Frank Sprow, told the media "We need to do what we can to get the message across more clearly... We are trying to communicate that we see the risk." Other execs from the company have tried to stress that they "take the threat of climate change seriously."  But just follow the money to see how hollow these statements are.  Last year, ExxonMobil funding for the Competitive Enterprise Institute jumped from $280,000 to $405,000. The CEI led the campaign persuading President Bush to stay away from the Earth Summit in Johannesburg (which he did). A letter to Bush from a coalition of right-wing groups assembled by the CEI claimed 'the least important global environmental issue is potential global warming, and we hope your negotiators can keep it off the table and out of the spotlight' (which they did). Guardian story  The CEI is also behind the Cooler Heads Coalition, chaired by former CEI director Marlo Lewis and directed by Myron Ebell, the CEI's Director of Global Warming and International Environmental Policy. The Cooler Heads Coalition was formed in 1997, 'to dispel the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific and risk analysis.'  They launched a legal action last year in an effort to bury an EPA report which admitted the existence of human-induced global warming and warned of the threat posed to the US. Bush called the report 'a product of the bureaucracy.'  The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) got a huge payrise from ExxonMobil, from $80,000 in 2001 to $193,200 in 2002. ALEC wrote to George W Bush after the Johannesburg Summit congratulating him on his "tour de force performance" … "We applaud your successful efforts to keep the Kyoto Protocol off the agenda". See letter.  They also employed the arch climate sceptic scientist Patrick Michaels to write a paper "Global Warming and the Kyoto Protocol: paper tiger, economic dragon".  ( Will: just a thought .....but joining us to campaign will be a worthy thing...)

      This was taken from the BBCi 606 site, quite an amusing post.  Chelsea make shock buy!  I've just seen the latest list of players Chelsea intend to buy.  Chelsea's new Russian gazillionairwe owner has put in an offer to buy every current Premiership player. The £7.2 billion offer means that Chelsea will have the largest squad in Europe. This has created a few problems - such as accomodating 4 digit squad numbers and setting up a rota system to ensure everyone gets at least 15 minutes on the pitch during the season.   The deal, the biggest in football history doesn't however include Emile Heskey. "I may be rich" said Roman "but I ain't daft".     Stag Night News  What a evening, i think everyone would agree it was bloody good. We almost got kicked out of McDonalds for blocking Steve in a disabled loo, i fell over in a club and have a bruise on my leg about 9 inches wide...ouch! We met a Russian hooker, who was ugly and would'nt take the hint that we were not intrested....daft ruskie....she got a drink out of us though. But other than that it was a highly enjoyable evening, everyone had a giggle...

       MORON UPDATE - CLIFF ON THE MOVE  we think? or shall I say hope!  it seems our little love birds nextdoor cannot sustain there violent relationship much longer and have seemed to have parted company, but after the last meeting they had Cliff might actually be parting Collettes head from her shoulders if she doesnt give the tv back. He also vowed to be back to smack her about if she refuses to hand the stuff he owns back..... I still think that she will accept him back and we will have to put up with him some more, because she is a arsehole magnet...and cant take a hint...he isnt even supposed to live there! And what its doing to her kids i hate to think, she wont be winning mother of the year.   WEDDING UPDATE  Rehersals tonight with the Rev.Bob Simmonds at the church, should be fun....we turned up yesterday thinking it was then but it turned out there was a breakdown in communication.

      Currently drinking a good bottle of Sauvignon 2002 red wine.I do like a good wine, but i find myself drinking the lot ....lol Iam also hooked to the Evanescence track on there album called 'My Immortal'. I have added the lyrics to this song below....its such a classy track!   "My Immortal"  my immortal i'm so tired of being here suppressed by all of my childish fears and if you have to leave i wish that you would just leave because your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone   these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  you used to captivate me by your resonating light but now i'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears and i've held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone and though you're still with me i've been alone all along.

      Today myself & Davee went down to Southampton on the train to see the reserve match between Saints & West Ham.We spent a small fortune on a new shirt and food and drink, walked around southampton and cheered on the reds as the played a lacklustre West Ham squad. I have included the match report from the saints site below.   Saints Res 2 West Ham Res 1  By Martin Hiley   Saints Reserves 2    West Ham United Reserves 1   Two bad errors from goalkeeper David Forde gifted nine-man Saints their first F.A. Premier League Reserve win of the season.  First of all he somehow managed to spill a weak header from Mike Williamson when it looked easier to catch it and presented the ball to Arron Davies who fired the ball into the roof of the net. He was then nowhere to be seen when Simon Gillett floated over a corner which gave Mike Williamson the easy task of heading the ball into the empty net.  It was a double boost for Saints who saw both Chris Marsden and Antti Niemi come through their first matches since the F.A. Cup Final.  However it was not all good news for Saints as they ended the game with nine men after having Michael Green and Garry Monk sent off. Saints started the match by far the brighter side with new signing Leandre Griffit sending a swerving drive from twenty-five yards towards goal which keeper Forde saved well. Simon Gillett then saw his first shot fly narrowly over the bar and his second a weak free kick spilt by Forde and the rebound cleared.  Forde then to his credit did well to turn a low Leandre Griffit shot round the post. Then in the twenty-fourth minute Niemi was called into action for the first time when Greg Pearson ran on to a through-ball only to see his fierce shot from six yards blocked brilliantly by the Finnish number one.  Arron Davies was then released on the right only to see his pull-back gathered by Forde. Then five minutes later it was Griffit's turn to be free on the right. His pull-back was met by Arron Davies who saw his shot easily gathered by Forde.  F.A. Cup Final hero Chris Baird was then taken off after taking a knock on his arm from Pearson. His replacement Michael Green was immediately into the action when he did well to block a Mitchell Cole shot.   Half Time: Saints Reserves 0    West Ham United Reserves 0   Saints once again were out of the blocks a lot faster than their opponents at the start on the second half. Leandre Griffit latched on to a throughball from Cranie only to see his shot on the stretch fly just past the upright.  However the 2,119 crowd didn't have long to wait for the deadlock to be broken as ten minutes into the second half Forde spilled Williamson's weak header and gifted Saints their first goal as Arron Davies was on hand to fire home the rebound. Saints could have doubled their lead a minute later once again helped by West Ham's poor defending. Tom Laws played a strong back-pass to the centre of the goal not noticing that his goalkeeper was still on the corner of his area. Forde scrambled back and just managed to clear the ball off the line.  Saints went close again when Arron Davies latched on to a through-ball from Griffit. He saw his shot parried by Forde and from the rebound Chris Marsden saw his header cleared off the line. Martin Cranie and Garry Monk were then booked before Saints doubled their lead with quarter of an hour left.  A Simon Gillett corner saw the keeper caught in no-man's-land and Mike Williamson headed into the empty net.  Then with just eight minutes left West ham were thrown a life-line when they were given a penalty. Michael Green hauled down Greg Pearson and was promptly sent off. Antti Niemi who must of thought that there was no point in being there was called into action and didn't dissapoint as he saved the penalty low to his left. However it was judged that he had moved off his line too early and the penalty was retaken. McMahon replaced Pearson as the penalty taker and he made no mistake firing the ball straight down the middle to give the Hammers a chance.  Saints endured a nervy last eight munutes especially when Garry Monk recieved his marching orders in the eighty-ninth minute after a late tackle.  Manager Steve Wigley must have thought that lightening had struck twice when a Mitchell Cole cross took a deflection of a Saints defender. Saints Reserves who gave away a two goal lead against Chelsea must have thought that they had done the same thing again however Antti Niemi saved the day as he stopped the ball on the line to ensure that Saints Reserves recorded their first win of the season.      Saints Reserves: Niemi, Baird (Green 41), Hunt, Cranie, Monk, Williamson, Gillett (Mills 89), Marsden, Davies, Griffit, Surman (Gleeson 85). Subs not used: Anaclet, Poke   West Ham United Reserves: Forde, McClenahan, Tattam, Laws, Lumsden (Bunce 60), Blewitt,Wright (Noble 76), Carrick (Cohen 60), Pearson, McMahon, Cole. Subs not used: Behcet, Parrington.

      Another week close to a end,hoorayy....!! The Chaplain and me were discussing my blog and if it would be better if Cliff the Moron hadnt have moved out from nextdoor... my response to that was 'mmm...iam sure ill think of something...'..lol  Its been the most easy going friday in history at the college today ....its usually busy about now but its quiet...which has given me the excuse to turn up my Bruce Springsteen CD full belt.  My Mate Steve and his girlfriend Amy are celebrating her 21st at Chicago's tommorow evening, and me and Stace are going to drop by and help her remember her special day.....or make her forget by buying her to much to drink..lol....(only kidding Steve!!).

       Inspired by the Guardian Newspaper   The Tories have a novel plan for dealing with the thousands of foreign types seeking asylum in Britain each year: house them on Alcatraz-style islands while their cases are considered. But the party hasn't said which islands it has in mind. This is were Basingstoke & Deane council can come to the rescue.  Basingstoke has thousands of islands with in the town limits,....yes, they might be traffic islands but iam sure they can hold about 20,000 for weeks on end.I mean if David Blaine can stay in a small box for 44 days then 20,000 asylum seekers can stand on one traffic island for 6 months.There will be no need for a perimeter fence on the islands as the high speed traffic wizzing by will probably flatten them, and if they did manage to survive then they would have to contend with one way systems and roundabouts.  And if they wish to collect handouts then no problem.....Basingstoke is famous for its 12 mile long dole queue, and this would probably stretch up as far as there island.Giving them the chance to pass a application form down the line.    "Room for 20,000 .....no probs"      Tip of the day:  school kids don't like being called 'little git'.... take it from me......i found that out today

          Basingstoke - A place to be proud of...????  Basingstoke Gazette is running a campaign to get the place recognised as the 'Place to be proud of'. Ok, I know iam biast towards Southampton and alot of you would argue with me when i say Southampton is better...but i really do feel that we shouldnt be jumping the gun about B'stoke just yet. Its a good place...YES.....i agree, but i dont even think anybody could be really proud of it.  And yes it is the butt of all jokes, in Hampshire especially as its taken Basingstoke council years to catch up with the rest of the towns and citys.  Aquadrome  - Basingstoke & deane would have you think this is a smashing place, pretty average is what it really is considering Romsey has a population half the size of B'stoke and has a far more superior pool.   Festival Place  - I like the coffee bars and eateries, but smaller than what they advertised when it was still being built.   Look of the Town  - Houses as far as the eye can see.   Roads  - Traffic prevention bolards on blind corners, so the accidents are actually doubled instead of reduced....great one!! (Hatch Warren).  I do think though that this is great improvement, much needed even...but dont get your hopes up for any awards just yet because there is alot of competition out there.

      Still on the subject of the worst cities and towns, Portsmouth (yuk) have come 11th and Reading 34th....But I don't see Southampton there! And that's because althought its only improved in the last few years its still the best place to be in Hampshire.  But I really cant understand why Winchester is 5th...I like Winchester, its history its building.The people are abit snobbie but that comes with living in a 'up market' sort of place.  But this survey though I feel should not have been so hard on Hampshire places.Does the person who constructed this survey not like us????

You bastards block the freakin road and you all drive like complete tools...not to mention the atmosphere you clog with your 3 letre engine gass guzzlers.If you insist on driving these beasts, offer to take neighbours kids as well as yours to school, then your doing a good deed...reducing traffic, pollution and being helpful to neighbours.

      Football players are going mad at the moment...But why?  1. Liverpool Reserve player shot in arse. 2. Several players in allegations of gang rape on a 17 year old. 3. Rio Ferdinand missing a drug test. 4. Leeds player under suspicion of a sexual assault.  These men have the world at there feet, they have what all school boys dream of...And what most men would give there right arm for! But the just piss it against the wind, how dare they....  At the end of all this the may be innocent, but why were they involved even just that 1% ? The police must have felt there was something... And the problem is they are under educated, overpaid with far to much time on there hands.Its coming to a situation where people will turn on the players because our money is best spent on something good rather than some prima donnas who are on to a easy life.

      Incredible reading in the Guardian Newspaper today from writer Micheal Moore. He has asked... and answered himeslfe some questions that should be put towards George Bush.The questions are:  1. Is it true the bin ladens nave had business relations with your family for the past 25 years? 2. What is the 'special relationship' between the bushes and the Saudi Royal Family? 3. Who attacked the United States on Spetember 11th - a guy on a dialysis machine from a small cave in Afghanistan, or your friend, Saudi Arabia? 4. Why did you allow a private Saudi jet to fly around the US in the days after 9/11 and pick up members of the Bin Laden family and then fly them out of the country? 5. Why are we protecting the second amendment rights of potential terrorists? 6. Were you aware that, while you were governor of texas, the taliban travelled to Texas to meet with your oil friends? 7.  What exactly was that look on your face in the Florida classroom on the morning of 9/11?  As you can see the questions posed by Moore are quite straight to the point, and he also has alot of information about the Prez that shows a sinister side to him.Corruption, back handers, money...murder! Adolf Hitler has been re-incarnated...

      Courtesy of BBCi  By Jim Stokes BBC Sport in Perth, Australia   Jonny Wilkinson was asked at a press conference on Tuesday evening at England's headquarters in Perth about the way his soul mate David Beckham reacted to his penalty miss against Turkey.  Replying, he said he hopes to keep his stuff above the bar as well!  Wilkinson took time to praise Beckham in Oz  Wilkinson, though, went on to praise the Real Madrid midfielder for the way he handled himself.  "Fair play to David, the pressure he was put under afterwards was not right," said Wilkinson. "But his self-control was something else.  "He did receive a lot of pressure after the incident and after the game, and it reflected on him the way he stood to it.  "It's not only on the pitch, but off the pitch as well. I don't know where he gets his spare minutes from.  "I'm glad I've got my privacy," he said, which brought out raucous laughter from the assembled press hounds who are determined that he hasn't.

Girl's returning from Hockey: " Mrs Jones, whats that beeping noise? It happens everytime we go around a corner". "it's the indicator, girls!"

Once there i had to assemble my team of five and plot a route back to the college, the walk was good and it took us about 6-7 hours to walk about 16 miles...the lads i walked with were a good bunch,looked after each other really well.  By the time the afternoon came i wasnt in any fit state to eat...i only stayed at the pub for a hour then came home and fell asleep watching Gladiator. The pains in my legs are still there but it was enjoyable all the same, I might do it again some time...might..lol

In the states they organise it better, there is a better sense of community spirit (scuse pun) about it, but in the UK we have teenage lads who havnt even bothered to make the effort to dress up and havnt got the enegy to remove there hoods of there coats. If you fail to give them anything and ask for the trick they decide beating the shit out of you.  The UK isnt ready for halloween, besides...we already have a traditional celebration called 'Guy Fawkes Night'. This involves kids pissing around with fireworks in your local park whilst tanked up on white lightning cider in brown bags.Guy Fawkes evening in the local A&E looks like basingstoke has been hit with a napalm attack.  roll on crimbo, a much more loving celebration!

       Taken From William Gibson Blog   urlLink William Gibson   HEARD ON SKY NEWS  "Umm Qasr is a town similar to Southampton", UK Defence Minister Geoff Hoon told the House of Commons yesterday. "He's either never been to Southampton, or he's never been to Umm Qasr", said one British soldier, informed of this while on patrol in Umm Qasr. Another added: "There's no beer, no prostitutes, and people are shooting at us. It's more like Portsmouth."

      Well, what a weekend!.. We drew our first game and lost our second but I think i can say this on all our behalfs that we really enjoyed ourselves. Quentin organised an excellent tour and it was v.amusing in places....Harrogate is stunning, really nice place with some great sights. We visited a turkish bath but had to change our plans on going as it was packed and we would have had to wait for ages.The flight was ok ....well....me and James got our ears chewed for talking whilst the hostess was trying to give a safety drill.  Roll on the next tour....! Iam looking forward to it already.

      Me and Claire have finally seen 'Matrix Revlolutions' and I must say what a greatly  'Entertaining Film' . It was better than the second film which although I enjoyed and understood to an extent, did seem to be a tad bit dissapointing.But in all honesty to those people who hated 2 & 3....you were never going to find answers to life here, nor were you going to find an excellently acted film. This was simply a film to enjoy...like a story...with three chapters.  Star Wars for instance was dreadful and overrated, the acting stank and only the special effects held it together. But you still all loved it! And why?  Because it got you talking about it.. you had conversation with people you had never spoken to before on Star Wars related issues. It got people embracing a common interest.  This is exactly what the Martix achieved,  and I suppose if you are looking for that bit of spiritual help from the films then this is it. Mankind is its own worst enemy, we never appreciate what we have till its gone, and when it is taken from under our noses we fight like hell and club together to get it back.  The Matrix films made us think, .....What if?  And for anyone who didn't like the films then you have your right to..... And for the ones who couldn't understand it then you should pay more attention as many would find Bambi to taxing on the brain.  So..my verdict is this.....TOP NOTCH!!

      This evening me and Stace gave the kids a fireworks and burger night. We got out the BBQ and cooked burgers and hot dogs on the patio...in the dark...and then on with the show. Now, one of the usual things that can happen with a Dawe family firework display is a 'dud' firework in the box. And yet again we got one..! A screamer rocket the size of a pencil decides it doesn't want to leave the tube its sitting in and explodes 10cm off the ground. The noise was deafening to say the least...and it didn't do the garden any good.  We have also had a 'Finding Nemo' night, as they DVD from the US had arrived. It doesn't get released here for like another 4 months so the kids are really happy.

      I have just finished watching some students and a collegue of mine on BBC Two's 'Time Commander'. I must admit i was quite upset when they failed to win, they seemed to have the right plan ....just at the wrong time. Never mind, you all did really well.   Artcile from BBCi site  Time Commanders Mon 3 Nov, 6:45 pm - 7:30 pm  45mins  Qadesh  The year is 1275 BC, the place is Qadesh in Syria. Two armies prepare to fight the earliest recorded battle which can be reconstructed in detail.  From a hi-tech war-room which resembles a modern military command and control centre, a team of students and their history teacher from Lord Wandsworth College in Hertfordshire* take control of an army of the Hittite Empire against the ambitious young Pharaoh of Egypt, Ramses II. Using real-time computer graphics to put their battle plan into action, the team must decide how best to use the thousands of war chariots under their command. Will they overcome their natural caution to beat the aggressive Pharaoh at his own game, or will they choose to defend?  Watching the team's every move are two military experts. From their vantage point above the war-room, they assess the team's command structure, their communication and tactical skills, and compare their performance to what happened at the real battle of Qadesh more than 3,000 years ago.  The team are fighting to protect their lands from the expansionist Egyptian Pharaoh and the stakes are high.  * Hertfordshire?? And there is me thinking i worked in Hampshire!!    Cliff the Mong is Back....but alot more quiet! Like a bloody rodent that wont fuck off he is now back to spoil our peace again. The thing is though it may be quiet now, but wait till there next argument...or piss up....or xmas! The guy will never change...sooner rid of him for good the better.

OF THE WORLD!  Fantastic! What a tense action packed on the edge of your seat ride. I watched the game from the college that Johnny used to go to with a load of 6th formers. The atmosphere was electric, my voice is sore and my ears are ringing. Congrats to the Aussies, they gave us a hard fought game! They had the BBC and ITV cameras at the 6th form room,the newspapers..oh what a buzz.. ENGLAND ARE WORLD CHAMPIONS. i never thought i would say that......

      Less than 24 hours to go before England enter there biggest game in 12 years, and a nations hopes are on a Rugby team to bring home the country's first World Cup in any sport in over 30 years.    I will be spending the match at Lord Wandsworth College as i have to go to work, but i should get to see the game which everybody is talking about. Lets hope Johnny can do the students and staff ...and the nation proud and bring back that trophy to its sporting birthplace.

      This just recieved from the bugged phone line of the Wachowski brothers....Okay so this was found on PointlessWasteofTime.com. It had me laughing in no time at all.  ***************************************** JOEL Andy! Great to hear from you again. Has your brother gone into labor yet?   ANDY What do you want, Joel? I told you we're not doing-   JOEL -a Matrix part 7. Yes, I know. But we've talked to Keanu and he swears he can drop 50 pounds and-   ANDY Dammit, Joel. Neo died in part 6. AGAIN. It's the fourteenth time he's died in the series. We showed his body  being burned and his ashes being shot into the sun. We even had that scene at the end where God himself came down from Heaven and declared that Neo and Trinity would never, ever, ever  return lest all of existance be unmade.   JOEL Oh, I'm glad you mentioned Trinity. Carrie-Ann is close to signing-   ANDY Joel, I'm getting death threats from fans.   JOEL You're breaking up here, I'm almost out of my service area. Quickly, we got Joe Pantaliano's verbal agreement to do the film in exchange for some food and a better box to sleep in-   ANDY Joel, you do this, and I WILL KILL YOU.  Do you understand?   JOEL -and Warner wants this one PG-13.  It'll be tough, but I told them you  were my guys and you could do it. So we're just gonna take out all  of the fight scenes, it's perfect. It's better than perfect, I love it.   ANDY AGH!   JOEL Also - I'm blueskying with Gabriel and he suddenly says -and you will LOVE this- that if the movies were only a half hour long, we could have like thirty showings a day. So we're thinking, "How to trim the time?" and it hits  me. The bullet time! It's in slow motion, for crissakes, right? You ditch that, you're in at 30 minutes with a whisper!   ANDY KILL YOU. BULLETS IN YOU AND KILL.  SO MUCH ANGRY. JUST.   JOEL I TOLD Gabriel you'd love it. Also, I'll need a script by nine tonight.   LARRY NO!   JOEL ...and the money truck will be by around 9:30.   ANDY Oh.    A pause.    ANDY Yeah, alright.   LARRY Actually, those were some great ideas, Joel.   JOEL Homerun Joel! That's why you  guys call me Homerun Joel!    We hear a CLICK and a DIAL TONE.    LARRY But that's not what we call him.   ANDY Shut up and get your writing pad.    THE END  ****************************************

      Bush go Home! This is a subject i feel will not go away to quickly, as alot of people feel strongly against having a man over here that is considered probably more dangerous for world safety than Saddam ever was.I for one would like it if he just dropped dead, but this isn't an attack on the people of the US. I like America, just not Bush!!  I hope that he is elected out of office next elections but i can't see it happening, OBL will probably be 'caught' just days before polls open, and Saddam 'killed'.

      Alex Parks, (un)Deserved winner of Fame Academy has critised how she is being followed with the stigma of being a winner of a TV talent show.  "Being associated with it is a hurdle and not a help. I am working to get rid of it."  She whined. Well if i may correct you first...its not a hurdle, it was a bloody big push up through the ranks and the hard work of getting noticed.   "The BBC did not put me where I am," she said. "They helped but they did not ultimately put me where I am and they do not have ownership of me."   - True, but then didn't the viewers who voted every week have something to do with where you are now??   "I don't give a toss about the flat, car or champagne, which is still in the fridge. I hate the stuff."   - Oh lord, you ungrateful fucker..! You have it all and you still not happy.At least bloody Sneddon appreciated his 5 mins of fame.Who cares if you don't like it...don't fucking drink it... And if you don't give a toss about the car or flat....prove it...give it up....to me....or better still, a family in a over crowded council house who have been on a waiting list for 2 years and havn't gained the points to be considered a high priority. Then we will take you seriously you spoilt little berk!

      ok, so i pinched this from my fellow B'stoke blogger  urlLink Frank ... but iam sure he will understand as this is amusing.   This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at Clemson University. It was in the local newspaper and even Jay Leno mentioned it. It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests.  After the wedding at the reception, the groom got up on stage with a microphone to talk to the crowd. He said he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride’s and his family and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a lavish reception.  As a token of his deep appreciation he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just from him. So taped to the bottom of everyone’s chair, including the wedding party, was a manila envelope.  He said this was his gift to everyone, and asked them to open their envelope. Inside each manila envelope was an 8×10 glossy of his bride having sex with the best man. The groom had gotten suspicious of them weeks earlier and had hired a private detective to tail them.  After just standing there, just watching the guests’ reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, “Fuck you!”. Then he turned to his bride and said, “Fuck you!”.  Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said, “I’m outta here.”  He had the marriage annulled first thing in the morning. While most people would have canceled the wedding immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with the charade, as if nothing were wrong.  His revenge….making the bride’s parents pay over $32,000 for a 300 guest wedding and reception, and best of all, trashing the bride’s and best man’s reputations in front of 300 friends and family members.  This guy has balls the size of church bells. Do you think we might get a MasterCard “priceless” commercial out of this?  - Elegant wedding reception for 300 family members and friends……………………………………$32,000. - Wedding photographs commemorating the occasion……………………………………$3,000. - Deluxe two week honeymoon accommodations in Maui……………………………………………$8,500. - The look on everyone’s face when they see the 8×10 glossy of the bride humping the best man ………………Priceless.

      So, no more work for me till January 2004! We had a great xmas meal at the college today, lots of wine and beer....everyone in a great mood. It also gives me plenty of time now to catch up on work that needs doing pronto. We also have some lads leaving the college in the form of Chris and Andy. It will be a shame as they were both a great 'double act' that were good for the college...i wish them all the best for the future and hope they can be back soon.  Tommorow is bill paying day, oh..and if anyone has any suggestion as to what to get Stacey then leave them either on comments or the tagboard.

After a few visits to pubs and a meal at Nandos just outside the Academy we went in to enjoy 1hr 30mins of music enjoyment. It even included Chad doing and impression of the lead singer from 'the Darkness'.... They spayed beer over us, through drum sticks into the crowd, and it went down as one of the best gigs i have been to. It was just a shame it was on a sunday night as i only got to bed at 1:30am this morning and i was back at work for 9am....urrghh

I don't think many US citizens are aware that it was the US government who created this monster, by arming him, funding him and supplying biological weapons which he used to gas the Iranians all back in the 1980's.

       Shock NEWS - Prince William buys a stamp    So maybe I'm not getting caught up with all this crud that appears in the paper showing PW being 'normal'... That's 'normal' as in just like the 'poor folk'. Here we have a picture of PW buying a stamp, but he wouldn't be the first member of the royal family to have 'licked the queen'...Charlie once licked a Queen.    Here we have PW looking for sweets, avoiding the walnut whip as he thinks its a game they used to play at Eton, except with a bigger whip and more nuts.  These photos might buy the spoilt bugger some private time from the media, but it also makes him look like a completely out of touch dong.

       The End is Nigh  - For RI:SE anyway. Thats it, its almost over for C4's car crash breakfast show which in that past few months has only been watched by a minority of people. No more twig boy (Ian Lee), blonde with short skirt and attention span (Kate Lawler) and Blimp Boobs (Zora Suleman)... although it will be a shame Zora is no longer on TV, Radio will be sure to use her talents to better use...ok, they wont but it might stop all these fan sites of her boobs appearing everywhere.  I personally thought the Big Breakfast was cult viewing with wit and entertainment, but RI:SE was littered with no hopers and Reality show contestants...(I think they may fall in the same catagory).

On thursday there were a few nice surprises with the presents, Stace got me a really cool looking stereo with a neon blue glow to it.   Yesterday we had a ball as my Dad & Val came up and we all had a few games of Britain Brainiest ..resulting in my Dad getting pissed off with losing twice. Amy had far to much to drink and fell asleep and everyone let there hair down. Today we have Staceys dad visiting and tommorow we are visiting sombody elses for once. I will need a another break to get over all this..!

       With only a few days to go till crimbo we still have had xmas shopping to do in the Dawe household. So we got up nice and early this morning to beat the rush and avoid the queue's... and we only just made it. Tonight will be making a visit to a family friends to have a few tins and exchange gifts, and then come home to be subjected to some really bad xmas tv. That is one thing you are garenteed from crimbo its that TV will have endless repeats and tacky films. And to cop that yet another episode of 'only fools'... in which the BBC have said that this will be the final for one for sure. But didn't they say that after the episode in which they found a watch and became millionaires? It all seems like flogging a dead horse to me, shame though...i quite liked the show up till then.  Alternative Christmas carol By Chris Charles, BBCi News (With apologies to Noddy Holder)  JONNY CHRISTMAS  Are you lining up the goalposts with the ball? Are you driving all those Aussies up the wall? Will you kick it with your left foot? Perhaps you'll use your right Then hoof it up away and out of sight  CHORUS: So here it is, Jonny Christmas - all the Pommies having fun Look at the Aussies now, we've got them on the run  When you're waiting in the pocket at the death A nervous nation quietly holds its breath Your mama's stuck in Tesco's Doesn't want to know the score Your dad can't bear to watch you any more  So here it is Jonny Christmas, all the Pommies having fun Look at the Aussies now, we've got them on the run  What will the Aussies do when they see you lining up another one? Oh dear, oh dear  When the kick goes over, you all go insane Cos life will never be the same again Take a bus ride round the city, have a teacake with the Queen Waiting to be told it's all a dream  So here it is Jonny Christmas, all the Pommies having fun Look at the Aussies now, we've got them on the run  TO FADE...

      It is not often i review a fellow blogger but i will make and exception this this blog  urlLink http://london-underground.blogspot.com/ .  The most amusing bit being the picture of a a drunk man spotted at a london tube station singing and making "farty" noises through a traffic cone, and still people give him money...classic!!     Back to work Tuesday  Yep, the normality of life comes back to our lives on tuesday, Monday for Stace ....and i finnaly realised christmas is actually quite enjoyable. You can get drunk , meet friends...do whatever....but when you back at work you find your evenings are dictated by the following day. I suppose it doesnt help now iam not really happy with work, i love working there and my collegues are fab but its hit a brick wall with ambitions for career. Any job offers would be gratefully accepted..

       Happy New Year  -  I need a new liver!   What a great evening, the guys at Eat Wells in Hammersmith were great again and laid on a great party.... and you always get one group who decide to eat on the stroke of midnight....idiots...you food only gits covered in streamers and plastic shells from the poppers. I do have abit of a headache today though but i think that might be to do with the lack of sleep i have had.

      With the new year upon us with the renewed hope of a better future for us all, I would like to look back on my first year as a blogger and the new year ahead of us and what it could offer. Since I have been writing many things have happened, Southampton reaching the FA Cup Final in Cardiff in May, the illegal war in Iraq, the Earthquake in Iran , my wedding to Stacey, starting my driving lessons...I could go on for ever.  2003 has unlike any other year played such a huge part of my life, I found a women that has shown the ultimate commitment to me, that I'm not alone when I think our world leaders are corrupt... And once and for all have banished any notion that I'm any good at ice skating. 2003 has been the best year of my life so far, and a great family has been there with me to enjoy it.  There are many hopes for the new year, one of them being that the saints win the FA Cup this time....But that might not happen..lol. But if something that is guaranteed is that I will be back again next year writing my life away on my blog.

Yep, Kilroy....star of the self titled discussion show and newspaper colomnist has come out with this little perl of wisdom.   Apart from oil - which was discovered, is produced and is paid for by the West - what do they contribute? Can you think of anything? Anything really useful?... No, nor can I...     Edited 12/1/04  Ok, Todays Daily Express has said that 20,000 calls were made to its hotline supporting his statement. They also said that he was entitled to his freedom of speech, this i agree with but i do feel that maybe he should have made an opinion that was based on facts rather than just opening his mouth and letting it all fall out ...

       Apologies to my Irish Friends, but you have permission to leave an english joke in my comment sections.   Air Lingus Flight 101 Heathrow to Dublin. As they approached Dublin No. 1 Runway, the tower heard:   PILOT - Bjeesus will ya look how fookin shart dat runway is? CO-PILOT - Yer nat fookin kiddin Paddy PILOT - Dis is ganna be one a de trickiest landings ever Shamus! CO-PILOT - Yer nat fookin kiddin Paddy!! PILOT - Right Shamus when I say go put de engine in reverse!! CO-PILOT - Royt ill do dat!! PILOT - an den ya put de flaps down!! CO-PILOT - Royt ill do dat to!! PILOT - An den stamp an der brakes as hard as yer can an pray ta de holy mudder a gad!!! CO-PILOT - Im prayin already but ill hit de brakes as hard as I can So as the wheels hit the ground Shamus put the engines in reverse, put the flaps down, stamped on the brakes and continued to pray to the holy mother with all his soul.   The breaks screeched, the tires squealed and there was smoke everywhere!!  But to the relief of all the passengers and not least of all Paddy and Shamus the aircraft came to a stop but a few meters from the end of the runway!!!  As Paddy and Shamus sat in the cockpit regaining some composure Paddy looked out of the window and said to Shamus "Dat has gat ta be de shartist fookin runway in de world"  To which Shamus replied "Yes but da ya see how wide it is?

      The SAS, the Parachute Regiment and the Police decide to go on a survival weekend together to see who comes out on top. After some basic exercises the trainer tells them that their next objective is to go down into the woods and catch a rabbit for their supper, returning with it ready to skin and cook.   Night falls. First up - the SAS. They don infrared goggles, drop to the ground and crawl into the woods in formation. Absolute silence for 5 minutes, followed by the unmistakable muffled "phut-phut" of their trademark silenced "double-tap". They emerge with a large rabbit shot cleanly between the eyes. "Excellent!" remarks the trainer.  Next up - the Para's. They finish their cans of lager, smear themselves with camouflage cream, fix bayonets and charge down into the woods, screaming at the top of their lungs. For the next hour the woods ring with the sound of rifle and machine-gun fire, hand grenades, mortar bombs and blood curdling war cries. Eventually they emerge, carrying the charred remains of a rabbit. "A bit messy, but you achieved the aim; well done", says the trainer.  Lastly, in go the coppers, walking slowly, hands behind backs whistling Dixon of Dock Green. For the next few hours, the silence is only broken by the occasional crackle of a walkie-talkie "Sierra Lima Whisky Tango Fanta One, suspect headed straight for you..." etc. After what seems an eternity, they emerge escorting a squirrel in handcuffs. "What the hell do you think you are doing?" asks the incredulous trainer, "Take this squirrel back and get me a rabbit like I asked you five hours ago!". So back they go. Minutes pass. Minutes turn to hours, night drags on and turns to day.  The next morning, the trainer and the other teams are awakened by the police, holding the handcuffed squirrel, now covered in bruises, one eye nearly shut. "Are you taking the p*ss!!??" asks the now seriously irate trainer. The police team leader nudges the squirrel, who squeaks: "Alright, alright, I'm a f*ckin' rabbit!"

      Bush Jnr Has come up with an excellent way to win the next election, and this time it might not need to go as far as rigging. Space...Yes, thats right...he wants the US to go to space.I suggest that when they go to mars they should send him, let him tear up that planet and not this one.   Today's Presidential Action (from Whitehouse website)      * Today, President Bush announced a new vision for the Nation's space exploration program. The President committed the United States to a long-term human and robotic program to explore the solar system, starting with a return to the Moon that will ultimately enable future exploration of Mars and other destinations.  ** Bush also suggested employing the services of Captain Kirk & the Mash aliens to check out Mars. The rocket will launch from the US and land in Nottingham where they will spend 2 days in the Mars factory.       * The President's vision affirms our Nation's commitment to manned space exploration. It gives NASA a new focus and clear objectives. It will be affordable and sustainable while maintaining the highest levels of safety. **Hold on...highest levels of safety! Shame you could'nt have been more careful on 9/11.If NASA fall asleep like the CIA did then this mission won't get anywhere.       * The benefits of space technology are far-reaching and affect the lives of every American. Space exploration has yielded advances in communications, weather forecasting, electronics, and countless other fields. For example, image processing technologies used in lifesaving CAT Scanners and MRIs trace their origins to technologies engineered for use in space.  ** And maybe....just maybe...there may be oil on Mars and nobody owns that yet!

      OK, iam going to issue a disclaime with this next post: None of the following statements have been done by Will Dawe (Me), nor do they represent my feelings towards my employers. But iam quite happy for 'Big Roy LWC' to take any rap for this as he bloody wrote it.   Review Taken from  urlLink Ciao.co.uk  A Rugby School pure and simple  First of all I will give you a little background on the school. It takes pupils form the 11-18 age range helpfully guiding you through the struggles of adjusting to a secondary school onto GCSE's and finally the big ones A-Levels. The school has just recently gone completely mixed. There are over four hundred pupils and the numbers rise every year. The school fee's are expensive but I am assured they are not as expensive as else where so you may presume it gives you value for money...   Now having got the boring background detail out of the way I can tell you what I want to tell you. As you may guess from the title the school is built on a rugby foundation. Yes some of you out there are now thinking wow that sounds cool. However, you are sadly mistaken the school is run by the rugby team or staff who will do anything in order to content the 1st xv. This means that as I don’t play rugby I’m treated as a second-class citizen. A prime example of this is when it comes to meal times. Lunch and Tea are always congested but not for the Rugby team or their followers. They push their way forward aided by members of staff willing to turn a blind eye to them. However, a non-player attempting to move forward is reprimanded for these foolish attempts.  This is addition to the review especially for Mel. Yes indeed there are scholarship places availiable for; Music, Drama, Sport and Academic. The standard of education you will recieve here is good when compared to other schools in the area. The food does go against the grain of normal boarding school stereotyping, it's actually quite good. There are also very good facilities, which include; gym, astro-turfs, two swimming pools, computers and libary and many sports fields.   However, even the rugby team are subjected to pointless rules implemented by teachers who are still living in the good old days of the trusty cane. Many examples of these are apparent: We are not allowed chewing gum, only the sixth form are allowed mobile phones and then only in boarding houses. I could stream out an endless list of pointless rules but I will spare you the effort of reading them.   This school is great for people who like being ordered around and treated like children through-out their school career its also great for good rugby players. If you are just a normal person like me looking for a good education and your basic human rights don't come here. You will be forced to go to Christian services, people will try to force you to sing hymns and pray, you will have speakers telling you that you are "spiritually blind if your not a Christian", you will be told you can't cut your hair too short or too long, you will live your life how they tell you or face the consequences.

I have some plans of attack on how to improve my career:  Get a book deal with a top publisher (not ladybird) about my blog. Realise a top 300 single, a cover version of 'Ready to Rumble' by Ant & Dec. Star in the Matrix 4: Regurgitated (working title) as ZXSpectrum. Design and build a new website which reunites school bully's with there victims, called 'Bully's Reunited'.  Something tells me they wont happen...

      This evening me & Stace learnt the joys of Ebay. Stace got her eye caught on a signed piece of paper by Chad 'Nickelback' Kroger and bugged me to help her bid. With only 20 mins left we started......£3.10 ...... I went back to my computer and quickly reminded Stace to refresh her screen every min to keep an eye on the bidding.....after 15 mins nothing changed. Then she forgot she was still in a auction and got distracted by another site....only to be out bid!! I think it might have been a blessing in disguise that she did'nt win as it looked like it was signed on Chad's loo roll.  (Stace thinks even that would have been good.....urrghh!!)

It was great fun and i won my first game with 128 points...but game a miserable last place on my second. After much to drink we came home to the comforts of our beds...Paul & Julie though had to re-pump the air bed i did for them as i left one of the valves out and when they got on it all the air flew out.oops..

       Saints 1 -  1 Bayern Munich ....   Impressed? Well iam, we dominated a really entertaining game and it was good to see a large turnout. Even Bayern had alot of fans...!! We lead for most of the game through a Brett Omerod goal in the 3rd minute but a Micheal Ballack strike wrong footed Niemi and so total glory was'nt ours. But with Francis Benali playing for the last time and the game in Ted Bates memory it made a really good evenings football... well worth the entrance fee.

      Well done to Ricky Gervais and the rest of the cast for winning a Golden Globe for best Comedy & Best Comedy Actor. Remarable considering  The Office  is only shown on BBC America which ia a lesser known channel.  I just wish he had been given an award for best acceptance speech with corkers such as...   "I'm not from these parts... I'm from a little place called England. We used to run the world before you,"   On accepting best comedy actor:  "Two. Books ends. Excellent. You need the set, one looks... y'know."    To BBCi before the awards:  "It would be good to lose. I need my come-uppance and Matt LeBlanc is the man to do it - it's character building."

      SPOT UPDATE - Its probably an infection! I am seeing the college Doctor today at 5pm. The thinks there is nothing to worry about, which is news i want, because i have been shitting it like a big jessy! I can be such a clown.      This joke was emailed to me today by a ol'School Chum.  Will Young,  Robbie and Kylie went for a night on the town, as they left the night-club,  Kylie slipped and got her head stuck between the railings of the fence  opposite the club. Robbie decided to take full advantage of this and lifted up her little skirt, pushed her thong to one side and gave her a good seeing to (as any Stoke lad would!). "Its your turn now, Will"  grinned Robbie  But Will started crying.  Robbie asked "Why are you crying,  Will? What's wrong?"  Will sobbed "My head won't fit between the railings".

      The side of my face is giving me some cause for concern today, for the last week and a half had what looks like a mole changing shape and going all 'scabby' on me. The gland is also up just under one side of my jaw. Iam going to give it a couple of days to see what happens but if there is no change then ill see my GP.  But maybe iam panicking over nothing and its just a insect bite that has become infected..!

      Ok, so its taken me ages to find any reviews of the Nickelback gig me and Stace went to in december but i have finnaly found one.   The Guardian / Online  Brixton Academy, London  Adam Sweeting Wednesday December 10, 2003  Rating 4/5  Maybe it's because they're from Vancouver, but Nickelback are a different species from the current wave of fashionable US metal. Whereas the likes of Korn or Staind sound so dark and diabolical that you could only imagine that they were saved in the nick of time from hanging themselves before they went onstage, Nickelback seem cheerful and well adjusted, and actually enjoy communicating with the crowd. It's amazing they've come as far as they have, but they've been canny enough to exploit a few reliable old tricks - like writing tunes and not playing everything so fast and heavy that it's like being crushed by a steel avalanche.  The Nickelback biography is littered with statistics and superlatives (the Silver Side Up album sold 40bn copies in 15 minutes, the band had to buy a new bus to keep all their Grammys in, blah blah), but their mega-anthem How You Remind Me is one of those songs you know backwards without having made any effort to listen to it. They played it tonight as an encore, and vocalist Chad Kroeger found he had no further use for his microphone since the crowd did all the work for him.  The 'Back have a useful batch of beefy, anthemic rock songs, among which we might pick out Breathe, Do This Anymore or the rather skilful Someday, and they can get heav-yyyy, as in the battered-wife saga of Never Again. But they also work hard to give the punters a value-added showbiz experience. Huge blasts of flame kept shooting up from the drum riser, threatening to incinerate both sticksman Ryan Vikedal and the lighting rig hanging above him, and the set was peppered with ear-splitting flashbombs. They sprayed the sweat-soaked front rows with water, and lobbed plastic glasses of beer into the balcony. The unplugged acoustic segment was prefaced by an interlude of darkness filled with some dialogue samples from Spider Man. When the lights came back up, the band launched into Hero, from the movie soundtrack. Kinda hammy, but was it brain surgery you were after?

      A week after getting my cream it now seems the spot has gone....along with the mole. Its bizarre sounding but the slight scar where it used to be could be covering the mole, and i only got the scar because i kept picking it. A thankyou to both  urlLink Frank  &  urlLink Kate , there messages recently have been quite supportive!  The weekend was fun packed with the birthdays of Claire & her Grandad.

      About 2 years ago Beech Down Primary School was hit by arson, and burnt to the ground! The police did a great job of catching the little bastards ....the eldest being 12 years old. But justice was to stand in there way...the police's that is and allow these two fuckers off with lack of evidence ( thought: big school,rubble,burnt down, caught on scene,confession )....hmmmm...strange.  Well, after much argument the local community wanted a school built on the land with the insurance money, but it seems you cannot actually insure a school. The council are not actually held by law to.....but Joe Public have to (by law) have there house insured.So there was no cash.....  Councillor Don Allen of Hampshire County Council decided to pull the rest of the school down, stick the kids in other schools....and sell the land for some serious cash to housing developers. This would not be a problem if the money gained from it was going towards building nice extensions on to the other schools taking in the school-less kids.  But no.....  They have built prefabs you wouldnt house your dog in...and they will probably only last 10 years...long enough for people to forget about Beech Down. So, i suppose our council tax will be cheaper this year seeing that Hants County council are a bit flush....i think fucking not some how!!

      After reading about four young boys from the same family who are desperately ill with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, I have decided to join the thousands of people in Britain who have put there name forward for the bone marrow transplant donor register. The four boys from Romsey, near Southampton, need the transplant or they will not live past there teens...So..I urge all you healthy buggers out there to follow the rest of us and do a good deed for the year.

      In this weeks copy of  TimeOut - London , Robert Elms has written a article on how London should be separate from England and the rest of the UK. A Republic..... The sort of comments he spouts are what you would find from narrow minded Londoners (Only a minority!) He reckons this would be great because all the money that Londerners would generate in tax's and Russian billionaires would go into funding the biggest shit hole in society, instead of funding poor northern towns.  I agree with him about one thing....It should be a Republic. Its a shite reflection of the UK anyway, most tourists only ever got to London and go away thinking we have tea with the queen and we all speak with cockney accents. They fail to realise...(including Londerners) that the UK is a lot more than London will ever be in the sense of tradition and history. And I would rather look at a field of poppy's in Hampshire or The Giants Causeway in N.Ireland than any poxxy, over-priced, jumped up fuckheads, restaurant / brothel /  art gallery.  Note: This post was in reference to TimeOut's Robert Elms.....and not the vast majority of London. Who i think make a shit city sort of respectable.  Note 2: Robert, you can come and stay in my Hampshire home this summer.... you will find we have clean air to go with our restaurants & Art Gallerys. And we even have a multicultural society as well....

      Bought myself a new shirt from Foxhole in Festival Place yesterday, I vowed it was going to be a work shirt but I feel its to nice for that...Not bad for a tenner either! Also go my mits onto the controversial software   urlLink DVD X Copy Xpress  . And for once it does exactly what it says on the box, it copies and burn with only three clicks of a mouse button. So blockbuster it is...  As for staff footie tonight, I'm giving it a miss. I really don't fancy the competitiveness of it all today.

      After many weeks of searching i have now found Dj Dangermouse's acclaimed (but illegal) 'The Grey Album'. One of the most highly sort after albums with a fine blend of Hip Hop music , the result of a mix of two albums..... Jay-Z's  'The Black Album' & The Beatles 'White Album'. I have posted the link and i suggest everybody gives it a try, even if Hip Hop isnt your bag.....               DJ Danger Mouse's recent Grey Album, which remixes Jay-Z's The Black Album and      the Beatles White Album, has been hailed as a innovative hip-hop triumph.      Despite that and the fact that only 3,000 copies of the album are in      circulation, EMI sent cease and desist letters yesterday to Danger Mouse and      the handful of stores that were selling the album, demanding that the album      be destroyed.         &quot;EMI isn't looking for compensation, they're trying to ban      a work of art,&quot; said Downhill Battle's Rebecca Laurie.            "EMI isn't looking for compensation, they're trying to ban a work of art," said Downhill Battle's Rebecca Laurie.   urlLink Dj Dangermouse - The Grey Album

      Another busy day on my blog, i have just installed meta tags into the code....at last, and now just adding some final bits to it later today. My blog spring clean was sort of needed...and iam happy with the outcome.  My new boss starts today so things at the college should start to go a bit better. Iam hoping he has good news in the form that i fit in with future plans, beause if i don't i will be looking for future work in the next few months. I sort of have plans to introduce a automated room booking form for ICT so i hope my future is with the college, they have been good for my career even if sometimes i can put a few noses out of joint.  Iam also sort of hoping he offers me full time work as i would like to get rid of some existing debts and then move on to applying for a mortgage.

      Made a few adjustments today on my blog, i was getting tired of the old look and there were many things that i hated about it. This though has so much felxibility when it comes to changing things on the site, the other just got untidy and cruddy looking. I have even got room for add banners, which have been the scurge of the net for years but i need the cash to run things like my Broadband connection. I have still got a few more things to add to this new look but this is it .....no more BIG changes for at least another 6 months, a cannot be bothered to keep changing!

      Corporate bastards at Lycos have terminated the funding of the TeraLycos run site webmonkey.com. For years this place has been a great source of information and help and without it my involvement with web design may have never got this far. This is just typical ....they probably knew though that they couldnt charge peole to be a member as most people would rather get it for free, so they just ditched it.  Anyone has any sugestions as to where i find my needed web info please leave the address in my comments section.

      MY BLOODY KNEE!! Heck we won though...Yes, thats right. Racing Wandsworth 7 Wozza Allstar Eleven 3, and i even made the score sheet with an impressive 25 yard shot in the bottom left hand corner of the goal.  My knee hurts though, its like all the muscles are really bruised, but that will teach me for not warming up properly.   The Car I Want  Its called the Ligier Be UP, 505 cc Scooter car. And i only need a CBT to drive it, with costs for a new model at around £4000. If anyone wants to give me a birthday pressie (13th April) then this is it.

      What does a 2 hour train journey, annoying passengers running up and down the train screaming, weird people talking to themselves in train stations and a boring seminar all have in common?  YES! Its the Brighton Macromedia Seminar!  The seminar was exactly like last octobers, just advertised differently to fool punters into coming again. And they even failed to provide enough seats for everyone, which explains my my arse is sore today from sitting on a rock hard floor. I dont think iam going to make another trip down there again, i did feel conned!  Then you have weirdos in Subway who talk to themselves frantically whilst your trying to eat, then they ask you the time every 5 mins.....to the point they turn around to you and say....'you are telling me the truth about the time arn't you?'  WHAT...??  My reply to this was.....'why would i tell you a lie?' .... this i dont get a answer for, so i finished my club sandwhich and go out of there. Once the seminar was up i made my way home....for another 2 hour train journey.I even managed to get a snooze on the train.

       Is this the most stupid person in America??     This Woman had made 3 One Million US Dollar bills to pay for shopping of around a grand in her local Wal-Mart. Failing to really think this one out she didn't know that there isnt such thing as a $1Million dollar bill, and even had the stupidity to ask the cashier for change!!  The cashier immediately noticed the bill - bearing the picture of the Statue of Liberty - was fake and called her manager who alerted the police.  "This is the first time in my law enforcement career I've seen someone trying to use a $1 million bill," local police chief Almond Turner was quoted as saying by the Houston Chronicle newspaper.  "It was green, but you could tell it was not a real bill," Mr Turner added.  Police are investigating her mental health.....

      Claire had her last game of the season for Hatch Warren Ladies on Sunday. Probably a good thing as Stace was shouting nasty things at the other teams number 12 ..... but in Staceys defence, the number 12 did look like a bloke! And it was amusing to hear Stace shout to Claire, 'Kick her in the bollocks!'. She can get rather naughty when she wants to be...lol...

Lil Bugger isn't she, but lovely thought.  Tommorow i get back into my driving lessons after i passed my theory, i'll have a couple of them and then i get on to my actual driving test.

      The posts to my blog have been of a shit standard over the last few days.....but with this one i hope to make up for it. Started my first day on my temp work with Motorola in Basingstoke town centre today, and according to there guidelines thats all i can say on that matter.......i work for marketing and they dont like there work being discussed. But i can say i enjoyed the work and everyone there was nice and friendly ....  its poo though i only have two weeks with them, then iam back to the college to finish my job off. And i got a fantastic reference from a colleague....made me feel quite good inside.

      With three weeks off from the college i have found that i have plenty of time to go looking for work. Only one agency seemed interested, and the girl in the office was more than helpful to take my details and help with my CV.It feels strange that almost this time two years ago i was doing the same thing, and it was so stressfull. At least this time iam alot more experienced than last time.

      Its not easy leaving a job that you like, especially one in which you have florished in. My time at Lord Wandsworth College has been great, and its great to know my work was appreciated. Here is just ONE of the references i recieved form staff who wanted to help me on my way. Quite a good one, and it certanly goes along way in helping me find other work!   Reference -  Will joined the IT staff at Lord Wandsworth College in September 2002 on a fixed term contract.    The College had invested a great deal in establishing a whole school network and required some software support and some expertise in web page design.  Will very quickly showed himself to be an effective worker in these areas and very soon established websites on the school’s intranet for those departments which requested them.  Given guidance on content, he was able to transform these ideas into effective websites which caught the imagination and had a very real visual impact on the end-users.  Will learnt a great deal from the tasks demanded of him by the school and was always willing to pick up new ideas and learn new techniques as required for a particular task.  He would often try the find the ideal or exact tool for a particular job and gained a great deal of satisfaction when he mastered it.    After a short time Will was given responsibility for standalone computers which were dotted around the school campus.  He was able to support these effectively and could relatively easily put right hardware and software problems with these machines.    Will likes to work independently but can work as part of a team and did so with the two hardware technicians and the Head of ICT at the College.  He works best when given specific guidelines on the task to be achieved.  Will is a polite and confident young man who had a good record of attendance and punctuality and did not miss any time through illness.

        I have emailed this to just about everybody i know, even if they couldnt give a shit that iam standing with the RWC trophy. Whilst the majority have been impressed, one or two havn't.... I emailed my good pal (soon to be ex-good pal...lol) Louie this picture and his only comment was:   'Its been done in Photoshop'   To which i assume he thinks i a hour cutting my image out of one snap and pasting it into a picture of the trophy, this i can do and have become quite good at.... but not this time. And no....its not made of chocolate nor is it a 'fake' one, its real..really.

      Few things done today, surprised alot of people by turning up for a third day of temping with Motorola. On my dinner hour i had my picture done with the Rugby World Cup, which i will post as soon as they email it to me.   JOKE MEMO  From: Bin Laden, Osama  To: All Al Queda Fighters  Subject: The Cave, Do Not Distribute Outside The Organisation.  Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours recently but we've really come together as a group and I love that! However, while we are fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave, and frankly I have a few concerns:  First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we should be even more concerned about the dust in our cave. We want to avoid excessive dust inhalation, (a health and safety issue) - so we need to sweep the cave daily. I've done my bit on the cleaning rota ..have you? I've posted a sign-up sheet near the cave reception area (next to the halal toaster).  Second, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to scare the s**t out of most of the world's population, okay? That means that while we're taping, please do not ride your scooter in the background or keep doing the 'Wassup' thing. Thanks.  Third: Food. I bought a box of Dairylea recently, clearly wrote "Ossy" on the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, two of my Dairylea slices were gone. Consideration. That's all I'm saying.  Fourth: I'm not against team spirit and all that, but we must distance ourselves from the Infidel's bat and ball games. Please do not chant "Ossy, Ossy, Ossy, Oy, Oy, Oy" when I ride past on the donkey. Thanks.  Five: Graffiti. Whoever wrote "OSAMA F***S DONKEYS" on the group toilet wall It's a lie, the donkey backed into me, whilst I was relieving myself at the edge of the mountain.  Six: The use of chickens is strictly for food. Assam, the old excuse that the 'chicken backed into me, whilst I was relieving myself at the edge of the mountain' will not be accepted in future. (With donkeys, there is a grey area.)  Finally, we've heard that there may be Western soldiers in disguise trying to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First patrol will be Omar, Muhammad, Abdul, Akbar and Dave.  Love you lots,  Group Hug.  Os.  PS - I'm sick of having "Osama's Bed Linen" scribbled on my laundry bag. Cut it out, it's not funny anymore.

The job is a online co-ordinator helping edit and control the main UK BHF site. It costs a bit in travel but its a good job and one i would be silly to turn down. And i get to see London...ok...maybe not that last bit.  It has been almost 4-5 weeks and this is the first interview i have had so far. And ill make sure i take a camera next time iam up there so  urlLink Frank  &  urlLink Kate  can have a few snaps of how 'ol blighty' is doing without them.

And Iam still waiting for a call from Ciaran at Orion IT about a job so i have a few things that i can get on with.  And a big plus is that the weather is great!

      This morning Stace tryed to cancel her AOL subscription because she has got her comp networked to mine now. After 20 mins on the phone with a AOL sales rep, she still didnt manage to cancel....but she managed to get a few months free...!! ...  WHY DO AOL NEVER SEEM TO TAKE 'CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION' AS A INDICATION THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY WISH TO CANCEL??  Whats more, if you type 'billing'... you get hundreds of options to pay them cash.  Type 'Cancel Subscription'.... you get two options. Email or call the nice Sales lady who won't cancel you.  Anyone else noticed this when cancelling?

       hehehe....could'nt resist it!   A mother and her son were flying Aer Lingus from Dublin to Heathrow. The son (who had been looking out the window) turned to his mother and asked, "If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't Big planes have baby planes?". The mother (who couldn't think of an answer) told her son to ask the stewardess. So the boy asked the stewardess, "If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?" The stewardess responded, "Did your mother tell you to ask me?" The boy said, "Yes she did." "Well, then, tell your mother that there are no baby planes because Aer Lingus always pulls out on time. Have your mother explain that to you."

I decided to pick a 'blogger' template rather than make my own because iam lazy, and this one is more flexible with the blogger account.  I have also started my first day at British Heart Foundation as there new Online Co-Ordinator. Been quite busy so far, there is also some cracking food places round here as well... Oh, and you may consider this as 'harping on' but i my arms STILL ache from the TA recruitment weekend.

      Have you ever lost anything without being able to explain where the hell its gone? This morning confirmed to me that there is an 'abyss' of lost stuff in our house.Car keys,wallet,phone charger...all vanish for anything up to 2 hours, without explanation!  My phone charger has been missing for a while now and my mobby is close to dying on me.Iam beginning to think thats what happened to Lord Lucan, has made the fatal error of tying himself to a set of car keys and now he is bloody lost in some bloody limbo state of misplacement.

      Not a good start this morning, could'nt find the bloody Oyster top up machine at waterloo so i gave up and bought a return ticket to Bond street.And when i did get to Bond Street i was in such a world of my own, i put my ticket in the turnstile...it popped out. Doors only open on these things if you collect your ticket...but i carried on walking using my bag as a battering ram becuase the gates were still closed. I then realised what i had done, which included leaving my return ticket in the turnstile... But it was to late, so i left quickly to the sound of a few Japanese tourists sniggering behind me. Iam Such a dumb ass in the morning!!!  I need stonger coffee in the morning or otherwise someday ill forget where i work.So now i have to fork out more cash to get back to waterloo station tonight, i wont make that mistake again.

      What a weekend, lovely weather!! Been a scorcher for spring, which was just as well as Davee had her Birthday party on Saturday so it was ok to go ahead with the Barbeque. Davee and her friends made a complete mess of the garden but i think they enjoyed themselves...  Friday's trip back on the tube was full of surprises, first of all i got caught on a carriage that had a faulty heater, which then started to smoke heavily...and people still did'nt move from there seats... I got straight off and waited for the next train to come along. Then on the next one everybody had abuse hurled at them by some pisshead..the smoking carriage could have been safer!  Caught the sun abit yesterday when me and Louie went up the pub, it left a slight burn imprint on my face of my shades, but my arms look quite brown.

       coz there funny, ...!!   Replies Put on Child Support Agency Forms   The following are all replies that women have put on Child Support Agency forms in the section for listing father's details: These are genuine excerpts from the forms.  01. Regarding the identity of the father of my twins, child A was fathered by Jim X. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of child B, but I believe that he was conceived on the same night.  02. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of my child as I was being sick out of a window when taken unexpectedly from behind. I can provide you with a list of names of men that I think were at the party if this helps.  03. I do not know the name of the father of my little girl. She was conceived at a party on Acacia Avenue where I had unprotected sex with  a man I met that night. I do remember that the sex was so good that I  fainted. If you do manage to track down the father can you send me his phone number? Thanks.  04. I don't know the identity of the father of my daughter. He drives a BMW that now has a hole made by my stiletto in one of the door panels. Perhaps you can contact BMW service stations in this area and see if he's had it replaced.  05. I have never had sex with a man. I am awaiting a letter from the Pope confirming that my son's conception was immaculate and that he is Christ risen again.  06. I cannot tell you the name of child A's dad as he informs me that to do so would blow his cover and that would have cataclysmic implications for  the economy. I am torn between doing right by you and right by the country. Please advise.  07. I do not know who the father of my child was as all sailors look the same to me. I can confirm that he was on a ship berthed at Norfolk.  08. Peter X is the father of child A. If you do catch up with him can you ask him what he did with my AC/DC CDs?  09. From the dates it seems that my daughter was conceived at Disney -  maybe it really is the Magic Kingdom.  10. So much about that night is a blur. The only thing that I remember for sure is Delia Smith did a program about eggs earlier in the evening. If I'd have stayed in and watched more TV rather than going to the party at Miller Drive, mine might have remained unfertilised.  11. I am unsure as to the identity of the father of my baby- after all when you eat a can of beans you can't be sure which one made you fart.

      Yet another visit to Selfridges, yet another celeb spotting!! I even spoke to this one, which is a first as they usally dart around at 5000 miles per hour.  Daniella Westbrook - Standing out side one of the entrances as I was walking past, puffing away on a ciggie. When I opened the door to go in (as you do) she followed in behind so i held the door open for her.   'Thankyou, your a real gent!' says Daniella 'Ah don't mention it' I reply (crap one at that)  Its getting quite regular this lark... Yesterday it was Indra Ové, saw her buying shoes...Ok, she was in Interview with a Vampire & The Fifth Element.  And then a week or so ago there was Alex Parks...not really a celeb?!? Located on the left near the bottom I have created my last seen celebs at selfridges list. Crap I know...but it fills space.

      A horrible day today, supposed to be bloody the first day of summer. All it has done though is piss down with rain... Hoping though that my day at work goes a little better, I want to impress and so far I think that I could have done better. I may even have done really well but I do get a tad paranoid about if iam liked or not.

      Yesterday I suffered probably the worst train journey since I got my new job in London. If it was going to happen, it was happening on this train. 1. The Train had about 5 carriages less than usual, but same amount of people. 2. Air conditioning broke down and temperatures soared to at least 35c... 3. Beer was warm!  Even the spanish student sat next to me was appalled by the treatment to the train passengers or train networks give us. Pay top prices for shit conditions!

      Yesterday Summer Xs was on at Madejski Stadium in Reading. Me, Davee, Claire and view other friends went along. Not really my bag, especially Blue who I really detest.Did get to down a few pints, see Lenny Henry & Dawn French (and speak to them),get hot on a train and watch England balls it up in Portugal. But a good day all round.   David Beckham's voice is going to be used to make all stadium announcements at England's Euro 2004 matches. A spokesman said, "We heard he comes over the PA really well."

       urlLink    Here we have the culprit for our exit from Euro 2004. Whilst everyone on the BBC gives poor ol Vassell a ear bending they failed to remember Becks here missed the goal altogether. And in typical fashion would'nt take responsibility for it and blamed the floor, even though 9 other people managed to cope well enough!  He has been a liability the whole of Euro 2004 - His ego just is way out of control!  A quick visit to the BBC 606 sports forum dug up these comments:  If you had scored that f-king penalty against the French, we would have been playing Greece.  Beckham costs us the tournament by doing absolutely nothing again.    Overpaid pre-madonna, rip the armnband off his arm and send him off to wear his skirts and daft hairstyles elsewere.    Please!!! Comon Vassell DID NOT MISS it was saved at least his was on target unlike Beckhams, He cost us the WIN !!! at the end !! so please give Vassell a break.   Intresting don't you think....people don't buy the Beckham thing anymore..bout time he played football rather than trying to flog us razor blades,shoes,castrol oil,t-shirts. Your time is up Becks....Eriksson make sure you and David close the door on the way out and let our nation play football again. &nbsp; urlLink

      What a cool weekend..well...Friday was! Me and Stace made the trip up to see Nickelback at the Carling Hammersmith Apollo. I wasn't supposed to go after the TA had told me i was away that weekend but they cancelled which meant i could go to london. It was a better gig this time, as i could see what was going on! We had some cracking seats up in the circle and could see the whole gig without some bugger getting in the way.  The support group let the evening down though, the English group InME. Characterless, sound-the-same crap!!  They had a small fan base there for them but I wasn't impressed, even the stage crew cleaning the equipment up at the end of there set was more entertaining.     DVLA Newsflash  In order to assist other motorists in identifying potentially dangerous drivers, it's now compulsory for anyone with a lower than average IQ and driving ability to display a warning flag. The flag (comprising of a red cross on a white background) will be attached to the top of at least one door of their vehicle. For drivers of exceptionally low ability, additional flags are required.

      Yesterdays tube strikes cause chaos in London, leaving loads of commuters to either take the bus or walk. I walked,...from Waterloo to Bond Street and back again. I have decided to wear my trainers today as my feet are killing me still from my highly impractable leather shoes..good for looking good,crap for walking in!  The plus side was that i got to see ALOT of london which i usually miss everyday on the tube.The downsides are off the chart... After my driving glesson tonight iam entertaining Dawe Snr with the joys of Greece Vs Czech Republic in Euro 2004. I want Greece to win but I cannot see it happening....

      Interesting week so far, i have worked, slept, eaten food and gone to work! my blog enteries lately have become really dull and iam looking for a source of inspiration as i feel that iam getting a form of bloggers writing block.  What are you supposed to write about if you have nothing to say? You can always ramble on like iam doing now...  maybe i'll leave you with a quote fom the great Gordon Strachan: Reporter: Gordon, you must be delighted with that result? Strachan: You're spot on! You can read me like a book.

      No updates for a while on my blog....Basingstoke just isn't that intresting this week. Met up with aload of the guys at Gibralter Barracks to do a few sessions of Clay pidgeon shooting. Only me did'nt have a clays to shoot at as the guy in charge was unavailable. So we squeezed off a few shots ..... some kick on them buggers I can tell you!  After we ran out of cart's we used the air rifle to take out the empty shells which had been placed a wall. Memories of being in the scouts came flooding back to me...one memory stuck out the most, when my sister shot the scout leader in the arse with a sharp dart.  Davee got back from Paris last night and talked us to death about her trip... and my lovely babes got me a aniversery pres!! James Bond collection on DVD.... Dead chuffed... She did say that she was expecting her pressie to be of the same price.....cheeky devil..

       Taken from Funtime Franky:   While I was driving down the A19 the other day, (going a little faster than I should have been) I passed under a bridge only to see a copper the other side with a radar gun laying in wait. The copper pulled me over, walked up to the car, and with that classic patronising smirk, asked: “Runway too short?” To which I replied, “I’m late for work”. To which he asked, “What do you do?” “I’m a rectum stretcher”, I responded. The copper was surprised and confused “A what? A rectum stretcher?? And just what does a rectum stretcher do?” “Well” I said, ” I start by inserting one finger, then I work my way up to two fingers, then three, then four, then with my whole hand in, work side to side until I get my other hand in, and then I slowly start to stretch the hole, until it’s about six feet.” Then the copper asked questioningly and cautiously, “And just what do you do with a six foot asshole?” to which I politely replied, “You give him a radar gun and park him behind a bridge…..” Speeding ticket: £105.00 Court costs: £45 Look on copper’s face: Priceless
