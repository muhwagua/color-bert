      Whew, I've just spent my first day in Colorado after exactly 40 hours on the train...and I am happy.  A few words to the wise about the train...    1)  Don't take the train if you feel you have a schedule to keep.  The train will NEVER arrive ANYWHERE on time.  It is not for people who want to hurry up and get there so they can start having fun.  I don't know anybody like that, so I think we're in good shape, but just a precautionary note.    2)  Don't take the train if you like paying less than $15 dollars for a meal.  Or just bring your own food, because you will be broke whenever you get to wherever you'e going if you eat on the train.    3)  Don't take the train if you have a problem seeing other peoples' asses.  There is some kind of nation-wide mooning ritual known as the "Amtrak Salute," and the land-bound just LOVE to introduce us unsuspecting passengers to it.      4)  Don't take the train if you are scared of meeting people.  They will put you at a table in the dining car with a bunch of strangers and you will be expected to deal.  Now, I LOVED this, but some are horrified at stuff like that, so that's just another warning.  Okay, so all that out of the way, let me just say that I had so much fun!!!!!!!!!   For anybody who's never been on the train, there are three basic places you can go.  You can stay at your seat like a nerd (but there are people to meet there too, so that's cool), you can go to the observation car where the seats face the windows and you can watch the world go by, or you can go to the dining car.  You can also go to the bathroom, of course, or the smoking car, or the snack bar/lounge downstairs from the observation car, but those are kind of secondary thoughts.  Going any combination of these places will undoubtably allow you to meet a whole bunch of cool people who you will most likely never see again, but it's an awesome way to spend the time.  Actually, I take that back because I met a woman on the train that had met her husband (of nine years) on the train, so how's that?  Just a few things I have to mention in case any readers happen to ever take the train as far as Reno (from the Bay Area).  In Sacramento the train picks up a couple of volunteers from the train museum there.  These volunteers do narration all the way through the Sierras.  They tell a lot of interesting stories and, overall, it's pretty cool (though kind of refreshing, too, when they get off the train in Reno and leave you to formulate your own thoughts about what you're seeing).  I was a little concerned, I have to say, when I heard the narrator say that the chinese workers that helped to build the railroads were paid as much as the white workers.  This was a total lie!  It is well known that there was a white wage, a black wage, a mexican wage, and a chinese wage, and you can all guess who got the most.  He DID mention that the chinese workers bought their own food, but it was made to sound like they did this by choice because surviving on rice alone improved their efficiency or something like that.  The other weird thing was, when we went through Donner Pass, he was telling the story of the Donner Party.  At the end of the tale, he said, "in the end, of the 89 people who started out, only 47 survived the winter."  He cunningly left out any mention of a little thing know as  cannibalism , which I was admitedly impressed with.  The glossing-over was unmatched.  Do they think that we just couldn't handle it if we knew what really went on?  I mean, it's not like these things are secrets, and it just works to ruin their credibility.  This would be a great time to recommend James Loewen's   Lies My Teacher Told Me   and Howard Zinn's   A People's History of the United States  , both great myth-dispelling reads, and user-friendly to boot.  So, now that I'm back on unmoving ground, I have to start thinking about a job and the fact of it is incredibly depressing to me.  How I would LOVE to just relax and talk to my parents and my dog and write and read and lie around in the sun.  Oh well, que sera sera.  Just one last note, cuz my pops wants to use the computer now...I read my horoscope today in the Denver weekly publication that's like San Jose's "Metro."  These were the first couple of lines:  "I think it's high time you dreamed up a few new vices.  The old ones barely tweak your guilty conscience any more, and they certainly don't pack the educational punch they once had."  So don't blame me when I take up crack-smoking and whatever else you can let your mind imagine.  :)

      Ok, so now I'm (finally) about to embark on my trip to Colorado.  I'm for the most part packed, ready for two days on the train, and just kind of tired.  I've got lots on my mind too, so I'm looking forward to the fresh Rocky Mountain air.  John Denver is just so rad!!!   He makes me feel happy.  And that's all I have to say about that...I'll be around in a couple of days...

      Would anybody believe me if I said that I'm giving up on love?  You probably shouldn't, because I doubt it's true, and I know it sounds ridiculous at the age of 24, but jeez louise!!!  I know that everytime one decides that they are going to open themselves up to love, they also open themselves up to the pain that comes when the nature of that love relationship changes.  So, no room to bitch and moan, right?  Right.  Sometimes I wish that people would just be evil like they are in the movies, so we wouldn't feel so bad about breaking up with them.  But I don't believe in evil people...or at least I've never met any, so life is not so easy, then, is it?  Does anybody have any comments on the idea that what somebody thinks of "The Pina Colada" song says a lot about their take on love?  If you think that it's romantic when they guy discovers that it was actually his own woman that placed the personal ad he was responding to, does that make you a sucker?  I mean, they WERE both gonna cheat on each other, right?  Yes, but, but, it's just so sweet, you know, how he   never knew   that she like Pina Coladas and all that stuff.  Maybe I AM a hopeless romantic despite the fact that I just threatened to swear off love 5 minutes ago.  Something weird happened to me yesterday.  I was walking down San Salvadore on my way to South First Street Billiards, and I (think I) was propositioned...you know, as in, as if I were a prostitute?  The weirdest thing is that it was the second time this has happened to me in as many months!!!  I was walking down the street and this man walking behind me said "excuse me" or something close to that (he didn't seem to speak much English).  I could not make out what he was saying, but I'm pretty sure I heard the words "price" and "pussy" (!!!!!).  He had the most devilish grin on his face and seemed to really be enjoying my baffled reaction.  Now, I was wearing blue men's jeans and an long-sleeved blouse and I most definitely wasn't hanging around on any street corners or making eyes at anybody.  So I have no idea about all that.  The other time this happened to me I was waiting for the bus after work.  This car was pulling into the parking lot and on his way by the driver yelled, "How much?"  Wha?  That time I was wearing a dress and heels, so I   guess   I might be able to see how I would look like an unlikely bus-rider and how I might be suspected of harboring some sort of alternate motive, but c'mon.  Can't a girl wear a dress and stand at a bus stop in peace these days?  I'm really pretty troubled by these events.  I mean, I wear your occasional low-cut blouse, but prostitute?!  That's pretty insulting.  I'm only sharing to help get over the pain.  :)

      Ok so, as promised, I spent five (count them, FIVE) hours in front of the T.V. today watching TLC.  It was a Memorial Day "Trading Spaces" marathon, and I got sucked in!  I justified this to myself by noting that I wasn't just watching T.V., but watching T.V. in between doing laundry and drinking beers, which were the   real   tasks at-hand.    For anybody that doesn't know (because I didn't before today), Trading Spaces is a show where two sets of neighbors get $1,000 and the help of a professional designer with which to set about completely re-making one room of their neighbor's house.  This happens in the span of one weekend, and the hour-long show condenses everything so we see only the most interesting parts and don't have to actually watch them do too much of the work.  Now, don't misunderstand me...I do not think that this show is so interesting that I just HAD to talk about it here.  It's just that there was one episode that got me thinking about something that I think is really cool.  The show travels all over the country to find these neighbors.  They aren't necessarily married couples, but they often are unless they're mothers and daughters or something like that.  So anyway, there was one show on the marathon today that took place in Oakland.  The first set of neighbors was a married couple, an African-American woman and a white man.  Their neighbors were a lesbian couple with two small children.  Watching this (and knowing that people all over the country were watching it) made me feel strangely (and immensely) proud.  I mean, there are parts of this country where either one of those couples would be absolutely unacceptable.  And here, in California, they are neighbors and they are friends.    There is a line in the movie L.A. Story (one of my favorite movies of all time) where the English reporter makes a comment about how the people in L.A. seem to have their own set of rules, their own little world, really, and that nobody is looking to the outside for approval or reassurance that what they're doing is okay.  I think that is true of California, in general, which is why it would be so hard to ever leave here.  When you grow up here, you take things for granted...diversity, open-mindedness, liberal political climate, sunny weather.    I remember flying into Cleveland once to visit my parents when they were living there.  I was walking through the airport and I started to get this really weird feeling.  I was racking my brain, trying to figure out what it was that was making things seems out of place.  At the end of a long walk to the end of terminal and toward the baggage claim, it dawned on me.  There were so many WHITE people!!!!  Everywhere I turned, white people in all directions.  Now, this is not to criticize the white people, or to say that they shouldn't be there, all congregated together in Ohio like that.  It's just to say that when a California native is suddenly thrust into the midst of a homogenous scene, things feel a little off.  I get this feeling a bit when I go to visit my parents in Colorado, too, where they now live.  When I mention it, they swear to me that the Hispanic population there is growing in leaps and bounds.  I suppose I believe them, but I think I'd have to let it grow for a few more years before I'd really feel comfortable moving there (which is something I've considered).  I would never want to do the disservice of raising my future children in a place where they don't get to experience the kind of diversity that I grew up with.  And I don't have any illusions about this...it's not that I think that California doesn't have racism problems or that hate crimes are less frequent here.  It's just that I would want to give my kids a fighting chance at being able to look around them and see people for who they are, with less overt separations.  Ya'll dig?  Oh well, it's late, and though I'm not exactly tired, I'm not exactly functioning all that well either.  I think I'll call it a night.

      The end of day of a melancholy Day One of single life has me feeling grateful for my sweet roommate Lisa.  It's not just her spunky disposition that brings me a bit of comic relief...but she made me an absolutely awesome mixed tape when she thought I was about to embark on a five-day road trip - one of those rare instances where the tape-giver doesn't just give you a tape full of songs they like, but one full of songs they think that  you'd  like.  So I'm sitting here listening to Diana Krall and the bongo wonders of Perez Prado, Dead Can Dance, etc., etc, stuff I dig.  Now would be a good time to mention the CD that my friend JD burned for me the other day as well.  Man oh man...we had been talking early 80's country and the fact that the Oak Ridge Boys and Alabama and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band just kicked the shit out of anything Nashville has to offer these days (and both of our Mom's seem to harbor some morbid fascination with Anne Murray)...so my CD came complete with Kenny Roger's "The Gambler" (that  is  Kenny Rogers, right?), and John Anderson's "Swingin'," a song that, for some reason has been burned into my memory as a piece of sheer brilliance since the tender age of five.  Go figure.  I'm sitting on my bed wondering what on earth to do with myself given the fact that I have no finals to study for (not that I would have been studying even if I did), no job to go to, an aching feeling in the back of my eyes that prevents reading, and can barely stifle a dry heave at the thought of watching T.V. on a Sunday night (Simpsons being over and all).  This is all I wish for (free time) during the nine months of school, and now I can't figure out which way to go.  Whatta dork.    I went to visit my friend Dean today, and I've finally found somebody who agrees with my claim that sci-fi paperbacks are men's answer to the romance novel.  Since the fact that he works at a bookstore allowed for such a luxury, he went to the trouble of finding a sci-fi novel and a romance novel that had nearly identical cover art - each with a warrior-looking man holding a heaving-breasted damsel in distress in his arms...or something like that.  Awesome.    I'm trying to prepare for my big train ride out to Colorado, but I can't seem to get motivated.  It probably has something to do with the fact that some of the things I have to do are to go to my storage facility, the bank and the post office...none of which can be done on Sunday (or Memorial Day, for that matter).  So I think tomorrow I'll abuse myself with TLC programming...A Makeover Story, A Dating Story, A Wedding Story, in that order.  Or maybe I'll just take a long long, long long drive, and think about all the reasons why life is wonderful while listening to my groovy new musical gifts.  I'm hoping to wake up with motivation and joy...wish me luck.

      Hmm, trying something new in the form of an online journal.  I was inspired by my friends Murphy and Dean, whose rambling thoughts I have saved to my favorite places and whose sites I visit when I feel like getting out of my own head (for once, dangnabit!).  I thought, at the very least, this could be some summer fun, and a chance for me to be expressive in a way that is more accountable than the likes of my (for-my-eyes-only) journal, and yet less accountable than the for-grade work I turned in to Maio's creative writing class.  I hope you'll enjoy, as well as forgive any spelling and grammatical errors.  I never said I was an English major because I was interested in  that  sort of thing.  I'll try to form nice little bite-sized morsel-like paragraphs for any of those personality types who might be reading this (and you know who you are), but I'm not making any promises.  The sun is shining, I think I'll go splendor in it for awhile.

      What a fun day!!!!  I woke up this morning without a care in the world (despite the fact that I owe a few different credit card companies a whole bunch of money and I still have no job to speak of).  That will probably change soon...I've decided to go back to my old overnight stocking position at Target.  Mindless work is just the way to go sometimes.    It's been a Father/Daughter afternoon.  Pops came home early from work...we were gonna go to some boring banquet for something rather (I was supposed to step in for the Moms, who left for California this morning for a weekend getaway), but I convinced him that we should stay home and watch the Laker game instead (it wasn't too hard), so I'm killing time in anxious anticipation.  We decided to go to Boston Market for dinner (because my Ma has a problem with mass-produced chicken products, and this was our chance to grub on some for a night), and my Dad did this thing there that was SO typical of my Dad, and cute in that way that it can only be when you're no longer in middle school and embarrassed by this sort of thing.  We were ordering, and I ordered this meal that comes with chicken and two sides.  My Dad ordered chicken and  three  sides, and when he saw the plate the guy was gonna put it on, he goes, "when you order three sides are the plates just divided into smaller sections?"  (Pops LOVES food!  :)  He said it in a really serious way, cuz he was, and he sounded just a slight bit upset.  The kid who was shlepping the grub looked confused, and my Dad added, "because they looked like the same sized plate."  The funny thing is that I was thinking the exact same thing, I just don't think I would have said anything about it.  I was asking myself what my Dad was expecting to happen from the exchange (like, the kid couldn't possibly change the size of the plate right then), and then the kid said, "I could give you more of everything," in this way that sounded like he was totally scared.  I forget sometimes that my Dad is a 6'4" 220-pound intimidating figure to those who don't know whatta gentle goof he really is.  So I guess he got what he wanted out of the deal.  The kid rung us up and asked if we wanted drinks in this way like he was expecting my Dad to reach over the counter and grab him by the collar, screaming that "NO, we don't want any damned drinks!!!!!"  But we totally wanted drinks, and we just smiled politely.  Sometimes it's nice to eat with men because they don't mind if you're more interested in your chicken than conversation.  Don't get me wrong, I love talking and joking with my Dad, but it's a very low-pressure sort of relationship.  And to explain the chicken part...I finally realized why I've always liked that "Swingin'" song so much (the one I mentioned about two weeks ago).  It's because of the line where John Anderson says, "Mama's in the kitchen cuttin' chicken up to fry."  When I was a little girl, fried chicked was my favorite food in the whole world.  Every birthday I wanted to go to this restaurant near Anaheim, California called the Big Yellow House.  It was a chicken place made out of this old victorian-style house, and I just LOVED it.  There's a picture of me with a big plate FULL of chicken bones sitting in front of me on my 5th birthday.  Of course, everybody had been using the plate, but it was a funny picture.  Come to think about it, my parents really seemed to dig on that kind of humor.  My Dad used to always fall asleep watching T.V. in the evenings (still does, actually).  One time, he was lying on the floor on his back in the living room, and my Mom took all these Twinkies out of their wrappers and put the wrappers on his chest and all over the floor around him and then took a picture.  It was like he passed out cuz of all the Twinkies or something.  Those wacky Konrads!  So anyway, I think that when I was little and heard the part about the Mama cuttin' up the chicken, I just let my mind wander and imagined that I would get in on some of that.  Cheap cheap, cheap cheap thrills.  Anyway, it's about time for the game, and my Dadio's saving a spot for me on the couch.  Go Lakers!!!

      Mmmm, remember PeeWee's Playhouse?  Of course you do.  Well, I've got a word for the day.  Today's word is........drumroll....... LOVE  (I hope you're all screaming).  Why would I pick such a HUGE little word?  Because I feel like it, and because I'm presently trying to understand some previously misunderstood facets of this HUGE little word.  My thoughts and my desire to understand were prompted by an article I read this afternoon titled, "Is There a Better Way to Love?"  I didn't plan on getting much out of this article, seeing as I glanced ahead and saw that it was only three pages long (what can you say in three pages?!), but I decided to go ahead and give it a chance to change my way of thinking (you can say a lot in three pages).  The article was written by a man who was interviewing the Buddhist teacher Joseph Goldstein, founder if the Insight Meditation Society.  What he has to offer on the subject is the idea that love and attachment are two separate concepts completely, which cannot possibly co-exist.  Goldstein asserts that love is made of a giving energy, and that attachment is based in the act of holding.  He says, "We've been bamboozled into thinking that attachment gives us something, provides some security for love.  But it doesn't enhance love in any way.  How could holding ever enhance giving?  Instead of creating a relationship of beauty, attachment creates a bond of fear."   Ok, this is something that I've been hearing about for years and years, but I can honestly say that it's never sunk in until recently.  I think I finally understand the idea of "if you love something, let it go."  I mean, I understood it in the literal sense...if you love your girlfriend, and she goes far far away for college, but she comes back in four years and wants to be together again, well, then that certaining seems like love (if it's meant to be, it'll come back to you).  The part that I think I hadn't gotten until now, is that this concept is true even if the test is not letting somebody go in the physical sense.  You have to let go even as the person is sitting right beside you.  I am reminded of something that somebody once said to me about love.  They said, "I don't want to be with somebody because I have to, because I don't think I could live without them.  In fact, I want to know that I could live without them, that way I'll know we're together simply because we lift each other up...not because we would sink without each other."  Ok, maybe it wasn't said in that many words, but the sentiment remains unchanged, and I think the statement really coincides with the article.  I want to relax in love.  I don't want to be jealous, scared, or coast through things with my defenses up.  I think that's a BIG part of the problems that people experience in relationships...defenses.  When I say coast, it's because I think that having defenses up keeps people from experiencing the depths of love, it's like coasting over the surface of the water instead of just diving in.  And I mean love in every area.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could just see our loved ones, feel them and what it's like to love and be loved by them, and then just relax instead of trying to control every last little thing?  I think so...I'm gonna try letting go a little bit, see where that takes me.

      Ok, I don't know why I do this...I guess because I like to torture myself...but I watched Politically Incorrect last night.  For anybody who's never seen it, it is a show where four (sometimes qualified) guests join sarcastic and (sometimes) informed Bill Maher for a half hour of debate about politics and current affairs.  Though I hadn't seen the show in a long time, it has stayed true to format, usually devolving into a (s)he-who-shouts-the-loudest competition, with the unimaginative audience going along with whoever that loud person might turn out to be.  Last night, David Crosby (musician now billing himself as "political activist"), and Kennedy (former MTV V-Jay now billing herself as "author") joined a really smart female author from England and some republican strategist who was going bald WAY too early (you decide if the two descriptions of him are in any way related).  Now, it's a shame that I didn't catch the English woman's name, because she was by far the most educated, most articulate, and most sensible person on the show (in my book).  Anyway, there were a few debates that ensued that I wanted to comment on.  First, the topic for the majority of the show was nuclear (or, "nucular," if you're the president) power and what we can do to keep Pakistan and India from acting on their threats to use nuclear power against each other and, in the process, blowing us all to smithereens (Don't you just love that phrase?  What does it MEAN?!).  Anyway, at first I thought that Crosby was gonna be cool, not only because he made really good music once upon a time, but because, after all these years, he still hadn't cut his hippy hair (sound like anybody you know?).  When the subject was transporting America's nuclear waste from the 130 separate sites where it is presently housed to the middle of one big mountain (which I think is in Nevada), he had the sensible answer...he and the British woman both thought it ridiculous, given the accident rate of any moving vehicles on America's roads, and considering the little matter of the mountain resting on, like, 23 different fault lines.  Ok, points there Davy.    Things got horrible, however, when the British woman brought up the idea of peace, and started questioning why the hell we have to go around KILLING each other, in that silly way that women do.  She brought up the 5,000 civilian casualties that we caused in Afghanistan when we decided to flex our muscles and show the Taliban who was boss.  She was troubled by the fact that nobody was talking about this, and hinting at the idea that the U.S. Army was, perhaps, a bit hasty.  My thought, as she was saying this, is that 5,000 is MORE than died in the World Trade Center.  I mean, you can't compare numbers, really, when it comes to innocent human lives lost, but it is shocking to me that it is easy for so many Americans to just blow it off, because, hey, they killed our people FIRST.  Kennedy chimed in with, "oh don't worry, those 5,000 were just orphans and old ladies."  It would have been funny, if it weren't so fucking unfunny.  Of course, in response to the woman's comments, Bill Maher made fun of her and accused her of being idealistic, not to mention unrealistic and, dammit, British.  To my shock and dismay, Crosby was right there with Bill.  He was laughing at the lady and when Bill said, "People say that violence doesn't solve anything, while I'd say that violence solves just about EVERYthing," (with an annoying little smirk on his face), Crosby joined in with, "Yeah, and there is a good kind of violence, which is the kind that we use."  Yeah, I'm sure that's not EXACTLY what those terrorists were thinking when they flew planes into buildings in the name of their faith.  Can't they SEE that it's all violence, no matter what side of the line you're born on and what religion you practice and what you look like and blah blah blah??!!!  At one point, I just got really, really mad.  I thought...men (and I am referring to men, specifically) just keep dreaming up new and more efficient ways of killing each other, and WHY???!!!  Now we not only have our own "enemies" to worry about, but we have to worry about Pakistan and India and their conflicts and the fact that they both have absolutely NO problem dropping the first bomb/launching the first missile, anything you can imagine.  But you know what, as mad as I got, I didn't want to go out and KILL anybody.  I'm going to sound like a male-basher, but that's not it...goodness knows I love men.  I'm not saying that all men are violent and want to solve problems by killing people.  But honestly, how often to women go around harming each other, relatively?  And would we ever  dream  of developing the most deadly weapons that human beings are capable of creating, in order to ensure our place at the head of the proverbial table?  I don't think so.  So what I say to all you weapon-developing men out there is...you got us into this, now you get us out.  Some advice might be needed from the women's camp, so I'm offering this...why don't you try TALKING to each other.  I know you'll say I'm also idealistic.  And I am.

      Mmm, and the Lakers are going to the Championships again.  Knowing this helps me get over the fact that it seems Rick Fox will never grow his beautiful curls back  :(  Oh well.  Nothing too ground-breaking has happened to me today.  I haven't started looking for a job, and I didn't even take a bath until about noon.  I probably wouldn't have gotten dressed at all if it weren't for the fact that I went out to dinner with my parents and an acquaintance of theirs.  Yes yes, I know it's summer and all, but the whole point of me being out here is so that I can make some money and pay of some bills.  Somehow, though, time spent with my Ma sitting on the couch and talking about boys seems so much more important for the time being.  I promise I'll start looking tomorrow.  I was noticing something horrible at dinner.  We went to this restaurant that serves a hunk of bread to each table of people while they're waiting for food.  They serve it with this yummy cinnamon butter that is just awesome but I'm sure you can guess that I haven't gotten to the horrible part yet.  I noticed that all these people were leaving and there was a ton of bread left on the table just waiting to be thrown away.  My friend was mentioning the other day how important bread is in Russia, and how having bread at a meal (or just bread  as  a meal) is a mark of survival.  I'm sure this is true in many parts of the world.  And then here we go, in typical American fashion, just throwing it away.  I know I sound like a Mom..."Starving children in China" and the whole bit.  But you know what?  Sometimes our Moms are just right.

      Aha!  And my wish for mindless and menial work at Target is realized!!!  I'm a happy little clam these days.  Boy, those clams sure ARE happy, aren't they?  I was asked to come in last night at 10:00 for orientation.  It was all going so well...the loss protection lady cut her normal 11/2 presentation down to 10 minutes just because she knows that, moreso than any other shift, overnight workers don't give a CRAP.  Plus, I think she just wanted to get home.  My manager cut back his presentation as well, and the whole thing looked like it would be wrapped up in about two hours.  Then the whole shift went on break, so he made the four of us new-hires go too, and after that they had this cheesy "huddle" thing where everybody gathered and listened to all the new info.  The manager took that opportunity to introduce my cohorts and I to the crowd (about 50 people), made me wave and everything.  I couldn't believe how many people still worked there from before (3 1/2 years ago)!  The difference is that now there are a whole bunch of Hispanic workers there, so all of the things mentioned in the huddle were also translated and the whole thing took twice as long.  It was awesome, though.  I'm so excited about having the chance to speak Spanish everynight.  At one point I had to translate a video about bloodbourne pathogens to the two Spanish-speaking new-hires.  Talk about challenges!  Anyway, after the huddle, I was waiting outside this room to get my ID picture taken, and I heard somebody say "Hi Kisa."  I turned to see this guy named Brian who used to be the manager of the shift when I worked there before, but who now apparently just changes displays or something.  Anyway, the funny thing to note about this guy is that when I worked there before I had the HUGEST crush on him.  It used to drive me crazy, couldn't sleep, all that jazz.  So, like the smarty I am, on my last day, I decided I needed to TELL him about the crush, made a total fool out of myself getting all red-faced and stuff.  He was like, wondering why I chose my last day to mention it, all this...but he never gave me the impression that he returned the feelings.  No big deal, I was about to leave for sunny California!  I got over it.  So now, 3 1/2 years later and the guy has to STILL be working there.  When I saw him yesterday, I was thinking 'what on earth did I ever see in this person?!'  He is one of those people (and as I hinted at before, the majority of the night crew is like this) who just seems to hate life or something.  Super quite, super disillusioned, smoker, plays paintball for kicks, has shaved head - looks like a skin head, has worked at the same job he can't stand for over five years.  Sounds dreamy, right?  Then I realized that he was actually just my type, for the time when I was interested in him.  I don't understand this...I LOVE life, I'm not disillusioned, I hate to sit in corners and scowl and be lazy and I don't fancy the idea of pelting my friends with little balls of paint.  Opposites attract, I guess they say.  But I'm done with all that.  I used to be attracted to the shy boys because I thought they must have some really interesting thoughts going on in their heads.  It took me dating three of them before I realized that they're really NOT thinking anything interesting at all, which is why they aren't saying anything.  Ok, so maybe that's a harsh stereotype.  I'm sure that there are plenty of interesting shy boys out there (I know quite a few interesting shy girls), but I just don't want to date them.  People who wear their emotions on their sleeve...that's what I like.  No guessing, no always wondering if they're REALLY having fun or not.  Yes, I lost interest in the shy boys a while ago.    So now I'm faced with the task of trying to work with somebody whom you used to like, and behaving in a way that makes it clear that you are no longer interested.  Cuz don't you just HATE when you know that somebody thinks that you like them and they're like trying to avoid you and stuff and you want to tell them (or convince them) that you don't really like them but you know that if you do it's gonna seem like you really DO like them?!  That sucks.  The store's pretty big, though, I should have no problem avoiding contact.  So, after that run-in, we had to go back for more training...this STUPID interractive CD-Rom about safety that lasted an entire hour!!!  There was this little robot that you had to make do all this safe stuff like mop up spills, help a guy who had fallen and whose head a huge box of detergent had landed on (picture this in cheesy, primary-colored, low-tech graphics), and put out a fire that some little kid had started in the automotive aisle.  The thing took way too long and was so, so boring and sleep-inducing at 2:00 in the morning.  The best part was when they introduced the codes for the intercom...code yellow = missing child, code red = fire, code green = somebody hurt.  The robot would get on the phone and say three times "code yellow, garden, code yellow, garden, code yellow, garden" in this total robot voice that I decided I'm gonna use if I ever have to make such an announcement.  No influxion, just the robot facts.  Then they'll know just how well I was paying attention during my orientation.  I hate when execs approach techies and ask them to develop interesting training tools about subjects that could never possibly be interesting.  A whole HOUR of that stupid robot!!!!!!!  Anyway, it WAS pretty funny, I got a good kick out of the ridiculousness.  I've gotta get ready for work now.  I promise I won't talk about work all the time...unless something really exciting like a code green happens.

      If any of you readers don't believe that romantic love can last, I would like to offer Exhibit A...My Parents, who are an extraordinary example to the contrary.  Today my parents celebrated their 26th Wedding Anniversary, and I have to say that they are, by far, the most romantic couple I know.  They went out yesterday night because they wanted to go the the Botanical Gardens, which aren't open today, and planned on having a picnic there.  The undying sweetie, my Dad planned for some friends of his to surprise my Mom and asked them to set up a beautiful spread of decadent food and dessert, flowers, and candles, which were waiting for them when they got there.  They spent three hours in the gardens, sitting among the flowers and talking.  And that is the thing that is amazing to me about my parents...after 26 years, they never run out of things to talk about.  My Mom has told me that sometimes they will go to bed, but before they know it, it's like 2:00 in the morning and they're still awake, talking to each other.  As I mentioned, my Mom was out of town last weekend.  On the second day she was gone, I noticed a little pad of paper sitting on the kitchen counter that had my Dad's handwriting on it.  I started reading down what seemed like a list of the day's events, and I figured out that he was keeping a list of things he wanted to remember to tell my Mom about when she called that night.  I teased him about it, and he said it was true...he wanted her to know everything, didn't want to leave anything out.  How cute is THAT???!!!!  My parents still hold hands when they walk around the mall or go to outdoor festivals.  My Dad still opens car doors for my Mom.  They are there in support of each other whenever one of them gets involved in a project or organization that is important to them.  They still listen attentively to each other and laugh in all the funny places when one of them is telling a story to a new acquaintance....even though they've each heard each others' stories hundreds of times before.  My parents still sneak a card in the suitcase, when one of them is going out of town.  My Mom still sports a smile at my Dad's corny jokes (mostly), and my Dad loves nothing more than to watch my Mom when she's laughing so hard she's about to pee.  They are each others' best friends, and they call each other four times a day while they're apart.  When I've reached uninspiring places in past relationships, I used to try to tell myself that that was just the normal progression...that love fades and that sooner or later, people get realistic.  My parents just keep on shattering this self-lie for me.  Don't get me wrong...it's not like they haven't had challenges in their marriage.  The difference is that they saw them as just that...not endings, but new opportunities for their love to grow.  They are each others' biggest fans, each others' eternal support and intimate friendship.  When they look at each other, there is still a spark in their eyes.  My parents have taught me many, many things over the years.  The most important thing they've taught me, however, is about love, because they know how to be in love better than anybody I've ever known, and I thank them for it.  Happy Anniversary, Ma and Pa.

      Mmmm...peeing into cups.  What a strange thing.  Actually, the peeing into the cup part is not the weird thing.  It's the carrying the cup out of the bathroom, handing it to someone else, and watching them pour it into a smaller cup that is kind of goofy.    I had to take a drug test to work at Target.  Can you believe that?  I didn't have to do that when I worked as the stranger danger talk girl, going into different elementary and middle schools everyday, left to  influence youth !!!!.  But Target, evidentally, is real concerned.  Oh well, it's kind of a nice feeling to take a test that you already KNOW you're gonna pass...kind of reassuring.  They'll get the results in a couple of days, and then I'll have my old, manual labor job back.  Lifting and climbing and opening and stocking and throwing stuff down from high places from 10:00pm to 6:00am.  I can't think of any sort of work I'd rather be doing right now.  I have made a startling and disturbing discovery during my time here, and that is that COLORADO DRIVERS ARE THE  WORST  DRIVERS EVER!!!!!!  First I thought that Arizona drivers were bad...and they were, especially the ones in golf carts.  Then I thought Cleveland drivers were bad...and they were, nobody could cut you off and then slow down with greater skill than they could.  But Colorado drivers, it's like they have all the horrible elements rolled into one.  They are slow, but that's okay by me...I'm not usually in a hurry to get anywhere.  They do the cutting-off-slowing-down thing.  Yeah, that's bad.  They have no clue how to merge, and THAT is really annoying.  But the worst part is the red-light running.  I swear it happens at every single stop light, every single time.  It occurred to me the other day, that the reason they do this is because they can.  I haven't seen a police car in the entire two weeks that I've been here, and that is just so WEIRD for somebody coming from San Jose.  It lends weight to the theory that people will do what they can get away with.  And that's incredibly depressing to me because I hate that theory!!!  I always wanted to believe that people do what's right because it's the right thing to do, not because they are afraid of the fallout it they DON'T do it.  Poopie poopie!!!  People from other parts of the country are horrified by California drivers (which I think comes mainly from the fact that California drivers drive so  fast  )  It is my contention, however, that while California drivers are assholes, they are  considerate  assholes, if that makes any sense.  I mean, they will cut you off, yes they will.  But California drivers KNOW how to cut you off.  They pull in front of you and then they get the hell out of Dodge.  And they DEFINITELY are the best mergers I have seen in all my travels.  Plus, they can parallel park, they signal with more frequency than others (believe it or not), and they hardly ever dare to drive in the carpool lane unless they are qualified to do so.  My parents say that it's getting worse out here, and I hope it doesn't continue on that trend, but only time will tell.  All the wildfires are still burning, and the skies are still pretty yucky-looking, but apparently the winds are working in the favor of the fire fighters now.  They discovered that the largest fire (which is only 5% contained!) was started by an illegal campfire.  That is really hard to even think about, so I won't.  Anyway, aside from peeing in cups, bad drivers, and uncontrollable wildfires, things are peachy keen here in Colorado.  I'm employed, I'm well-rested, I'm in the company of my sweet little dog and my swell parents, and I STILL have all my limbs!!!!!  I'm really excited about that last one.

      Last night I dreamed I was babysitting Nicole's baby.  For any of you who don't know Nicole, she's my best friend (whom I've know since eigth grade), and she's really, really pregnant.  It was a cool dream, complete with the sensation of holding the baby against my shoulder, and the smell of baby head.  In my dream, the baby was really chubby, which was surprising because Nicole is tiny, and I don't think the baby will be heavier than six pounds in real life.  Anyway, it was SO awesome, and I can't wait to be an Aunt!!!  Today's kind of a sad day in Colorado.  It seems that half the state is ablaze, and sooty clouds of air have moved in over the entire valley (referred to as the "Front Range), which makes it seem like a giant storm is brewing.  It doesn't help that everything is making me want to cry today.  I'm not sure why that is, I think I just miss the daily human interraction I left behind in San Jose.  I know it's good for me to get away and do some soul-searching, but it's just not really my style, makes me feel naked and abandoned.  The good news, however, is that I went for a drive yesterday and found a beautiful park with a view of mountains and jutting rocks just perfect for figuring your life out among.  I walked along the trails and sat down for a while and just watched and listened.  Have you ever just sat, closed your eyes, and tried to pick out every single separate sound that you could hear?  It's incredibly meditative.  I had a nice, relaxing run of it until I opened my eyes and realized that the entire ground around my booty was moving.  Ants in my sandals and on my feet, I decided to get up and walk again.  If any of you want to come visit me in Colorado, I'll take you there (with a blanket).  You will not be disappointed.  Yesterday my Dad rented a Harley and went out riding with some of his friends from work.  When he got back he and I went for our own ride, and man oh man, it made me miss riding!!  This morning we went out again, and as we were about to take this little curve, my Dad broke harder than was necessary for what seemed like no reason whatsoever, and we headed into the curve really slowly.  As we were rounding the curve, a HUGE-ass dog walked into the road, and my Dad had to go into the other lane to avoid hitting it.  When we were pulling away, he said, "I don't know why I broke like that, I guess I just sensed something."  More proof for my theory that riding motorcycles puts one in-touch with their intuition.  It's something about the open air that gets your mind wandering into all these places that you didn't even know existed, and you are all of a sudden the smartest person you know.  I was riding on the back of my ex-boyfriend's bike when it occurred to me that he was a lying meanie.  I was on the back of his bike when I realized that he was cheating on me.  And I was riding a bike that I myself had rented when I figured out who he was cheating on me with.  I guess, in a way, I sensed a big-ass dog of my own.  But anyway, riding is like that.  Riding around in the hills yesterday made me think of the trip that he and I took out here (from San Jose) a few years ago.  Thinking about it now, I can't believe we made it all this way.  His starter broke in Yosemite (the very first day) and from there on out we were parking on hills and push-starting it, and leaving the engine running when we got gas.  Now, ex-boyfriend was not a big fan of anything that detracted from the sleak and powerful look of his Fat Boy.  So a back-rest was not happening, and a nice, cushy, comfortable seat for me was out of the question.  I ended up riding all the way out here on what looked like 1/6 of a tire, and it was about as soft.  On the last day, about 30 miles away from our final destination, we pulled off the road in the Rockies for a little break.  We parked on a hill, but I guess we didn't park up high enough, or else the bike was just SICK and tired of going, because it would NOT start.  We pushed and pushed and I don't know if you've ever tried to push-start a Harley on flat ground, but let me tell you it was HARD, and I started to cry after it didn't start on the 7th attempt.  Characteristic of ex-boyfriend, he chose to yell at me rather than sympathize.  He said, "What are you doing crying?!  Crying is not going to get it started!!!!" (in a thick, German accent).  He had a point, and his lack of TLC pissed me off...so much so that I put my everything into that last push, and the thing finally kicked up.  I'm sure, now, that he did it on purpose (pissed me off), and it worked.  All in all, though, I wouldn't have minded sitting on the side of the road and pouting a bit.  I had earned the right, had never complained once about my swollen ass and the fact that I was just TIRED of riding behind his big, stupid head.  Sorry, I just had to get that out.    So anyway, the bike has been returned, and I've decided that I want to buy one some day.  What an incredible thing...to have the wind all around you and to be able to smell all the smells and  feel  the curves of the road.  If you've never ridden (even on the back), you should give it a try.  Somehow, in some way, it's like being connected with nature, and we could all use a little more of that (especially us San Jose residents).  And just to clarify, part of what's making me want to cry about everything today has nothing to do with being sad.  Do you ever want to cry because everything is just so  beautiful ?  If not, then I'm sure that sounds weird, but I think that everybody I know could identify with this feeling.  Because I still haven't been officially hired anywhere and have a lot of time on my hands, I was watching A Baby Story on T.V. earlier today.  I don't normally watch that show as I am years away from wanting a baby of my own, and in that state of mind, all the babies on the show come out looking the same.  Today was different, though.  When the featured Mama's baby came out and the doctor handed him to her, she kept saying, "Oh, my beautiful baby, oh my beautiful baby, thank you God, thank you God."  It was the 'thank you God' that got me, got me all choked-up and watery-eyed, thinking about what an amazing thing it really is.  And what a gift.  In that way, I envy Nicole.  Her body is doing the most incredible thing the human body can do...creating new life...a WHOLE NEW LIFE - where there was NOTHING before.  It blows my mind, and she is going to be a great, great mother.  I can only hope to know that kind of miracle some day.

      I WAS planning on sitting down to try to re-write my entry from the other night, but that's all gone now.  Basically, I had been talking about how strange it was for me to realize that all my co-workers are married with children, even though most of them are about my age.  Then I was talking about divorce and blah blah blah.  I want to talk about something different now, but relationships all the same.  I got a letter from a friend today in which he was mentioning that women are basically phonie balonies when they say that they want sensitive men.  He was pointing out that he is a sensitive man and good listener, to boot, but that women (possibly as a result of those qualities in him) end up thinking about him in strictly friendship terms.  He has decided to treat women the way they say they don't want to be treated, and see how far that gets him (I'm thinking and hoping that last part was said kind of tongue-in-cheek).  Now, I have to say that I am no exception to the women-go-for-assholes phenomenon.  I can't explain this, I have no idea where it comes from and why we do it.  Hmm, but that's not really true because I know it has a lot to do with self-esteem.  I guess our choices in men are reflections of how we view ourselves and what we think we deserve.  So my advice to my friend would be to seek out women who have a stronger sense of self.  They are the ones who will appreciate his finer points.  I'd like to think that I'm past going for jerky boys.  I mean, right now I wouldn't dream of dating another one, which I think has to do with me having grown up and seen enough to know what will make me happy in the long run.  Time will tell.  The other part of this is that I think the jerky men (and women) are all about low self-esteem as well.  It takes a strong person to be able to be with an AMAZING person and still feel like you are okay, or that you are deserving of that person.  So it makes sense that those with serious self-doubts will choose to put-down the people that they are in relationships with.  As long as you are able to keep them doubting themselves, they will be afraid to leave you.  So I think that those with a stronger sense of self will automatically want to be with somebody who helps them to shine, rather than blocks their light from escaping.   And in this area I know I'm getting better.  I want to glow, dangnabbit!  This is my rather simplistic take on things, but it's as much as I know about all this (or as much as I feel like writing about it anyway).  I only know cool people (aren't all people cool?), so it's my hope that all my friends will end up with people who appreciate them and treat them like the cool people that they are.  Life is SO SO SO SO short.  No need to waste it with people who bring us down...we are better off alone.

      ARRRRRGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I just spent an entire hour writing, and then my connection was lost and it ALL went away!!!!!!!!!  It was brilliant, too.  :)  This is why I still write snail-mail.  Dammit!!!  I'll try to reconstuct it when I regain my foolish sense of false security in technology.

      Golly Gee, it's been awhile!  I think I've grown scared of writing in this thing after The Incident (when my everything got erased).  I'm like the kid who just discovered that hot stoves hurt...I'll never have quite the same level of confidence.  But here goes....  I want to talk about music.  I need some help.  Part of my job at Target is to stock all the music and movies and books that come in.  I'm realizing that there are A LOT of movies that I haven't seen, but that doesn't bother me so much because most of them look pretty stupid and I can't  believe  the things that people will spend 16 bucks for the DVD version of.  But anyway, this was supposed to be about music.  I'm also noticing that there are a lots of bands and artists out now that I've never heard of, which I know is my fault for not listening to the radio or watching Mtv.  The radio part is due to the fact that I can't handle any radio stations because of the repetition of crappy songs and the million commercials. The Mtv thing is basically the same...I mean, do they even show videos anymore?  Anytime I flip past it's like the Real World 56 or a bunch of people dancing on the beach to some lame somebody rather on stage.  Sooooo, the other night I turned on Mtv and there was show on called "Spankin' New," on which they show videos of the latest artists or an old artist's latest album.  I thought 'cool' because I figured I would get to hear a lot of those people whose CD's I'm stocking everynight and wondering who the hell they are.  And I was right.  I saw videos from Ashanti, B2B, Our Lady Peace, Dirty Vegas, Paulina Rubio, I don't know, a bunch of other groups that I can't remember.  And the reason I can't remember them is that they ALL SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't believe the kind of stuff that gets serious air-play.  I know at least 7 musicians in my own private life that write better music, I seriously can't believe it.  So, the part about me needing help is where I ask you readers to send me some good recommendations.  I'm definitely out of the loop since I can't seem to move past U2 and R.E.M and Tori Amos...you know the tried and true.  I think the most recent artists I've been into were Coldplay, India.Arie and Badly Drawn Boy - and they're not even recent anymore.  I mean, I know there's good new stuff out there, I just don't know where to find it, cuz it ain't happenin' at Target.  Even if it's an old artists that you think I might like....please help me!!!!  My e-mail address is  scoobisnac2000@yahoo.com .  I would LOVE to hear from you!!!!!  And there's another thing that kind of bothered me.  In the hour and a half or so that I was watching Mtv, there was only one song that I thought interesting and, I don't know, is catchy too dorky of a word?  And guess what it was!!  Freakin' Eminem (Ahhhhhhh!!!).  Some song called "Without Me" where he talks about how awesome he is and how the controversy he causes on Mtv is what keeps it interesting and how everyone's just bored to tears without him and all this stuff.  Ok, so it wasn't ground-breaking or anything.  I agree with him about how controversy keeps things interesting, and it's hard to disagree with him that he says that he's just trying to be himself and that people want to censor him and everything.  I guess I just can't dig on his causes.  I mean, homophobic misogyny just isn't my thing, you dig?  So I guess it bothered me that I could dig his song.  I mean, don't you hate it when you can't stand a person's politics but you like their art?  I feel like I'm betraying myself or something.  And I'm wrestling, too, with how I feel about his politics.  I mean, it's obvious that I don't agree with him, but if I just go around disliking him and talking smack about him, aren't I just as bad as, say, the religious right, who I wish would just chill out and let people live?  I think I'm asking for help in this area, too.  I think it's an interesting discussion and I would love to hear what other people have to say about it.  So write to me!

      Ok, first I just want to thank everybody who has responded to my plea...I will be publishing the responses soon, but they are still trickling in so I want to hold off a little.  Music....what amazing power it holds!!!!  I had happiest day since I got here yesterday because I finally got out and listened to some live music.  There is an eight-week long jazz thing here in the summers and every Sunday night they have a different group playing for an hour and a half on the bank of this little lake in a park downtown.  I knew that going would put me in the right frame of mind for the whole week, so I made my way down there.  Now, as I'm sure many of you know, few things can enhance the live musical experience like a little somethin' somethin' to wet the whistle.  So I made a stop at the grocery store before I went.  I sold out, though, because, as I was a young girl there by myself, I felt too goofy to bring a 40 ounce like I would have liked :), and ended up with the more socially acceptable Bartles and Jaymes Hard Raspberry Lemonade.  I know, I never expected to see the words "Bartles and Jaymes" and "hard" on the same label, either.  It was for the best that I drank mild wine-coolers, though, because I had to go to work after the concert last night.  So, Hard Raspberry Lemonade and stationary in-hand, I made my way down to the lake.  The Sunday evening concerts seem to be a place for jazz afficionados to have a listen, and young non-jazz afficionados to see and be seen...the mix is interesting, and everybody brings food and makes a picnic of the whole thing.  So, walking to find a spot, I was letting myself enjoy all the smells that were changing and mixing as I made my way along the cement path...barbeque....cigarette smoke....pachouli (?)....and I found a spot right by the lake.  There were families on rented paddle boats coming around to listen, dogs and kids running around everywhere, and loners like myself taking it all in.  The kids were so freakin' cute - a bunch of them jumped onto the steps near the large gazebo that was serving as the stage, and they were moving and shaking in that free and spaztic way that only kids are smart enough to know is not only okay, but a pretty good to spend an evening.  I watched this one little girl wander onto another family's blanket and ask them for a piece of the chicken they were eating...only little kids (about four years old) can pull that sort of thing off.  They complied, and the girl made a wry little face when she took a bite and discovered it was spicy.  She just grabbed her little pink water bottle and wandered around with chicken in one hand and water in the other...and she was very happy.  That's the other thing about children---they really know how to adjust.  So, just as I suspected, the majestic peacefullness of the jazz made me happy and ready for work...live music should be a part of my daily experience.

      Mmmmm, menial jobs.  You know how when you go to the grocery store (especially if you go early in the morning), the cans and boxes are all lined up and you can tell that some poor soul actually spent their time pulling all that stuff forward for the asthetic pleasure of you the shopper?  Well that's me...some poor soul.  Yesterday morning I got my first taste of "zoning," and lemme tell YOU...what a rockin' good time THAT was!!!!!  Did I mention that the Target I work at has a grocery store attached to it?  As I was sitting on this little milk crate stacking the tuna, the soup, the olives, and hosts of products I have never heard of before and certainly would never have noticed if I hadn't been meticulously stacking them on top of one another, I was thinking that I can't believe that they pay people to do this.  And all because some marketing person somewhere along the line did some kind of survey and declared that people will buy more if they perceive, I don't know, AMAZING selection, cleanliness, FULL SHELVES.  I've thought about this.  I mean, I know a nice and clean store makes for a pleasurable shopping experience, but sometimes I think I'd be more likely to buy something if it seemed like they were almost out of it, like there was a run on it or something so I'd better get it while it's hot.  You dig?  The other thing I was marvelling at last night was wondering how big a kick marketing execs must get out of the fact that we, lemming Americans that we are, will pretty much buy whatever they tell us to buy.  I know this is true.  I stock the books every night, and I notice that the majority of the books that have to be replenished are the paperback bestsellers that are on an endcap for the world to see.  C'mon, you can't think of ANY other book to buy than the latest soft porn from Nora Roberts?!  Actually, I don't even know if there's sex in her books, so please don't write me horrible letters if she's one of your favorite authors and I have it all wrong.  Also, there's that DVD thing that I mentioned before.  Every single day we run low on the supply of about 50 copies of "Black Hawk Down" on display.  Was is THAT much fun watching the American soldiers blow away the evil enemy?  And someone, I don't know who, has been buying "Shallow Hal" on DVD.  Yes, it's true.  The store I work in is absolutely HUGE.  I heard last night that it is the 6th most profitable Target in the country.  I was walking around there last night, stocking an insane selection of back-to-school supplies, when I thought about the fact that I don't have any of the 100,000,000 things for sale there (back-to-school section and beyond).  Seriously, I know I have a trash can from Target that they still sell there, and there are definitely SOME CD's there that I have, but other than that there's nothing.  More importantly, I don't  need  any of that stuff!!!!  And neither do you!  From now on I'm spending my money on rent, school, food, CD's, and traveling.  I'll buy some new (used) clothes every now and then, but I certainly don't need a new,  better  set of tweezers, a mini-paper shredder for my desktop, a police officer-shaped cookie jar that tells me to step away from the cookies when I lift his head, or a little hamster that twirls num-chucks while singing "Everybody Was Kung-Fu Fighting."  Okay, so maybe I do need that last one.  One must be free to indulge ONCE in awhile.  My friend Murphy has a blog that contemplates art, economic systems, authors, the cycle of life, and all things beautiful and ugly in the world.  I contemplate canned tuna and singing hamsters.    I can't WAIT for school to start again!!!!!!!

      Ok, I think I'm about to risk sounding preachy, but I've got important stuff to say, so please read up!!  :)  I don't know how many of you have these sorts of days, or how many of you would believe that I have these sorts of days...but yesterday was one of those days....those days where you feel like the worst person that ever lived and that you have nothing good to offer and that you should just forget about it cuz it's too hard.  Ever feel like that?  I went through a year-long period just like that when I was about 18.  Now I only get that feeling every once in a great while, and I know more now than I did then, so it doesn't last long.  But anyway, all I wanted to offer about that is this...when you feel that way, please just go to bed with the hope that the next day, or the day after that or the day after that, it will feel better.  Because eventually it will.    About six months after I had finally climbed out of my depression, I took a trip to Mexico with three good gal friends.  It wasn't really a vacation, we were there to help out where we could with what was a somewhat dangerous situation in Chiapas, but even at that we experienced all the amazing things (and more) that one does when they take an extended vacation.  I have a vivid memory of riding on a rickety old bus back from a little village, sitting next to kids and old people and chickens, looking out the window and crying a cry of absolute joy.  I was thinking how happy I was that I never gave up on life, back when things seemed so very unbearable.  18 months is a long time to wait for a sign that there is still more to be experienced, more worth hanging around for, but it was well worth it.  Last night wasn't nearly so dramatic.  I just went to bed feeling sad, and woke up feeling happy.  I know it's not always that simple or instantaneous (for any of you who have ever been through a depression), but it's a cycle all the same.  Things will ALWAYS get better.  There are ALWAYS things worth living for.  I know I sound really serious, and I suppose I am.  But I'm calm.  This is one of those things that I just know, and I want to share.  I also want to advise everyone not to run from the rain, the next time it's raining.  I spent the afternoon outside in a hailstorm yesterday, and it made me feel young and free and like there were things I've been missing out on that I don't want to miss out on anymore.  "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may..." I have to repeat this again.  Life is SOOOOO short.  Please go out there and enjoy it, and please invite me along if you think of something incredible, even if it's just a sunset.

      Ok!  The new music issue has finally arrived.  Thank you to everyone who responded.  As for those of you who didn't, I'll just assume you're listening to O-Town :)  I was disappointed to find that a lot of people feel the way that I do - that music that's out now is just not that good.  I have REAL faith that there is good music out there, I'm just gonna have to go to alternative sources to find it.  I mean, that's where all the good EVERYthing usually is, anyway, right?  I will definitely mention anything ground-breaking that I run into here on this journal.  In the meantime, here are the responses, in the order in which they were received :)   Personally I think music out now sucks.  If I ever turn the radio on,  I find myself listening to 91.1.  The jazz station.  Why?  Because they express themselves through the music.  Not by what they say but what they do on the instruments.  I love it.  I like to turn 91.1 up when there is a car next to me "bumpin tight ass shit foo" rap, pop, and so called rock.   This is from Richard, or Meatball, as I prefer to call him.  I couldn't agree more about the jazz, which is why I'm coming back to San Jo in time for the jazz festival (Aug 9-11).  Be there or be square.  I was telling him that, as far as jazz musicians expressing themselves though the music, I find jazz to be some of the most organic sound available for that reason.  How talented, to be able to say something without saying a word!   I wish I could help you out with your search for new music but I still consider bands like Counting Crows, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam to be the new wave.  I guess Karl agrees with me about tried and true.  Counting Crows just released a new album, by the way, for those of you who also dig them.       My contribution to current music would be David Gray and Dar Williams.  Oh yeah..Linkin Park is pretty cool..It's fun to hear someone screaming again...And the lyrics are quite intelligent. Nelly Furtado is awesome.  This is from Murphy, whose super smart, funny, and entertaining online journal inspired me to start my own.  David Gray....mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  Good stuff.  Anyone else out there familiar with Dar Williams?  My curiosity has been piqued.     Don't feel bad about being out of the music loop. I keep up with much of what's out, but find it all so uninspiring that I don't take it very serious nor spend my hard earned money buying it.  Though a few things I've picked up of late our India Arie (which you mentioned) Bilal and of course Maxwell.  Most everything else I listen to is older things that Steve has given me like Santana, The Doors, The Cure, and Hendrix.   This quote is from Paul "Pablo Honey" (Steve is his roommate).  I haven't listened to Bilal or Maxwell, but I'll give 'em a whirl.  As for Santana, The Doors, The Cure and Hendrix...well, yeah....of course.  :)    WAR - Mos Def- A Tribe Called Quest- Method Man- more Bob marley- Jill Scott- Lauryn Hill- Ella Fitzgerald- Billie Holiday- Common- Ani DiFranco- The Roots- Black Eyed Peas- Nina Simone- Erykah Badu- and don't forget who told you about India Arie!!!    All these wonderful suggestions are from Freeda, who yes, I have to declare, introduced me to India Arie and made my life that much happier!!  There are definitely some great artists on this list.  I have to check out Mos Def, Common, The Roots and Black Eyed Peas, but I can speak for the rest and second her on her suggestions.   Patty Griffin is a gem, as is Jennifer Knapp. I listen to a lot more Christian music these days, as it's hard for me--like you--to actually see the artistic merit in a lot of new bands. I still listen to mostly U2, Counting Crows, Dylan (who's in concert at my school in August!!!), Taylor, my man Paul Simon (who played here last year!!!), Morrison, REM (although I can't seem to chill to anything other than Automatic), DM Band on occassion and Pearl Jam (who will always be cool). Of course, there's Leonard Cohen and Louis Armstrong. I like newer people like David Gray somewhat, and Shakira's song, "Underneath Your Clothes" is really sweet.  In high School, Renee and I used to bump down the streets of Phoenix in her 1982 BMW blasting The Pixies and REM.  Mmmm, sweet memories.  I have to reinforce her U2, Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen references.  That's Van Morrison and James Taylor, by the way, if you were wondering.  And as for REM, please do check out the Monster album (it grows on you) and my personal favorite, New Adventures in Hi-Fi.  Well, kids, that's it.  If you think of anything else, let me know.  My brother was just out here, and he had Wilco with him, who my friend JD also introduced me to, along with Jack Johnson.  Both come highly recommended.  I also forgot to mention Beta Band and Mary J. Blige, and JD and I have decided that Norah Jones deserves some further listening.  As for my brother's visit...it was awesome, as usual.  I didn't write that whole time because I was trying not to be such a computer junkie while he was here.  It's so hard though, not to become addicted to technology.  Just as long as I never get a cell phone I think I will be okay.  Oh!!!  That reminds me.  My family and I went to that jazz in the park again on Sunday, which was just as rad as last week, with a Dixieland band this time.  The kids were shakin' it again, along with this old and *clearly altered* man with a cane and a little duffel bag that seemed to REALLY be enjoying himself.  He was just moving non-stop, and then he would hold this cell phone up to his ear while he was dancing (though it was obvious that he wasn't really talking on the phone).  We were all watching him and digging him for awhile, and my bro said, "I'm jealous of his moves."  And I said that I was jealous he got so many phone calls.  Sometimes, I seriously think it would be fun to be a crackhead.  I'm all for alternate perceptions of reality, and nobody else in that park was feeling as free to physically enjoy the music.  I'm kidding, of course, about the crack part.  But I do wish more people were so unihibited (starting with me).  I know this song is kind of cheesy, but LeeAnn Womack's "I hope you dance" has a really good message.  Next week I'm getting out there and get my groove on with that guy!

      It occurs to me that, if I think about it, I can't really think of anything that I do as a routine.  The most I can say for myself along those lines is that I brush my teeth everyday.  Other than that I can think of nothing that I do daily or even weekly, or that I've done as a habit over a period of time...which is why I am so intrigued by and appreciative of the creatures of habit in the world.    Three and a half years ago, when I was working at Target the first time, there was man that I worked with (actually, I didn't really work with him...he and this other man (neither of whom I ever heard uttering a single word) worked sort of independently, changing displays and signs and stuff like that).  Every single night....I mean EVERY SINGLE night, he wore this american flag handkerchief around his head.  This was before american flags as clothing were  ALL THE RAGE .  Every night...same handkerchief tied in the same way around his seemingly dirty and certainly unkempt hair.  Hey, guess who's still working there are still wearing that SAME american flag?!  Yes!!!!!!!!!!  It looks a little more war-torn, and little more faded, but the same handkerchief nonetheless.  I find myself wondering about this man with some degree of frequency.  I know he's married, and I wonder what his wife thinks about it.  I wonder if it really is the same one or if he has a whole drawer-full.  I wonder if he will ever wake up and just want something different.  One morning I had just passed this man in an aisle and I started wondering about him, as usual.  It was after 8 o'clock in the morning, so there were already customers in the store, and I was walking through the toys section.  I walked by the hot wheels aisle and was nearly stopped in my tracks.  Another creature of habit from my previous Target life!!!!!!!  The last time I worked there the store used to open at 7 instead of 8.  We used to get the biggest kick every morning watching for the Hotwheel Men.  Every morning at 7 o'clock sharp, the doors would open and in would rush a group of five men walking, no trotting together toward the hot wheels.  They were collectors, and they came everyday looking for brand new cars.  This group of men was entertaining to watch...not only because of the seeming ridiculousness of their task, but because of the dedication and seriousness of purpose with which they carried it out.  They were always in such a hurry, and I even saw them run sometimes to get there faster.  And the thing I could never understand was who it was they were trying to beat there.  They were the only ones looking at the hotwheels, and they were all friends, or connected in some way by this hotwheel thing...so were they racing  each other  there?  The other funny thing with these men them was the physical look about them....a motley crew of people that you would NEVER put together in a group of people if you had a thousand tries.  And it was my favorite man that I saw the other morning - a super tall and super thin African-American man with Wranglers, cowboys boots and a cowboy hat....still....same outfit, same aisle, looking for new hotwheels.  I LOVE these people.  I think the world needs these kinds of people.  They are the ones who notice when things are out of order, who keep things in-check.  Hotwheel man and his cohorts keep thousands of people gainfully employed - designing, producing, packaging, transporting, stocking and selling hotwheels.  Seriously, where would the world be without people like that?    I think I could take a lesson from these people.  I mean, I don't ever want to get all weird about my routines and feel like I will have serious problems if something doesn't go EXACTLY LIKE IT ALWAYS HAS.  (You should have seen the looks on the Hotwheel Mens' faces one day during Christmas when we were just plain OUT of them.  They looked at each other with puzzled expressions and didn't know what to do with themselves.)  But that said, I've always admired people who had things that were that important to them...exercizing, gardening, playing the guitar, I don't know, things like that that they love to do and feel a little bit off about if they can't do them for some reason.  I try new things, try new hobbies and stuff like that, but nothing seems to stick.  I've always felt a little bit lacking about that...like I lack passion about the things I like to do because, obviously, I don't like to do them THAT much because often sooner than later, I stop doing them altogether.  To be honest, I'm surprised I've been doing this journal thing as long as I have (I know, two months doesn't seem like a lot to most people, but believe me, it's the sort of thing I would normally have quit doing by now...so it's actually good to know that people are reading it, it inspires me), and I worry a bit about waking up one morning and not caring about writing in it anymore.  I feel like I want to work on not letting things go so easily, not being so quick to move onto the next thing...in some way, if I can do that, it will feel like I've grown up a bit.  It is said that Geminis get bored easily, and I don't know if it's a Gemini thing or not, but I am certainly easily bored.  And I just think that's lame.  There is nothing so uninteresting that it doesn't warrant a little effort and attention.  I guess only time will tell.  I want to be a creature of habit...just one, just one really good habit that brings me joy and makes people look at me funny :)  I'll keep you up-to-date.

      I have a new person to love!!!!!!  My best friend Nicole just had her baby, and life looks more beautiful than ever.  A tiny little girl, 6 pounds and 3 ounces...I can't WAIT to meet her!!!  It was funny, I mean, I've never been in this situation before - where somebody I've known since adolesence makes that huge leap into the next phase of life, and I didn't know how it would affect my outlook.  I heard somebody at work the other day saying that having a baby makes you look at EVERYthing differently and I imagine that's true, cuz this baby isn't even mine and I feel that way.  When I talked to Nicole I couldn't help it, I started crying because I felt joy and amazement and admiration and excitement all at the same time.  I just still can't get over the fact that her and Raul made an ALL NEW PERSON!!!!!  I know I mentioned this in an earlier journal, but I feel like I can't say it enough or articulately enough to really express how I feel about the whole thing.  My best friend......a Mom....the most important job in all the world (next to being a Dad, of course).  I already love the little tyke and I have yet to see a picture.  I could hear her making little baby sounds in the background while we were talking.  Apparently she was asleep but was just sending out little signals or yawning or something, I don't know but it was cute.   As I was driving to work the night that I found out about the baby, I was still in a state of awe.  Listening to Van Morrison's "Moondance" CD just brought out the intensity of emotions..."She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love."  I was thinking of the song in reference to my new honorary niece.  I know kids do that for their parents (and all the people that love them, actually).  They just really know about love and unbridled joy and wonder and telling people what you really think and saying stuff that makes you laugh so hard when they're not even trying to be funny.  Crazy love.  I want to send out my sincerest congratulations to the new parents!!!!!!  Auntie Kisa can't wait to spoil her rotten!!!!!  :)

      Ahem.  I saw something interesting tonight.  I was waiting at a red light when I witnessed four grown men standing on the street corner, holding signs that said "Stop Immigration!!!!"  One of the signs said "Help us take back OUR country" on the bottom, and another of the signs said "Non-whites are RUINING our land!!!!!!!!"  Okay, I know I don't even really need to go into this any further....all the thoughts that ran through my head, all the questions I had for them, of all the ridiculous things!!!!  But I found something interesting in my reaction to these men.  I was baffled, a bit speechless (imagine that) and awestruck, but the one thing I didn't feel was anger.  I felt it just briefly, but it didn't stay with me like it would have in the past.  In the past I would have let the incident eat away at me until it reached the very core of my soul and maybe I'd get sick to my stomach or something.  Tonight, I just thought "huh."    I wonder what Malcolm X would have to say about that.  I know that anger was the driving force behind a lot of important social change that has transpired over the past couple of centuries (or millenia).  Anger has served its purpose to an extent, and it will continue to, I just don't know if I want to live with it, personally.  I've been reading a lot over the past couple of days about a graduate program in psychology that has sparked my interest and that came to mind while I was gauging my reaction to these men.  The program is called Contemplative Psychotherapy, and it is offered at a Buddhist school here in Boulder.  All the programs at this (1,000 student) school are rooted in Buddhist idealogy (including their writing program, which was founded by Allen Ginsberg and is called the "Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics"), and meditation is a part of graduate studies every single semester.  What interests me about this program is that it lends a spiritual hand to otherwise cold and clinical western psychology, and its participants are encouraged to find peace and presence in the moment in their own lives, as a way to understand people and the world around them.  There is so much to it that it's hard to describe it all right now, but there were a few things that I was reading about in some of the program's literature that I thought were interesting, and which are giving me a different perspective on people and their (sometimes unfathomable) behavior.    One Buddhist monk (Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche) is describing his first experiences with the western world (in England) and how he reconciled them with his eastern background.  He writes, "Buddhist psychology is based on the notion that human beings are fundamentally good.  Their most basic qualities are positive ones:  openness, intelligence, and warmth....Coming from a tradition that stresses human goodness, it was something of a shock for me to encounter the Western tradition of Original Sin.  When I was at Oxford University, I studied Western religions and philoshical traditions with interest, and found the notion of original sin quite pervasive."  In this particular case, the Rinpoche was talking about how the idea applies to western psychology, which sets up the hierarchical arrangement of sick patient and healthy doctor.  The sick patient has done something wrong and the doctor is trying to "fix" the problem.  The Buddhist idea is that people are fundamentally healthy by nature, and that through various forms of meditation, etc. people can find their way back to health, having temporarily departed from it (the reasons for this departure are not considered unimportant, but regression therapy and things like this would never be the focal point in this kind of therapy).    I know it seems I've gotten off the subject, and I probably have, but please indulge me.  I often think about how we are products (to an extent) of our environment.  Sometimes I look at guests of, say, the Jerry Springer Show and think how I shouldn't judge them because their experience could easily have been mine, had I been born where they were born, into families, financial, social, or educational situations like theirs.  Even saying that sounds like a sort of judgement to me.  It's hard to think of different without considering words like "better" or "preferrable," you know what I mean?  Anyway, the Buddhist idea of inherent goodness, rather than guilt as a result of the actions of Adam and Eve and those that crucified Jesus, fits well with my outlook on things.  These men on the street corner...they are not evil (is there really such a thing?).  They just feel cheated out of the things they really wanted in their lives, and they are looking for something to blame their disappointments on.    Another central tenet of Buddhist theology is compassion.  I like that.  I think we can accomplish a lot more in the world by using compassion, than anger and war.  I know there are MILLIONS of people out there that would disagree with me (they would say that Osama bin Laden is evil, Hitler, Rush Limbaugh, etc. and that they should be destroyed), but I just can't let go of the idea that peace is possible, when people look at the world with loving eyes.  We spend so much time blaming.  So much time feeling guilty, judging and being judged....looking around at other people and wondering why, damnit, they couldn't just be and act more like US!!!!!  What a waste of time.  What a lonely and depressing way to pass a lifetime.  I mean, those men could have been spending a nice, quiet evening at home with their families playing Scrabble or something.  Instead they're standing on a street corner feeling livid and inciting anger in others.  And think about all the anger.  They riled up the people that agree with them, and pissed off those that don't.  One thing I can say for them....they made people think, and I've decided once and for all that thinking is a good thing :)  Ahhh.  Breathe deep.  On a lighter note...I got a great little bit of trivia from my friend JD the other day.  It seems that there is a Walt Whitman Mall (yes, I said Mall) in Long Island!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have to quote him here..."In Long Island there is a WALT WHITMAN MALL!!!! If that don't beat all huh?? I can just see that planning meeting.... "What can we think of that will make people want to buy stuff?? I know... Walt Whitman hated materialism so why not name the epitome of materialism after him!!!  And we will call it Walt Whitman Mall!!" (picture the guy moving his hand in an arch with that far-off look in his eye)"  Awesome.  Here's a site:   http://www.shopsimon.com/smt/servlet/SMTMall?mid=106&pn=ENTRY&rs=0    :)  Peace and love and joy to you all.

      Ha, so speaking of things that I don't stick to doing!  I know, I've been far far away for a long long time.  But I haven't just been sleeping, if that counts for anything.  I've been thinking...just not sharing.  It started the weekend that my new niece came into the world.  I don't remember ever having felt that sense of wonder in my adult life.  Few things came close in my childhood or adolescence either, come to think of it.  The idea that Nicole offered an entire person as a contribution to the world continues to blow my mind.  But the following week I got the news that the brother of an old friend had passed away - the very same day.  The same day that one family and circle of friends was experiencing unparalleled joy, another family and circle of friends began to feel the profundity of loss.  Was it one soul making room for another?  I don't know how to explain these things.  Chad, who passed away, was close to my age, and he passed away as a result of a number of medical complications that came from having become partially paralized in an accident years ago.  His brother Marc was telling me about the funeral service, which was attended by hundreds of people.  From everything I've heard, Chad had an incredible lust for life before the accident, which left him in a state of depression that he never really recovered from.  I met him after his accident, and I remember him as a charasmatic and gentle soul, but Marc has told me over the years that something was missing after the accident and it never really returned.  I wonder what it was that Chad came to understand at the moment of his passing.  I know that he (possibly unknowingly) taught all the people around him about living, which is a beautiful gift.  But why him?  I think he probably had that thought a lot in his quiet moments...why him?    Sometimes I am amazed at the depth of suffering that the human spirit can endure.  I can't imagine what it was like for Chad's parents to bury their son, for his brother and sister to say goodbye to him and know that their lives would never, ever be the same.  I guess life really is a series of waves - waves of joy, sadness, wonder, loss, love, fear, beauty.........big, undulating waves that bring us to the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.  It reminds me of that scene at the end of the movie "Parenthood," where the grandma says something about roller coasters...she's making a life analogy, but Steve Martin is not in the mood and he makes some sarcastic comment, to which his wife (Mary Steenberger) answers, "I happen to like the roller coaster."  It's like Joni Mitchell's song "The Circle Game":  "And the seasons, they go round and round and the painted ponies go up and down, we're captive on the carousel of time..."  It's like Khalil Gibran wrote in "The Prophet":  "When you weep, know that you are weeping for that which has been your delight."  It is only in the greatest of joys that we can know the worst of sorrows.  Arrivals and Departures.  Round and round and up and down.

      Packed, mentally and (almost) emotionally detached from Colorado, ready to come home.  I'll be on the train as of 9:00 tomorrow morning, that's about 11 hours away, and I am quietly content.  The beginning of the rest of my life awaits me...I can't wait to get started......

      Apparently I'm not the only one exploring the world of Buddhist thought...and I'm glad to hear it.  My intelligent friend and neighbor Paul has reminded me that, along with compassion and a basic belief in inherent good, Buddhist idealogy emphasizes patience.  I hope he won't mind if I include his own words..."I think more than just compassion though we also need patience (another tenet of Buddhist thought).  We are all in such a hurry to change the world that we sometimes forget that it takes time for others to grasp the meaning of what were talking about or even allow them to explain why they are the way they are.  Rather than be patient and allow people to adjust over time we become frustrated and immediately discount their abilities to change.  What then happens is these people feel misunderstood, frustrated themselves, and then angry which is then projected onto those that have tried to help.  Having the best intentions, however lacking the necessary patience, those who wish to help end up causing more strife."    It's a thoughtful, important and interesting point.  I was thinking about what he said about letting others have the chance to explain themselves.  It occurred to me that - so often - when we ask questions of people who we know think and act really differently from ourselves, we aren't truly interested in the answers.  We ask loaded questions and, beyond even anticipating the responses, we go as far as to be thinking ahead to OUR responses to their responses.  Headway will never be made in this fashion.  For a spirit of change to really take hold, we need to ask questions and then be open to hearing the responses...really HEARING them,  listening  to them.  That is my challenge for myself.  My radiant and articulate friend Laurie also had some thoughts on the subject (with the Psych degree to back them up)...."Their [the Buddhist school's] take on Western Psychology (actually, through my cross-cultural studies, Ive found that 99% of all psychology is STILL Western, actually, mostly AMERICAN WESTERN, and change is happening, but quite slow) is right on the mark, which is why most people dont like going to see a shrink, since we look to them to control and fix us, as opposed to sitting next to us and guiding us."  Guides...isn't that what we all want?  Spiritual guides and human mentors...I mean, we ALL have something left to learn (some of us have lots and lots and LOTS to learn, starting with myself, of course).  Soooo much more yet to be figured out...never stop wondering, never stop learning.  I learned something about myself the other day - a very important something.  I went out to breakfast with a few co-workers the other morning, after work.  This was a goodbye sort of breakfast as it was one of my last nights at work and the friends that were there wouldn't be working on my actual last night.  So, as I was pulling away from the parking lot, after a few hugs and the exchange of some "ahh, I like you, I'm gonna miss you" sentiments(only in Spanish), I found that I was crying.  Like, I really WAS gonna miss these people.  I know it's only been two months, but you can make some nice connections in two months...there are many, many warm and amazing people out there.  And here's what I learned about myself:  I'm  tired  of moving on.  I used to feel like I had turned my heart off.  I was so used to moving around the country and starting and quitting jobs and stuff, that I became de-sensitized to loss.  I didn't miss people.  I mean, I did from time to time, and there are people that I've chosen to keep in touch with over the years, but I didn't let the emotion really take hold in me, didn't feel the pain of it.   I think that's horrible.  I think it shows a lack of understanding of human value and the importance of meaningful relationships (friendships and otherwise).  I'm not like that anymore.  The older I get, the more it hurts...just planting little seeds, sending down little baby roots, and then ripping everything up and moving on.  I'm ready to settle in some more, which is partly why I can't wait to get back to San Jose.  I've finally let myself call a place home, and been there long enough to where I can run into people I know walking down the street downtown.  While I do want to come out to Colorado for graduate school eventually, I know it's gonna be really hard to leave San Jose (I can hear the snickers of all you people who have wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of Dodge, but I've been a lot of places, and I can say that, for me, San Jose holds a unique kind of charm, despite its urban sprawl and techie MADNESS).  No more uprooting all the time.  At some point, moving on is nothing more than just empty searching (for me at least).  In the past, I've prided myself on not being afraid of change.  But is being afraid of NOT changing any better?  I feel like the proverbial bachelor...afraid to commit.  I'm not talking about relationships here, but that thing I mentioned before - fear of sticking with something and seeing where it can take me, which includes just STAYING PUT for a little while!!!!  We'll see where this road leads....

      Sometimes I have moments during which I have the distinct feeling that I could love the entire world.  Im not talking about a hippie kind of were-all-connected-I-have-love-in-my-heart-for-everybody thing (although I mean that, too).  I mean that I think I could fall in love with every single person I meet.  How to explain this?  I know its probably sounding like a drug-induced sort of feeling, but its not.  Its actually usually a music-induced thinglive music in particular.  I remember watching all the listeners and dancers at the Salsa stage during the jazz festival a few weeks ago and thinking to myself that this was the most beautiful group of individuals that had ever been gathered in one place.  The thing is that its the most beautiful group of people EVERY SINGLE TIME, no matter who the people are, what kind of music it is, or where its all taking place.  So, that said, I think it must have to do with the joy to be found in watching people let go and allow themselves the pleasure of abandon (Let your mind go and your body will follow).  I was trying to describe the feeling to my friend while we watched the salsa dancers.  Its like the music and the dancing reaches a sort of fevered frenzy, and when I look around it seems that every movement, every smile, the little beads of sweat forming on the surface of somebodys sun-browned arm  its all frozen in time  little snapshots of euphoria, and theres me standing or dancing nearby, trying to soak it all in and remember every single detail for future reference.    Its at those moments when all I can see are awe-inspiring scenes everywhere, in every direction I turn:  that man has eyes a color that strikes me to my very soul.  the way that woman moves in her hip-hugging skirt and midriff top makes me feel like, if I touched her (even just accidentally brushed against her briefly), I would melt at her feet.  Thoughts like these go through me head, and I find myself wishing against all hope that the music would never end and that there were, indeed, time enough in one persons life to love everybody up close.  I want to hear all their stories.  I want to know them all and touch them all and be invited to their families houses for Thanksgiving.  I want to read their diaries and look at their bookshelves and ask them all about their third grade teachers.  I want to know what theyre most afraid of, and if its something of this world I want to go out and conquer it with them.  Sky diving?  Lets go next Saturdaywell have em drop us somewhere over the Salinas Valley and well see the amazing hills that Steinbeck spoke of, only as birds do, instead of humans.  I think this all sounds kind of selfishme here, wanting it all.  But its just that there is so much to love out there, and what seems like an unfair amount of time in which to love it.  If the universal waitress asked me what I was having, I'd answer that I wanted seven courses of life and an extra side of childhood (for good measure), plus a glass full of water from the Fountain of Youth to drink.  Somehow, though, I know I'd still be hungry.

      What is with these overcast mornings?  I feel like I'm living in L.A. again.  And that's a bad, bad feeling.  Not really.  I actually feel pretty good, which I think is partially due to the fact that I returned to old stomping grounds last night...Cafecito's Open Mic...the grooviest place to be on a Monday or Thursday night.  For anybody who doesn't live in San Jose or hasn't been to this place, I'll break it down.  There are two different house bands that play at these open mics (both jazzy/funky), and they play in-between hearing from various musicians and poets (and sometimes freestyle hip-hop artists), all of whom are very talented.  It used to be free, but most of the people there are students and I think they weren't buying any coffee or something because now it costs two dollars, but it is well worth the money.  Going there is definitely a natural high (and necessarily, too...they don't sell alcohol, which is beautiful, because you get to see how amazing and expressive people can be all by themselves - without anything helping them reach another state of consciousness but their own talents).  The performers are all very socially conscious and have so much positive energy to share that it always contagious.  I'd been away from there all summer (obviously), but I also didn't make it all last semester because in my mind I was too busy.  But that's bullshit.  I could have made it if I would have just made the effort.  And I pledge to this semester, because I think that if I don't allow myself that sort of outlet, I'm gonna go crazy.  I just mapped out my schedule like a high school freshman because, between six classes and seven 1 1/2 hour sections of tutoring in the school's writing center (my new job), I know I'm gonna have a hard time remembering where I'm supposed to be at any given time.  I feel it...I can actually feel the freedom dripping out of me :)  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh......................................

      Okay, so the last time I started doing this I experienced one of those horrible computer-crashing-out-of-nowhere things and lost it all (again!), but I'm trying my luck now because I wore a summery dress today in order to make the sun come out from behind ugly grey clouds out and it worked, so I figure I'm magic today and magic people don't have computer crashes (do they?).    It's been roughly a week and a half since I returned to San Jose and I'm oh so happy to be back!  I realized I missed ALL of it...all of the lovely, as well as the yucky (including, but not limited to:  endless passing of cars all night right outside my window, many of them with thumping bass, pigeons (which I don't think exist in Colorado) and the ridiculousness of signs reading things like "Historic House Moving" as a euphemism for the mayor's heartless uprooting of really old houses with long-time residents in order to make room for the new city hall which will ensure his legacy).  Yes, the city is a beautiful thing - as was the Jazz Festival (Salsa Stage, most especially), and the GREAT show I saw the other night at Plant 51 - an Ozomatli-esque group of fine, talented young men who call themselves the B-Side Players.  But there was business to take care of, too.  I got a job in the writing center at school, which sounds like it will be challenging, and challenging is good.  However, beyond the job, three weeks worth of laundry to contend with today, and the business of hanging out lazily in coffee shops catching up with friends, I've been exquisitely, thankfully, and pleasantly idle.    One can never be quite so idle without feeling a slight bit of guilt (if the "one" is me, anyway), so I decided I had to get some good reading in before school starts and I have to read what THEY tell me to read.  I decided to start with Camus' "The Stranger," which had shamefully sat unnoticed on my bookshelf for who knows how long.  You know how you grow up your whole life hearing about books and movies that are supposed to be the Be All End All of books or movies....and then you finally get the chance to watch, say "Gone with the Wind" and you're all, "Wha?" "What the hell is so great about THIS movie, book, etc.?!"  You know what that's like?    Well, "The Stranger" is nothing like that.    This is a book that has earned its place on the imaginery list of must-read books that might not necessarily be in THE CANON, per se, but everyone knows that you're supposed to have read them (The Canon, what a bunch of phony-balonieness that is, by the way).  For any of you who haven't read it, this book is said to epitomize existential philosophy and all that jazz.  I would normally be opposed to a work of fiction that attempts to present such a huge philosophical or spiritual idea ("The Celestine Prophecy" drove me nuts for that reason!) because if it's something as important as a philosophy about life, I'd prefer for authors to just come out and say what they mean, you dig?  But this is the exception, and I'm not sure why, maybe just because it's so well-written.    Check this out: (the speaker is getting used to his new life of incarceration after having committed a murder) "Afterwards my only thoughts were those of a prisoner.  I waited for the daily walk, which I took in the courtyard, or for a visit from my lawyer.  The rest of the time I managed pretty well.  At the time, I often thought that if I had had to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but look up at the sky flowering overhead, little by little I would have gotten used to it.  I would have waited for birds to fly by or clouds to mingle, just as here I waited to see my lawyer's ties [the lawyer wears ugly neckties] and just as, in another world, I used to wait patiently until Saturday to hold Marie's body in my arms."  I love that passage.  Anyway, what's interesting about the story is that the plight of poor Meursault (the story's main character) is presented in such a way that you can hardly blame him for his actions (for which he is ultimately sentenced to death), and you find yourself thinking like an existentialist (sympathizer, at the very least).  In reading, I could see how society was constantly trying to impose a morality on the character based on the (unproven) idea that there is a god and that life holds some kind of deep meaning (if only in-reference to an afterlife).  It's interesting, really.  Meursault was only being honest, and yet nobody would believe that he put his mother in a nursing home or was able to kick up an affair with a woman the day after his mother's death, simply because he felt they no longer had anything to say to each other (he and his mother) and that he was ready to move on in his life.  Only evil people behave with such utter absence of humanity, so they said.    I would like to think that I would have given young Meursault the benefit of the doubt, if I had known him in real life.  But I knew a man just like that once, only he was named George, and really, I just thought George was an asshole.  I would like to have the chance to know George now, though, because I would like to think that I could let him live his life and think in his way and not internalize everthing (which is usually what the problem is - internalizing - when people can't just let others live and have their opinions without taking issue with everything).  And not that I advocate rampant murder or anything, but there are degrees of personal freedom, free of judgement, that I think humans should be entitled to.  Yeah, so, reading.  That's been good.  I've since nuzzled up with Kerouac's "Big Sur" for the second time around...if only for the pure pleasure of reading frenzied words put together in the strangest and yet most satisfying of ways.    One more week until school starts...I'm trying to soak it all in and slowly savor it...lick, instead of bite my way to the center of the Tootsie Roll Pop.

      Ok, so I just wrote a half hour's worth of my continuing adventures, and it all went away--disappeared into the netherworlds of cyberia.     Poopie Poopie.  I'll do it again soon, but I don't have the wherewithal right now, so I'll just give a brief summary:  Still in Rome.  Saw the Collosseum  Saw Vatican City  (mmm, saw Michaelangelo's "Pieta," which made me cry)  Saw a free concert of Two Tenors outside the Collosseum last night, which will be aired on PBS later this month  Leaving today, destination yet-to-be-determined  Am the happiest girl in the whole world :)  I wish you all well on the homefront!

      Where to start?  At the beginning...  One of the last things I said to my friends at the bus station in San Jose was that I was tired and hoped I didn't end up sitting next to a "talker."  Well, in perfect universal irony, the young man who sat next to me pulled out a little device on which he typed a message to me: "Hi, I'm Nick.  I hope it's okay that I sit here.  I'm deaf...have you ever used one of these devices [referring to the thing he was using to type]?"  I should have been more specific; should have said "communicator," but all in all it was good.  We talked on that thing, and two hours later, I made an attempt at sleep, but it seems I can't sleep on moving vehicles these days.  So I spent a few days with my brother in Hollywood, which was great.  Last Friday night he was honored on the field at Dodger Stadium for his perfect usher attendance (and his dashing good looks).  I arrived roughly 8 seconds too late to see his 30-foot mug displayed on the Diamond Vision screen, but it was cool all the same.    After a few days of playing with him and his Super Cool group of friends, I set out for my adventure.  Sunday night: no sleep on an overnight flight to New York.  Monday: eleven hours wandering in midtown Manhattan.  Nice.  Monday night: no sleep on an overnight flight to Rome.    First lesson in Italian men: don't trust Italian men who warn you about Italian men.  I was talking to this man while waiting to board.  He lives in San Diego and was returing to Rome to visit his parents.  Well, that was his story anyway.  He was warning me about the men here (I'm writing from Rome) and how they will tell you anything and blah blah blah.  As we boarded, he was telling me about the perfume he bought for his mother.  A few minutes later, he brought up the perfume again (one called 'Paris'), and when I told him that I didn't know anything about perfume, he said, verbatim, " I don't usually buy the new one, but sometime my wife, I mean, no my wife, my mother...she like to..."  I didn't hear the rest because I had walked away at that point.  When somebody lies to you within the first 4 and a half minutes of meeting, I figure it's a good idea to move on.  So.  Rome.  This morning I thought I lost my purse first thing upon arriving.  I was ready (sleep-deprived and a little nervous anyway) to pack up and head home.  Turns out I left it on the plane.    So I'm staying then :)  It's true about the Vespas...those and other kinds of scooters are everywhere.  It's pretty charming.   It's true about the Italian men, though I haven't found them particularly threatening or anything.  And Rome is just teeming with handsome fellas.  But then I've always liked the dark, curly-haired types anyway.  I had a long non-conversation with an elderly German man outside a cafe over my first cafe latte (which was everything I dreamed--the latte, not the non-conversation).  Lesson learned (I don't speak German and he didn't speak English, Spanish, or French...neither of us speak Italian): European phrasebook is next to useless.  Now, it's time to get some sleep.  I'm curious about the hotel in which I'm staying.  It's called "Bed and Breakfast" (the hostels were full).  The man showed me the room and told me about the keys and the bathroom, and when he was fixin' to leave, I asked him how to go about breakfast.  His reply was "Oh...we don't serve breakfast; it's just called "Bed and Breakfast."  I repeated:  "You're called "Bed and Breakfast" but you don't serve breakfast?!", which he answered with an apologetic shrug and a promise to bring me some coffee and juice in the morning.  At this point I'm sort of wondering if it really is a hotel at all :)  As far as I can tell, mine is the only room there.  Hmmm.  In summary, so far, so good.  But Rome is expensive.  I think I'll be leaving for some quieter, less touristy realms tomorrow.  Hope everything is great on the homefront.

      Last I wrote I had just been to the Collosseum and Vatican City.  Three things I can say about those places:    1) Breathtaking (seriously, I haven't breathed in like 5 days).   2) Big (really really really big).   3) Germans!  (Soooooo many Germans).  I'm summarizing of course.  I'll just have to share the pictures and tales in detail when I get home.  Where is home, anyway?  I was thinking about this.  I have no place to live, no job, nothing tying me to anywhere.  Maybe I'll flip a coin and pick a city when I get back to the States.  But anyway, back to Italy...  I was gonna scrap my plans to see Malta the day I left Rome, but then I got an e-mail from my friend Nick, who was down there, so I decided to check it out.    Well, that was the easy part.    First, I decided to buy a train ticket to Reggio di Calabria, in the very south of Italy.  It seemed like a port city and was about as close to Malta as I could get.  There were many trains leaving, but most of them arrived late at night.  So I decided to take an overnight train and get there in the morning.  Leaving me with 10 hours more in Rome.  Oh, but first things first---I couldn't use my ATM Visa card at the train station.  Turns out there was a fraud alert placed on it.  Apparently a sudden 2-Euro purchase at a grocery store in Rome causes some alarm.  So I got that straightened out first.  I ran into a tourist office employee named Amadeo, who offered to show me some more sights.  I'm pretty sure this was not part of his job; I suspect he may have been hitting on me under the guise of "helpful tourist office employee," but he wasn't imposing or shifty or anything.  So I took a crazy busride with him to the Fountain at Trevi, The Spanish Steps, a charming little square called Campo di Fiori, and the Pantheon.    I really don't think I can describe accurately how enchanting it felt to be amidst so much history.  So, so, so beautiful.  Like I said, we'll have to talk over a slide show in the future.  But right across from the Pantheon, in the same little square, sits a McDonald's.  Sick.  Really sick.  But I peaked in at the menu and saw a colorful picture of a salad with ripe red  Roma tomatoes and chunks of Mozzarella cheese on it.  When in Rome...I guess.  Amadeo (along with every guidebook I'd consulted) warned me not to fall asleep on the train if I wanted to have my luggage in the morning.  Ok.  I lucked out an ended up in a car with 4 natives of Reggio di Calabria--one young girl, one crazy old man (I'm not just saying that--even the other Italians exchanged "this old guy is crazy" looks.  I had to pay close attention to these things because I was now entering the region of Italian-only speakers--body language is everything.  That and cherades.), and one young married couple.  None of them seemed eager to rob anybody, and I was sitting far from the passageway (where the thieves roam, I suppose), so I felt safe.    The young married couple was in a fight all night, though, which made me a little sad and uncomfortable.  See, it wasn't a vocal, let's-have-it-out-and-be-done-with-it fight.  I mean, it couldn't be: there were four other people in the room.  It was a slow, quiet, awkward, man-touches-knee-of-woman (apologizing and speaking in hushed tones), woman-gives-man-the-cold-shoulder-and-faces-the-window, man-gets-up-and-paces, woman-pretends-she's-asleep, man-comes-back-to-seat-and-tries-again, woman-gives-the-evil-eye, etc., etc. kind of fight.  They were friends again by the time we stepped off the train, but still, I was feeling for both of them for the first 6 hours of the ride.  So then.  7:00 a.m.  Saturday.  Reggio di Calabria.  I asked a woman at the train station how to get to Malta (figuring people there must go to Malta all the time), and she sold me another train ticket.  I figured this train must go to the port (the ticket was only 1Euro).    I was wrong.  When I figured out I was wrong (luckily, before I actually boarded the train--turns out there's a very nearby town called Malta), I asked her how people get to Malta, the country.  She referred me to the travel agency.    Closed.  It was Saturday--who would be traveling or making plans to travel on a Saturday?  Lesson 1 regarding the south of Italy.   But Reggio was quiet and wonderful, so I wouldn't have minded staying at all.  I did want to get to the port, though, just to know what my options were.  And here's where it gets interesting...  I found the bus to the port, which looks nothing like the kind of port where anything other that huge containers of things would be shipped from.  I certainly didn't see any family members waiting around to greet arriving passengers.  It was something like Long Beach Harbor, but smaller.  There I was referred to a dim, dingy little office where the man in charge of "Sea Malta" was sitting, smoking a cigar.  I know, it sounds like a movie, but this whole sequence felt that way for me, so it's fitting.  He told me that "Sea Malta" was a cargo ship, and that I could maybe take it to Malta, but that the priority passengers were Maltese truck drivers and the space was limited.  Don't freak out, Ma.  I promise it all turned out well.  He said to come back at 1:00 in the afternoon to find out if there was room for me.  The other option was to take a passenger ship the next day that arrived in Malta at 2 in the morning.  Whatta dilemma!  I spent a few hours roaming around and trying to communicate with the incredibly friendly people of Reggio di Calabria.  Then back to the port.  The man said that there was room, and he took my 55 Euros (roughly 75 dollars or so), along with my passport.  He made a copy of the passport, but when I asked for it back, he said I'd get it back later.  I squinted and thought about it, and when no female intuition alarms went off, I said "ok," and left.  The boat was leaving at 7, and he said to be back by 5.  So I went back into town and drank some sort of coconut drink, wrote a quick e-mail to Nick, and went back to the port.    At 3:30 I went back to the office, which was then closed.  I wasn't that surprise, since he had told me to go directly to the ship, but this was a crucial sort of moment.    Here I was, walking along this port with my big backpack, sweating like a madwoman.  These were my thoughts:  Random American girl, really out-of-place in a quiet cargo port. Extreme south of Italy. Speaks no Italian. Gave a stranger her passport and 55 Euros. Trusts that the man really does have something to do with this ship. Trusts the ship really is going to Malta that evening. Trusts they'll let her on the ship. Trusts nothing bad will happen to her on the ship. Trusts she'll get her passport back.  Needless to say, I felt a little apprehensive.  When I got to the ship, there were nothing but men standing around all over the place.  They looked at me like I was a leprechaun.  I suppose I seemed a little out-of-place to them, too.  I picked the one who looked closest to my age and asked him what to do (hand motioned, really) if I was supposed to take that ship.  He pointed to the steps and told me to get aboard.    "Okaaaaay.  Grazie." (Said, turning slowly toward the ship with raised eyebrow)  Imagine my relief when, walking up the rickety steps, I noticed a 40's-something blonde woman on board.  I spoke to her and her husband, and all my fears dissolved instantly.  She was from Sweden and her husband from Malta, and their 18-year-old son was there, too.  She said they take the boat all the time, and that it's very safe and I'd have my own sleeper room with a lock and the use of a shower, dinner provided, and breakfast in the morning.  It was all true.    There were only 3 actual truckers on board, and they were the friendliest people I'd met so far.  We all (the truckers and the family and I) had dinner together (pasta, the best food I'd eaten since I arrived), drank wine, and told stories (they all spoke English--English is one of the two official languages of Malta), and I had the soundest sleep I'd had in a week.  It was a random, rare, and beautiful experience.    The Mediterranean, glowing under the light of a near-full moon--just imagine.    And it turns out they needed to hold onto the passport for the Maltese customs agents to have a gander at when we arrived.  So, like I said... Hi.  I'm in Malta.  And more on Malta later.  For now I'll just say that everybody should try to make it here at some point.  It's a gem of a place, and a pretty well-kept secret (except from the Germans--they seem to have found out about it :)    I'm off to collect my laundry, and then to the beach.  Greetings to all my friends and family.  I miss and love you all.  And I'm still the happiest girl in the world :)

      Hi.  I'm in Malta.  I had to say it like that because reporting this news reminds me of that scene in Wayne's World where Wayne and Garth are playing with the blue screen: "Hi..I'm in New York.  I've got a gun, let's go to a Broadway show."  Then they're in Texas and I think Hawaii and, all of a sudden, Delaware.  And Wayne says, "Hi.  I'm in Delware."  Now, I'm not saying it reminds me of that because Malta is boring or anything (quite the contrary--it's amazing), but just because who knows anything about Malta?  Really, I mean, I didn't know anything about it before...Maltese falcon?  Maltese is a kind of dog?  What else?  I was talking to somebody here who used to play on Malta's national futbol team, and he said that when the team was playing in New York, the chant that the U.S. fans liked was "Where the hell is Malta?!"  Anyway, I'll get back to Malta later...first, some back-tracking.  I'm going to post this first, though, just to be safe.

      As promised, I would like to invite you into the world of the Savoy Guesthouse.  First, a bit about the house itself.  There are three floors and something like 14 rooms.  My room is on the second floor, where it's warm, but not as warm as the third floor, so I lucked out.  There is a little rooftop terrrace where I can go at night and look at the stars above or the people below.  I can also hear, for example, the sounds of neighbors' domestic disputes, and a strange little bird warble I've never heard before.  I've yet to see the actual bird, and I think it's more interesting that way.  My room has tile flooring, a double bed, and a window that overlooks a busy street, where there's a crosswalk just perfect for getting killed while crossing (the crosswalk is right at a curve in the street, where cars come a-flyin').  Mine is also one of the few rooms with its own shower, for which I sacrificed having a kitchenette.  The kitchenette would have been nice, but I've been grateful for the shower since I realized that a pervy old male resident named Tony likes to check out (up close and personally) the laundry of the women who use the rooftop clothesline; washing and drying my clothes in my private shower has afforded a nice alternative.  There is a common room where people watch T.V.... about 6 channels in Italian, 2 or 3 in Maltese, and one sometimes showing American series (series'? serieses?) in English.    The plumbing, due to the building's age, is, um, a bit of a gamble.  Everytime I flush and the toilet actually works, I feel like I've won the lottery.  Also due to this temperamental plumbing, I never know exactly what I'm going to find in the toilet, courtesy of the last visitor, who may not have been so lucky with the plumbing lottery.  I've had a few frights in this situation, unable to  imagine  what said non-flusher might have consumed or imbibed the night before to have produced what was left in the toilet for me to find.  The window in my room is best left open at night (as the afternoon sun makes my room pretty stuffy in the late afternoon), but leaving it open means letting in the mosquitos, and I have a very bad relationship with mosquitos.  Last week, after declaring an all-out war with one particularly robust pest, I witnessed the emergence of my alter-ego, which was quite disturbing.  See, I don't usually kill bugs.  I'm more one for ushering them out, or ignoring them.  But you know, with mosquitos it's an "us or them" sort of thing--"eat [or "kill" in this case] or be eaten."  So I chose "kill."  Now, this mosquito had an admirably determined will to live; I had thought I killed it twice, when I saw it land on my bedspread, on my leg.  I was just about to turn the light out and go to sleep, so I knew that this was the Moment of Truth.  He would have had his way with me all night long.  So I moved my hand slowly toward him and threw my hand down in a quick and violent SLAP!!  Then (and this is where my dark side exposed itself) I actually uttered the words...  "YES!!!  DIE, M@therf*cker!!!"  Mygoonus!  Then, in what I'm sure was my universal lesson for the day, I became aware of a warm and throbbing pain coming from my leg.  See, I had forgotten, in my focusing on KILLING, that I had a fresh sunburn, and I had struck my leg hard enough to keep me awake with the sore, radiating effects of the slap for another 25 minutes.  Tisk, tisk, tisk.  We'll work on ushering the little buggers out from now on, eh?  But anyway, enough about my room and my evening death-related activities.  I want to introduce you to the players...the Savoy Guesthouse Horror Picture Show.  I use "Horror" in jest.  There is nothing terrible about my fellow residents (well, most of them, anyway), but they are indeed interesting.  First, I'll start with the house Mamas--two sisters who run the place and who keep everyone reasonably in-line.  The first is Josephine, a buxom sort of Mother Hen with a wicked dry sense of humor.  It took my a while to plug into this humor, and a few times I really thought she was upset with me.  For example, the other day I was talking with my friend in the common room, and I turned the T.V. off because nobody was watching it (or so I thought).  Josephine emerged from her little office, where she had been talking on the phone, and said, "WHO turned off my T.V.?!!!!"  I said, "Oh, I'm sorry.  I did.  I didn't think anybody was watching it."  She replied with, "Well,  I  was watching it."  Then, looking directly at me with raised eyebrow, she said, "It was an AMERICAN film," and walked off in a huff.  A couple minutes later I realized she was joking when my friend pointed out that she had actually been watching the news.  But despite her sometimes ambiguous comments, she is clearly a caring woman who always remembers to give messages, never goes snooping through rooms, always remembers to bring a fresh towel, and likes to ask about the plans you may have mentioned having for the previous evening..."How was the jazz?"..."Did you have fun on the island of Gozo?"  Her sister, Lina, is a bit more military-like in nature and is less likely to chew the fat.  In the afternoons, she sits watching T.V. with her boyfriend Charles, a red-faced Maltese man who's been living in San Bruno, California for 44 years or so.  He comes to visit her every summer and watch T.V.  They are both cordial and pleasant enough, though definitely more distant than Josephine.  I would never refer to Lina as a "Mother Hen."  But both sisters stir up a mean carafe of instant coffee in the mornings--my choice meal after I fast grew tired of the standard breakfast fare...corn flakes and milk, orange juice, and bread with marmalade.  I bought my own wheat bisquit sort of things (called "digestives"(?)) and usually have a few of those as well.  Incidentally, I wanted to say a bit about the milk here in Malta because I promise it's unlike anything you've ever experienced.  Okay, you know how thick all-fat, Vitamin D milk is in the States?  Well multiply that by two, at least.  The milk here crawls down your throat at a pace that might make you feel like gagging, or chasing it with something like cranberry juice to clear the canals.  But if it's cold enough (which is rare), it can be especially satisfying and take the place of a three-course meal.  But we were talking about the residents...  There's Iris, a young Chinese student studying English here.  She has a wonderfully soft and most melodic voice, and when I told her this, she said that she'd studied voice (as in, singing) in China and had trained her voice to be that way.  Cool.  I asked if she would mind giving me a little concert sometime, which she answered with the words, "Yes, I will sing to make you feel happy."  Isn't that awesome?  There are two other young Chinese students who are also studying English but are loathe to actually speak it.  The only conversation I had with one of them concerned American movies and basketball, during which the young man (Da) declared his favorites to be "Bread PEE" (Brad Pitt), "SUHdra Block" (Sandra Bullock), and "SHUH-cle OH null" (Shaquille O'Neal).  Please understand I'm not making fun of his accent, just trying to give an idea of why I had to strain and stretch my ears in my desire to have a conversation with him.  He was nice, but I fear the fact that the two share a room and never leave the guesthouse is keeping them from learning much English while they're here.  Da told me that they must pass Standard English exams next month in order to be admitted to the University of Malta.  Hmmm.  Oh, one other thing he told me was that, growing up in China, one of the few American series he saw was "Growing Pains."  It took a while to determine this was the show he was talking about, finally becoming clear when he mentioned a 'Michael' who was always getting into trouble.  Turns out Da's dad had always wanted a son more interesting, less shy than Da himself, and continually asked Da why he couldn't have been more like Michael from "Growing Pains" and at least do something  interesting  once in a while.  That broke my heart.  There's an Egyptian man named Mario who brews beer in his room and wears a near-constant scowl on his face.  The only time he ever spoke to me, the conversation went like this:   Me : Hello  Mario : Hello [ heading up the stairs and then retreating to add to this initial response ].  Are you Jewish?  Me : Me? [ a line from "The Princess Bride" coming to mind: "Do you always begin conversations this way?"  ]  Mario : Yes, are you Jewish?  Me : Do you mean religion or race?  Mario : Religion  Me : No  Mario : But your parents, are  they  Jewish?  Me : No, I was raised Catholic  Mario : Hmm. [turning, without another word, toward his room]  So.  That's Mario, as far as I know him.  There's an older British man and a young Russian girl, neither of whom I've seen enough to have learned their names or anything about their situations.  There's an older Maltese woman named Anne, whose habits and the incredibly lived-in state of whose room would make you believe she's been living in the same guesthouse, piling the same tangerine marmalade on her bread in the morning, for the past 37 1/2 years.  In the afternoons, she can be found in the foyer, where she serves as the house's first line-of-defense, or last barrier-to-your-exit, depending on if you're coming or going:  "Where are you going?"  "To the beach?  Which one?"  "When will you come back?"  "Who are you going with?"  "Where did you go?"  "What did you do there?"   This drives some of the guests absolutely crazy, and I think Anne is reason #1 for Nick's refering to the Savoy as a "halfway house," but the woman is harmless and actually very sweet.  She's just a bit inquisitive, which I think is merely due to the fact that she is, I think, somewhat physically unable to leave the house and so lives vicariously through the other residents.  I felt bad the other day because I was sitting near Anne in the foyer when I happened to glance down at her feet and caught sight of her breathtakingly overgrown toenails.  I, anticipating that maybe she didn't own a pair of nailclippers and thinking she might like to borrow mine, embarked on this conversation:   Me : Anne, I noticed your toenails are a little long.  Do you...  Anne :  I know, I know.  I'm sorry.  I was gonna cut them last night and then I forgot.  Me :  No, no, I was just wondering if you needed to borrow some clippers.  Anne : No, I have them.  I'm sorry.  I'll cut them tonight.  I will cut them tonight.  Me :  I don't care, I mean, it doesn't bother me.  I was just gonna offer you mine.  Anne :  No, I have them, but it's just a little difficult for me to cut them.  So then I was thinking maybe she needed help cutting them, and the conversation continued:   Me : Oh, do you need help?  I mean, I could help you if you wanted.  Anne :  It's okay, and I promise, I'll cut them tonight.  I'll cut them tonight.  I felt really bad at this point because I could see that Anne couldn't understand that I was just concerned.  She thought that I was disgusted by her toenails and was trying to hint/guilt her into cutting them.  The more I said, the more I felt that she was misunderstanding me and that I was making her feel bad.  So, I dropped the toenail subject.  Now, I've neglected to mention yet that Iris (the young Chinese girl) had been sitting in the foyer also, but she wasn't listening to us; she had been watching T.V.  I'm not kidding...five minutes later, during a commercial, she gingerly glanced around the room, looked casually at the two of us, caught sight of Anne's feet, and said (in the harsh and unapologetic way that only English-as-a-second-language speakers do accidentally), "Are you going to cut your toenails?!"  Oh my.  The whole conversation started all over again, Anne becoming more and more convinced, I'm sure, that her toenails were an affront to the civilized world.    The next morning, I walked into the breakfast room and the first thing Anne said to me was, "I forgot to cut my toenails again, but I'll cut them tonight.  I'll cut them tonight," shaking her head absolutely in betrayal of the fact that she was not only trying to convince me of this intent, but to convince herself as well.  And that's Anne.  Then there are Tony and Eddie, both elderly long-term residents who hover on the edge of eviction every single day.  See, Josephine's problem with Eddie is that he begins drinking at 11:00 every morning and doesn't stop until he's consumed an entire bottle of Auld Lang Syne Scotch Whiskey.  His only defense to this beef is to point out that Tony begins drinking at 5:00 in the morning and doesn't stop until he's consumed  two  entire bottles of Auld Lang Syne Scotch Whiskey.  Both arguments are true, and the entire hallway near these men's rooms reeks terribly of sour alcohol breath.  Tony is Maltese, but he lived 44 years in England, where he was married to a woman from India.  Tony fled the country when his wife died and her son (from a previous marriage) tried to kill him for attempting to incinerate her body in compliance with her wishes.  So he brought her dead body and all to Malta and has been living in something like exile for the past who knows how long, in the Savoy Guesthouse.  Now, this lamentable tale might cause you to take pity on the old man, but nay, I say.  You should hear the rest first.  You might remember my having referred to Tony earlier as the "pervy old man" who checks out women's clothing on the clothesline.  Well that's true of him.  He is also given to offering hourly work to female guesthouse residents.  And he sees absolutely NOTHING wrong with this.  On the day he offered this kind of work to me (as if it were some kind of favor), and I became angry and yelled for the first time in I have no idea how long, he asked, very innocently, wherein lied the problem.  "It's good money," he reasoned, "Ten Lira per hour."    Ten Lira is roughly 27 American dollars.  Eddie is alternately disgusted with Tony and is his best friend.  That afternoon, after Tony had been asked to leave the room, Eddie denounced him as a scoundrel, a truly reprehensible human being, a waste of good oxygen.  Moments later, Tony reappeared in the doorway, having forgotten his glass of whiskey.  And when he left, Eddie said, "Ok, I'll come see you later."  I throw my hands up.  Eddie is from Pakistan, where he was forced out because of an inability to find work, having suffered from prejudice associated with his being a Christian.  He claims to be a palm reader, and has offered to read my palm but failed to deliver on this promise so far.  Until now, he's only shared with me that my lucky day is Wednesday, and that things I begin on Wednesday will have good outcomes.  Good to know.  Eddie also writes jokes (or joke, as far as I know--so far he's shared the same one with me three times).  The example:       A bartender closes his bar and goes home to sleep.  A little while later he's awakened by the phone, and the man on the other line asks when he'll be reopening in the morning, to which he answers, "Sometime around 10:00 am."  A couple of hours later, the man calls back, wanting to know EXACTLY when he'll be opening, and the bartender repeats, "I told you!  Around 10:00."  By the third call, the bartender is irate, and when the man asks again for the exact time, he answers with, "You bloody bastard!  You've ruined my night!  If you're so bloody fond of drinking, why don't you buy a case of liquor and drink it at home?!"  The voice on the other end answers, "Look man, I don't drink.  I promise.  I just came into your bar to use the restroom and now I'm locked inside until you reopen."    Now, it's difficult to find that joke funny more than once.  But watching Eddie's face--the way he cracks up at his own cleverness--makes it worth waiting for the punchline.  The other day Eddie tried to pay his rent and Josephine told him to keep his money because she was kicking him out.  In a panic, he called Tony downstairs so the two together, whiskey bottles in hands, could brainstorm a solution to this new problem.  After a couple of hours of careful discussion and plotting, their answer was to send Tony in to speak to Josephine.  Slowly, cunningly, he crept into her office, his lines planned.  She took one look at him and said only these two words: "You're next."  Ouch.  But it's not true.  They'll probably both die there.  I think she just likes to scare them into compliance...she's told me how happy she's been with the silence and the cleanliness of rooms she has observed since she made her threats.   The one guest I've yet to discuss, Saad, refers to them as Tom and Jerry, but we can't really figure out who's who.  Saad is a young man from Morocco who's here to find work.  He's full of insane tales about Morocco and what he refers to as "magic."  He also talks a lot about "phantoms," which he pronounces "FAWN-tomes," in a way that makes them sound truly scary and almost believable.  He claims this magic has been responsible (in his eye-witness experience) for: * A young man spelling an American woman into falling in love with him, her taking him back to the States where they still live. * His mortal enemy coming to his house, weeping, and waiting with his mother for three hours until Saad came home, at which time the enemy apologized for all past transgressions. * Same said enemy coming to and wondering what the hell she was doing in his house, after Saad asked the spell-casting third party to remove the magic. * A young newlywed being unable to do the deed on the wedding night, thanks to the magic performed by the scores of young bachlorettes in the village who were jealous and angered at his finally getting hitched. * Same said newlywed impregnating his wife when Saad's magical grandmother intervened with her White Magic, on his behalf.  * A young man who moved to Libya to work being sometimes given to intense and overwhelming desires to return home to his girlfriend, who made a magic paper and tied it to the leaves of a tree so that the magic would make his mind change with the wind.  !!!   It's funny, though...if you listen to him tell these stories, they sound true.  Do you think that magic is merely a matter of believing in it?  It seems to me that might be a contributing factor.  All in all, these characters have made the stay entertaining and well worth the whopping fifteen bucks a night I'm paying to stay there :)  And that, my friends, is the Savoy Guesthouse.  Ya'll stop by sometime, y'hear?

      Patience, my friends...I fear this entry will be loooooong.  I've had the details floating around in my mind for exactly one week.  Upon arriving at the port in Malta (pronounced MOLE-dtuh by the locals--go ahead and say it aloud; I know you want to), I took a bus to my guesthouse, which sits atop a curvy hill, overlooking, among other things, the nearby Mediterranean Sea), I called Nick to let him know I was here and in good spirits, and he came right over.  Fifteen seconds of greetings later, he asked me if I was ready to go to church.  CHURCH?!    I checked my face and clothing for signs of blantant heathenery, but he explained that it was the first stop on our tour--he had just learned more than a bit about the history of the building and was eager to make me his first victim, er, audience.  And Saint John's Cathedral, in Valetta, was worth the journey.  There are 350 valiant knights buried below the marble floor, and the ornate details of the interior (which is well belied by the unassuming exterior) rivaled only Saint Peter's in Vatican City.  Okay, indulge me...I have a limited frame-of-reference.   Though I am no longer religious, I have to say that there is something very comforting in being able to attend a mass anywhere in the world and know when to stand, when to sit, and when to sit quietly and brace yourself for a long-winded homily...  In Maltese!  Needless to say, I didn't understand a single word, but the enchanting voices of the choir members (a real choir, which is difficult to find at Catholic churches in the States) reached down and took a firm grip on the innermost knot in the bottom of my soul (I had been wondering where it was (the bottom of my soul, that is...it's good to know).  Then, a walking tour.  We checked out the ENORMOUS fortifications built, uh, a very long time ago (sorry Nick, you're a better guide than I am a student) to keep the Turks out.  Damned Turks!  Always trying to sneak in somewhere.    When you walk up and down the narrow streets of Malta, your shoes make the sound that shoes make in British documentaries.  Do you know the ones I'm referring to?  In these documentaries, there's some old man, always walking UP a hill for some reason.  So between heavy breaths, he says something like (think high British pronunciation), "For the Egyptians, mumification ensured the soul's being kept in-tact during the afterlife," and all the while, he continues to walk and his shoes, on the limestone/sand combination, make a cool kind of crunching sound.  Do you have the slightest idea what I'm talking about?  Well, the streets of Malta make that sound.  When talking to myself as I walk (one of my favorite passtimes), I always have to affect a British accent; it seems so apropos.  But, of course, one needn't walk everywhere.  There are busses...if you dare, mwah ha ha.  Well, actually, the busses themselves seem entirely safe.  The problem is me.  See, they drive on the left here, and I've been nearly killed at least a half-dozen times.  Guess my learning curve is less-than-optimal.    The busses are relic "gifts" from England, many of them dating from sometime in the 1950's, chrome fenders and all.  Their interiors are best described using a phrase I don't think I've ever uttered in my life: A real hoot.  There are religious stickers plastered all over the front dashboards and window panelings (many featuring images of a glowing Virgin Mary and the like).  Some of the more modern-looking stickers read things like "Think GOD," or "Jesus Loves Me," but the most intriguing one so far read "I Love Safely."  Now, I don't know if this was a typo, meant to say "I Love Safety," or if the driver of the bus was especially careful about the way in which he loves and wanted to make sure all his passengers knew this about him (in my feeble understanding, public transportation is handled in a private-contracted sort of way--each driver owning and (sometimes) caring for his own vehicle), but anyway that's what it said.  Which brings me to the language discussion.  As I wrote before, English is one of the two official languages here (three cheers for British Imperialism and the Knights of Saint John), but that doesn't remove the possibility of encountering some idiosyncratic discrepancies.    My favorite sign so far reads "Andrew's Beefy Crunch."  I've never seen the establishment open, but I'm eager to find out what exactly is sold there.    Another, written on the side of a mini-bus, read, "Stuff Your Jealousy."  Okay, I'll get right on that.    A shirt worn by a local man: "International Delivery."    The Maltese speak with a charming accent that sounds like a combination of the accents you would here from native Arabic and native Spanish speakers, which is fitting considering the island's location.  The worst thing I can say about Malta (which is a relatively welcoming place, otherwise) is about the service, which is probably the worst I've ever encountered (seriously, you thought Original Joe's was bad!)  I don't know if this is owing to a general and overwhelming annoyance with tourists or the effects of the weather (oppressive sun with a healthy dose of wet--wet air, not actual rain), but SOMEthing has crawled under the skin of every person in the service industry here (and, I suspect, laid eggs).    An example: The other day I was sitting at a cafe, writing in a notebook, when my server (an elderly and sour-faced man) came to take my plate away.  I realized, as he was taking it, that my notebook had been resting in the ketchup on the plate's edge.  I made an "Aww" kind of face...as in, "how unfortunate," which he misinterpreted as my assigning some kind of blame to him and to which he responded by pointing an extended forefinger in my face, followed with the words, "It's YOUR fault!!"  Hot Damn!  But, as cultural differences can be charming, I've found eliciting a smile from a server to be a challenging and, when successful, gratifying way to pass the time.  And speaking of food (because we kind of were), I'll share what I've learned of it so far.  Well, they have rabbit (stewed), rabbit (fried), and rabbit (baked).  The end.  Kidding of course, though rabbit is a favorite when it comes to local cuisine.  Unfortunately, it seems the Maltese (probably having something to do with the British occupation I referred to earlier) suffer from a bit of an identity crisis.  It is difficult to determine what true Maltese culture is all about.  So, my choice vegetarian option is chips and egg (how much more British can you get?), followed by couscous and pita bread from the Istanbul Kebab joint near my guesthouse (I guess some of those Turks snuck through after all).  And then, there's (surprise, surprise) McDonald's, Burger King, and Pizza Hut.  The notable menu item in a Maltese McDonald's: salad with fresh tuna or shrimp.  And Italian gelatto has meandered its way here, as well...  There IS a God!  And now for the best thing I can report about Malta: It is--by far--the safest place I have ever been.  Locals and tourists alike muse about the fact that anybody (man, woman, child) can walk down the dark, deserted streets at any time of the night and feel completely at-ease.  Do you think it has anything to do with the absence of a National Rifle Association?  Naaaaaa.  Really, though.  It's a nice change from the dagger-like sideways glances I had grown accustomed to throwing during my stay in Rome.  Oh, and while I'm thinking about Rome...I wanted to remove any remaining doubt about my being a bona fide freak from the minds of my friends and family members, by making a side-by-side comparison of....drumroll please....  Body Odor!!  Now, the overcrowded busses and Metro of Rome afforded me with countless opportunities to (connoisseur that I am) take a whiff, sampling the smells of Italy (or, Italians).  Assessment: pleasant, in that horse maneur kind of way.  You know what I mean?  How B.O. can sometimes be not-so-bad?  My friend Nicole (thanks to lessons learned in her Human Sexuality class) would point out that our attractions to another's sweat smell has something to do with the likelihood of that person's immune system, coupled with our own, producing offspring with healthy immune systems (ain't that cool?).  Assessment of Maltese B.O.: more offensive.  Is it the proximity to the salty sea air?  I don't know, but the smell is very bitter, most unwelcoming.  So, my belief in this immune system thing has been thrown into doubt.  I mean, it couldn't be that I would produce healthy offspring with EVERY single Roman...afterall, the women have this smell, too.  And there's no way my coupling with any native of this island would result in weak little sicklings.  Or is there?    But anyway.  I fear I haven't really given a good description of this place.  Where to go from here?  On the boat here, I was told that Paceville (PAH-chuh-vill), the local hot spot here, offered the best nightlife to be found in the modern world.  Though I'm not really one for "nightlife," I figured I'd check it out, especially after I learned there was a Salsa club.  After days of loafing around in the sun, I was eager to expend some energy.  So.  Paceville.  Paceville is a nightmare.  Well, I suppose that if I were 17, or drunk, or eager to spend too much money to go to a club exactly like any club I could find in the United States, it would be quite a thrill.  But since I'm none of the above...  I went to the Salsa Club (Fuego, it's called), and was happy when I entered and heard a merengue song, followed by a salsa.  But then, suddenly, the tides turned, and the next 6 songs were (sometimes) in Spanish, but with nothing even close to a salsa beat anywhere to be found.  Most were just overlaid with a thump, thump, thumping just perfect for losing your mind to.  I guess that's the idea.  Oh, and a resident of the guesthouse where I'm staying had kept mentioning to me a song that had the words "Life is life" as the main chorus.  "Life is life?," I asked, "What does that MEAN? That doesn't mean anything."  I heard that song that night..."Life is life," and apparently it's quite popular, because after the "Life is life" part, the DJ would turn down the volume and, in one loud voice, the entire contents of the club would yell "La la la la la," the rest of the chorus.  Is this a local phenomenon, or is my ignorance, like a poorly hemmed slip, showing again?  Please, if anybody knows anything about this, do set me straight.  Ah, but last night, in a wonderful stroke of luck, I discovered the local jazz club.  It sits underground in a sultry, red little room that seems like some sort of a secret, and like--among the patrons--there should be real live beatniks or maybe Boris and/or Natasha. Sadly, they only have jazz on Thursdays, but I'll be sure to be there.  As for daylife, I have only the beach to offer explanation of, but the beach is enough.  The great thing I can say about the beaches in Malta is that all are welcomed with open arms...big'uns, lil'uns, all types, all sizes, all in bikinis (well, the women anyway).  They are far less body-conscious here, and it was incredibly refreshing to see old and young, thin and not-so-thin, tawny bronze and ghostly white and beet red, all enjoying the sun as it should be enjoyed.  And the Maltese children, splashing and sand-castle-building and running and screaming, are especially nice to watch.  Though eating and entertainment are comparably priced to the U.S., accomodations are cheap, so I've decided to stay a while before heading to Spain.  My purchases so far include the obligatory sarong (only $6 here, compared to the $15-20 you'd pay at, say, the Jazz Festival) a sun hat (which I bought from the Maltese version of a dollar store--awesome!), and a traditional henna hand tatoo.   Despite bad service and yucky nightclubs, life here has treated me well.  Next time I write, I will tell all about the cast of characters at the Savoy Guest House, a motley crew of folks so strange at times that, in hearing the reports, Nick (in the classist and superior manner for which he is known) has taken to calling "Halfway House" rather than "Guest House" residents.  Our differing attitudes about what is "uncivilized" and what is simply interesting and quaint, has resulted in a general happiness (in both of us, I think) about the fact that our respective hotels are located on different parts of the island.  :)  La La La La La.  I wish you all well.

      Okay, I just had to make one amendment to my last entry...  It wasnt the peeling out that finally put things in Malta over the top.  It was the Mormons.  Mormons on Malta!!!!!    But Barcelona, My Oh My!  I arrived yesterday and have decided it is the most beautiful city Ive ever seen.  Yesterday I saw a Dali exhibit, which gave me a little peek into the brain of certainly one of the most imaginative and eccentric figures of the 20th Century.  You know, he had a real knack for depicting avant garde uses for human genitals in drawings.  Just kidding.  I mean, he did, but the exhibit was much more than that.  Today I went to a garden designed by Gaudi, the famous architect.  Another imaginative fellow.  There were a house and a few structures in the park that felt like something out of Smurf Village.  Well anyway it was dreamy and wonderful.  But last night, I experienced the best moment of my trip thus far.  I was walking through this little alleyway that passes by a really big, really amazing church, and there was a small opening where a solo cellist was playing (with a portable CD player nearby, playing a single piano as accomaniment).  The night was perfect (cool and a little cloudy), and the music floated out from the cello, danced mournfully through the air, and approached me with a vivid sort of incredible sort of wondrous sort of hesitance that was haunting and inviting at the same time.   I decided to sit down for a while.  And my reward for staying came in the form of Ave Maria,about six songs later.  That song gets me EVERY SINGLE time, but most especially last night, alone in a little alleyway on a perfect night in Barcelona, Spain.  I decided that that moment alone--even if it would have been the *only* memorable moment during the entire trip--was worth the journey.  There are truly amazing street performers here.  Street performing seems less of a way for people to subsist than a venue for really talented people to showcase that talent and make a decent living.  The charcoal and pencil portraits the artists do here, in an hours time, represent the kind of work they would be paid REALLY GOOD money to produce in the States.  And Ive heard all kinds of brilliant musicians playing all kinds of instruments.  Its difficult to retain the will to continue walking most of the time with all the entertainment to be experienced on the way.  And guess where Ill be heading the day after tomorrow!!  Guess!!  Guess, I said!!!!  Well, I wont give it all away (since it seems you reFUSE to guess), but Ill just say that it has a little something to do with trampling, a little something to do with red, and a lot to do with ludicrous, idiot tourists looking for an adrenaline rush.  Ive yet to decide if Ill be running :)

      Godforsaken Island!!!   Yes, yes, the island fever has set in.  I think what finally broke me was the shudders that run up and down my spine each time I hear the sound of a car peeling out.  And this is a sound I hear quite often here, at least 10 times/day.  Where are they all  going ?  I mean, what's the big hurry?!  I think the sound of a car peeling out is my least favorite sound in the whole world.    I'm oh so happy to be leaving for Spain (Barcelona) tomorrow.  But my last few days here have been really, really wonderful and full of the kind of solitude I had hoped to find when I left for Europe without a travel plan.  The exception to my solitude came in the form of Nick (whom I hadn't seen much at all during my time here) and a German fellow by the name of Martin who was staying in Nick's guesthouse.  On Nick's last night here, the three of us went to a little bar and then headed down to Paceville (Fuego, specifically)because Martin had been there on Friday and learned that they play real Salsa and Merengue from 3-5 in the morning or so.  Well, that didn't exactly turn out to be true on a Monday night, but the three of us were having a good time, Nick dancing sprightly with the goofy, slightly opened-mouth smile he wears when he's very drunk.  At something like 4 o'clock in the morning, it began to seem to me that the entire dancefloor was covered with men--horny, eager, squinty-eyed men who seemed not to have seen a female in years of something like solitary confinement.  So, lucky for me, Nick and Martin were hovering nearby and were quick to intercede when they sensed I was uncomfortable.  At one point they nearly fought with a man who decided that 15 seconds was enough time spent dancing with a woman before it was okay to grab her ass.  They were the most valiant of knights in a sea of slime.  After Fuego we decided to take a sunrise skinny dip (my first ever) in the Mediterranean.  Wonderful.  Martin laughed (well not really, though I sensed he was laughing internally) at me in my prudish Americaness (demonstrated by my unwillingness to remove clothing until actually in the water), but for goodness sakes, the sun was already up, and people were walking their dogs on the nearby strand.  Plus, Malta is a pretty conservative, and I'm pretty sure we were breaking the law, so best to be subtle about it, no?  Today I learned that Saad (from the guesthouse) was detained for an hour and a half by the police yesterday because "he resembled a man who was wanted for stabbing a Maltese woman last week."  See, if you talk to the Maltese, they will tell you that the only problems with crime here come from the Arab population.  And to the Maltese, all Arabs are the same.  The Arab population here suffers a kind of racism that I think could be rivaled by the United States maybe 60 years ago or so.  Terrible.  Saad said he eventually saw a photo of the wanted man in question, and that the only resemblance the two of them bore was their shared black hair and dark eyes.  Again, terrible.  But at least they didn't beat him like he said they were beating some of the other men (all Arab, of course) being held while he was there.  More of the terrible.  I'll be heading to the beach one last time this afternoon.  There is an oh-so-groovy little cabana near the local rock beach, where the owner (a curly-haired old hippy with eyes that travel in two different directions) plays music just wonderful to frolic in the water and bathe in the sun to...Bob Marley, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Grateful Dead, U2.  Yesterday, I felt spontaneous tears spring forth upon hearing Marley's live version of "No Woman, No Cry."  That song ALWAYS gets me, but I don't think it ever made me cry before.  Where would we be on this earth without the comfort, the joy, the inspiration, and the sometimes heart-wrenching effects of music?      I'm waxing a little dreamy right now.  I'm having one of those moments where I just feel incredibly fortunate to be alive.  And I'm really looking forward to Spain; I feel her reaching her fingers invitingly in my direction.

      Well, forget the cello.  The cello was cool, but the Running of the Bulls was *****SUPER COOL*****  I mean really super duper amazing...the biggest party and the best time of my life.  I can't write many details right now because  1) I'm in Paris and have slightly more interesting things to do (I just had to get online to book a hostel in New York) and  2) As the parenthetical comments in #1 imply, I'll be home soon enough anyway and can talk about it in-person.  That's right...I'll be back as of Sunday, just 5 short weeks later.  Yes, this is a big time bummer.  But I don't have any money left, and the bills and students loans I have back home are looming menacingly overhead.  I figure it would be a bit nicer to go traveling again when I can get those things under control and not be worrying about it.  But Pamplona...let me just say a bit about this.  It was inSANE!!!!  Sooooo many people.  Sooooo much fun.  Has anybody seen photos of the big square where they kick off the festival every year?  You know, the sea-of-red-handkerchiefs-and-near-rabid-with-enthusiasm-Spaniards?  Well, I happened upon that square quite by accident and found myself in the heart of the madness.  And it was a very invigorating sort of madness.  And of course there were the people jumping off that monument (mostly tourists, mostly Aussie tourists at that--the Aussies are ridiculously crazy and great!) and the Sangria a-flowin' and sleeping by the bank of a little river for a half hour total in two nights and the 14 hour busride from Barcelona to Paris afterward (three days, yes three days without a shower covered in the champagne and sangria and beer and eggs that landed on me during the celebrations).  Paris has been quite calm, relatively.  I'm staying in a cute little hostel in the Montmartre area of the city.  Montmartre is French for "peep show."  Just kidding, but there are a TON of peepshows around, though the area is nice otherwise.  I saw about 600 monuments yesterday and am about to head out for Round 2 today.  Paris is beautiful and ugly at the same time.  Kind of like every major city...it's got its attractions mixed with the comfortable littering tendencies of the locals.  I can't think of a place I'd rather be at this moment...except maybe Pamplona :)  I leave tomorrow and will be in New York until Sunday, then back to L.A.  :(

      So I was in kind of a hurry the last couple of times I wrote, and I fear I may have left out some of the juicy stuff.  Im in Hollywood right now, hanging out with my Bro and trying not to tie up his phone line too much.  See, Im trying my hand at the job market here in L.A., but it seems theres no such thing as classifieds in the newspapers these days.  So Im doing a lot of looking online, and hes raised eyebrows at me more than once today alone.  Sorry, Bro.  But anyway, I think I have to backtrack a little to Pamplona and the bulls and all that.  The thing is that I didnt actually see any running of any bulls, which is probably a good part of the reason that the experience was such a pleasant one.  I think that if I had witnessed anybody getting mangled I probably wouldnt feel so happy about the whole thing.  But I was there for the opening festivities, and, like I said, the Aussies made it an incredibly exciting experience.  I dont know what it is about those people.  Its as though being an adventurer comes along with Australian citizenship or something.  All the Aussies I met abroad were traveling for 6 months or more (some with surfboards under their arms).  When I told them that I would be gone for roughly 5 weeks, most of them asked me questions along the lines of, Why even bother?  Theyve explained to me that Australia is such an isolated country, and its so expensive to leave, that theyre gone for long periods of time in order to make it worth the trip.  So I already told about the smelly bus ride (as in,  I  was smelly because of the caked on eggs and various beverages), and I already told that I visited beaucoup monuments during my stay in Paris, which was brief but pleasant.  I could tell you about my stay with my old pal Renee in the Hamptons, but that was just soooooo mellow that I fear I could lull anybody into a pleasant, dreamy siesta just by talking about it.    Ill just say that Renees house is The Cutest and she was The Most Gracious and Entertaining Hostess and the other friends she had staying (a friend of hers from kindergarten and two Swedes) with her for the weekend provided excellent conversation and the whole thing was wonderfully refreshing.  Wonderfully relaxing after the whirlwind travels.  That is despite the fact that her septic tank burst (or something like thatIm pretty ignorant about plumbing) while I was there and she spent about 7 hours dealing with getting it pumped by an Emergency Septic Tank Pumping Company.  I actually welcomed the waiting-at-home-for-the-guy-to-come-and-do-his-thing thing.  That was part of what made the stay so relaxing.  So that leaves me with Hollywood.  Oh, but first lemme just advise all readers to avoid Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris like the plague.  I arrived 3  hours early and STILL I was running to catch my plane.  Nightmare.  Part of the thing was that the security inspectors were moving sooooo sloooooowly.  I kept getting frustrated while I was watching them from the line because it seemed that they were just chit-chatting with all the passengers; it was like they were flirting or something because they had these smirks on their faces and all the passengers were smiling all goofily while they talked.  What IS this?, I thought.  But when I got to my guy, I realized the people were smiling and laughing because the inspectors accents were so strong (accentuated by the fact that they were speaking through smirks for whatever reason) that it was nearly impossible to decipher what they were asking.  Example:   Inspector:  What do you do to leave?  Me:  What?  Inspector:   What do you do for to leave?   (Im thinking  well, I packed my bag and checked out of my hostel and then took the Metro to the RER train to the airport shuttle and now Im here.   But I know thats not what he means.  I just cant figure out what he DOES mean.  I answer just to answer something)   Me:  Well, I packed my bag and checked out of my hostel and then took the Metro  Inspector:  To  leave !!!  What do you do for to   leave  ???!!!!!  Me:  Oh, you mean what do I do for a living?  Inspector:  Yes, for to leave.  Me:  Im a student. (I lie to make it less complicated)  Inspector:  And who pack your bag?  And on and on.  But the funny thing was that, at first, the way he asked questions was so unassuming that it almost seemed as though he was just making pleasant conversation, and that he was really interested in my trip, which is the other reason I think all the passengers were smiling.  Because he said, Where did you go on your holiday? and I thought he was just passing time while he did the official business of checking my passport.  So I said, Well, I was in Italy and then I went down to Malta, oh and then I was in Barcelona and Pamplona and then I came up here to Paris. I was about to pull out my pictures and tell him the story of Sea Malta when he started in with the What do you do for to leave? business.  The whole thing was just kind of goofy but cute somehow.  Not cute enough to overshadow the rest of the de Gaulle nightmare, though, so be warned.  And Hollywood.    Its only my first day, but Im just returning to old stomping grounds anyway, so I feel at home.  Except that I think theres a limit to how much one can feel at home in Hollywood.  There is definitely an anonymity about the place.  And yes, everyone here is trying to make it.  And yes, the smog is yucky poo poo.  And yes its dirty and somehow sad.  But something has me drawn here, so well see what happens.  The best thing that happened to me today was that a human sandwich spoke to me.  There was this sign twirler dressed like a big sandwich standing on the street corner outside of Subway.  When I walked by, he spoke.  It seemed to me that that sort of thing shouldnt be allowedlike talking sandwiches are scarier than they could ever be effective promotional agents, but thats just me:   Sandwich:  Helloooooooo.  Me:  laughter  Sandwich:  I know why youre laughing.  Me:  A talking sandwich is pretty funny.  Sandwich:  Do you want something to drink?  Silliness.  I had just had something to drink, so I walked away without answering, but now Im curious.  I mean, did the sandwich have beverages tucked between his folds of lettuce?  Was he giving away free drink coupons with subway sandwich purchases?    Maybe Ill go by tomorrow to kill to boredom that will inevitably come while I wait for responses to my employment queries.    Bottom lines are that Im back on American soil and safe and mostly happy save for the sad that has come with the end of my fantastic voyage.  Im currently looking into jobs with travel opportunities.  The travel bug dies hard like Malta mosquitoes, it seems.  Love to you all.

      At the kind request of one of my international readers (ok, my only international reader), I've decided to take up my blog again and write for the simple satisfaction of it while trying to convince some-body/company/entity to pay me for my efforts.    So, a lot has happened since I last wrote--since, for example, I forewent the hare-brained idea of making a living in Los Angeles.  Den of despair!  I shouldn't say that.  I know plenty of people who are, in fact, very happy living in the city of would-be angels; I just didn't happen to count myself among them.  As was customary in recent years, I made sure to be in San Jose for the annual jazz festival.  My return to L.A. was to happen the following Tuesday, but when that afternoon arrived I found myself physically incapable (or more likely, simply unwilling) to board the lighting-fast, Greyhound bus that was to take me there.  San Jose is indeed the place for me.  I pitched a tent in the living room of my dear friends, Nicole and Raul (and Maya too) and set out to find gainful employment, which I found (well, employment anyway) without too much delay.  Two months later I moved into a groovy (umm) flat, we'll call it, with my best gal Kelsi, and that brings me about to present.  I'm still looking for the job I went into student loan debt for...the one that would make all the late-night term papers worth the trouble (and that is, of course, the most pessimistic viewpoint...the education WAS worth the effort in its own right...but it will be infinitely MORE worth it when I have the means to begin  paying off  those student loans, you dig?)  In the meantime I've been back at an old haunt--Barnes and Noble--which is among the most pleasant environments one might find when it comes to working retail.  It's especially nice to be working in a Barnes and Noble in one of the most liberal areas of the country, where requests for Al Franken's  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them  outnumber those for Bill O'Reilly's  Who's Looking Out for You?  by about 25-0 and the Evil Anne Coulter's book sits in heaping mounds, growing dusty,  under  a display table.  And that's the short of it, for now.  I'm going to start writing more consistently, sharing some of my favorite public transportation tales of horror, along with other daily observations and embarrassing moments and good news as well.  Hope all is well--whoever you are, reading this, and wherever you might be.

       This check cashing place stoled [sic] $85 from me .  So read the message painstakingly markered on a sandwich board worn by the one-man picket line I saw downtown yesterday.  I didnt stop to get the details; I figured he must have a legitimate beef if hes willing to stand in the cold and explain his plight to complacent passers-by.  And yet I wondered how much that stoled was taking away from the serious reception of his message.  Or was it just me?  See, Ive been thinking a lot about language lately.  Theres a sign outside a furniture store near my place of work that advertises a free entry into a drawing for a  harly davisons motorclcye , free with  every purchased .  I have to say theres something about those and other errors on that sign that make me leery of shopping at that store.  A little part of me fears I wont be able to communicate with the people who work there.  I dont like that part of me.  Whats that statistic say?  That something like 90% of all messages are transmitted and received non-verbally?  Im not sure how They calculate these things in clear statistics like that, but it certainly feels true.  So why should poor grammar be such a roadblock for me?  Ive just begun the process of getting credentialed to teach adult English as a Second Language.  This seems a good fit for meI love language and (just as I enjoy learning other languages) will enjoy helping others communicate better in English.  Its something Ive been doing informally for a while anyway, and I think what motivates me is my own awareness of sounding like a mentally challenged third-grader when speaking either of my two foreign languages.  Have you ever had a relationship (even a brief onea.k.a. a fling) in another language?  Theres something very frustrating about wanting to say, perhaps, Theres this look you have thats very arresting in nature.  I feel somewhat off-balance when you look at me like thatlike you know something I dont and would regret knowing if I did, and instead saying something about the equivalent of Your face makes me sad.  So, last summer when I was in Malta and a German acquaintance said things like, We are having these [zeez] meetings all the [zuh] time in the [zuh] mornings, I would (at his request, of course, that I help him with his English) explain how and why we have meetings every morning is a sufficient and more common way of expressing the same idea.  But then, there are infinitely many ways to convey a message, and aren't the idiosyncratic expressions of second-language learners what make their speech so captivating?  Really, is your face makes me sad  that  far off base?   Ive traveled a little distance, however, from my original point, which was that a few letters can make a big difference in whether or not ones true intention will be effectively communicated.  This idea hit home one day when I was in high school and my Mom, whos really named Carmelita Konrad, received a letter addressed to Carnekuta Jibrad (say it aloud in a mean voiceit sounds really intimidating).  It seems whoever typed the envelope had his or her right hand over to the left by one key [what does your name become?  Im Jusa Jibrad or Losa Lpmrad, depending on in which direction Im off].  If I were into New Years resolutions, Id resolve not to equate poor spelling and grammar with bad ideas or a lack of intelligence.  Its not like I do this, ultimately, nowbut Im tempted sometimes and I dont like that.  Even if grammatical skills were a true measure of ones intelligence, it would be, at most, one type of intelligence out of many.  Would Nietzsche have needed the ability to spell Nietzsche in order to prove the worth of his ideas?  Kahlil Gibran?  What of those who dont even communicate their ideas in wordsor more interestinglytheir art, their emotions, their music?  Its a process, though.  So if you write me an e-mail that doesnt contain a single period and says things like whose comming to youre party besides myself? and it takes me a day or two to recover and respond, please forgive me.  You can laugh at my ill-fated attempts at baking, my inability to stay in one key while singing, the fact that I can't do a single pull-up, or my complete incapacity to get double entendres all you want.  Ill understand.

      When Kelsi and I decided to find a place together, we had a pretty substantial list of requirements.  I won't bore with ALL the details, but we were looking for things like good natural light, a kitchen that opened to other living spaces, a bit of space separating the bedrooms, etc., etc.  Our new place meets nearly every requirement, with two exceptions.  I'd wanted laundry on the premises and she'd wanted a fireplace.  We settled for a bi-weekly jaunt to our most favorite laundrymat and employing the two central heating systems in our apartment.  All was good, except, that is, one thing...  ...see, there was this pigeon shit to contend with.    Honestly, I didn't really feel the bird shit represented a force to contend with, per se.  But my gal Kelsi--when she gets an idea in her head...  :)  The thing is that the view from our little dining area is less-than-breathtaking.  The many-windowed wall faces a large, Victorian house next door whose adjacent wall just happens(ed) to be covered in the droppings of the two birds who'd made a love nest of the tiny stoop above.  Before we moved in, Kelsi mentioned to our soon-to-be landlord and landlady (on separate occasions) that she'd like to have an improved view, and she asked for their suggestions.    The landlady suggested we talk to the owner of the house next door and see if she'd mind our cleaning it.  Logical.  The landlord was slightly more, shall I say, proactive (?).  In addition to bringing over a large ladder and some kind of high-powered cleaning agent, he (how to say this delicately?) saw to it that the pigeons, well, uh, met with an accident.    Horrible!  I know.  If I'd known that was going to be part of his solution, I would never have let Kelsi mention it to him.    But anyway, we were then free to clean the droppings ourselves.  There was some downtime though...it rained or we didn't have the time or it was dark or we didn't have the cleaning stuff yet.  It was during this downtime that I came to understand just how big a stick in Kelsi's spokes this bird shit thing was.  There was more than one occassion when I walked out of the hallway to find her gazing disconcertedly out the window at the poo.  I'd laugh--I couldn't help it; she reminded me of the grocer in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" who was always driving into the Walmart-like, small business-crushing Food Mart's parking lot and staring up at the big sign, no doubt wondering where he went wrong, what he did to deserve this lot in life.  It would take her a second to realize why I was laughing, why I began to fear she was being overtaken with thoughts of these...damned...pigeons (clenched fist, clenched teeth)!!!!!  I'd been thankful for the post-poning rain and for my absense over the holidays because, as you can imagine, scraping bird droppings off high-up places atop rickety ladders is, while ranking high, just not The Highest on my list of fun ways to pass the time.  But finally, the rain cleared, the sun came out, we had the cleaning stuff and the time and (50% of us anyway) the drive.  I'd kept thinking the problem would take care of itself (an inclination I'd like to blame--as I blame so many of my other undesirable qualities--on my Gemini-ness), but alas, problems don't generally work that way.  [Incidentally, when one group of birds meets with an accident, others are happy to move in--just so you and YOUR sniper landlord know]  The day of reckoning came last Friday.  Even as the day was upon us, I tried to delay.   I took an extra long bath in the morning. I mentioned that maybe, for who knows what reason, the following day might be an even BETTER day to clean bird poop! I took to a bit of pouting, pointing out how it was my first day off in 7 and blah blah blah.  But that didn't last long.  After all, who really wants to look at bird droppings when eating?    I was about 8 steps up the ladder when I realized this was one of those things I'd be telling Kelsi's future children about: "And yet  another  thing your mama somehow convinced me was a good idea..."  See, I have a serious ladder phobia.  I discovered this only  after  I was hired to work at Pier 1 Imports about 9 years ago, where climbing to the very tops of ladders and flinging huge, off-balanced floor pillows onto and off of shelves overhead is just part of the daily grind.  Four years after that and about 10 jobs later I graduated to even taller ladders at Target, flinging even heavier objects like King-sized comforters.  Strangely enough, however, ladder phobias don't really go away.  So I did wonder how far I'd have to fall to ensure my spot in next year's "Darwin Awards" book.  I can hear Kelsi's quote now: "She was reaching over...see, there was this especially menacing little chunk, a bit yellowish with a big gloppy hanging off... I asked her could she please grab that one while she was up there and the next thing I knew..."   Obviously, however, I survived the ordeal.  'Cept the rain starting down in sheets just as we were folding up the ladders.  I was soaked through and through by the time I'd rolled up the neighbor's hose and made quick waste of the newly bio-hazarded scrubbing agents.  I giggled up the back steps, tugged my red, dripping wet Chuck Taylors off my feet, and thanked the universe for yet another ridiculous memory to tuck into the folds of my joyful life.  And I've never quite enjoyed a homecooked meal so much as the blueberry pancakes we shared while gazing out the breakfast nook window at our new, gleaming and glowing, dookie-free wall.  Sometimes, you just gotta clear away the shit.

      Last month I took the CBEST (California Basic Education Skills Test) as a preliminary step in attaining my adult teaching credential.  The CBEST isnt known for putting its takers up to challenging mental feats of strength (its not like taking the GRE or the Bar Exam).  Mostly, its just another hoop to jump througha barrier between the school districts and the mobs of motley folk who would gladly take $110/day to substitute teach or $30/hour to teach ESL, if it were simply a matter of having the desire.  The CBEST had been a pain in my ass for a few months.  Id signed up to take it once, paying $20 more than the initial fee because Id signed up late.  Then I missed that exam because of car-borrowing schedule conflicts, which sucked.  Two months later (when it was finally offered again) I signed up early enough to pay only the regular $40 the second time around, and made sure to have my travel plans well-outlined.  Thats a total of $100 I paid in order for the state to tell me, on an official piece of (not just paper)  stock  paper, that I can convert fractions to percentages and identify the closest synonyms to obscure words like strange, or ambiguous if asked to do so.  The reading section was easy, the math a fun little blast from the past (I realized I hadnt done any mathother than standard arithmeticin ten! years), and then came the essays.  Now, nobody likes an in-class essay (let alone 2!), and despite what yall might think, English majors are no exception.  It might be slightly easier for us to whip out lengthy, super cheese responses to the types of generic questions asked in these standardized tests, but its no less obnoxious.  The first question had something to do with whether or not we were currently living in something that could be considered the best of times and the worst of times.  I dont recall much about my response to that one except the main point being: we have a great deal of potential to be living in the best of times with scientific advances and what not, but that such potential was rendered null and void when advances were used for less-than-noble causes or when the worthy causes (i.e. treatment for HIV patients, or even basic healthcare) were like pipedreams for the majority of the countys citizensdue to outrageous costs, etc, etc.  Anyway, the second question was a bit more tangible, though no less irritating to consider: What is the single best piece of advice youve ever received?  For a stagnating 4 or so minutes, the only pieces of advice I could remember having received were, while incredibly practical, not the sort of responses you want to hand in to state-administered essay topics.  The first piece of advice was good for around-the-house matters: Righty tighty, lefty loosey, from my friend JD.  If youre unfamiliar with this phrase, it has to do with the direction for turning screws in order to produce the desired effect; Ive used it many times in the year and a half or so since I learned it.  Incidentally, this is close to what an ex-boyfriend deemed the best piece of advice hed ever received from his father, which was: Only an idiot screws a screw in too tightly.  Neither of those would have made much of an essay.  The second piece of advice Ive considered invaluable came from my brother, about 6 years ago: Beer before liquor, never been sickerliquor before beer, never fear.  Its not like Im a big drinker, which is precisely whycome to think of ita compact, rhyming, easily-remembered-even-when-already-a-little-bit-tipsy phrase like that has come in so handythe two-line poem of sorts has more than made up for my lack of experience or marginal street smarts.  How many toilet-hugging incidents were shrewdly sidestepped?  How many sick days carefully preserved for bona fide illnesses?  How many embarrassed apologies never uttered?  Now, I should note here that theres room for mention of wine in that little ditty (a point the owner of the wine bar downtown, my friend Nick, and any unfortunate witnesses to an unfortunate incident last winter will verify).  Should it be considered liquor?  Can it be safely mixed with  any thing?  And what about warm alcoholic beverages like Sake, which just seem doomed for disaster by virtue of their being warm?  Its not that I couldnt have written an essay about this advice from my brotherlook, Im writing about it right now.  Its just that I shouldnt.  And I didnt.  What I did was make up a piece of advice that supposedly came from my Dad: Never fail to recognize the lessons you can learn in the midst of a so-called failure, or something like that.  Its exactly like something my Dad  would  say.  My Mom, too, for that matter.  And it's good advice.  But its also like something youd hear in an after school special or even from the Evil Dr. Phil.  No matter how good the advice might be, its just not all that captivating to write about.  Is it so impossible to imagine that giving test-takers topics that are truly interesting would perhaps produce a better example of their best writing?  Wouldnt you have some pretty exciting responses to a question regarding the best and worst things about your first kiss?  How about the shittiest day you remember?  The time you walked out on a job and what brought you to that breaking point?  What are the three most terrible (and yet true) things your ex-girlfriend could/would say about you?  I suppose there are some censorship rules prohibiting the state from printing words like shittiest on standardized texts, but maybe its time we relax these puritan tendencies a bit.  With the new topics, they wouldnt have to pay people so much to sit around and read these boring essays all damned day.  It would be like a privilegesomething they could get Masters students to do for next-to-nothing.  Ok, maybe thats exaggerating, but they sure would be easier to write.  And theyd be more reflective of our personalitiesisnt that the most useful information anyway?  What if some mans shittiest day was the one that landed him in jail on charges of 2nd degree murder and racketeering?  It might be a slightly better gauge of his appropriate place teaching children than some piece of advice his grandma handed down when he was 11.  I guess thats what the background checks are for, eh?  Just allow me my fantasies for now.  I happen to believe standardized tests shouldnt HAVE to be less fun than an enema.

      It had been a peaceful bus ride until thena group of elementary school kids tend to pull ones attention away from even the most mundane reading (and this was far froma recommendation from a friendChalmers Johnsons Sorrows of Empiremost excellent and disturbing critique of the current administration).  I was a little annoyed at the disturbance.  But once I decided the reading was a wash, I was happy to sit there and eavesdrop.  Kids are so damned cute without even trying.  There were about six of themthird graders, Im thinking.  Loud, loud, loud.  There was an elderly man sitting next to two of them, and I initially thought he was lamenting his deplorable choice of seating, but it turns out he was quite taken.  The chaperone had told this one little boy that he should tie his shoes so he didnt trip.  The kid made a face and pretty much ignored her.  Then the old man said:  You may not want to, but itll make her happy.  Thats the reason men do things.  There, Ive let you in on one of the secrets.  BOY #1:  Then you get her heart?  MAN: (laughing) Hey!  Thats the other secret!  BOY #2:  I already knew  both  those secrets.  I like a girl.  She hates me.  GIRL #1: Yeah, and her names A- man -da!  (laughter all around)  BOY #2:  So?     He looked down at the ground then and smiled a super shy smile revealing two dimples.  So stinkin cute!!  A conversation ensued regarding what these boys knew about women.   KID #1:  Actually, I learned another lesson: girls can talk a realllllly long time.  KID #2: Yeah, and they like to yell.   I thought maybe they were talking about their mothers until Kid #1 chimed in again   KID #1:  When I dont listen to my sisters, Im a REAL manI think.   Apparently, the women these boys know just love to scream and fight, cuz   KID #2: The girl I like?  She wants to  kill  me.  I was laughing so hard.  Kill him?  Goodness!  They certainly knew they had a captive audience, so I think this group was perhaps more animated than usual, but then maybe not.  If you never spend any time around children, I can tell you its worth the strain on your patience (if you're not-so-kid-inclined) just to hear how they interact and try to remember having that kind of outlook.  Things are pretty clear:  either a girl likes you back (not bloody likely, in the 3rd grade), or she wants to kill you.  Makes things pretty easy, no?  Can you imagine such conversations in the grown-up world?   John:  Hey what about that chic from marketingdid you ask her out?  Rick:  Naw.  I havent.  John:  Well, whats your take?  Does she like you?  Rick:  No, actually, she wants to kill me.  John:  Tough luck, man.  Im calling for all-out, across the board regression, just to simplify matters.   P.S.  The kid  actually tripped  when he got off on account of not tying his shoelace.  If men would just listen to women...

      On the bus a couple of evenings ago, I was kept entertained by a man and woman sitting at the front of the bus and talking (though they were seated right across the aisle from one another) as if there were miles between them.  They seemed to know each other only marginally, through mutual halfway house friends (from what I could gatherand its not eavesdropping if the people are talking that loud).  Regardless, when the woman discovered they were headed to the SAME halfway house just then (him because he lived there, her because her friend lived there), she sidled up next to him.    Well, then Ill sit next to you, since were going in the same direction, she said.  Then, nudging him, she added, Hey there, MisterBubbleGumRing.  Huh huh.    He giggled knowingly then, and the two of them sat there staring  straight  into each others eyes, huh huh-ing in a knowing and, then, surprisingly familiar way.    I say surprising because, at that point, she put her arm around him (he responded by warning her he was sick) and then he said, Charlene, right?    And she said,  Dor -een.    And he said, I was close enough.  Which she apparently agreed with, because when he asked, she agreed to stop with him for a soda at Kentucky Fried Chicken on the way to where they were going.  I was rapt the entire way home, listening for any clue into what Mister Bubble Gum Ring might have been referring to.  Did he wear such a ring?  Had he once given her one?  What  is  a bubble gum ring, anyway?  It sounded kinky, the way she said it, but kinky didnt really seem an applicable term for either party.  Who can say about those types of things, though?  I love the bus.  A few years ago, I was sitting on the 22 (Eastridge Mall to Palo Alto Caltrain Station) when a man and woman (not together but having apparently struck up a conversation at the bus stop) boarded, both with chocolate rings around their mouths.  She was carrying a big, Costco-sized container of chocolate muffins, which she had, by all outward appearances, been kind enough to share.  [Id seen the woman before.  Wed once been sitting at the same bus stop and she told me about having worked twenty-some years at the now-defunct Del Monte canning plant in San Jose before deciding to take an office job.  She advised me against taking such a job (secretary), because the men, you know, they only want one thing.  Id been facing forward, and when it became clear she wasnt going to continue that sentence, I looked at her to find her making that finger-sliding-in-and-out-of-a-hole-made-by-the-other-thumb-and-forefinger motion while watching me with a raised eyebrow.  Ohmigod!]  Anyway, the man seemed about her age (mid- to late-50s), and wasnt so much talking with her as listening to her.    She talked about things I cant remember now, and then stood abruptly when she realized we had reached her stop.  Though the man had said absolutely nothing the entire way, when she stood, she shook his hand and said, I wish you well.  You seem like a lovely person.  His response was, I am.    Thats it.  No thank you.  No humble puh-shaw and dismissive waving-off.  Just a simple, I am.  What I thought was so great about this transaction was that lovely would rank about 9,987 on a list of 10,000 adjectives I would have thought of in describing this man.  He was very large and very stinky with a scraggly beard and crooked teeth and, youll remember, a big chocolate ring around his mouth.    But that was only on the outside.  Whatever it was he knew he had inside of himwhatever it was that made him lovelyshe had seen it.  He knew it was there and she had glimpsed it.  And I thought that was one of the most beautiful things Id ever witnessed.  Imagine how different the world would be if everyone could honestly describe himself or herself as lovely, could accept a compliment that soberly and know it held within it some truth.  Or imagine if we all went around commenting on each others loveliness and sharing our chocolate muffins.  I think I had a vision of my dream world that day.  Whod have thought it would happen on the 22?  I must always strive to keep my eyes and ears wide open.  There are a million transpirings to witness and overhear in a day, and some of them--even on the Urinemobile of all Urinemobiles, the 22 bus--give me the kind of renewed hope that every person needs now and then to remind him or her of what's awe-inspiring, what's comical, what's worth it, in this world.

      About 6 years ago I made a deliberate trip to a bookstore on Superbowl Sunday.  I claimed to be in search of intelligent life, figuring if there were romantic possibilities lurking about the greater metropolitan Denver area (where I was living at the time), they might best be discovered during this crucial moment of unbridled American machismo.   Basically, it occurred to me that anyone away from the TV at that moment (especially one whose alternate locale was the bookstoreTattered Covera thriving independent bookstore, at that) was someone worth getting to know.  Oh, the idealism of youth.  The self-righteousness, perhaps(?).  I didnt meet anyone interesting that day.  And anyway, how much more worthy was  my  cause?  Instead of being in the bookstore seeking to expand my web of knowledge, I was in there on the make!  What a phony baloney.  (Im reminded of a book I saw the other day called  When God Winks on Love , subtitled  Let the Power of Coincidence Lead You to Love .  All I could think was this hypothetical testimonial from readers-turned-devotees to the authors cause: The coincidence I masterminded worked out beautifully.  Ridiculous.)  I know what part of my problem was at the time:  I had just returned to the States from an extended stay in Mexico, where my new awareness of sub-par living conditions greatly soured my outlook on American wastefulness and decadent self-indulgence.  To me, the Superbowl and everything that touched it was evidence of a spoiled rotten population with too much time on its hands and its priorities way, way off-base.  And I still feel that way sometimes.  And I dont plan to watch tomorrows game or wager any money on it or even bother to check the score in the next days newspaper.  But thats mainly because the Raiders arent playing this year (and thats assuming Im kind enough to term what they did last year playing.  Other words that came to mind are floundering, [are you guys] kidding?!, and, simply, Sad.  So sad.).  Its not that I care particularly about football (certainly not in the way I care about baseball, not in the way I have elaborate fantasies about meeting the Dodgers Paul LoDuca), but I am no longer opposed to the idea of sitting down for an afternoon and enjoying the be-all, end-all, American sporting Super Event.  Please indulge my desire to share a few reasons for the change of heart.  Ive thought a lot in recent years about the Superbowl in relation to the World Cup.  I happened to be in Mexico when the World Cup was here in the United States, and I was struck by the serious devotion to ftbol (soccer) I found among the people there.  One day when Mexico was playing Germany (causing me, in my mixed-raced Beanerschnitzel-ness, great inner-conflict), I noticed that the town where I was staying was teeming with young people who would otherwise have been studying at the time.  I stopped a young boy and asked, Why arent you all in school?  Is there some sort of holiday or something? to which he answered, Mexicos playing, with a look on his face that said precisely, Like, duh.  My friend Kelsi was somewhat disgusted by this fanaticism, sparking a great debate between us.  I surprised myself by presenting the argument that soccer, while not being the most intellectual of pursuits, was a wonderfully unifying activity.  It was the only thing I could think of that so great a percentage of people worldwide took very seriously and agreed upon: The importance of the sports outcomes are agreed upon.  The rules are agreed upon.  That grown men should put their machismo on hold, flop, and cry to their hearts content if it means drawing the attention of the ref and, ultimately, a yellow card, is absolutely agreed upon.  To me soccer is the innocuous version of war.  (Excepting, of course, the unfortunate incidents of murder and mass-suffocation that have resulted from the games more fervent, more overzealous elementsto everything, there are extremes).  Countries from all over the world come together once every four years and settle their scores in a forum where the laws are set, the game is timed (though loosely sometimes), and everyone has the chance to cover his privates before any serious damage can be done.  Why cant men always play by the rules in this way?  American football is just a microcosm of this worldwide phenomenon.  Its a less-exciting, heavily padded, far-too-oft-stalled version of soccer, but a version all the same.  Black Hole Raider fans excluded, grown men come together to play or to cheer for their favorite teams in a normal, healthy way.  We need not kill each other to prove our superiority.  Why not just run faster, block better, or have a person on our team whose precise aim and strong gun means an extra six points rather than an extra person dead?  And theres another thing.  In all my former pooh-poohing of the Big Game, what I had neglected to consider were the humans who comprised the teams.  I had forgotten that, behind every facemask and (behind that) every snarl of threat and audible declaration of dominance, is a man with a dreama man who has, no doubt, been working day after day and year after year for the chance to be, in this exact moment, on this very field.  Who am I to criticize that?  Put aside the announcers, the commercials, the millions of dollars exchanging hands, and youve got about 100 men who are about to experience the best goddamned day of their lives.  And yeah, I support that.   P.S.  Please send any comments to  scoobisnac2000@yahoo.com

      It seems weve created a colossal monster.  Or, to be more exact, weve created millions of lesser monsters that, when considered individually, are really just singular off-shoots of (maybe roughly the size of the fingernail of) one, big, sweaty, ugly, snaggle-toothed beast: The Customer.  And how did we do this?  Well thats easy.  Someone, somewhere, in some fluorescent lit conference room came up with the phrase that would become the bane of retail and restaurant workers from then until somebody comes up with a truer (and yet equally profitable) phrasethe phrase, of course, being The customer is always right.  Whoever came up with that phrase couldnt possibly have been in contact with any  actual  customers, or at least not the kind who hang around bookstores.  I know what you all are thinking (I used to think it myself) The bookstorewhat a mellow place to work.  What a nice environment.  Books.  What could be better than working around books all day?   And to be honest, thats mostly true.  But theres a definite, lurking danger hidden below, around, and inside words like mostlythat danger being what mostly doesnt include.  Some examples:  1)  Golf Club Guy , whos been an everyday regular since the first time I worked at Barnes and Noble, about 3 years ago.  He earned his nickname by bringing (you guessed it) his golf clubs to the store with him and practicing his swing in the parking lot.  As far as I know, the man has never purchased anything more than a cup of coffee, and yet he still feels its his right to remove an entire shelf of books from the poetry section and use the then-empty shelf as his personal coffee table.  He comes to the store in the evenings, but when he was a morning customer, he was joined by the likes of:  2)  Motorcycle Man , who is also still a regular and who earned his name because of the dirt bike attached to the back of his truck.  The truck, it seems, is his bedroom, while Barnes and Noble, he seems to think, is his living room.  Then theres  3)  Obsessive-Compulsive Lady Part 1 , who used to grab a stack of books, sit on the floor in the childrens section, and tear tiny pieces off the corners of every page, creating a sea of tiny white scraps all around her.  She was soon asked to leave and was replaced by  4)  Obsessive-Compulsive Lady Part 2 , who comes in every morning and has to move a table in the childrens section over about 1  inches before she can comfortably sit and do whatever the hell it is she does all day.  5)  Que Buena , a Hispanic man who hangs around the magazine section and, when a girl he likes walks by, stares her down and says in a thick accent, OhMyGod real slowly, the words dragging out and morphing together in one long, creepy mantra.  6) Thank goodness, not a regular, is the man who was sitting in (again) the childrens section of all logical places, and masturbating while reading (naturally) a math book.  Yes, I said masturbating.  Yes, I said a math book.  Somehow, this escaped the notice of not only all the employees working, but the plainclothes security men as well.  He was only discovered, in fact, when the fruits of his labor landed (yes landed) on the leg of a woman sitting nearby, who screamed and went home to change, sanitize, and tell her husband.  She returned shortly thereafter to tell the manager, who was amazed to find the man still seated right where shed left him, still reading the same sexy math book.  He was shocked to be asked to leave and insisted on a full explanation of what was wrong with his being there.  7) There was the man who was caught stealing but who managed to escape security losing only his backpack.  They opened it to see what all hed taken and also discovered hypodermic needles and a small stash of what they figured must be heroin.  He returned a little while later, asking for his backpack, and ended up going into a full-on seizure in, of course, the childrens section.  Its a wonder there are still parents willing to take their kids there.  Luckily, I was not there to witness those last two incidents.  Once, an employee found these romantic items in a ladys bathroom stall:  an empty half-bottle of champagne, an empty box of stolen Godiva chocolates, and a pair of ladys panties.  If  that  doesnt make it into the Date Hall of Fame!  These are clearly the extreme examples and not a fair representation of the knowledge-hungry folks who comprise most of our clientele.  And its not even them who prompted me to write this.  It was the woman who called the other day with a four-book long list of requests.  The first book, we had in the store.  The second and third I happily ordered for her, but the fourth was one we couldnt get because there werent any in our warehouses and the publisher information was not provided.  Her: What do you mean you cant get it?! Me: Well, its not available from any of our warehouses. Her: Cant you call the publisher?! Me: Sometimes we can, but this publishers information is not provided.  Its possible youd have better luck at Borders(?) Her: Whats Borders? Me: Another bookstore, like ours. Her: Can you call them, then? Me: You want me to call Borders? Her:  Yeah, call them.    I should say here that her request might have stood a chance of being honored if she werent so rude.   Me:  Im sorry, were not really in the practice of making business for our competitor.  And this is where the non sequitur of all non sequiturs came:   Her:  Cant you call them for me?!  I have a bad back!  I think the fact that most customers are familiar with this Customer is always right business just works to perpetuate their spoiled, demanding behavior.  A person should be able to work in the service industry and still retain a decent amount of integrity, no?  Just ask the manager who was lucky enough to have to clean up what didnt land on the leg of sexy math mans poor victim:  Some customers are not only not right: Theyre just wrong.  Just really, really, really wrong.

      Refund checks are the best.  A tax refund check is the paramount varietymine usually hovers around the $300 range and comes exactly when I need some extra cash (ok, thats always, but still, they come when I  Most Especially  need some extra cash).  But there are other types of refund checks, of course.  Utility companies are big on these, particularly if the customer discontinues service.  They dont normally exceed, say, 10 bucks, and it can feel pretty silly to cash or deposit one, but theyre nice all the same.  A couple days ago I received a refund check from our utility company, PG&E.  I could tell from the envelope that it was a check, which is always exciting, but I tried not to get my hopes up, knowing I couldnt have overpaid them by much (weve been using the heaters with wild abandon).  Still though, I tore open the envelope and sought out the amount, picturing what I could buy (even if only a cup of coffee) with my surprise money.  Surprise indeed!  5 cents.  They sent me a check for 5 cents.  They spent  37 cents  to send me a check for 5 cents.  My check was signed by one K.M Harvey, CFO and Treasurer of PG&E, as well as Mr. Michael Donnelly, Assistant Treasurer.  I was flattered they both took the time.  First I just threw the check away, but shortly thereafter my friend Nick came by and, in telling him about it, I realized the situation was too ridiculous to simply let pass.  I fished the check out of the trash and began brainstorming with him: how best to handle this newfound wealth?  I would definitely be going to the bank with the check, but which action to take?  I could simply deposit it.  Or would it be funnier to cash it?  Nick thought I should cash it and walk away from the desk smiling, whistling, and flipping my (hopefully) shiny new nickel merrily in the air.  I could also deposit a portion of it and sign for cash back in the presence of the teller.  Nick said I should proudly declare, Yes, and Ill take two of your finest pennies, please, pointing to the teller and winking with the word finest.  I could sign it over to Nick.  How about this:  I let him strong-arm me into the bank lobby, making a big show of it.  He shoves me against the counter, clearly forcing me to fill out the necessary paperwork and capturing the attention of the guard, who decides hed better keep an eye on us.  He grabs me by the elbow very ostentatiously and leads me to the teller, where I give her his deposit slip and my 5-cent check, making a sad face and scowling at Nick like some little sister who just had her chocolate chip cookie bullied out of her.  5 cents!  Theres a notice on the bottom of the check that reads Void after 90 days.  How about I take it to the bank on the 91st day and, when they refuse to cash or deposit it, I dramatically throw my hands in the air yelling, this is  bull shit!  I have nothing more to say about that really.

      Modern man lives in a state of low-grade vitality.  Though generally he does not suffer deeply, he also knows little of true creative living.  Instead of it, he has become an anxious automaton.  His world offers him vast opportunities for enrichment and enjoyment, and yet he wanders around aimlessly, not really knowing what he wants and completely unable, therefore, to figure out how to get it.  He does not approach the adventure of living with either excitement or zest.  He seems to feel that the time for fun, for pleasure, for growing and learning, is childhood and youth, and he abdicates life itself when he reaches maturity.  He goes through a lot of motions, but the expression on his face indicates his lack of any real interest in what he is doing.  He is usually either poker-faced, bored, aloof, or irritated.  He seems to have lost all spontaneityHe spends endless time trying either to recapture the past or to mold the future.  His present activities are merely bothersome chores he has to get out of the way.  ~Fritz Perls  from  "The Gestalt Approach & Eye Witness to Therapy"  Kelsi read this quote to me from a book shes studying as part of her Masters degree in Holistic Psychology.  It struck me because it scares the hell out of me in the way that only true (and truly disturbing) ideas can.  Who would want to live this way?  And yet who could protest the truth in the statement?  How to avoid the humdrum, the mundane, the mediocre, the settling for what we can convince ourselves is good enough?  I told Kelsi that if I had significant interest, I would invent a new kind of therapy called Deathbed Therapy, whose principle tenet is so basic that one need not even include an actual therapist.  Its helped me confront fears and do things that seemed somehow beyond my capacity.  It goes like this:  When you think of something you want in life (long-term or immediate) but that seems scary, you just think, If Im lucky enough to take a graceful, deathbed exit from this life, and Im lying there reflecting, is this gonna be one of those things that I think about NOT having done and go, Stupid!  Why didnt I just  do  that?!  And now theres no going back and what was I so afraid of anyway?In a few hours Ill be dead and who cares?!  In the past, this exercise has enriched my life in little ways, from allowing me to have a damned good time while making a fool of myself on a dance floor, to bigger ways, like encouraging me to pour my heart out in a secret admirer-like love letter or taking a trip abroad by myself.  And I dont regret those things at all.  In fact, Ive never regretted the things I HAVE done.  Kelsi told me they already invented that kind of therapy: its called Existential Psychotherapy.  Fair enough.  I dont mind sharing proprietary rights with the likes of Irvin Yalom.  Really, thoughisnt it that simple?  Cant it be?  I know weve all heard this a hundred times, but that doesnt make it less true; it simply makes us less open to hearing it because the message has become trite: Life is Short.  As proof, I offer that my 10-year high school reunion is next year already.  My friends are all getting married and having kids.  I refuse to call this a quarterlife crisis.    Its a recommitment to the idea of living my life aware, awake, fully, and joyfully.  I want to say the silly thing and make the crazy decision and see the world and not think that because someone or something is different, that someone or something should be avoided, made fun of.  Think of the opportunities for fun and growth in opening up ones mind to new experiences and different people.  Think how much time weve already wasted!  I offer this NON-rhetorical question to myself and anyone interested:  What is the thing I (you) want out of this life, right now?  What stands in the way of my (your) doing that thing, having that thing, making that thing happen, right now?    Thats not a good excuse.  100 years,  max .  Why  wouldnt  I make the most of it?  I remember something an older man once told Kelsi while they shared a seat during a trip on a Greyhound bus:  Might as well make a good go of it [life], otherwise youre just turnin good food into shit.

      Those who know me well would agree that my moments of patriotism are few and far between.  Most frequently, I am struck with American pride when I happen to pass by the Civic Center just before the start of the monthly naturalization ceremony.  Hundreds of new citizens and their families will be waiting in a long line, dressed in clothing often representing their native countries, there to celebrate the reward of years of work, and waiting, and work, and waiting.  It's a reminder to me that many sacrifice much for the freedoms our country offers...it's a reminder to me that I have a great deal for which to be thankful.  And I do consider myself blessed.  I suppose it makes sense that encounters with foreign-born people could bring forth patriotism.  And yesterday I had one such encounter.  I was working at the bookstore when a man walked up to me and said, "So, do you sell a lot of books here?"  I wasn't sure if he meant "here" as in the bookstore, or "here" as in the bargain section, where I was standing when he asked.  So I asked, "do you mean 'here' as in...."  "Here.  This bookstore," he said.  "Well, yeah.  We sell quite a few books here."  "Oh.  That is very surprising to me.  I am from Europe, and it is my understanding that people in the United States don't read...they only watch T.V."  I should say that his tone was not at all surprised.  It was simply sarcastic...like he'd really been looking forward to having the chance to say this to me [to  somebody , some American, anyway].  "No," I said.  "A lot of people read here."  Again.  "Really?  Yes because this is such a big store, such a selection.  I am very surprised you sell books.  In Europe, we all believe that you don't read books in America.  You only watch T.V."  Didn't he just say that?  Was it that great a line it warranted repeating?  I was surprised to find myself feeling a little angry.  "Well, when you go back to Europe you can tell them people  actually  read in the United States...Not everybody in this country is as dumb as our president."  "Yes.  I didn't think you read here."  What the?  The thing is, I can't completely blame him.  The fact is that a lot of people DON'T read here.  And a lot of people do a lot of T.V. watching in Europe, too.  It is frustrating to me that Americans have such a bad reputation to overcome.  And yes, I understand its origins and the commonly encountered nationalism--coupled with ignorance--that keep the reputation alive.  But a stereotype is a stereotype, and it's annoying no matter where it comes from.

      It had to happen sooner or later.  There comes a day in every woman's life when she realizes she needs a new bra.  And that, my friends, is a sad, sad day.  It's not about the *idea* of a new bra.  Of course, new things are nice.  But the buying of the bra...now that's definitely less fun than a barrel of monkeys.  Trying on bras is second only to trying on bathing suits in the world of torturous activities in which women willfully engage.  I guess I was feeling masochistic yesterday.  So I battled the Valley Fair parking lot at 4:30 on a Friday afternoon (and won!  I found a spot right near the entrance.  Sure, it was the entrance on the complete opposite end of the mall from where I wanted to be, but it was a spot near the entrance nonetheless).  I dodged various obstacles including strollers, midgets, and people trying to sell me cell phones and then stopped in awe of the task in store for me when I came upon it--shining like some kind of half-angelic, half-evil beacon on the second floor of the mall--Victoria's Secret, all pink-and-white-and-blacklike.  "You're on a mission," I told myself, and mustered up a facial expression that read 'I know exactly what I'm looking for and where I'm going to find it.  You may try to speak with me if you wish, but you'll be wasting your breath.  And no, I don't need a Victoria's Secret charge card.'  So, either the sales *associate* was not skilled in face-reading, or my confidence diminished somewhere between the threshold and the first display containing underthings with no easily identifiable purpose or mode of operation.  And I'm leaning toward the latter.  "Hi!" she said.  "May I help you find something?!"  I had a few doubts about whether or not she actually could, which surfaced when I noticed her  own  boobies were only partially contained and in danger of Janet Jackson-ing at any moment.  But I reasoned she was probably aiming for that look and acquiesced.  "Yeah.  I'm looking for a strapless bra."  "Ok great!  We have a number of options for you.  Walk with me."  This was already bad news.  I didn't really  want  options.  I wanted there to be a standard-issue bra made for my purpose and I wanted it to be perfect.  But what could I do?  I followed her to a display.  "Now," she said, and looked directly, directly at my breasts.  "What size would you be, then?"  "Well it really depends on the bra."  "Shall we measure you?"  And with that, she pulled a tape measure from a holster and slung it around my back.  'Whoah there, Little Missy!,' I thought, a favorite line of my friend Wolfgang's echoing in my mind.    My inner puritan had a say as well: shouldn't we be behind closed doors (or at least somewhere other than in front of a huge, windowed store front in a busy mall) for this sort of activity?  "Ok," she said.  "We have this bra, which has a nice gel shaper in the cups."  I touched the cup and it moved.  It squished!  Bras shouldn't squish: boobies squish!  "Uh.  No, thank you.  Do you have one without padding?"  "Ok.  Why don't I just take you to the dressing room?  All the bras should be there and then we won't have to walk around and find them all separately."  This seemed like a good idea until I came to realize that "all the bras" included only two other models, and they weren't, in fact, in the dressing room.  I stood there and watched while she rifled through a number of little boxes looking for my size in the two remaining strapless models.  When she saw they weren't there, she called an invisible fellow sales person using a little hands-free cell phone attachment kind of thing and requested the bras.  This would seem like a cool trick, except that she didn't seem to know how to use the thing (there was some button she was forgetting to push) and had to repeat everything.  Additionally, she kept dropping the little speaker part down her blouse and had to fish it back out every few seconds.  We waited until the invisible sales person showed herself with only one bra in her hand.  I began to think I just might have had an easier time on my own.  Did all this hullabaloo  really  save us the "trouble" of walking around to find TWO bras on our own?  "Here you go," my helper said, "this is the [fill in the blank with something sounding like "Angel Sleak Body" or something like that] bra."  For a second I thought she was going to accompany me into the dressing room and I had to ask myself whether or not I was entirely opposed to the idea.  Despite all the superfluous fuss and the gaping holes in what's clearly trying to be excellent customer service, there was something sexy about having another woman take such a keen interest in my breasts.  At that point we were allies, united in the goal of getting me the proper support.  Maybe she'd want to see the once-impossible dream through to its fruition (?)  But she had other hapless souls to attend to.  I was now all alone in my battle.  And that bra...well, that bra beat me.  Once on, it looked like something from Madonna's "Vogue" video and felt like something you'd force onto violent mental patients to keep them at bay.  I got dressed and emerged from the dressing room, downtrodden.  There was another boobie-bulging associate there, happy to take the reins.  "How'd that work out for you?" she asked.  "Um.  Do you have a strapless bra that isn't pointy or that doesn't make me feel like my boobs are sitting on a shelf?" I asked.  "Oh yeah, let me bring you the [whatever] bra...it's much better."  And she did.  And it was.  She even walked me through the incredibly complicated 5-in-one convertible strap options.  She told me I can have straps, one strap (those tacky 80's looking blouse-styles), halter top strap (nice feature, by the way), strapless, or racerback.    I didn't know anything about racerbacks ...didn't think I owned anything with a racerback ...am not given to racing.    But whatever it is--this racerback thing--my new bra can handle it!  So yeah, I bought it.  At the register I encountered a pleasant woman who made friendly conversation and who even winked a sweet wink at me when I passed her later in the mall.  If I hadn't heard her call another female employee by the name "Mystique," I might have thought Victoria's Secret was a perfectly normal place, after all.  But it's not.  And you shouldn't go there unless you really really need a bra with racerback options.  I have to say, though, walking around the mall afterward with that little pink-and-white handle bag containing my new 5-in-one non-shelf-like, non-pointy bra, I felt a sense of accomplishment.  I felt I'd made my breasts proud.  And yes, I hope it's a long, long time before I have the need to go there again.

      Recently, Ive come to believe that few things are better than being witness to the realization of a dream.  I dont mean learning that your best friends best sex dream just became a reality, although I suppose that would be cool too.  A couple of days ago I received a graduation announcement and attached letter (on  Yale  letterhead) from my friend Tamika (one of the true, brilliant goddesses Ive had the fortune to know), whos graduating tomorrow with her degree in Classics.  In the letter, she reminded me of a day a couple of years ago when we were at work and a cheesy classical music favorites CD was playing; Pomp & Circumstance came on, and she told me then that she was considering returning to Yale (where shed been going before a short hiatus) to complete her degree.  And now here she is, cap and gown, Pomp & Circumstance and all.  The letter made me all kinds of teary, the good kind.  To know that a person I care about has worked so diligently toward accomplishing a goal, has been recognized for that hard work, and is now about to feast on the fruitswell Ill say honestly that I can think of few better things in this life.  And theres this, too: I cant wait to see what she does next.  I feel that way about all the people I know, and things are very  good  in the lives of the people around me.  My Ma is set to become a certified Feng Shui practitioner in a couple of months and loves what she does.  Her and my Pa (who is now fully recovered from a hip-replacement surgery (!) he underwent a few months ago and is working and playing as hard as ever) just completed the landscapingdone entirely by the sweat of their own browsof their gorgeous new home in Colorado.  They are both very involved in their community and Ive never seen them happier.  My brother is now working on a television show down in SoCal, just moved into a nice apartment, and his co-ed softball team (the Isotopes, Topes for short) is in first place ;)  Kelsi is chugging right along with her Masters degree in Psychology, shes written some great new songs recently, is going to Mexico for a month this summer and get her Spanish on, and is fixin to start her field placement position in the fall.  I am awash in admiration.  Nicole returned to school this semester and is writing again, which is a great thing for the world at large, by the way.  My gal's got stories that  need  to be told, and told well.  Her perfectly chosen metaphors and incredible knack for creating mood are enough to penetrate the heart and psyche of any reader.  Also, she just learned she'll be able to graduate as early as next Spring with a degree that I swear was designed just for her: it's called Creative Arts.  Awesome!  JD will walk this week (he graduated last winter) and just told me hes going to Europe for the summerGreece and Germany and wherever else the wind may carry himweeeeeeeeee.  My friend Rocky is graduating with his Masters in Philosophy and is moving back to Boulder, CO next month, a long-time dream of his.  My friends Dave (the one I accidentally knifed at work [whos healed very nicely, by the waygood job Dave]) and Ramon are both graduating from SJSU this week.   I just learned my friend Brent is starting school this fall (art school in San Francisco, which hes been talking about for years and at which he will absolutely flourishhes remarkably talented).  My sweet and lovely friend Sharon is now halfway done with her Masters in Library Science, AND she recently chose a wedding dress (which is a wondrous feat in the world of wedding planning, Im told).  Her roommate and our mutual friend Maribel is graduating this week with her Masters in Education and will begin shopping for a Ph.D program soon.  The future Dr. Rotsko (my friend Nick) just had his 2nd paper published in an academic journal of philosophy and also completed his 5th straight semester as a Presidents Scholar (4.0).  My friend Don from high school just finished his first year in the MBA program at the University of Michigan and accepted an internship on Wall Street (!) for this summer.  And I dont know if this is a bigger accomplishment for me or for my beautiful honorary niece, Maya (about to turn 2), but she just learned to say (with some, ahem, assistance), and I quote: Dodgersawesome!  Its the cutest and truest thing ever to cross the lips of a toddler.  Shes a genius!  Theres a lot to celebrate these days.  I know, I know.  One should not live ones life through the accomplishments of others.  And its not that.  What I mean by listing all this is to say that my being able to share in this good new is, I consider, a true gift in my life.  These are the kinds of things (and forgive me, my sappy language) that warm my heart.  I think its a somewhat commonly held belief that only relatively few people  really  change the world for the betterthe Martin Luther Kings, the Mother Teresas, the Eric Gagnes :).  But I would disagree with that.  I believe each personsetting out to do what it burns within her or him to doin so doing makes the world a beautiful place.  Imagine all those around you, whose lives touch yourswell, imagine them all truly fulfilled, truly happy.  That, in my mind, is a better world.  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate all these people and anyone else whos got great things going on that I havent been nosey enough to learn about yet.  I consider myself grateful to know you and admire you, and I wish youalwaysonly the very best.  P.S.  If you've never heard of Eric Gagne, I suggest a Google search :)  P.P.S.  If you've got some good news to share, please write and tell me about it (you can access my e-mail by clicking on "view my complete profile").  I'd love to hear all about it.  If it asks you to register, just make up a name or e-mail...I don't think it's too painful, but I haven't tried it so I wouldn't take my word for it.

      Its Spring Cleaning time.  Im speaking for myself, first off.  The other day I used a barbeque & Trivial Pursuit party I was hostessing as a good excuse to give my room and bathroom the old once over.  Except it was more like a twice or thrice over.  I even ended up re-painting a nothing-colored dresser that had long sat sadly in the corner of my room begging for life.  I gave it pinkbright magenta pinkwhich shut it up real good.  The cleaning felt great; seeing such a tangible change was inspiring.  But thats not the kind of cleaning I was really referring to.  Spring also brings about a different kind of cleaning: one thats at once more subtle and more palpable.  Spring, it seems, is a time for break-ups.  All around me, my friends are losing their honeys.  Some of these relationships have been years in the making.  Others have spanned a few precious months.  But when it comes to breaking up, time spent together is not necessarily relative to pain experienced when its officially over.   (Except it doesnt seem to me that many relationships truly are officially over these days.  Its like getting back together is the new breaking up.  But anyway).   What is it about this time of year?  Is it really some kind of unconscious clearing out?  I know its painful to think about it that way, especially for those who have felt the sting of an empty bed lately, but I cant help but think the witnessing of Springtime rebirth all around can rub off on the humans a bit:  Whats blooming? What needs re-seeding? Whats longing to be pruned? What isbeyond any doubtdead?  I once broke up with a boyfriend around this time of year, but I think that actually had more to do with my birthday coming.  Just like I once broke up with a boyfriend soon after my grandfather died.  Just like I was once broken up with just before Christmas.  I think events like this trigger an inner Gallup Poll that asks (and asks loudly), Is this where I want to be in my life?  Is this the person I want to be celebrating with now?  My friend just told me about watching the full moon with her man last night and thinking how shed watched the full moon on a previous occasion with somebody she felt less-than-thrilled about moon gazing with.  The same thing happened to me before.  I was on a date when the man said we should go for a drive and look at the moon, and I was so happy when driving circumstances prevented it from happening.  The voice inside me was screaming, I dont   want   to look at the moon with you!    Or maybe it was, I dont want to look at the moon with   you  .  And that date was a first and a last.  A full moon is nothing to be trifled with.  The moon, you see, should only be shared casually with coincidental bystanders, or passionately with good, good friends or the honey of your hearts desire.  And when the full moon or the brilliance of Spring or a birthday or a major holiday comes around and the honey youre with is not of your hearts desirewell, thats a tough day.  Thats a real tough day for everybody involved.  I want to wish a personal rebirth to all those who are aching right now.  I wish there were something I could do to make it feel better, but I know I cant.  A breakup without mourning could only come after a relationship that was insignificant to being with.  I know yours were not of that category and so I hope your healing processes are thorough andultimatelyrefreshing.  Kahlil Gibran wrote, when you experience sorrow, know that you are weeping for that which has been your delight.  May you take this time for personal growth and, in the end, find someone with whom you can relax, someone who wants nothing more than to watch the moon with you.

      Much of the time, in the world of management (I'm learning), there are way too many things to do.  But on rare occasions (such as tonight) you  find  things to do.  Or somebody else finds them for you.  Tonight, my boss decided that the gum needed to be scraped off the hardwood and tile floors around our store.  My first response when I heard this, was, "There's  gum  on the hardwood and tile floors?"  She looked at me like I was a leprechaun.    Yeah, she said.    This is how good managers are: they notice the little things.  So I grabbed a blade and set to scraping.  Scraping gum off any kind of flooring turns out to benot surprisinglyquite a humbling experience.  But there are a few things that can take the humbling exercise up a couple of notches.  Like when a little girl (7 years-old or so) standing nearby a particularly gummy spot I was working on asked me what I was doing; said, ewwww, when I told her; then scratched her head and said, it looks like youre ruining the floor with that blade.  Thank you.  Yeah, I said, but we dont have anything else to get it off with.  Then her friend piped in and, pointing to a big glob of gum a few feet away, said, Theres some more over there.  Are you gonna get that?  Thanks.  Thanks again.  Theres something very intimate about digging into a months-old glob of gum with a box cutter blade and revisiting the smell of spearmint that had been locked in below the surface and trampled upon by a million anonymous feet.  Wow, I thought when the aroma hit me, this was in some strangers mouth.  And now I get to scrape it up.  Its a kind of intimate you could very well live a lifetime without experiencing and be, methinks, just fine.  There are some tasks that I never give a second thought...things that are taken care of invisibly, things that just get done somehow.  I was thinking about this when we did inventory the other night.  The freaky people from RGIS were there (and I only say freaky" because it always creeps me out how there are like 1,500 of them who come swarming into wherever theyre working that night and just type numbers into little computers all night like  Night of the Living Dead: The Accountants Return .  And they hardly say a word.  If youve ever worked in retail during inventory, you probably know what Im talking about.  Really, its a little scary).  Well, I realized that people dont EVER give a thought to those people unless theyre working somewhere and it happens to be inventory night.  And then the RGIS people are seen as the enemy because theyve invaded the store and who the hell wants to be there for inventory anyway?  The RGIS people are always being yelled at to rescan a section or to stop making a mess or to just be faster (if that were humanly possible).  Plus, they always work overnight and have to go on break at the same time like some kind of zombie herd.   Now THAT is a thankless job.  And then there's the work that janitors do every single day.  And I do mean every single day; the janitors at my store work 7 days/week.  They clean the store in the morning and then have to return in the afternoon to restock the bathroom supplies.  Sometimes theyll be all dressed up because they had to leave a party or some other event just to come make sure the customers at Barnes & Noble would be able to comfortably wipe their asses.  These are customers, by the way, who cant even manage to keep gum in their mouths.  I walked into the restroom the other day and a co-worker who was on her way out warned me not to go into the first stall.  Whats in the 1st stall? I thought.  But I knew I didnt want to know what was in the 1st stall because whatever it was, it promised to be gross.  I wondered how many other people had walked in and walked right out of that same stall because they didnt want to deal with whatever was waiting in there.  Then I wondered absently when it would be taken care of.  And I remembered: the janitor women would be in at 7:00 the next morning.  They would take care of it.  They would unclog the toilet or wipe the crap off the seat or pick the bloody tampon off the floor.   They  would do it.  That thoughtthinking of it in those termsmakes me want to cry.    How could this be okay?  How could we have agreed to this setup, collectively?     And I think its kind of disturbing that scraping gum off a floor is an experience for mesomething I can examine from afar like a detached anthropologist and have the leisure to write a blog about.  ' Hmmmhow did that make me feel? '  And for others, its a living.  Its what you do to make ends meet.  I wish I could give a big hug of gratitude to the people who work tirelessly in thankless jobs that are truly service orientedlike, the Ultimate kind of service.  I want them to know that there are people who see them, who appreciate them, who know they are so many heros working so many miracles, day after day.

      Well, just because I opened my mouth the last time, I had to stop by real quick to say that last night's Game 2 of the Finals was one of the best games I've ever seen, of  any  sport.  Kobe's 3-pointer with 2.3 seconds on the clock to tie the game...priceless.  And how 'bout that Luke Walton?  I don't know about any of you sports fans, but I thought he was the sole source of Laker energy for a good part of the game.  Eight assists!  Ok, and that's all I have to say about that.

      When my brother came to visit me in San Jose last month, we took a little trip to the drugstore on the corner, where he found the best pair of sunglasses he'd ever seen.  They hung lonely and faded on a revolving rack that had clearly been displaying the same glasses for at least 19 years.  The pair he zeroed in on were fluorescent yellowfaded fluorescent yellowwith a strange sort of ventilation device on the sides.  They supported a fortress of lens that would prevent even the most determined ray of light from penetrating through to the wearers eyes.  But the best feature, by far, was a faded tag attached to the center of the frames that read Future Vision in a 1980s Tron-like computer font.  He had to have them.  Hey bro, you  did  just have a birthday, I said.  Put them in my cart.  This was before I flipped over the Future Vision tag and discovered that inflation had somehow retroactively caught up with these babies: their  original  price tag read $12.99.  We nearly peed our pants laughing.  For those?! Kris asked.  Youve got to be kidding.  We went back and forth.  I said I didnt mind paying that, that I just wanted to see him happy in the way that only these beauties could make him.  He thought $4.00, the price on a nearby (albeit less exciting) pair was more like it.  So we took both pairs to the front of the store and pleaded our case.  The counter man looked at me, looked at my brother, looked and the glasses, looked at my brother, and said, $4.00.  Kris beamed a victory smile and then turned to take the comparison glasses back to their rack.  The counter man mused in his thick Middle Eastern accent, He looks very happy now.  You have no idea, I said.  Kris wore those glasses for the weekend and then carefully packed them up for his return to Hollywood, where people apparently share his aesthetic sensibilities.  Hes been standing on street corners and had cars pull over, their drivers asking where they could get a pair just like his.  Sorry, he says, youll have to go to San Jose.  Recently, he was wearing his Future Visions on a street in Hollywood when a homeless man approached him and asked him if Kris wanted to buy the sunglasses  he  had to offer.  It seems the man knew his audience because my bro snatched up this pair (brown monster shades with the word "sport" written in gold on the side), which immediately took top billing in his sunglass wardrobe.  Well, Im in Colorado right now visiting my parents.  They flew Kris and I both in, and Kris was kind enough to bring both pairs to share with us.  Youll find us all modeling them below.  Please dont be jealous.  I know it must be heartbreaking to realize there will likely never be another pair quite like the Future Visions, or another homeless man offering quite the same pair (for 50 cents) in YOUR neck of the woods, but I hope these pictures will be enough to bring you at least some of the joy weve experienced here this week.

      I just want to add something to my last post.  I think I was insensitive in comparing relationship endings to Spring Cleaning.  In doing so, I did not mean to imply that the people involved were in any way comparable to things that should be thrown away and forgotten about.  What I mean to say is that, sometimes, assessing things leads to the conclusion that something in one's life isn't working, perhaps for  either  party (important to note)--and SOMEbody has to do the breaking up.  When I said that somethings were "dead," I did not mean to say the people involved were no longer of any use, just that relationships themselves can grow stagnant.  I hope that was the way my words were taken, but in the event that they weren't taken this way, I apologize for my insensitivity and for any part of what I said that came across as flippant or trivializing.  I've been through a breakup that rendered me very much lost and in despair, so I know what it's like...and it's no trivial thing.  To anybody whose feelings I hurt, please accept my most sincere apologies.

      When I was a young girl, I had a prayer I would say every night.  It started with the standard little kid prayer: Now I lay me down to sleep and then changed a bit, I think because my parents didnt want me to get freaked out by the whole if I should die before I wake business.  Well after that part, there was a little add-on wherein I gave shout outs to all the people I knew.  I still remember it, verbatim:  God bless Mommy and Daddy  and Kris and Kisa [don't know why the talking about myself in the 3rd person; this was pre-Elmo]  and Nana and Tata [grandparents on the Mexican side]  and Oma and Opa [grandparents on the German side]  and all our aunts and uncles and cousins and friends,   and Kris and his spots ,  in Jesus name, amen."   Kris and his spots?   As you might know, Kris is my brother.  Spots was the kid term my parents taught us to describe Kris  vitiligo  [vih-dill-EYE-go], technically defined as "a skin condition resulting from loss of pigment, which produces white patches."  Kris' vitiligo appeared on his hands, elbows, and knees, and the spots would alternately grow and diminish as he got older.  The doctors couldnt predict whether they would ever stabilize, so the possibility of their growing to cover a significant portion of his skin was very real.  Thinking about that prayer now, I realize it would be difficult for anyone who overheard it to know whether we were praying for the disappearance of the spots or for their continued growth and power.  It almost sounds like we were hoping his skin would, everyday, look less and less like its original shade (described affectionately by my mom as poodoo brown) and more and more like the shade of my own (which she calls stock white).  But we knew.  We definitely knew.    The spots were evil. They made him stand out. The kids at school teased him.  The spots were a kids worst nightmare.  So imagine my surprise when the spots earned a new place of merit in our family just the other evening.  Indulge me while I provide a little background information.  Kris is currently working as a production assistant on a Lifetime television show called Merge.   Production Assistant  is a very broad title that could refer to anything from actual technical assistance to the picking up of the directors dry cleaning.  Kris position falls somewhere in-between the two.  Merge is a quote/unquote reality show in which a couple that has recently married moves into a new place together.  The designers on the show decide which of their things can stay and go, and they do a makeover on the new space once everything is in place.    Production assistants on this show work as movers.  Theyre the ones who put the couples things where the designer decides they should go.  Now, there are a few production assistants working on any given episode, and sometimes the camera shots are so quick its difficult to tell whos who (because even the movers, in this case, get airtime).  My mom had taped last weeks show, and we sat down and watched it together when Kris and I were out visiting last week.  We were all sitting in front of the t.v. on-edge, hoping to catch a glimpse of my bro on the tube.  Sometimes we could see him very clearly and up close, and sometimes it was more of a challenge.  Once, it was up for debate because only the persons arm was in view.   Was that him or wasnt it?   Kris solved the mystery with this line:  No, thats me.  Look, you can see my vitiligo.  Huh, we answered, collectively.  "Well be darned.  That  is  your vitiligo.    We joked a little about the vigor with which he reported the clue:  Look, look, its my condition.  Its my disorder.  Its my defect.  Its  ME !!   Its me.  The moment caused me to pause, thinking how far wed come from hoping the spots would just go away.  Just go away!  And to be honest, they havent been an issue for Kris for a good 15 years.  In fact, hes always had a strong sense of self and I suspect the condition was always more troubling for my mom than for Kris.  He was her child, and this was something that had the potential to cause him heartache.  Kids can be so cruel.  And yet even as hes long past being self-conscious, to hear my brother so proudly identify himself using the condition we once saw as so threatening we tried to pray it away  every single night ...  ...that was kind of cool.  Its interesting the way things that make us different can change from enemy traits to ally traits in the course of a few years.  I used to hate being so tall (particularly in middle school and high school, where Amazon women arent in real high demand).  I also disliked my name because it was weird and people couldnt pronounce it (Keisha, Keeza, Kissa?).  Now Im happy to be an Amazon woman with a weird name, partially  because  those things make me different.  Oh my god, Ive lapsed into After School Special mode again.  Forgive me, but I really feel this way.  I hope that if I ever have a kid with three arms or an extra face in the middle of his backwell, I hope he or she can learn to embrace that trait and, eventually, use it to his or her advantage: Can I lend an extra hand?  I know my back was turned officer, but believe me, I  did  see the robber, and he went  thataway !  I mean really, who wants normal?  How boring.  And so yeah, God bless Kris and his spots.

      For anyone who doesnt know, besides my job at Barnes & Noble, I have a part-time job teaching adult ESL (English as a second language) to employees of Whole Foods.  Its a pretty sweet deal for the students because they dont have to pay for the classes or even leave the store.  And some of them truly appreciate it and work hard, showing up for every single twice/week class and studying enthusiastically when theyre at home.  Francisco is not one of those students.  Now, he definitely  wants  to learn, especially because hes been working at Whole Foods for roughly 15 years and cant be promoted any further until his English skills improve.  And he tries.  But he has some deeply ingrained bad English-speaking habits that are incredibly difficult to break and, well, he doesnt do his homework.  Anyway, I didnt bring him up so I could publish his progress report, but I wanted to give a little background.  So, the other day Francisco was telling the story of a party a friend once threw him when he was working at a Whole Foods in Palo Alto.  This is how he tells it:  She make me a party and she rent a, its a, how you call?  Like a when you have wedding?  A reception hall?  I ask.  Yes, well, and we have dancing and carne asada.  I make the salads and also some soup.  We have DJ he play the msica, and it was the best party in my life: water for EVERYBODY!  He says this last part while spreading his arms wide to illustrate the amount of people who enjoyed this particular aspect of the party.  His eyes are all lit up, like he is just  so proud  for having pulled off water for everybody.   Water ?! I ask.  What do you mean?  You just served water?  Yes, he says, still beaming his self-congratulatory smile, for  everybody .  I was laughing, but I was also trying to figure out what was so special about this water and his ability to procure it for everybody.  Was it a drought year?  Was it that they were extra hot & sweaty from dancing and he was happy there was enough for everyone?  And who serves water at a party anyway?  His classmates were all laughing at him until he clarified that he was talking about  aguas , fresh drinks they make in Mexico using water and other things like rice or fruits (horchata, tamarindo, those sorts of drinks).  He was proud because he made the drinks, and apparently they were a big hit.  Oh, he hates alcohol and wouldnt allow any of his guests to drink it, so I guess he figured hed better have a good alternative.  Somehow, despite the fact that he speaks English a lot better than my beginning students, Franciscos particular brand of miscommunication always makes me have to try (often horribly unsuccessfully) and stifle a giggle.  The other day he was talking about how he bought a house in a town called Madera and was going to be renting it out.  Its a big house, but hes renting part of it to a family of three for only $300/month.  We were all intrigued, wondering how hed make the payments if he had to pay rent here, too, and he was charging so little.  Oh, he said.  Theres another man, he wanna stay there.  I gonna rent him a room for $300/month and 3 horses.  Three horses? asked Rosi, another student.  Yes, $300 a month and 3 horses.  What do you mean, youre charging him 3 horses per month? I asked.  Yes, 3 horses.  Horses are very expensive, said Rosi.  An image came to mind of a future snapshot of Francisco standing outside his home in Madera, surrounded by hundreds of horses, which have been breeding and making him a rich man.  In the snapshot, hes wearing his same ultra-happy smile and spreading his arms to show off the fruits of his ingenuity.  I had to come to and get to the bottom of this.  What are you gonna do with all those horses? I asked.  "How can he afford to give you 3 horses per month?!"  Whachyou mean?" Francisco asked.  "Its just 3 horses.  Oh, 3 horses total?  Yeah, he keep 3 horses there.  I charge him $100/month each horse.  Oh!  The collective light bulb went on and we all relaxed a little, now that we didnt have to go on and worry where Francisco would get the money to feed 3 new horses every month.    I love my English classes.  And trying to help my students through their struggles with this language makes me appreciate it more, not in spite of all of its idiosyncrasies, but because of them.  Many concepts I teach require tangential explanations of the exceptions to the rules, the connotations if you say the thing the wrong way, the 16 alternate meanings (do you know how many ways you can use the words pick up together?), or the 6 words that either look just like it and mean something different, or sound just like it but are spelled differently and mean something else entirely.  You know, it feels good to know something well.  And its FUN to meditate on a question a student asks and think, how  do  we use that?  Would that be more or less polite?  And why?'   And also, my students know Spanish with an intimacy that my 2nd language learner skills will never allow me.  I think it must feel good for them to know something well, too.  I can see it in their faces when I ask them how to say something in Spanish, or when I say something wrong and they have to correct me.  Theres a feeling of accomplishment when you can confidently say, I know this.  No, I KNOW this.  And I can help you.  And having something to teach to people who want to learn is rather addictive.  So Im going to grad school in the Spring and learn me some more. :)

      We got the news on a Tuesday.   I came to work at noon and was stopped in the doorway by my store manager, Tony.   You know those display changes I told you about? he asked in his slight Texas drawl.   Yeah, what about em?   I want you to put that all on hold for a coupla weeks, he said. We got somethin much bigger to work on now.   I looked at him, anticipating the news, and he motioned for me to follow him to the managers office. While I followed, I tried to imagine what could be much bigger than completely rearranging three full sections of the store.   Sit down, he said.   I complied, then watched him smirk for a few seconds before I gave in. Tony, what is it? I asked.   He smiled for a moment more, then came out with it: Bill Clinton, he said.   What?!   Bill Clinton.   "...is coming to our store?   "...is coming to our store.   When?   The 29th.   Of  this  month?   Of this month.   I was back on my feet by that time. No  WAY , I protested, a full smile taking over the bottom half of my face.   He took in my reaction for a moment, seeming to enjoy my bubbling-over-ness.   Way, he nodded.   And thats how it started.   ***   Just under a week later, there were customers lined up outside the front doors to be the first to purchase Clintons memoir,  My Life .   The press (and, hence, the public) had gotten wind of our news five days earlier, and all the days in between had been spentmore than anything elseanswering phone calls about the event.   We were given little information, but that didnt stop customers from asking any possible question you could (never) dream up and expecting not only answers, but the answers they wanted to hear:   I live in Missouri, and so I cant make it to the signing. But is there any way you could send me a signed copy of the book?  Sure thing, Maam. In addition to the 1,000 books he signs that day for customers who will have been camping out for upwards of 35 hours, eating nothing but 7-11 food and pooping in Porta Potties, as well as the 1,000 he signs earlier that day for customers at another bookstore in Berkeley, well make sure he signs just 1 morespeciallyfor the woman in Missouri who couldnt make it.    If I get my book signed, but then I read it and dont like it, may I still return it?  This woman had never heard of eBay(?) And another thing: does that mean she always reads through books first and returns them if she "doesn't like them?" How cheap and shifty is that?!    An interesting phenomenon occurred.&nbsp; It seemed that, when it came to an event like this, people had never been more proud to be handicapped. All of a sudden, everyone was an invalid:   I just had a surgery [no mention of what type of surgery; it could have been oral surgery for all we knew]. Will there be a special line for me?   And not only that,  bona fide  handicapped people became a precious commodity:   My Moms in a wheelchair, and I have to push it. Can we get in the front of the line?   But the worst was the man who came out with this one after his 45 minutes of attempting to finagle special treatment proved fruitless:   Well, my 9-year old son had cancer before. Will there be a special line for him?   You say he had cancer  before ? I asked. We...I mean...can he stand in a line? Can he  stand ?   Well, yes. But, I mean, hes still...you know, I mean, hes kind of sick.   People will stop at nothing. Just when that kid thought hed defeated cancer, just when he was trying to put the near-death experience behind him, his dad jumped at the chance to (if this is at all possible) relapse him himself. Cheesh.   But aside from all the phone calls (which were actually kind of fun to answer when the callers were excited and not trying to convince us they were special), there was a lot of work to be done.   A lot of work.   There were walls to be painted, carpets to be cleaned, displays to be merchandized, shelves to be dusted, books to be shelved, caf items to be ordered, and everything to be everythinged.   Its not that we feared Bill Clinton would run his forefinger over our dusty shelves, clicking his tongue and vowing never to come back to our filthy store. But having a former president as a guest tends to attract, well, everybody. All of a sudden we had managers from all over the district pledging their help for the big day. And the bigwigsthe bigwigs were coming out of the woodwork. With all those Suits on the way, the store had to be at what our managerwhos sometimes given to hyperbolecalled, officially, 112 %.   And so we painted and we cleaned and we merchandized and we dusted and we shelved and we ordered and we everythinged.   Twice, for good measure.   ***   As the Big Day came closer, our collective nerves grew shorter. We all wanted to delete the words line, book, and sorry Sir, one-legged people still have to stand in the initial line for a wristband, just like everybody else from our vocabularies.   And some people began to show rabid enthusiasm. I heard from Tima self-proclaimed loyal customer who is apparently at our store all the time (though Id never seen him)no less than 5 times in the days leading up to the event. I think he figured a personal relationship with a manager would earn him the necessary ins.   And then, of course, there was Babette.   My mistake with Babette was to happen to be the manager on duty the first time she called. This is Kisa, how may I help you? Id asked.   Hi Kisa. My name is Babette and I just got out of the hospital. I got out 1 day earlier than I was supposed to, actually, just so I could make it to the Bill Clinton signing.   Great, I thought, here we go.   But it turned out Babette wasnt asking for special treatment. She was just sharing this particular detail of her life in the same way she would eventually share  many  particular details of her life with me during her bi-hourly cell phone update calls from the road.   Babette, you see, was driving up from Texas.   Id given many verbal sets of directions to the store that week, but directions to the store from Texas?   Im just outside of L.A., she said, during a phone call Saturday afternoon. Is there a line yet? (Note here, the event wasnt to happen until Tuesday night).   No, Babette. Theres still no line.   Yes, but have you overheard anybody talking about camping out?   Well, yes. I know some people plan to.   Well, are they there yet?   Uh, no. Theres no line yet.   Do you know when theyre planning to begin camping out?   No, I really dont know for sure.   Well, Ill get there some time tomorrow morning. Im going to get a hotel outside of San Jos. Or do you think I should get one near you? I mean, is there one with windows that overlook your store so Ill be able to know the second the line starts to form?   And on, and on.   She was asking for me by name when she called thereafter.  Theres  my favorite bookseller, shed say, when I picked up the phone.   Hi, Babette, Id choke out.   Ive talked to you so many times, she said. I cant wait to meet you.   Yeahme too.   ***   The magic phone call came late Sunday night, and shockingly, it wasnt from Babette.   Hi, a young mans voice said. My names Rick, and, uh, my friends and I are a few hours outside of San Jos right now. Is there a line yet?   No, I said. Not yet.   Well, do you mind if we camp out?   Go for it, I said. It looks like youll be Mr. Line Starter Man.   Cool, he said. Well be there soon.   And so Rick came.   And shortly thereafter, Babette came.   And after that, they just kept coming.   ***   The morning of the event, I spent an inexcusable amount time getting dressed. I wasnt exactly banking on meeting Mr. Clinton, but just in case,  just in case did I think hed like the black slacks and jacket or the dark blue with pin stripes? Or should I wear a dress?   For the record, it was the dark blue with pin stripes.   When I arrived at work at 11:30 in the morning, there were people lined up all the way around the back of the parking lot. This wasby all accountsa significant change from earlier in the morning, when the line had formed an entire loop around the store, continuing all the way down the street neighboring it, stopping somewhere near the freeway underpass.   Those people had changed their minds about standing in line and were now inside the store, forming mini-mob scenes around each individual manager, screaming like mental patients whod just found out Soylent Green was (indeed) people.   I should have known the day wasnt going well when the first thing I said to my boss was, nice bullhorn.   From all accounts I could gather, some kind of mayhem had broken out around 4:00 a.m., and&nbsp;all the commotion was a bit much for our&nbsp;rent-a-cops to deal with it. Somehow, people jumped over a fence and cut in line and all these people who thought getting there at 2:00 a.m. would be plenty to ensure them a signing, gotultimatelyswept out of the line.   And they were pissed.   There was a smallish coup, during which&nbsp;some people returned their Bill Clinton books and cheered each other as they did so. I dont know that I was particularly affected by these people, who must not have been huge fans of the former president if they had no interest in his book beyond his signing it. But it was stressful, nevertheless.   And I understood their frustration. Some of them were very polite and pleaded their cases in civilized manners that made sense.  But there were the others who just wanted to yell at somebody, and for them, it was hard to muster sympathy.   Some people truly seemed to think meeting Mr. Clinton was not a privilege, but a right, which I found very confusing. How could he have possibly signed the books of all the people who thought he was cool? There just wasnt enough time in the day.   My favorite customer was one who brought his walker in to illustrate the extent to which he was not qualified to stand in line. And he wasnt among the fortunate to receive the necessary wristband. He was chewing out a completely innocent employee whom wed borrowed from a nearby store, and he wouldnt let up.   Excuse me, Sir, may I help you with something?   Yeah. Are you a manager?   Yes.   Well, I just want you to know that this is a  black eye  on the face of Barnes &amp; Noble. And this is just the beginning. Its going to get much,  much  worse. He stared at me unblinkingly, waiting for me to react in shock and horror and a million ass-kissing apologies.   I guess my, Im sorry you werent able to get a wristband, sir, and I thank you for your feedback wasnt really what he was looking for, so he went on:   And you should know that my son works for ABC news, channel 7.   Okay.   And he just kept staring at me. I had to excuse myself after a few rounds of this because there was a fire to put out at a cash register. He came over there after a few minutes and interrupted a conversation I was having with another customer.   This is a bad,  bad  thing youve done for San Jos," he said, shaking his head dramatically. "A bad,  bad  thing.   Okay, thank you sir. Is there anything else I can help you with?   And just so you know, my son is Michael Something, ABC news, channel 7. Okay?!   Okay. And yeah, I actually heard you when you said that earlier.   I had to wonder how many times this man had been unhappy in the past and thrown around the name of his son, as if his son were just around every corner, waiting for somebody to&nbsp;screw his dad over and ready to launch a full-scale investigation.   The man shuffled off with his walker, in search (I can only imagine) of another person in a suit to whom he could drop Michael Somethings name.   Shortly after that I was called to the caf for reasons I cant remember. At the counter stood an elderly female customer in a huge, aqua-colored muumuu with big, tropical purple flowers on it. She looked at me, read my name tag, and said, Youre Kisa?!   Yes, I said. And you must be Babette.   Howd you know?   I dont know. Just a guess.   I got my wristband, she said, shaking her fist in the air and beaming the happiest smile Id seen all day.   Congratulations, I said, and truly meant it. And for the first time since my arrival hours earlier, I felt good.   ***   There were, following, about 5 hours of relative calm. I took the opportunity to walk around outside and meetamong others Rick, Mr. Line Starter Man, a friendly young guy who got his 15 minutes of fame on all four local news shows, including the Spanish station.   At that point, the fans were as mellow as people whove been sitting in the sun for two days  should  be, reading and eating and playing guitar and cards and Gameboy, and talking. They brought their lawn chairs, their umbrellas, their water bottles, their children, andmost of alltheir Anti-Bush t-shirts. There was a like-minded happiness hovering in the air and, below that layer, a nervous sort of anticipation that can only come when people are about to experience one of the most memorable moments of their lives.   The feeling was there for me, too. I know  Ill  never forget the trickle of unknown liquids dripping down my leg as Kenneth (a fellow manager) and I carried bags and bags of heaping garbage to the dumpsters around the corner of the store. It builds character, he said, when a woman nearby made a comment about the yuckiness of the work in which he and I were engaged.   Amen, I thoughta little manual labor is good for the soul.   ***   About four hours before Mr. Clintons scheduled arrival, the Secret Service arrived. They looked just exactly like youd imagine theyd look, wearing near-identical grayish-brown suits and, yes (some of them), sunglasses (they were standing outside for much of the time). They all looked to be in their early thirties, handsome, capable, and the most serious bunch of dudes youve ever seen.   They walked the perimeter, peeked under things, set up barriers, chatted with us, and mostly stood around looking like the bad asses they were.   The SJPD brought in the German shepherds in the early evening, and they sniffed every sniffable thing in the entire store. We watched, and ate, and watched, and waited.   ***   At 8:00 p.m., I took to my post, an area near some shelves that had been cleared away for the placement of bags. People would have to check in their belongings, be wanded by the Secret Service, and go forth to meet Mr. Clinton with nothing in their hands but their soon-to-be-very-valuable copies of his memoir.   We werent sure which entrance hed chose, so my cohorts, Beum, Traci, and I, tried to relax and chat while watching for a glimpse of the familiar gray hair and feeling around for a tiny waft of the air of presidential-ness.   A loud cheering coming from the customers in the caf, who were seated a good bit higher than the floor level and could see better, alerted us that the moment had arrived. Our District Manager, Greg, walked by and said, guys...were rolling. And he gave a definitive nod at the end.   Were rolling.   The words never sounded less cheesy and more crucial than they did at that moment.    Oh my God, were rolling. Whatever that means, guys, were doing it. Here we go    The line started moving from the front, and then all of a sudden, they were there: the fans, already done with the experience and ready to collect their bags.   Bill Clinton, you see, is a very fast book signer.   But the people didnt seem to mind at all. They emerged flushed and joyful and some of them in tears. The women swooned. The men were proud. The kids had no idea what the hell was going on, but they were excited, too.   I kept trying to catch a peek in between two curtains that would separate every now and then. But there were hoards of people standing in the store behind me (behind rope barriers) trying to do the same thing, so the Secret Service man and woman standing in front of the curtains repeatedly drew them shut.   Then, he did it. The Secret Service man looked at me and gave a little wave. Come here, it said.   I walked over to him.   You wanna see? he asked.   I felt like an adolescent boy whod just been offered a gander at his friends sisters boobies.   Yeah, I said, my faceIm sureglowing all kinds of pure, Technicolor girliness.   He drew back the curtain a little. Go ahead, he said, and smiled a smile that said this was one of his favorite parts of the job: helping make a person feel that kind of yay.   In front of a black curtain, underneath bright semi-spotlights, stood my president, the one Id voted for the year I was first eligible, the one I hadnt quite let go of yet.   He was smiling and handsome and attentive, never looking up from the people immediately in front of him, whose books he was signing and whose hands he shook.   It was so hard not to gawk, but I pulled myself away; there were, after all, bags to be put away and then retrieved. But a moment later, I had another go.   A Secret Service man came out from behind the curtain and asked a nearby co-worker, Ellen, whether there was anything we could do about the music?   What do you mean? she asked. He wants it turned down?   No, he said, sounding offended at the idea. "He wants it turned  up . Were rocking back here.   She looked at me.   Well, I said, theres a volume control, but its in the managers office. Id turn it up for you, but Im not allowed back there.    Ill  take you back there, he said. And there was that same Secret Service man smile. Like he just knew he was making my night.   We walked behind the curtain and I tried to maintain conversation with him while thinking, Im in the same [albeit large and sprawling] room with Bill Clinton.   I know this sounds silly, but its difficult to describe the level of energy and excitement in the room. It was more than Id ever imagined it would be.   He loves Motown, the Secret Service man (Cory) said.   Oh, you mean he chose this mix?   Absolutely. Its his favorite.   Which just endeared him to me even more.   Once the music was turned up, the mood in the store went from jovial to ecstatic. Everyone was laughing and dancing and singing (because  everybody  knows the words to Motown hits). I laughed when I had to go retrieve bags, which were collected in the area near where the Secret Service men searched people; it was funny to see these Most Serious Men in the Whole World barking orders like spread your arms!, and turn around!, and put that down! with this super jumping Motown music in the background. I dont know where they find people like that, but Im glad they do, because somebody has to keep a straight face when the rest of us are feeling silly and there are people to be searched. I mean, Im sure that comes in handy.   We went through this routine for about an hour and a half: get the bag, give it a number, set it on the shelf, oh! here comes the person, howd it go? was it worth it?, yes, it was amazing, get the number, grab the bag, give it back, see ya later.   There was an impatient mob of people outside who had the idea they might get their books signed if Mr. Clinton decided to stick around after the first 1,000 people had passed through. At one point they started chanting,  Please sign our books, please sign our books!!!  with so much force, it ended up sounding like the rudest polite request ever made, rhythmically, to the beat of angry fists. Those chanters put a bit of a damper on the moods of those leaving (otherwise) happythe lucky ones. I thought they were going to get violent until the bullhorn came out again, asking them to shut the hell up and leave us all in peace...only, you know, in a more diplomatic way. Surprisingly, they mostly complied.   And when the last few customers trickled through the line and collected their things, a quiet settled in among us.   We werent sure what to do next, so we all began to congregate near the bag check and wait for some kind of sign. There we were, about 60 employees looking around at each other and the Secret Service men and hardly saying a word. I felt like I was in church, only some kind of newfangled, fun one where they blasted Motown music and the president popped in for a visit every now and then.   And then, even the music stopped.   Okay, Tony practically whispered, lets everyone get in a single-file line.   We did so, still not quite sure what would happen next.   Then the curtains parted and we noiselessly filed into the room and took places on the media staging that had been set up directly in front of the signing table. Mr. Clinton didnt look up at us then. He stood talking quietly with an older couple that seemed to be friends of his. We watched while they chatted, laughing every now and then like talking with the leader of the free world for eight years running was the most everyday thing they do.   And we still werent saying a thing, just watching as if through a two-way mirror, seeing something we werent supposed to see.   And then he shook hands with the couple, said goodbye, and turned to us.   Is this the class portrait? he asked.   We laughed nervously. He looked down at the place that had been cleared for him to sit, surrounded by young women, while the photographer took his light readings.   Ladies, he said, in his Arkansas twang, Im not sure you want to be seen with me like this, he joked. And he sat.   One shot, two, three for good measure: we smiled the smiles of our lives.   The pictures done, he turned and began shaking hands. I couldnt hear what anybody was saying to him, and I wasnt sure I knew what to say myself.   When my moment came, I managed a simple, thank you, and tried to freeze-dry in my mind the two seconds when I held in my hand the hand of a man whod held in his hand the hands of hundreds of country leaders and diplomats, the hands of millions of fellow Americans, the hand of John F. Kennedy himself.   When he was done shaking, he looked around. I always thought Id like to work in a bookstore, he said. Now, were in the childrens section? Its huge. Its real nice. He walked around admiring the displays, and I thought of Sharonthe childrens department leadall her hard work being taken in and appreciated by one of the most important figures of our century, indeed, our entire countrys history, and I was joyful.   ***   The night didnt end like that, though. There were Ren and Kelly, two women who had been working away and hadnt even realized we were all posing for pictures and meeting Mr. President. And they were, of course, both in tears.   So that was terrible to witness...the loss of a moment that could never been regained or done over.   And there were all the displays to put back in order, the line posts to be carted off, the food to be cleared, the signing area to be disassembled, the receiving room to be rearranged, and the closing numbers to be run.   And then wed go.   Except, not quite. Tony issued one final directive as he drove away from his 20-hour day, preparing to start all over again a mere 6 hours later. Kenneth, he said, lets get this trash in the parking lot taken care of.   It didnt sound so bad at first. When I heard, I told Kenneth Id be out in a minute to help. And when I saw what awaited us there, I wanted to run back inside and hole myself up in the deepest, indeed even the creepiest (where nobody would look for me), darkest corner I could find.   Thousands of people sitting in the sun for two days, not wanting to visit a trash can and accidentally lose a place in line, produce staggering amounts of waste.   Staggering.   We both took our coats off, rounded up our fellow victims, grabbed trash bags and gloves, and set to stooping and sweeping and picking up between thumb and forefinger some of the nastiest who-knows-what type of remnants imaginable. There were diapers and Popsicle sticks and burger wrappers and newspapers and Coke cans and cigarette butts; everything was sticky, and everything stunk. It dripped on us and gooed on us and clung to us.   At one point I stopped and looked up. The lights in the parking lot were low, so all I could see were the silhouettes of my coworkers outlined as they performed a task Im sure they never dreamed would be par for the course, working in a bookstore. But I feltin that momentimmensely proud. Wed just been through, I think, the toughest week and a half ever experienced at our store. And here we were, still giddy enough from our encounter to hunker down and do some grunge work.   And I looked down at my hand. The hand that had so warmly welcomed that of an historic figure an hour earlier was now reaching into the deep recesses of garbage piles and emerging covered in filth.   And I thought, thats just how life is.   Its a precious and disgusting mix of real and fantastical, of discouraging and invigorating, of the things you have to get done, and the elevated experiences that make all of it worth it.   I went home and settled into the most satisfying bath of my life, and half an hour later I watched while the drain carried away the sweat and the grime, and the magic of the evening.

       Last week I was teaching a lesson to my English classes, during which I introduced a lot of new vocabulary.&nbsp; My students were studying a drawing of a scene at a park and trying to name all the English words they could.  &nbsp;  They all wanted to know what the things floating in the pond were called.  &nbsp;  Oh, those are ducks, I said.  &nbsp;  Hmmm, said Rosi, Hay veces que el pato toma mucha agua, y veces que ni agua bebe.  &nbsp;  I looked at her.&nbsp; There are times when the duck drinks a lot of water, and times when it doesnt drink at all?  &nbsp;  She nodded a little doubtfully, then repeated the phrase.  &nbsp;  What the hell does that mean?&nbsp; I asked.  &nbsp;  She started laughing, along with my other students.&nbsp; I dont know, she said, its a dicho [a saying].  &nbsp;  Alfonso piped up:&nbsp; Ive never heard that one&nbsp;before.  &nbsp;  Yeah, Rosi said, me neither, but my friend said it once like it was famous.  &nbsp;  "Your friend,"&nbsp;he said, "she is Mexican?"  &nbsp;  "Yeah."  &nbsp;  "Funny," he said, "I never heard it in&nbsp;Mexico."  &nbsp;  Well, is that even  true ? I asked.&nbsp; I dont even think thats true.&nbsp; I mean, I dont know that much about ducks.&nbsp; But even if it is true, is that different from any other living thing?&nbsp; Why ducks?  &nbsp;  I likened it to feast of famine, or all or nothing, and figured it was one of those things that just dont translate.  &nbsp;  But translation problems aside, Ive never been good at adages, or clichs.&nbsp; Sometimes its a comprehension problem, like with A penny saved is a penny earned.&nbsp; What is that supposed to mean?&nbsp; Does it suggest that if you were able to save the penny, then you must have deserved it?&nbsp; Or does it have to do with interest, as in, your penny will become two pennies--one saved and one earned--with time?&nbsp; I never gleaned much from that one.  &nbsp;  But most of the time, its a simple inability to get it right, and I think that has to do with hanging out with Kelsi for 12 years or so.&nbsp; My gal Kelsi, you see, is rather creative in the clich department (paradoxical as that may seem).  &nbsp;  Its not that shes  trying  to be different, but the real ones just dont stick with her.  &nbsp;  One time, she was talking about how she was excited about something she didnt want to be that excited about, in case it didnt pan out in the end.&nbsp; Yeah, she said, I would like for it to happen, of course, but Im just not gonna put all my chickens over there.  &nbsp;  Our friend Nicole and I looked at each other quizzically.&nbsp; All your chickens over there?&nbsp; we asked.  &nbsp;  What she meant, clearly, was that she wasnt going to put all her eggs in one basket.  &nbsp;  That one, I could deal with.&nbsp; You know, maybe she didnt want to put all her chickens in one chicken-retainer-area because what if that one burned down and all the chickens went with it?&nbsp; Makes sense.  &nbsp;  On another occasion, she advised a friend of ours to just let dead dogs die.  &nbsp;  Well, yeah.&nbsp; Id agree with that one.  &nbsp;  Weve both had problems with those two damned birds.&nbsp; Should you not hide your light under two birds in a bushel?&nbsp; Or you can kill 2, but&nbsp;they're worth more if&nbsp;they're alive, in your hand?  &nbsp;  Why is it Cant see the forest for the trees?&nbsp; Why not through the trees?  &nbsp;  Can anyone really take him or herself seriously when throwing around phrases like this?  &nbsp;  The worst, thoughthe one that always gets me  &nbsp;  The other night I was playfully reprimanding a coworker who was being mean to his boss, whod just sprung for his dinner.&nbsp; Hey, I said, dont bite a gift horse in the face!  &nbsp;  Or was that look at the hand of the horse that feeds you?&nbsp; Kick a gift horse in the knee?  &nbsp;  I say we erase all those silly clichs from our minds.&nbsp; The reason they dont stick is that they bear little relevance to our experiences today.&nbsp; Who even knows what a gift horse is?&nbsp; Would you recognize one if you met one?&nbsp; What is that--a horse somebody gave you, right?  &nbsp;  How many people are out there killing birds (my landlord aside)?&nbsp; And whens the last time you were loading dozens of eggs into one basket (indeed, ALL the eggs you had!), then thought better of it?  &nbsp;  Kelsi had an interesting point: she said she cant remember the clichs because shes too creative; her mind wont let her recycle the same hackneyed phrase over and over.&nbsp; And I think theres something to it.&nbsp; I also feel lucky to be privy to her word incarnations.&nbsp; They make me stop and think.  &nbsp;  Hmm, maybe an apple a day  is  worth a pound of cure.  &nbsp;  Maybe I  should  nip it at the heels.   Maybe I shouldnt give an inchtheyll take all my chickens.

      I have pretty big feet (size 9), but my mouth is apparently more than adequately large enough to accommodate them.   Ive set a precedent in this department.   I dont do the kind of thing where I accidentally ask a non-pregnant woman when shes due.  I know better than that.  My particular brand of foot-in-mouth disease has to do with inadvertently spewing double entendres and not identifying the potential for the 2nd entendre until its too late.   Some previous examples:   I have a friend named Renee who will be the first to tell you that she cant hold a note to save her life.  She gets this from her Dad, whom we used to force to sing computer karaoke versions of songs like Camp Town Races and My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean in his thick, Indian accent.  Now, admittedly, this wasnt fair.  Hed never even heard these songs beforeso he had nary a tune in mind to imitatebut even if he had, I promise he wouldnt have been able to emulate them, and later we still would have giggled into our pillows while we listened to the surreptitiously obtained audio tape of his dying-frog-like musical stylings.   Well, anyway, Renee is like that, too.   But there is one song,  one song  she can somehow manage to sing and sound like a human: "Amazing Grace."  If you asked her about this, shed probably say it was divine interventionGod will arm you with whatever it takes to get you to sing His praises.   One night years ago, we were driving in her car, and she wanted to sing.  So, naturally, we had to sing "Amazing Grace," which we did, and I was surprised at how well it went.  There were times when wequite accidentallyfell into harmonies.  I mentioned this afterward.   That sounded really good, I said.  Especially me.   Renee is, above all her other good qualities, polite and humble, so she was rather shocked by my expressed, over-the-top conceit.   Gosh, she said, thats pretty egotistical of you.   What do you mean?  I asked, honestly clueless.   Sounded pretty good, especially me?   Ha ha ha!  Ohmigod! was my response.  No, thats not what I meant!  I meant that note, when we sang, that saved a wretch like  me the me sounded really nice with our harmonies.   I was happy the thing was cleared up, but I will never be able to erase from my mind the retroactive, 10-second-long embarrassment I felt at the idea of my being such a braggart.  Thats 10 seconds during which my best friend at the time thought I was no longer the person she thought I was, but, instead, somebody who would say (and mean) something like, That sounded really good, especially me.   I want that 10 seconds back.            About 6 years ago, I was living with my friend, Nicole, in Flagstaff, Arizona.  We were fixin to travel to the south of Mexico, where we would volunteer as human rights observers.  Id sold my car and planned to use the money to live in Mexico (as had my friend Kelsi) and was working part-time to make extra money.  Nicole didnt have a car to sell, so she had to work much more than we did.  And jobs in a college town like Flagstaff are very hard to come by.   She took a job as a chambermaid (Dont you just love that word?  It sounds so naughty).  It was good work (which is to say it was work, period), except for the fact that she spent hours and hours alone everyday with nothing but her cleaning supplies and her walkman, which played a steady stream of Tori Amos, Liz Phair, PJ Harvey, and Fiona Apple.  See, Nicole had just ended a relationship with her first boyfriend, and she now had more than enough time during which to drown herself in mood music and to think about the relationship upside-down and inside-out and any other way it could possibly be thought about.  This was not a good thing.   But I digress.   In the evenings, Nicole would come home, melt into a chair, and tell me about her day.  Then wed move onto girl talk, laugh and be silly for a while, then call Kelsi and take off in the 1972, magenta VW bug that was our one remaining vehicle to share, and find something fun to do.   In the midst of one of these pre-adventure conversations, Nicole came out with this one:   Oh hey, I meant to tell you, I found my first condom today.   I went immediately to a place you never want to go to in reference to your friend, and my response was, Eww, you  SAVED  it?!   She looked at me like youd look at a person who just mentioned hed had his eyeball pierced (on purpose).   What?!   Then she realized what Id thought she meant, and she pictured me, picturing her, poring over little trinkets, ticket stubs, photos, letters, and other special mementos in a little secret box and coming acrossin the midst of it allthe first condom shed ever used, all crusty and stinky and memorable-like.   The scary thing is thats  exactly  what Id pictured, but Id gone a little further, imagining her picking it up, rubbing it oh-so-lightly against her cheek, and thinking fond, sexy thoughts about her ex.   When I realized what shed really meant (that she found a used condom in a hotel room she was cleaning that day), and she realized what I meant, we peed our pants (or, I should say, we thought it was kind of funny).   Now that I think about it, that was more a foot-in-mouth moment for Nicole than for me.  Or maybe it was one, each: How could Kisa think that?!, she wondered.   How could I think that?! I wondered, in turn.   And we each had 10 seconds of life we wished we could just say erase, erase to, and start over again.   ***   All of this was meant to be background information.  Jeez Im longwinded these days.   Which brings me to these daystwo days ago, to be exact.   Id been working backup on a register for a little while, when an older man shuffled up to my station and set a magazine and book on the counter.   The magazine caught my eyethe most recent issue of  Esquire .  Donald Trump is on the cover with a bunch of huge, bling-blingie, hip-hop-style gold chains around his neck.   I picked up the items to ring them up, then made a rather lame attempt at small talk:    Thats  an interesting cover, I said.   When the man didnt respond, I looked up at him for a moment and smiled.  He was staring at me with a slight scowl.   Best drop the small talk, I thought.   I asked the obligatory questions, Do you have a Barnes & Noble Membership?  No?  Have you heard about the program?  Would you like your receipt in the bag?   He grunted his responses in my general direction and I began to wonder, What gives?   I wondered until I picked up his items to put them in the bag.  It was then I noticed the cover of his book.   It was some kind of erotica, and the slightly smoky cover featured a ripped-stomached young man with an orgasmic look on his clean-cut face, as he was in the throes of an oral sexual act with (Im assuming, based on the look of the back of the persons head) another young man.   So, on the shopping list that day: The latest issue of  Esquire , and a little gay erotica.  Which (of course) not that theres anything wrong with that.   Except I flashed back to the beginning of the transaction and my innocent little, now  thats  an interesting cover.   And the silence, then the scowl, then the gruntingit all began to make all-too-perfect sense.   How to salvage this moment?  This misunderstanding?   My weak effort:  You know, that picture of Donald TrumpI never saw him with necklaces like that before, I offered, a tiny question mark hovering at the end.    What was that supposed to mean?  I mean, really.  Like when I mentioned the interesting nature of the cover, I meant that I just hadnt seen Donald Trump in necklaces  quite like that  before?  Whichcome to think of it is  what I meant.  But is that even worthy of comment?  How many types of necklaces  had  I seen Donald Trump photographed wearing?  Or how many pictures had I seen of Donald Trump at all?  Whats more, who gives a damn?   The man looked at me with a face that said, uhyeah.   That, I learned, is just one of the things wrong with making small talk.  From now on, Im working through transactions in silencespeak only when spoken to, and then, only if whats spoken is interesting enough to warrant a response.  This includes questions.   Im kidding, of course.    Suffering from foot-in-mouth disease does make life a bit more interesting.  But heres the thing: In considering the 10 seconds worth of misunderstanding, I always cringe, even years later, at the thought of being so grossly mis-taken.  And what really horrifies me is the thought that Ive been misunderstood in similar ways countless other times, of which I never did become aware.  How many other people are out there thinking Im an egotistical perv and a homophobe to boot?   Very disturbing, and, yes, a little funny.    Im teetering out here on this limb.  Tell me this happens to you, too.

      Last year, while on my backpacking trip in Europe, I posted occasional blogs with the intention of highlighting certain adventures and letting all my peeps know I was alive and well (and tan even!), without having to send out individual e-mails.&nbsp; Internet cafs are expensive.   What I didnt realize until after I returned was that I had a secret reader, who was following along like so many Metro ticket stubs at the bottom of my backpack, observing my every move.&nbsp; He said he was living vicariously through the blog versions of me and my meanderings.   This, it would seem, was creepy.&nbsp; Only it wasnt, because the reader was Doug, Kelsis dad and my long-time dad-away-from-dad.   Hey, he said, when he came to visit in January, why didnt you have a link on your blog where people could contribute money to your cause? (Id gone without a plan and come home when I ran out of money).&nbsp; Yeah, he said, I would have paid to keep you over there so I could keep reading about it.   Damn!&nbsp; I said.&nbsp; Now you tell me.   I thought it was an excellent idea, if a long shot.&nbsp; And I also thought it cool that hed been reading.&nbsp; Having an audience is nice.&nbsp; During that same conversation, he asked why Id stopped writing and suggested that I might want to continue posting entries even though I was home from my tripsome people were (believe it or not) interested, he offered.   Hmm, I thought.   Hmmm turned into a post about cleaning bird shit off the neighbors house.   Dougs been reading my entries and feeding back ever since.&nbsp; So it didnt surprise me when he mentioned my blog while I drove him, Kelsi, and myself to Gordon Biersch last Friday night.&nbsp; Kelsi made a joke about the vulnerability of living with a blogger.&nbsp; Hey! she said, forefinger pointed straight at my ear from the passengers seat, and dont you write about this in your blog!   Yeah, dont you write about us, Doug joined in, a smile smiling through in his voice.   I told them I thought their optings-out funny because Ive had the opposite request also, like when my friend Dave Marquez mildly chastised me for not writing about a group Trivial Pursuit match wed both participated in, which he found plenty worthy of a blog post.&nbsp; Id responded with something like a shrug at the time.&nbsp; I thought one post about the event (his, on his Diary of a Poor Sport blog) was probably sufficient.   Similarly, I told them, my Dad once hinted none-too-subtly that his then-recent hip replacement surgery would make for fun-filled reading.   The drive to the restaurant was short, so the conversation pretty much ended there.   We had to stand and wait a while for a table, and when our magic blinker finally buzzed and blinked, signaling the readiness of our table (I love that moment...I always feel like I won something), we were sat just the perfect distance from  Quasimodal Quartet , the jazz band wed come there to see.    QQ  features a few former members of San Jos States English Department (which is why I knew of the group), and the assembled listeners included a sprinkling of acquaintancesfellow book nerds and wordy folk.   Let me repeat here that these people were  acquaintances .   After wed been sitting there a little while, one band member (who was sitting out that particular night) approached the table.   Hey Kisa, howya doin? he asked.   Oh hey, Vince.&nbsp; Just fine.&nbsp; Have you met my roommate, Kelsi?&nbsp; Kelsi, Vince, Vince, Kelsi.   Oh, so youre the roommate, Vince said, referring to the fact that Id mentioned Kelsi to him in some previous context.&nbsp; Each presented a hand for the shaking.   Nice to meet you, they jinxed.   Im not exactly sure what happened next, but I suspect Doug misinterpreted Vinces seeming familiarity with Kelsi for the mark of a man whod read all about her.   Doug placed a hand on Kelsis shoulder and said, yeah, shes the one in the blog, his eyes sparkling the sparkle those of any proud father would.   Im not sure Vince heard him, because he didnt reply specifically except to nod and turn to Doug.   And this is Doug, I said.&nbsp; Hes Kelsis dad, out visiting from Phoenix.   Doug extended his hand while smiling, his other hand touching his own chest apologetically:  Im  not in the blog yet, he said, but, hey, you never know.&nbsp; He laughed, demurring.   Vince gave another frozen-smiled nod, this one a little more apprehensive than the last.   He had absolutely no idea what Doug was talking about.   I stifled my laughter while Vince and I chatted for a few minutes, then turned to Doug when he walked away.   He doesnt read my blog, Doug.&nbsp; Im not sure he even knows what that&nbsp;is.   Ah, well, he shrugged it off, and we went on taking in the jazz.   &nbsp;   Dougs presumptions were working on this main level:   1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who has ever met me is reading my&nbsp;writing religiously,   and this sub-level:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each die-hard reader is interested in and following the stories of the actions principle players.   I was touched by this, his vote of confidence.&nbsp; He was doing his job as my dad-away-from-dad in that moment: the encouraging, the proud, the one who says, "That's my girl."   There are plenty of people whodespite their friendship and/or family relationfind it difficult to be supportive, for myriad different reasons.   Nay.&nbsp; Nay, they say.   And then there are people who are just always, always on your side, rooting in your corner.   I had the extreme good fortune to be raised in an immediate family that doubles as a cheer squad.&nbsp; My name is [insert first and last name here] and theres nobody in the world better than me, is a phrase my family members often make each other utter when they sense self-doubt or sadness on the horizon.   We say this with tongues most definitely in cheek, but the sentiment behind the forced, Anthony Robbins-like self-talk remains true.&nbsp; Nobody in our family feels bad about himself or herself on anothers watch.   What a beautiful thing.   With this kind of background, I was naturally affected by Dougs idea that others should be as consistently supportive and interested in my&nbsp;writing&nbsp;as hes been.&nbsp; It was a nice, familiar feeling that made me all-over-again grateful for the swell folk that have become my chosen familythe family Ive assembled to complement the one into which I was born.   Life has been good to me.&nbsp;  People  have been good to me.   So, I offer this as minimum payment on my Debt of Gratitude:   Thank you, Doug, for&nbsp;all to read.

      Id read about these situations before. A few weeks ago, I had the fun job of going through the managers log and reviewing entries from the past 8 months or so; during that time, the managers saw fit to write about things like employee absences, tardies, equipment malfunctions, and incidents involving thieves, masturbators, and other characters who attracted the attention of the authorities.  Relative to some of the tales Ive read, my management stint has been a breeze, and last night started as no exception to the rule. We had plenty of employees working, and they were in good spirits, to boot. Sales were strong, the place was clean, and the displays were looking good for todays purported visit from our regional manager (which never happenedthat is so damned frustrating!).  In many ways, it was business as usual.  At about 9:00 p.m., one of our regular customers approached me with some sort of strategic plan worked out in his mind, which he began to outline for me,  en media res , in his strong, Pakistani accent. You know, he said, hes not doing anything wrong, so Im sure you cant legally ask him to leave, but there is one route you could pursue.  Who? I asked. He who?  The man. Hes sitting in the chair next to mine. He isnt bothering anybody, but he  is  taking cigarette butts and putting them in the magazines, he said. You could get him on that.  Well, what man? Where are you sitting?  Over here, in the childrens section, he said.  If youve read any of my previous postsnamely the one about the customers who are not only not right, but very, very wrongyoull remember that any hint of trouble coming from a man in the childrens department usually means bad news a-brewin.  The customer (Casey) began to lead me to the area, then stopped just out of earshot of the man in question. Oh yes, the thing is, he added, leaning in to whisper to me: he smells like  piddle .  The word seemed to denote a scent that would be far cuter than it could ever be offensive, but when I approached the subject of our discussions, I realized piddle was probably not exactly an accurate choice.  He smells like dirty ash pit might have been a bit closer to the truth. And its important, I think, to differentiate between objectionable odors. Piddle would have been unbearable. Dirty ash pit was not SO bad.  Casey didnt seem all that put-off, either. He remained seated next to cigarette butt man for the remainder of the night. I suppose he just wanted to warn me in case some of the  other  customers might be driven away; our regulars like to think of themselves as little helperssome of them regularly report strange goings-in and even see fit to give talkings-to to pervy neer-do-wells.  I thanked Casey for his tip and approached the man, who was clearly transient. Im not one to kick people out simply because theyre dirty, or even because they smell (aside from the fact that there arent really legal grounds for this, my inner hippy says, Well, as long as theyre not hurting or truly disturbing anybodyyou know, to each his own.)  Excuse me, sir, I began. Have you purchased that magazine?  He didnt respond verbally. He just made a no-ish kind of noise.  Ok, well then would you mind not putting your cigarette butts all over the cover?youre going to ruin it.  Now, people ruin our magazines all the time; that wasnt really my concern. The gross thing is that were talking a heaping pile of hodgepodge butts collected (I imagine) from ashtrays and trashcans and parking lots the city over. They were all different lengths and brands andlike any cigarette butts dothey just STUNK.  He gave half a nod, scooped them up, and put them back in the old Camel Lights box sitting next to him on the armchair.  Thank you, I said, and walked away.    It wasnt until a couple of hours later, when we were fixing to close, that smokey man and I were reacquainted. It seemed he had passed out on the chair and completely missed both our closing announcements.  Casey the Regular, stood by and watched while I said, then said louder, then yelled, Excuse me sir?  Sir ?  SIR ?  He opened his eyes.  Youre going to have to leave now. Were closed.  The man managed a little nod, then dozed off.  No, I said. I mean now. Were closed  now .  He nodded again, this time with eyes closed, then let his head fall to the cushion.  Hmm. What to do?  I summoned Darrell, our big, Clark Kenty head cashier/bouncer (you think we dont need one, think again).  Darrell yelled using his outside voice, and this time, the man didnt bat an eyelash. Darrell (a former cop) said, call the police.  I really hated to do that. But I wasnt about to sling the man over my shoulder and carry him out, either. The dispatcher asked if the man needed medical attention, and I said I didnt know.  If you dont know, he responded, then its my job to send it. Im dispatching it now.  Okay then, I thought, and man-sat while the booksellers straightened the store all around us.  The medical attention arrived 15 minutes later, making me happy for the fact that it hadnt been a  true  emergency. I heard the sirens and waited for the ambulance to pull around to the entrance.  But no, this was no ambulance. No. This wasdrumroll please.  The Fire truck!  Yay firemen!  I was too tired to be as excited as I might have been otherwise, but I will say that had I known it would be (not one, but two) fire trucks (each loaded to capacity with hulking heroes) sent in the event that the man needed medical attention, I would have exaggerated his condition, which truly just seemed to me like Xtreme Sleepiness! (say it in monster truck rally voice).  The ambulance was there, too, and behind it, two police cars. It was overkill, to say the least, but its nice to have some excitement around.  The man perked up enough to identify himself as Bill, a 50-year-old diabetic.  Then he  really  perked up when they stuck him on the gurney. He threw his hands behind his head in super relaxation mode, and even smiled as they wheeled him out the doors.  Another night, another emergency call at Barnes & Noble.    I joke it about somewhat now, but it was a bit heart wrenching to watch this manwho was obviously having a tough time with thingsbe so needy and so unkempt and so unable to care for himself.  I thought about it a lot after work last night, and I was thankful for the systems we have in place in this country to help people. I mean, this complete stranger was left in our hands. Ok, clearly I cant do much for him myself, not being a nurse or anything. But I can call other complete strangers, and they will come take care of him. I dont have to know them; they dont have to know him; nevertheless, the man gets the attention he needs.  Lest I take flak from any of my Republican friends a-lurking, I will say this much:  Yes, I know these services cost taxpayers money.  Yes, I know there are plenty of people who take advantage of the services of the state and become discouraged from pulling themselves up by the bootstraps.  No, I wasnt all that surprised to see the same man, less than 24 hours later, hospital bracelet and all, plop himself into the very same armchair (!) as I was leaving work this afternoon.  At that point, I had to laugh a little.  We all do what it takes to get by.  Like the smoker who flicks his butts into the parking lot and says, There are people who are paid to clean thisIm giving them job security, I say this: let the man sleep a while. Fires are rare, and how many times can you wash the fire truck to keep busy? Its good for us to see our neighborhood civil servants out and about and do-gooding every now and then.
