						    One Hundred Thirteen:    The Path is exceedingly vast.  From ancient times to the present day, even the greatest sages were unable to perceive and comprehend the entire truth; the explanation and teachings of masters and saints express only part of the whole.  It is not possible for anyone to speak of such things in their entirety. Just head for the light and heat, learn from the gods, and through the virtue of devoted practice of the Art of Peace, become one with the Divine.

						    One Hundred Ten:    The Divine does not like to be shut up in a building. The Divine likes to be out in the open. It is right here in this very body. Each one of us is a miniature universe, a living shrine.

						    One Hundred Nine:    You cannot see or touch the Divine with your gross senses. The Divine is within you, not somewhere else. Unite yourself to the Divine, and you will be able to perceive gods wherever you are, but do not try to grasp or cling to them.

						    One Hundred Eight:    Unite yourself to the cosmos, and the thought of transcendence will disappear. Transcendence belongs to the profane world.

						    One Hundred Two:    Ultimately, you must forget about technique. The further you progress, the fewer teachings there are. The Great Path is really No Path.

<post>

						
						    One Hundred One:    The techniques of the Way of Peace change constantly; every encounter is unique, and the appropriate response should emerge naturally.

						    Ninety Seven:    The Art of Peace can be summed up like this:  True victory is self-victory; let that day arrive quickly!

<date>20,June,2004</date>
<post>

						
						    Ninety One:    The real Art of Peace is not to sacrifice a single one of your warriors to defeat an enemy.  Vanquish your foes by always keeping yourself in a safe and unassailable position; then no one will suffer any losses.  The Way of a Warrior, the Art of Politics, is to stop trouble before it starts. It consists in defeating your adversaries spiritually by making them realize the folly of their actions.   The Way of a Warrior is to establish harmony.

<post>

						
						    Eighty Eight:    Do not stare into the eyes of your opponent: he may mesmerize you. Do not fix your gaze on his sword: he may intimidate you. Do not focus on your opponent at all: he may absorb your energy. The essence of training is to bring your opponent completely into your sphere. Then you can stand where you like.  

						
</post>

<date>20,June,2004</date>
<post>

						    Eighty Three:    In the Art of Peace we never attack. An attack is proof that one is out of control. Never run away from any kind of challenge, but do not try to suppress or control an opponent unnaturally. Let attackers come any way they like and then blend with them. Never chase after opponents. Redirect each attack and get firmly behind it.

						    Eighty Two:    There are two type of ki: ordinary ki and true ki. Ordinary ki is coarse and heavy; true ki is light and versatile.   In order to perform well, you have to liberate yourself from ordinary ki and permeate your organs with true ki. That is the basis of powerful technique.  

						
</post>

<date>20,June,2004</date>
<post>

						
						    Eighty One:    In our techniques we enter completely into, blend totally with, and control firmly an attack.  Strength resides where one's ki is concentrated and stable; confusion and maliciousness arise when ki stagnates.

Polish the heart, free the six senses and let them function without obstruction, and your entire body and soul will glow.

      "In Aikido, we always want to make the ideal movement. Somebody comes with a very good, earnest attack, and you try to make the ideal movement. Of course, it doesn't work. So you do it again -- again trying to make the ideal movement. You fail again. In Aikido, we want to make the most beautiful technique, and we fail. Still, the purpose is to make the most perfect technique. That's what we have to remember but we forget it very easily."  "There was a painter named Hans Menling who never signed his paintings. He just wrote, 'It's my best.' I attended a Jesuit College, and every day we had to write 'It's my best' in our notebooks. I think that Aikido is the same: you try to do your best -- not the best, of course, but your best."   -- Christian Tisser, 7th dan, Shihan

When somebody attacks me I don't think about, I'm going to get him, I'm going to do this.

      "With Aikido, you have to unlearn first. That is why it is so hard. You are learning something that is very, very sophisticated. It is something that Warriors after hundreds and hundreds of years of dedicated endeavors, of life and death situations, have finally figured out that there is a point of least resistance, and that there is something that works beyond strength...physical strength. It is 'Ki', its attitude and its adept movements that seem to go beyond force, and that a lot of times using strength is completely secondary to learning a way. A kind of moving without resistance, a non-resistant movement, a relaxed movement. So you have to unlearn in order to learn.

When students protested his talks were difficult to understand, he replied  "What I tell you may now seem to be way over your heads, but eventually there will be a time when it all becomes clear."   -- O-Sensei

        Conclusion  Given some hiccups during the whole trip itself, I still really loved the experience of trekking in Norway. I enjoyed the experience of going on a tour with Daniel and Justin. Most often they took the lead on the planning, suggested places of interests, etc.  Learned a little something planning and budgeting my finances. I had to ensure that I bring MORE THAN ENOUGH money whenever I'm on a trip.  Safety was essential. Especially safety with respects to your own luggage was not to be taken for granted. Regardless of how   suagu   it'd make us look, there's simply no compromise because as tourists, we stand out too easily.  Hope someday, I can go on another trip like this with the guys.

        After 0600 hrs  Needed to wake early today. Marcus is going to give me a lift down to the train station to see me off. I found out online that there seems to be a train around 0700 hrs. I managed to get a discounted ticket at 250 SEK (around £25) to Stockholm. In total, I spent less than Daniel or Justin did for their tickets down to Stockholm yesterday. I think it’s because I needed to make 2 changes and part of the ride was on the older trains instead of the new X2000 series.   1241 hrs  Arrived at Stockholm. At the Tourist Information counter, I had to pay 20 SEK for a map (not FOC leh). By the time I left, I had wasted 20 mins just to queue up. It took me about 1 hr to orientate and get myself to the hostel that Justin had told me about. Naturally, given my ‘fantastic’ sense of orientation, I did make some wrong turns here and there. The hostel is really unique. It is a ship, permanently secured to the side of a harbour / waterfront. Its reception is located in a building opposite the ship. In addition to accommodations, the building also houses the common kitchen and a lounge. I was staying in a separate dorm from the guys. But it was pretty comfortable. Point to note, they sold disposable bed covers which cost cheaper than renting them. Most other hostels we’ve visited only provided rental sheets. The disposables are a good idea for travelling in Scandinavia. I shared my dorm with a family of about 9. It looked to me like the grandparents down to the grandchildren and an uncle or family friend were here on holiday. Felt a little awkward being the only Chinese in the dorm. But they were really nice and friendly folks.  After checking in, we went on to explore Stockholm. Again we decided to go for a canal tour of the city. However, this time it was a pre-recorded message. The whole thing lasted about 2 hrs, which was really a little too long. Naturally I fell asleep again. This time, it was because of the music. It kept coming on, then after awhile the message came on, then the slow music, then the message, and so on. I think I also have some kind of thing about sleeping on ferries. I feel that they just put me to sleep sometimes. Could also be because I woke up really early this morning and I haven’t gotten much sleep on the train rides because of the short span of time in between the changes.  There was a part of the city called the Old Town. This was an impressive place. The guys had visited the area yesterday and they took me to a sci-fi store. It was really cool. After that, we headed back to the hostel and prepared pasta for dinner again. After dinner, we explored the little island that the hostel was built on and then returned to hang around the TV room. Here we called back to check up on Lynette and Annie. I noticed 2 Welsh English playing pool, befriended them and played a few games with them. After awhile, a group of Scottish teens joined us. 1 of the latter was an Australian who is actually staying in Scotland now. Daniel decided to do some bouldering on a rock wall behind the hostel and Justin left together with him. Daniel looked pretty impressive as he climbed. I told myself that if my results were alright, I will try to visit the Rockface back in Birmingham to try to do some climbing one last time before I went back to Singapore.   2330 hrs  Returned to my dorm, grabbed a shower and got ready for bed. Everyone else in the dorm was already asleep. I had forgotten that there were kids in the dorm too and they probably needed to go to bed early. Tried to move around as quietly as I could.

        0800+ hrs  Got up and washed up. We all went straight to the rail ticketing office to change our rail tickets. I got mine changed from Copenhagen-Stockholm to Copenhagen-Karlskrona (both via Malmo). Karlskrona is the place where my Poly classmate, Marcus, is staying. The RSN had sent him to Sweden for submarine training. Ivy, his wife, accompanied him and she had given birth to baby Zelda sometime in Nov 2002. I’m really quite ecstatic when I think about seeing all of them soon. They are the first close friends I know who’ve already started a family of their own. I’m scheduled to arrive at Karlskrona at 1421 hrs.   1100 hrs  We all departed Copenhagen for Malmo, Sweden. Apparently we were misinformed and should have boarded a slightly earlier train. This caused us to miss our connecting rides to our destinations. Now that I’ve had time to think things through, I think I might’ve overlooked the timing for the earlier train. Anyway, when we arrived at Malmo, I tried to change my ticket for another one (the guys are going straight to Stockholm so their tickets aren’t affected). I was initially told that to pay for a new ticket. But I explained my situation and the ticket attendant decided to change a new ticket for me FOC. Cool! However, my arrival time has now been delayed by a good 2 hrs. I bought a local phone card and gave Marcus a ring to inform him of the delay. It was a pity as he had planned to take me to the Maritime/Marine Museum on my arrival. It seems that I will arrive too late to visit the sights of the small town.   Around 1200 hrs  The guys boarded their train for Stockholm and I still have some time to spare. So I grabbed a map of Malmo and decided to explore outside the station. Naturally I didn’t dare to venture too far and kept one eye on my watch constantly. The train station is located at the edge of the city itself. Malmo looks really nice and peaceful. Of course, being a Sunday, that may be the reason.   1429 hrs  Train departed Malmo for Karlskrona. I managed to arrive around 1641 hrs. The moment I stepped onto the platform, I could see Marcus standing a short distance away. He was in a typical Singaporean attire of T-shirt, Bermuda and slippers. Of course, his short GI haircut was hard to miss too. As I was walking over to him, who should come along but Ivy carrying baby Zelda. It was sweet seeing this family of three. Marcus drove us to a supermarket nearby. After the 5 min drive, they asked if I had bought my ticket from Karlskrona to Stockholm for tomorrow. Alamak! He drove me back to the station but the ticketing office had already closed for about 15 min (4 min after my arrival). I’ve been really careless and forgetful since this morning. Sigh, can’t be helped now. We headed back again to the supermarket, bought some stuff and proceeded back to the family apartment. The flat was nice, cosy and had a spacey living / dining room, a kitchen, a toilet and a bedroom.  They prepared steamboat for dinner while Zelda took her nap. Almost towards the end of the meal, she woke up and Ivy had to prepare her baby food. The couple switched after awhile. I was cute seeing the three of them; Marcus, a happily married father, Ivy, a busy housewife and a 7 mth old Zelda. We had a nice long chat the throughout and after dinner. I played with Zelda a little but I seriously didn’t feel too comfortable carrying her. I’m not sure how tight I had to hold her and I was really afraid of dropping or hurting her somehow. Zelda has Ivy’s nose and Marcus’s eyes and mouth. This was one time that I actually had to be referred to as Uncle Aylwin. Haha. The baby proved to be quite a handful for my friends sometimes but they do seem to be managing very well. Just before midnight, we all decided to go to sleep. I was really quite sad that the day had to end so soon. Had things been perfect, I’d have an extra 2 hrs to spend with my friends, not that it would’ve been enough anyway.

        Before 0800 hrs  Woke up. Breakfast consists of cereal, different types of bread, butter and coffee/tea. Weather seems as though it'll rain soon. We're just waiting for the sky to get a little better before we go out. Later we'll be shifting to a more centrally located accommodation. However, it looks like it’s may be in a red light district of sorts. It also seems like there is a huge population of Asians in the area. We do have some events lined up for the day but everyone seem to be in a world of our own since Justin’s bag was stolen. I have no idea how long this mood will last but it’s getting boring. I hope we can find something to lighten the tension soon.  Visited Amelieborg Palace (Royal Palace) for the changing of the guards. I finished up my current roll of film here. It was interesting but not too fantastic. Justin noted that one of the guards dropped his magazine on the ground during one of the drills. Cham liao, the chap sure kanna extra guard duty. After this, we went for a guided canal tour. It was really good, but Justin and I fell asleep. For me it was because of the rocking motion on the waters, the nice sun and the soothing breeze that made me fall asleep. The tour isn’t boring and I did find it quite informative. Next, we visited the National Museum. It was pretty interesting. But the problem was that we were all too tired to enjoy it much.  In the evening, while deciding on what we are having for dinner, the atmosphere turned a little nasty. We met a group of Singaporeans and Daniel took a bit of time to talk to them – he’s a friendly and sincere guy who takes time to talk to people, even those we don’t know very well. On the other hand, Justin is rarely that patient with strangers over such niceties. He’s not an unfriendly person, it’s just that he places purpose, speed and efficiency over such protocols. I feel pretty uneasy when I noted the change of tones. But everyone knows that tempers were just running a bit high at that moment. The mood was defused as quickly as it started. Whew.  We all had an enjoyable pizza buffet (but the drinks we had actually cost us more than the meal). After dinner, we went back to our accommodation and rested. I called Marcus about the details of visit and found out that we had a cheaper alternative. What we needed to do is to try to change our tickets first thing next morning. We had an enjoyable discussion about things in general and as it sometimes happens, a (friendly and interesting) debate ensued. I think we only went to bed sometime before 0100 hrs.

        0700 hrs  Justin woke us up to get ourselves ready. He heard some kind of random announcement about presenting your boarding ticket on arrival or something like that. Justin thought that it meant that we had arrived early in Copenhagen. When we were all ready, we went to the cafeteria with all our barang barang (luggage). That's when we realised we were really an hour and a half away from arrival. Alamak, we could’ve gotten an hour's more sleep. But it wasn't exactly a bad thing. Being up early, we decided to use up all our Norwegian currency and coins on breakfast.   0900+ hrs  Arrived in Copenhagen. My first impression is that it seemed livelier and nicer than Burgen. First thing we had to do is to get to the train station to purchase tickets for travel to Stockholm 2 days later. My next impression, things were still as expensive as before. The tickets cost us 673 DKK (about £67+). I made an initial estimate of my transport costs within Scandinavia so far and it seemed to have already hit about £230. I think it's even possible to travel by flying at this price. This obviously only shows how poorly estimated our transport costs were. But since we are already here ... sigh.  At the ticketing office, after we had paid for the tickets, we immediately realised that Justin had lost his bag. He had placed his bag in front of his feet (between both feet and the counter), a relatively secure position I would say. Naturally, it's been stolen. We searched around and even went to the station's toilet to see if any bugger was hanging around there rummaging through a familiar looking bag but all to no avail. We suspect that it was as we were all leaning forward to talk to the counter staff and checking details that the thief made his move. Even so, Justin had only left his bag down for a few mins. The lucky thing was that he had all his documents (passport) and cards (credit and debit) on him when the bag was stolen. He did lose his new £200 credit card sized Casio digital camera (with MP3 playing capability) and about £30 worth of cash though. The really inconvenient part was that all his clothes and his glasses were in the bag as well. Naturally, Justin felt really sian about the whole thing. We went to the Police station located within the rail station and made a police report.  We still had to grab some chow. We came across a buffet serving Indian/Mediterranean food of sorts and decided to have a try. It wasn't bad at all, but there wasn't a great variety. After dinner, we went on to the famous Tivoli Gardens. I originally expected Tivoli Gardens to be some sort of botanical garden or park. Imagine my surprised when I realised it was really an amusement park. It wasn't particularly expensive either considering that we're in a country of such a high standard of living. The place was bustling with people and activity. Featured rides and all that weren't like state of the art or brand new but the atmosphere sure was one of the best in the world. It definitely lightened our mood a bit given the incident of the day.  Allow me to go off-track for a while but at that moment I was wondering how come Sentosa can't enjoy the same kind of atmosphere or popularity as the one I had seen in Tivoli Gardens? Justin pointed a few possibilities to me. Most events held at Sentosa seemed more catered for the teens and young adults. The locality of Sentosa was a bit too much to the south, but considering Singapore's small size so that's probably more of an excuse for people not to visit Sentosa than a good reason. But Tivoli Gardens is situated in the heart of the capital itself. It closes at 0100 hrs but in Singapore, only certain special locations do so and they are more like pubs, discos, etc.  We are quite lucky as there will be a free concert tonight. We don't recognise the singer (she was a Randi something) but her vocals sounded pretty good. Music was nice too. As Justin isn't in a perfect mood, he wasn't particularly interested in the concert. We left Daniel at the concert while we went to the arcade/jackpot. He did pretty ok and won some credits but he had no idea how to retrieve the tokens from the machine. Ultimately he used up all his credits instead. I did have a go on a swash-buckling samurai game. It's the first time I tried and it was quite fun. I tried to apply some simple things I learnt from weapons work but after awhile, I realised it was pointless. There was so many loophole in the game compared to the real thing. It's still a game after all I suppose. O yea, Daniel, the ever-ready-rock-climber had a go on a machine which simulated a rock wall. A crowd always gathers whenever someone has a go on the machine. It just seemed interesting lah. Danish girls here have really pretty and outstanding features. Lots of blond around (dunno if they're natural blond or what). Anyway, they really stood out.

        0600+ hrs  Woke up, washed up, packed, and had a simple breakfast of bread, butter and sausages.   0720+ hrs  Departed the YMCA. Walked to the train station and boarded the train back to Oslo.   Before 0800 hrs  Train pulled out of the station. The journey to Oslo will take us about 6+ hrs. We're scheduled to arrive around 1420 hrs or so. The train was a new one. Reasonably comfortable with a fair amount of leg space. I spent about one third of the journey sleeping. The rest of the trip I just read my book.  In Oslo, we have just less than 2 hrs before we need to board the ferry bound for Copenhagen. We're probably going to look for an Internet cafe and a bookstore (Daniel's still hoping to get a book for the rest of the trip).   1600+ hrs  Arrived and boarded the Crown of Scandinavia. Cast off timing is 1700 hrs. It's an interesting experience. This is the first time I've been on a ferry / cruise like this. Dinner isn't included in the price of the ticket though. But we're still planning to go for the buffet dinner in the ship's restaurant later. It's my turn to treat the guys. I just can't wait to explore the rest of the ship. So exciting. In the meantime, think we're all gonna grab a nap first.   2000 hrs  Finished dinner. It costs 195 DKK each but it was really good. There were seafood, meat courses, cold dishes and desserts. I only managed the first 3 sections. The dessert section I had to leave it out as things didn't look too tempting to me. I ended my dinner with a green apple instead. It's been a great trip so far making our way to Copenhagen in this fashion. In fact, I hope someday in future, I can do the same again with my parents or family on something similar.  I felt that the waiter serving us wasn't really comfortable serving us. It's either because we seemed like some young punks or it may be because we're all Chinese or both. He wasn't like particularly nasty to us or anything, it's just that he didn't seem friendly enough as a service personnel. He just gave me the impression that his level of hospitality was not like the other crewmembers we have come across earlier on the ship. It was only when the bill came that he seemed to be friendlier, but only slightly ("I hope dinner was OK."). I dunno lah, like I said, he wasn't exactly mean to us.  After dinner, we walked and explored the ship. Getting out onto the open deck was a bit scary and exhilarating at the same time. When I first pushed the door open, the breeze from outside was so strong that it nearly pulled me outside. Stepping out into the open, it took me awhile to get used to the strong breeze and the wobbly feeling. You can feel the seas-spray almost everywhere. You'd realise it if you lick your lips and you'll find that it tastes salty. After awhile, I managed to find my sea legs. It just felt damn shiok to be out on the ship's deck with the strong breeze all around. It made me feel as though I was flying. The guys kept jokingly asked me to sign on with the Navy when I got back to Singapore.   2343 hrs  Justin and I just finished a film we caught in the ship's cinema. We each paid 40 DKK for it. We watched the Recruiter (starring Al Pacino and Colin Farrell). It was quite OK. Daniel caught another film instead as he had seen the Recruiter before. We're probably going to grab an early night and just ready ourselves for tomorrow.

       Was horrible. Some bugger's alarm clock rang and woke the whole room up except for himself. I felt really pissed. To top things off, someone spilled water on the floor last night. The water flowed towards my bag (which was on the floor) and kinda soaked it a bit. But it was wet enough to get my jeans and some shirts inside wet as well. I was extremely irritated when I left the YMCA.  Because Burgen is known for it's seafood market found along the waterfront in the early morning, we walked across to grab breakfast there. The guys were really willing to spend money on seafood. I went to a convenience store for a hotdog and a cold drink. I'll probably try the seafood for lunch instead.  Walked around aimlessly and it was really boring. What an ordeal it was just passing 2 hrs. Luckily we found a bookstore. The first branch we visited had very little English books but the guys were still able to hang around for quite awhile. I'm not a very great fan of literary works so most of the English books displayed simply didn't appeal to me. Across the street, there was a bigger branch, which was much better. I bought a book on Viking sayings. It's a bit pricey for it's thickness I guess it's but OK lah, bring a bit of Norway back with me lor. So far, I've yet to see anything about Burgen I really like. It's so similar to Birmingham that I feel that I should could've remained back in Brum to see the same things. It's almost 1200 now and I think we'll grab lunch in awhile. All we're doing now is just sitting in the square and listening to a brass band playing nearby. They are pretty entertaining though.   1740 hrs  Having a terrible day so far. We still haven't done much except sort'a whiling time away sitting here and there and not really doing anything. I think I'm kinda holding the guys back because I haven't got as much cash to play around and visit places and stuff. I also can't eat as much as I'd like. They probably find this cultural city with all its museums and all that more fascinating then I do. It wouldn't be a bad idea for them to go ahead without me but they probably didn't feel it was a good idea to just leave me while they went enjoying themselves. I'm grateful but I still don't like the idea of preventing them from enjoying themselves. Another part of me isn't exactly that enthusiastic about visiting museums and all those stuff either, but if I had the kind of spare cash I probably wouldn't mind it. Sigh, I'm not comfortable with incurring too much extra expenses and bad debts lah. Not to forget that I still owe them a meal in Copenhagen. Daniel has already treated us one. One thing though, after we returned to the YMCA, I did catch a really good nap. Hopefully that changed my mood a little. I'll go look for the guys in the lounge now, maybe we can do something after dinner ... I hope.   2100 hrs  Went up to the peak of Floibanen. Sort of Burgen's version of Singapore's Mt Faber and/or Bt Timah Hill I suppose. There are a few tracks here and we took a quick walk here and there. Daniel was finishing a book he just bought this afternoon so he tried to get another one in the evening, but to no avail. Most bookstores were closed already.  Tomorrow is another full day of travelling. We'll be taking a coach/train back to Oslo to catch a ferry/cruise to Copenhagen, Denmark. I'm really looking forward to leaving Burgen and going on to Denmark.

         0800+ hrs  Had a longer sleep today. Laundry was still damp. We hung them out on the clothesline provided outside. But only for about an hour or so as we had to pack up and check out soon. We took the same breakfast we had 2 days ago of bake beans and bread and went back to bed to sleep a little more.1030 hrsGot out of bed, packed up and checked out of the hostel. Purchased some tokens at the Internet cafe nearby and cleared our emails while waiting for the ferry which will be taking us to Gudvagen. We whiled time away sitting along the harbour waiting for the ferry.   1430 hrs  Boarded our ferry and departed Flem for Gudvagen.   1700 hrs  Arrived at Gudvagen and boarded a coach bound for Voss.   Before 1900 hrs  Arrived at Voss and got on the 1915 hrs train to Burgen.  Basically, our whole day was spent travelling and getting to Burgen.  It's raining / drizzling when we arrived in Burgen. Horrible. Checked into the local YMCA here. It's newly renovated but everything seems half done. They were still in the process of renovating the place and you can still smell the new plaster everywhere. We grabbed an expensive dinner at a 'cheap' restaurant. That's not the worst. The toilet in the restaurant was coin-operated, same as the public toilets in the damn country. I can understand a public toilet being coin-operated but to do the same to the restaurant's toilet is simply outrageous.  The shower rooms were horrible. Not a proper changing room was done yet. The way the doors opened, I think someone walking past the male showers can look in easily. Can't imagine what's it like for the ladies shower room. I had a hard time showering. I'd classify the shower and changing rooms to be simply pathetic. The dorm was similar to military style bunks. They were double-decked. It took me a long time to fall asleep. Some bugger was snoring loudly nearby. My first impression Burgen has been dramatically damaged.

        0800 hrs  Woke up and had a buffet breakfast. It was similar to what we had in Oslo at the Ankar Hostel. All of us took a lot to keep our strength up for the journey back the way we came yesterday. We had the nicest hardboiled eggs. The egg white was solid but the egg yolk was only half or three quarter cooked.   1045 hrs  Departed Osterbo. We moved a lot faster and we made good time, possibly because we didn't take the steeper route this time. It also felt like there were more down slopes on the way back. Justin led and I was trailing behind with Daniel between us. Halfway through, Daniel took the lead. Being the last man, I lagged behind quite often. A few times, the guys had to pause for me to catch up with them. That says a lot about my level of fitness. I guess there's a lot of training I'll have to do when I get home. Might have to do some thigh strengthening exercises too.   1500 hrs  Ended much earlier than intended. We decided to hang around a stream where we washed up (no skinny dipping this time). We immersed our blistered feet into the ice-cold water and it felt really good. We took some photos here as well. I was quite happy that my legs felt stronger and hadn't tightened or cramped up today.  The cab came 15 mins earlier than before. We returned to Flem and lodged back the same hostel. We were given different rooms though. This time it was a room for 3 instead of a dorm. Dinner was a simple meal of pasta with eggs. Justin was trying to achieve the same standard of the eggs we had in Osterbo. He didn't quite make it for this first try. We had early dinner and an early shower. We even had time to wash our clothes in the laundry.   2045 hrs  Feeling a little bored ‘coz we haven't got anything to do. Justin popped out to get some chips for snacks. At this point we got into some random chat and read up on some pamphlets, which we picked up here and there.

        0800 hrs  Woke up. Made and ate our breakfast of bake beans and bread. Cab was 15 mins late. We took it to Vassbygdi, our start point.   0845 hrs  Start of trek!! It was simple path, leading past some houses and farms.     urlLink    Photo of Daniel and Justin at the starting point.  urlLink      urlLink    Another photo at the starting point. Behind is actually a sort of rest station. This was to be the spot which marked the start and end of our trek.  urlLink

        0800 hrs  Woke up late. Intended to wake at 0700 hrs but Daniel had forgotten to adjust his mobile phone's time to Norwegian time. We washed up and changed, chop chop everything was done in 30-40 min (bear in mind we only had 1 toilet to share) and we went for breakfast. The buffet breakfast was in the cafe of Ankar Hotel, which was next to Ankar Hostel. The buffet was OK, but not fantastic. There was a small variety of sliced meat. We stunned some butter, sugar and salt, all essential for cooking in the days to come.   1000 hrs  Finally checked out of the hostel feeling filled up and happy. We took our own sweet time to walk to the train station. I tried calling home from here but I just can't. Don't understand why they don't seem to take ICC. Weird. Tested my overdraft by withdrawing more money. Success! I recall applying for an overdraft 2 years ago. Still seems to be valid.   1046 hrs  Norwegian rail system are so meticulous. They depart on the dot. Now we're on our way to Myrsdal.   1100 hrs  Reaching the edge of Oslo city. I can see the clear blue sky with less than 30% of cloud cover. The train ride (with the expensive ticket) is reputed for the scenic views it'll be taking us through. It was said that we should stay awake for the duration of our train ride to take in the sights. Daniel has already knocked out. He hasn't caught much sleep the last few nights in UK, preparing for his personal stuff and the coming Italy trip with his parents.      urlLink     Picture of a waterfall. This was one of the stops. That's Justin's head in front of me when I snapped my photo.  urlLink

        Time stated in GMT British time   0000 hrs  Departed home for Digbeth coach station. Clement, a final year Singaporean Law student, gave us a lift in his car. Heard he was really tired from driving people around the whole day. The lift we got was quite uncomfortable with a lot of bumps and knocks here and there (but he was doing us a favour after all, so...). I did get a bit pissed off as he went over a particular deep hump and I knocked my head against the ceiling of the car. Seriously, if I knew that a 'free ride' meant having to endure such a thing, I'd gladly pay for a cab ride down instead. I'm not one to accept 'free lunches' but don't expect me to have to see your lian3 se4 (看脸色) and take such shit too easily. I kept looking at my watch and reminding myself that getting out now and flagging a cab down won't get me to the destination on time so I just kept reaaaaally quiet about it. Like I said, he was under no obligation to give us a lift and he did it out of goodwill, but I wished he hadn't tried to be a nice guy and had just gone about his normal business that night.   0100 to 0550 hrs  Took a coach down to Stansted airport in London, one of the smaller airports in the outskirts of London. Changed some Norwegian (NOK), Danish (DKK) and Swedish (SEK) currency. Rate was approximately £1 to 10 NOK / 12 DKK / 10 SEK. Around there lah.   0720 hrs  Boarded the EasyJet plane bound for Torp airport in Norway.   Time stated in Norwegian time +1   0945 hrs  Landed in Torp airport. My first impression of Norway: lots of low buildings and trees, clean air. Paid 120 NOK for a coach service to Oslo city where our hostel is located. Withdrew more cash from the ATM. Second impression of Norway: expensive country with a high standard of living. As we got closer to the city, taller buildings started to appear. Plenty of modern architecture dominated the Norwegian city landscape.   1250 hrs  Arrived Oslo city. We checked into the Ankar Hostel situated a few minutes walk from the city centre. It was a nice place. New too. We seemed to be the first group to be using our room as the hostel had just opened that day very day.  We approached a mountaineering shop for maps to our intended trail. Found out that we were too early in the season and around two third of the trail was still covered with snow. We were told the earliest possible season for trekking should be around mid / end July depending on the weather. This was in great contrast to what the Lonely Planet book said. Sianz. We had to revise our original plans again and re-plan our route. In the end we decided to go for the remaining part of the trek where the snowed has already cleared (supposedly the best part as well).  We made our way to the rail ticketing office to get tickets to take us closer to the starting point of our trek. Purchased a train ticket called "Norway in a Nutshell". Cost us 1657 NOK! Almost £165+. Have to try and call home to get more funds. Friends are paying for some of my expenses at the moment. What makes things worse is that tomorrow is a weekend. My parents won't be able to do anything till next week.  At the end of the day, I noticed that there's about 1 hr more of daylight compared to UK.  A coincidence. The 4th person in our dorm is a 5th year medic (medical student) also studying in the University of Birmingham. He had ended term early and had been travelling Europe for the past 7 weeks. We had a conversation with him till about 2am before we all went to bed. He mentioned a lot about his travels in Rome, Munich, etc.

      Wah piang eh!  Juz now after lecture was looking around for a toilet and I didn't realised I walked right into the ladies!!!! Argh!!! So embarassing, when I came out a door across the corridor opened and a lady came out. She muz've been really shocked to see me exit the ladies. But I really wasn't that bothered. Maybe that's wat they mean by having a clear conscience, huh. Still, thinking about the incident is sorta funny. Hmmm ... my high point this term. Hahaha.  Lastnight's Aikido training was an ultimate low for me. Sigh, felt sooooooo tired and I just don't feel that I'm concentrating properly. Actually though of leaving after the first hour with the beginners. But I just though, if I gave up so fast and easily when will I ever improve. So I stayed on for the 2nd hour. But still didn't feel like I'm doing anything right. Hope next week will be a lot better.

      Haiz, tonight never went for Aikido training. Pity lor. Felt really lazy. So many things just delayed me from getting ready and psyching myself up to go. Argh, really need to get ready earlier next time. I feel so bad / guilty for not going when I could have. I really don't know how this kind of attitude of mine is gonna help my Aikido development in future. So sad. Need to put in more effort. And the distance to the dojo doesn't really help either. It's not near like in Uni. Even though Uni has a free bus ride down, just traveling down to Uni and waiting for the (long wait) bus is a real put off as well. But I know that once I get myself down to the dojo I won't regret the training and I'd be glad to have put in the effort. Sometimes I seem to treat my Aikido training like a convenience. Seems like I go down only when I can go down easily. Shouldn't be the case. I think from next week onwards, I'm gonna bring my Gi around sch for the day so that I can leave from Uni direct. And I gotta liase with a senior to go down together. That shall be my level of commitment. Dat's what I'll do!!

      Alamak, Uni wants me to pay school fees liao. Wah lao! 9000+ pounds, almost 10k. This country really suck students dry on money. It's no wonder people, especially students, will try all means to maximise and even cheat the Uni of some money.  Very sian. Just got an email from my laopeh. Kaopeh at me about the Uni thingy, coz if pay late gonna get fined for it. A lot of things tell him liao he also kaopeh. That's why really freaking hate to talk to him. Cannot have a decent conversation without disagreeing. Shits. Ah, parents lah, what to do. Sometimes I miss Singapore, but everytime I go back and I think I may want to try to be a good son, some shit will happen at home and my parents will make me wish I'm back in UK alone and away from them. Confirm plus guarantee one. These few years I really don't feel like I can hang around them for long. I don't really feel the point for joining reunion dinner and all that stuff. Don't understand lah. I think army/camp life suits me lor. When I kanna hold back by the govt/army parents usually can't do anything. Woohoo.  O yea, talk about army life. I think I will sign on with the Police Force after I graduate. I've got a module doing something called Commercial Programming and the school brings in industry people to talk to us about issues out there right now. The module is very very good. Anyway, one area was Computer Forensics. Really damn interesting. Don't think anyone really knew that our data can still be retrieved even after we do a format. The expert said that you had to format the harddisk 7 times and do physical wipe of the system to have a high chance of ensuring that data cannot be retrieved. I dunno if I can do Computer Forensics lah, but I wanna do something to serve the public. Almost definitely government work. Especially with the Sep 11 incident, think it strenghtened my convictions that we need to be alert and stron internally. It was really scary to know that JI had planned possible attacks on certain locations in Singapore. If intelligence and news didn't reach us in time, the outcome would have been catastrophobic. I can't begin to imagine the number of innocent people who might have been killed and injured. Especially after watching war movies like Band of Brothers, Black Hawk Down and Saving Pte Ryan, imagine some civilian who might have lost a limb and just be bleeding on the ground waiting for life to end and being fully conscious. Ewww ... really very cham. If I'm the one there, I might wish for someone to put a bullet through my head immediately.  Anyway, gotta go library liao. Got to return a short loan video now. Otherwise fine fine fine. Hey, who said Singapore is a 'fine' country. It's the same over here and the amount is a lot more hefty compared to Singapore.

      Today was just surfing around and I went to the websites of every Aikido club in Singapore.  Aikikai (Singapore) has a new website. Well it's new lah following a split [which formed the Aikido Federation (Singapore)]. Anyway a lot of political shitz inside that which I dunno, so ... no comments. Was just to Aikido ShinJu-Kai's website too. Now I realised that the 2 of these clubs now have the 'history' section. Heh. The latter's used to be very very brief, while the former had absolutely none.  I dun mean to criticise lah of coz, but I noticed there's this sudden outburst of 'Singapore's Aikido History' available online. I'm happy to have put up Aikido in Singapore's history online (at http://www.geocities.com/Aikido_in_Singapore ... aiya muz promote my site mah hehheh) before ShinJu-Kai's new history updates and Aikikai's new site. Hope that helped to kinda poke more people to put the info online and made readily available to the general public. I'm sure that there must be a lot of people who have already wanted to do this. Also realised everyone have a slight version of their own 'truth'. Doesn't matter to me. Think when all the info is put out, the public themselves can read and then formulate their own opinions and ideas on the subject.  Personally I have a few views about the various club's sites I think. I analysed them through the following, overall look/design, content, navigation.  Aikido Fed's is simple to use. Nice comfortable look. But maybe because it's still new, it has a somewhat empty look. Should get better with time. Use of white and dark blue color is good and relaxing to the eyes. Doesn't take long to load. Better use of fonts may enhance the site further. Might help to include some history, but being a new club (and maybe coz of the unpleasantness from the split with Aikikai Singapore) think the lack of info now is coz they're trying not to offen anyone. I'd think a 3.5/5 is fair. Content probably only a 3/5 but it's simple to use design pulled it to a 3.5.  Aikikai's site looks 'stiff' (??). Dunno how to describe also. But I think it's also because it's still a new site. Weird color combination. Looks like they are trying hard to 'structure' their content at the moment. Heard that they were working on something 'good' few mths ago, but it looks crappy. Think the NUS aikido site is still better. Might have helped if they worked on it from there. But the info is still OK for a new site. Should get better with time. 3/5 grade maybe? It's design deserves a 2.5/5 though but the content kinda pulled it up a bit.  Ueshiba's can be better. They are quite a laojiao club but still very poorly established online. Maybe that's not their emphasis that's why. They're probably more focused on training and other forms of expansion instead. But I figure that in ths modern day and age, the development of a proper website is extremely important. They have a link with Ngee Ann poly's Aikido site. Both sites basically show the same stuff. Quite pointless to maintain 2 pages like that. May be better to crosslink some info pages to allow 1 update only. But this may slow down surf time for one of the site. Alternatively, they may want to use some kinda of FTP update facility to make auto updates/publishing. Either way, for a club that 'old' the site is quite crappy. Their content is OK. A history section would be nice though not really necessary. But I think George Chang Sensei runs the club very niely. Dunno, juz my impression of the club. 3/5.   Yushinkai is a new site as well, looks comfortable enough but can still be improved. Fonts can be improved. 3.5/5 coz of the nice feel it gives. Doesn't look messy.  Ki-Aikido's has a nice site, but they look a bit too cramped. Content is very very good. Only site which included video clips. Thumbs up on this point. Structure of the site content seems ok but feels a bit weird. Not sure why. But content more than makes up for it. Including history of Ki Aikido (being the only Ki sch) would be very very nice. 4/5.  ShinJu-Kai has by far the best site established online. Anyone looking for Aikido in Singapore will definitely like their site more. They are extremely well organised. Content is very good. 5/5 score.  Hope I dun offend anyone with these frank opinions. Hey, I'm no expert but I think even layman have got opinions. My site isn't that fantastic either. I'm so envious of Aikido clubs with impressive looking sites. Dun think I can ever reach that stage for my site. Think for an Aikido site to excel, including history and background is necessary. Also need to project a professional image and that's why how the site is designed is very impt. Of coz, Aikido is not about website building lah. But website helps the spread of the art.

      OK OK This will be my first official blog post here. Hmm what to say neh? Sorry if my posts not very structured. Just speaking from what I can rmember and my memories do jump around a bit sometimes.  Let me just start with a brief introduction of myself lah. Alternatively, if anyone out there is even remotely interested, you can visit my webpage at http://www.geocities.com/aylwintan1978.  OK, I don't want to, like, go really that far back in history (you can find that out from my website) so I'll just talk about myself now. Was from Nanyang Primary Sch, went to Buona Vista Sec and Computer Studies in Ngee Ann Poly. NS, was a M113 driver (no lah it's not a freaking tank lah) with 56th SAB, then disrupted to go UK for my degree.  Haiz, talk about my degree really need to be ashamed lah. I got direct entry in 2nd year of BSc Computer Science / Software Engineering. Didn't do well (that's an understatement, more like did really badly), so I had to take a year out to clear my resits while doing an internship in Singapore. I only just came back to UK 2 mths ago for the final year of my degree. Hope can still get my honours, even if it's a lousy one.  In poly I was very much into working out and physical training. Nope, I'm not one of those tanned and really fit guys you see out on the streets lah. I into working out for a tiring feel to stretch my muscles at a (turtle) slow and comfortable pace. My exercise 'kaki's in poly generally consisted of Ronny and Gary. We'd go for a run, then go to the gym first before jumping into the pool. Shiok, the pool ... my favourite exercise, swimming. Usually target to swim 1 to 2 km. No lah, not difficult lah. At a slow pace you can pretty much complete the distance.  Anyway, when NS came. You pretty much dun do anything but run and run. Plus there wasn't really much of an opportunity to to swim anymore. So there I was, panting and dying on the road. But I learnt to appreciate the feeling I get from running. I'm still a pretty lousy runner (aiya, can only get Silver for 2.4km in IPPT mah), but I happily volunteered for the Army Half Marathon in 2000. Really cham. Coz I overstrained one of my knees during training. Still, I didn't give up when it came to the actual day. I think it was either 12th or 16th km when I felt like my knee really hurt. Still half limped and half jogged my way to the 21st km finish line. I didn't meet my personal target for my timing though. But still, it was a very shiok feeling knowing I completed 21 km.  Anywayz, when I went into Uni. Went through a lot of stuff. Knowing more about people, more about myself. You discover a bit of your hidden strengths and weaknesses. You make some friends and you make some enemies. You become more receptive, more adaptable, yet still resistant to some kind of changes. You fit in and socialise, trying to widen your circle, only to find that you can also be a bit anti-social, and don't need anymore than a small circle of close friends. Yea, everything listed contradicts the other. But that's how it is. I suppose everything comes down to a right kind of balance between the 2 sides. Anyway, like I said, I screwed up my 1st yr of study (which was really the 2nd yr of the course) in UK. Did helluva lot of resits in Singapore and then proceeded back to UK for my final yr. I also met my current girlfriend in UK. Of coz lah, we didn't really get together till like last summer holidays.  We've got our own share of differences and arguements but so far things have been working out. At least I think so lah. Dunno what more I can comment on my relationship at this point.  Oooo ooo, now comes my favourite part, Aikido. Heard a lot about it long ago but never really tried it or really bothered to find out more about it. I started in University of Birmingham under Pauline Squire Sensei, 4th dan. She teaches every Wed evenings at the University. The Uni has this Active Lifestyle Programme that's really a cool idea. It is a very good way of introducing sports and certain activities to the students. They've got a lot of tstuff from martial arts, sports, aerobic-like stuff and even yoga. Fantastic. Anyway, I gradually went on to increase my training at Pauline Sensei's dojo, Po Rin Kan (literally translated as Pauline's House in Japanese). Just a bit of information. It's affiliated under the British Aikikai. This is sorta an umbrella organisation that has links to the United States Aikido Federation Western Region. And the USAFWR is under T.K. Chiba Sensei (hmmm ... should be Shihan right? I dunno), 8th dan. I've been reading stuff up on some Sensei's and from some of the stories told by Pauline Sensei, I would really just love to watch a class of his. I'm not sure if I can take or tahan one of his trainings though. Sighs. Anyway, I took my 1st grading (6th kyu) with Pauline Sensei and passed. When I returned to Singapore for my year out, I joined Aikikai (Singapore). Wah, I was so onz about Aikido that I increased my trainings from 4 to sometimes 5 days a week. 1 of which was a bokken course which taught me the really really basic stuff. At that time, my Sensei was Freddy Khong Sensei, 4th dan, who happens to be the club's Vice President. Bokken course was taught by Seah Ah Hee Sensei, 4th dan. One of my training class was usually conducted by Sensei Koh (Nai Sing/Seng I think). Let me just comment on their teaching styles. Pauline Sensei explains and tells the class what she expects from us when she teaches. It helped me a lot when I started out cos I felt like my hands and feet had exchanged places and had absolutely no way of co-ordinating myself. So telling me to shift this and do that was very very helpful. As I trained on, I found her techniques sometimes to be quite agrressive but she has mentioned before that she is really soft compared to Chiba Sensei. This also makes him sound a lot more scary and that's why I'd just like to watch a few of his classes instead of jumping right in. Hahaha :P Freddy Sensei is a quiet man. He teaches and leaves you to yourself. Of coz he goes around the dojo correcting the students' techniques and all that but he is a man of little words. Sometimes, I'm not sure what I'm doin is right or wrong. I guess when nobody mentions anything, it means its acceptable. Ah Hee Sensei has one of the softest technique I've ever felt. I especially like his kokyu-related techniques and exercises but juz can't comprehend them fully. Think his Taichi background is a reason for this. Sensei Koh also explains a lot when he teaches. Good if you can absorb them in. Sometimes I can't take in everything he says coz I'm concentrating on 1 small specific aspect instead of the overall. But I guess I'm juz a slow learner. Pauline Sensei's ukemi training is fantastic. I've not seen anyone teach ukemi in such a way before. She breaks things down into small parts that they are easy to execute and then bring them all together. Then she teaches different level/stages of ukemi and breakfall as you progresses. I really enjoy Pauline Sensei's class. Part of the reason is because they are usually small sized. She is able to give very personal attention on your own flaws. In Singapore, due to the large no. of students, I don't often get to learn what I'm doing wrong exactly. Sometimes I feel that I'm just going throught he motions of the what everyone is doing. I guess that's where my seniors come in, to help me out in this way. But 1 similarity among all the Senseis is that they all make you practice humility. In their own way, I am often reminded that no matter my grade or experience in training, I'm still learning. That's good coz I really really really hate to be on cloud 9 when it comes to Aikido. I would hate it if I ever get illusions that I'm a bad-ass martial artist who can kick people's asses and be some kind of martial expert. Still learning and reflecting daily, all thanks to Aikido.  OK I gotta go for lunch, so I'd probably finish this long entry in awhile.

      Lastnight we had a 'simple' Xmas eve dinner. It was pathetic for a variety of reasons. First off, I'm not interested in having such a big group over because I really was hoping for a relatively quiet dinner. Second, there wasn't exactly enough food to go around for everyone. Oh sure, I had my fill of food, but I noticed some people wasn't eating enough. Sigh, it also comes down to some people being a bit shy and all that. No point lah, when you come to such things organised by Singaporeans, being paiseh is like one of the stupidest thing you can do. You only leave feeling hungry.  One of my housemates pointed out a point to me which I totally agree, it was that he wanted to have a proper dinner in which he can actually sit down and eat instead of stand around. I thought over his words and I agree. I also want a dinner in which everyone can be seated to enjoy the meal. I was a bit pissed lastnight and hence seemed a bit anti-social to the main crowd coz after dinner I went back to my room with some closer frenz.  But I was really pissed with myself. Pissed that I didn't voice out when my friend suggested asking people over for Xmas Eve. I didn't realise that most of my housemates actually prefered a quiet dinner instead too. Sighz... sometimes I really need to learn to speak my mind. My other housemates are basically all very diplomatic people so they took everything in comfortably. I'm not. Well, not as diplomatic as them anyway.  So my new year resolution will be to express myself nicely to people and speak up more often if I think something doesn't feel right. That's 1.  O yea, good thing is that I managed to get my stamina for swimming back. No I've yet to swim long distances, but only becoz I dun wanna be too tired for the rest of the day. Think a short swim is fine coz I've been timing myself. Estimated timing lah.  Anyway, whoever reads this. A Merry X'mas to all and Peace on Earth.

      Today went to town. There's a German market on right now. Kinda like a fair thingy. But the food was good. I had 2 pork sausages today. Shioooook man. Glorious food. Too bad it ends this coming Sun. I'll probably drop in to eat 1 or 2 more sausages before then.  Also saw Lord of the Rings, the Two Towers today. Hmmm... it was alright but I really expected better. I'm not saying it's any worse than the 1st, but I just somehow felt it was a big anti-climax. I expected better war scenes. But it was still a good show.  Also noticed recently I've been buying books. Muz be some influence by my housemates. But it's good. I dun regret the books I bought, they are worthwhile either in content, or price, or both. Either way, I'm glad I'm starting to get back into my leisure reading again.  OK betta get back to work. Heheh, but think I'll sneak a chapter from my new book first.

      Haiz,  Yesterday had my Jap test. It was teeeeerrrible. And to think that I spent the last few days studying it completely. Even sacrificed a few hrs from my final year project to prepare to prepare for the test. Just felt a bit wasted lor. And I think it's a wake up call that my prep work was insufficient. Think I'll use the holidays to brush up. Gonna go borrow tapes and do all the exercises from page 1 onwards!! Gambatte!!!!!  Today had my project inspection. Woohoo quite good and encouraging. I was kinda panicky over it but I think the lecturer was satisfied about my progress. He just wants to make sure I know how to do what I want, and that I know what I really want done. I think I'll spend more hours on my FYP this holidays too. In addition still got about 2 modules I think I need to read up on and 2 essay questions I need to work on. I may be a bit greedy but I think I'll try to finish the 2 essays early during the holidays. But I foresee that I'm probably only going to finish 1 1/2 of the 2 qns. Bopian. Try my best liao lor. Dun wanna waste away this holiday too much. I'll of coz rest a bit too lah. But I know for sure that 2 days before and after X'mas will be quite a slack day for studying coz of X'mas dinner and all that.  GAMBATTE Aylwin-san!! Gambatte!

      Whew, just had my supervisor meeting about my final year project. A bit stressed coz last min my program just can't get working. Made me panick. But my sup was quite understanding about the whole thing. He asked me about other problems I might get stuck in and where I needed help/advice. Also reminded me not to be too worked up about the Project Inspection next week. Gotta just keep my cool and prepare some stuff and get ready to be asked some questions. On top of that, I need to prepare for my mega important Jap test coming on Wed. Wah, this week siong man. Gonna work hard this weekend, but not before a good rest tonight. Juz loaned some videos from school library and got some classic shows. I'll relax a few hrs tonight first.  Even the next 5 wks looks like a break from Aikido. Sigh, sure would like to go train somewhere but I guess it might be an overkill. Taxing myself too much is a definitely no-no for me in my Aikido training. Wanna improve and not lose interest. I really want to keep at this long term throughout my life. Hope that can be done. Anyway, I can always go train my swimiming this coming holiday. Woohoo.  O yea, I just found this really fantastic site called www.vcdhelp.com. They offer tips and advice on creating VCD and DVD from a variety of format. From hardware, software to tips and techniques. Fantastic site.

      Been awhile. These past week a bit more stressed than usual. Got my Jap coming along now. The test next week is 40% of the module. After my Xmas holiday is the Oral test which is 20% followed by exams in May, another 40%. All quite heavy. But I think they are definitely lighter compared to all my other IT modules. Next week also got a Project inspection coming up. I don't theink I really need to prepare anything and I was told it's not gonna be accessed. But knowing that I'll be facing some lecturers and they'll be questioning me on some areas of my work kinda scares (terrifies) me. Sigh, wish my demo day will either be 1st day of the week or the last day which leaves me to be really unprepared, or really well prepared.  Aikido cancelled last night. Sensei was down in Blackpool. Tonight's training is taken by someone else. But I'm feeling kinda tired from all the school work. Sigh, not sure how leh. Really think I should go down and train today coz I don't think my schedule can permit me to train next week. And I'm not sure there's any training for the Xmas holiday either. Would love to though. Maybe I'll just ask. But I suppose I can always train my swimming again. I've stopped for about 3 wks now. Thought I had managed to hit back 2km in 50 min. But Think now I'll have to re-train over from 1km onwards. Think I'll try to aim to hit 5km swim at the end of my holidays. However, I don't think I'll push myself for the timing. Just make it really relaxed first. Once I got the stamin back then mabbe do some sprints / speed up my time. Err ... that also means improving my tecnique. Poor technique slows me down as well. Hmmm ... sounds a bit like Aikido. Maybe I should emphasize on my technique first. The speed probably comes much later. My mind in Aikido always seem stuck on technique and rushing in on the speed. Bad bad....  Had a bit of disagreement with Corrine last few days. I know we had problems but I didn't expect that we'd have so much differences. I really hate to see her being so emotionally affected by things I did (or didn't do). Feel so bad sometimes but I also dunno lah, think we both got things we need to work on. I was really surprised that I even suggested some time off (ok lah, more like a break-up) from both of us. But I was even more surprised by her response and effort to try to keep things together. I feel a little ashamed. Coz now I dunno that when I suggested the break-up, wheather I was taking the easy way out or I really thought we aren't compatible? But I felt really really reallu elated by her saying (similar lah, my memory not that good to remember the exact words gramatically), "I'm also not sure if we are making a mistake or not, but I'm really willing to take the 'risk' with you." O man, because of that phrase, it practically erased most of the doubts and fear in my mind. I just think, no matter the mistakes or what, so long as we're making the step together, it's the right choice. Even if it means that someday in the future we really do break-up, but because of the fact that we had made whatever decisions together, it's can't be a mistake. Right? ... Sounds a bit chim, now that I'm re-reading my own words. But, aiya, that's just me lah. I can't phrase and express some things properly. I'd like to just follow my instincts. Even if it means 'losing out' in some way or making a mistake. I mean, there's no better time to make mistakes and pick yourself up while you're still young, rite?

      Lastnight my housmate accompanied me for my Aikido practice. It was his first try at it.  We met at the bus-stop outside the University's train station at around 7pm. From there, we took bus 44 down to Weiley Hill, Village Hall. It was quite a fair distance off, beyond Sainsbury, a big supermarket. Halfway, my senior boarded the bus as well. Funny thing was, we alighted at the wrong stop (1 stop too soon). It would seem that I've been alighting too soon all the while I've been to training. What a real joke.  Anyway, we arrived at the dojo pretty early. We had to lay out the mats together. That evening, Sensei Pauline wanted us to have the mats wiped. Soon as that was done, we proceeded on to change into our Gi, training wear, for class. David, my housmate, wore loose and comfortable attire (trackpants and tee) for class. Prior to this, he had seen some videos of Aikido, which my Sensei had loaned to me last week. He was impressed by it but still slightly skeptical. That evening, there were 4 students; John, Angelo, me David (in order of seniority).  We started warmups and some basic ukemi. As Sensei took him aside to instruct him, we were told to proceed with backward rolls followed by forward rolls. Later, we switched to shikko, samurai knee-walking. Finishing all these, Sensei wanted us to do ikkyo just for starters. She said that she would continue from where we left off from last week, which were some variations of sankyo. We carried on practising, occasionally swithing between the 3 of us and David to help him out with his rolls.  That evening, I got to try out 2 variation of yonkyo. I've never seen this variation before. In Singapore, I've only seen it a few times. And I remembered that I never managed to get it right. Sensei Pauline went through some simple explanations of how yonkyo works. When she saw that I couldn't wuite grasp the meaning of it, she tried out a small one on me. It caused some discomfort but not much of a pain. I won't begin to realise that I had gotten a bruise from this technique, until first thing the next day.  At the end of class, after we've cleared up the mats and paid our mat fees and thanked Sensei for the night, we had a short chat. I had casually mentioned that Chiba Sensei had a very solemn look in the videos (in which she gave a short laugh) and that Tamura Sensei had very soft techniques (so much so that sometimes I wasn't even able to 'see' what he was doing, the way he did it was really soft and effortless). I went on to mention that Freddy Sensei (in Singapore who had the opportunity to train under Tamura Sensei) had very similar warmups, techniques and teaching style as that of Tamura Sensei. Sensei Pauline also gave some accounts of her personal experience with Tamura Sensei during earlier Aikido camps. It was really enjoyable.  After we all said our goodbyes, Angelo gave me and David a lift down to Selly Oak where we could walk back home easily. While buying kebabs and walking home, I asked David if he enjoyed himself. He was really excited and I could tell that he had thoroughly enjoyed himself that evening. He had also decided that if time and studies permitted him to do so, he would definitely join me next week again. He described his experience to me that he felt Aikido was an abstract form. His initial impressions about it had changed as well. Pauline Sensei's teachings had managed to leave a deep and lasting impression on him as well.  I occasionally forget why I train in Aikido. I found myself bogged down by my own stagnant progress, that I had (in Gary's own words) "reached a plateau in my training". Not the peak, just no further improvements. This was really demoralising for me then. Having been with David that night, he reminded me of how  had felt 2 and a half years ago. He had helped to remind me why I had taken and continued with Aikido. The Sensei's in my short Aikido-life also played a big part in this.  Training with beginners isn't really a bad thing. Look for the things which remind us about ourselves. Reflect on these and I think we will realise we've came a certain distance since then. If there are qualities we dislike in what we see in others, maybe we should think if we have, or still retain these qualities. If we find it irritating or offending in others, imagine how others might feel about us. Look around us and take note of those who have been really tolerant about our bad habits, most important of all, our Sensei(s).

      Lastnight's training was OK but kinda tiring. My muscles along my back all the way down to my butt is aching.  We did variations of iriminage. Was good. But a lot of them I felt really unfamilar with. I might have seen them before but I'm really not too sure. Sensei Pauline was emphasing the need to move the centre around in the techniques. Of coz there were the fine technicalities of hand motion, feet work, etc as well.  It was an interesting way to drill in techniques coz she started with simple gyaku and ai hamni iriminage variations, before advancing on to morote, ryote and katate dori variations. I think my centering has improved slightly (but not a lot). I realised I need to be thinking less when I'm practising. Kinda juz empty my mind so that I can move accordingly.  I hope I can remember what I've learnt last 2 days and use them effectively next week. She might be bringing down some videos. If I can find out how my firewire connector of DV recorder works properly I'll probably make some copies for reference.  I was just thinking of my rock climbing experience few weeks back. I realised that the really good rock climbers have very very very stable and strong centering when they are climbing. Me, I only use my hands and legs. Basically I'm using muscle power which kind of just make it so much tougher and strenous to finish a climb. But they are all able to do it almost effortlessly. Same as Aikido, timing & confidence come in as well. Some handholds which are just too far away, they time themselves nicely to 'hop' a little to reach it. They also move their centre close to the wall before they stretch their limbs to reach a hand/foothold. Really really good. I'd like to try to 'experience' a little Aikido during a climb but I'm not good enough. I'm tryint to relate rock climbing to what I'm suppose to feel in Aikido. Sometimes, a change of environment seems to bring out other stuff in a different light. It seems to provide a different angle for you to 'see the light'.  Another area I'm trying to Aiki-sync is swimming. But I'm having a bit of difficulty. I think I'm thinking and concentrating too much. That's why I can't seemt to relate them. But if I don't think at all, I'm not able to 'see' the link. I just hope I can 'feel' it someday. Really love swimming. Woohoo.  O yea, was just at the  urlLink British Aikikai  website. I saw the site list Sensei Pauline as a 5th dan. Hmm ... I didn't hear that from my senior John. Might just ask them about it. Mabbe she got it last year while I was in Singapore or something.  Anyway, time for my lecture. Gotta run.

      Last night was my 1st Aikido class for for the new term. It was very good. I felt that I got a bit of a good warmup and even though I didn't do anything that was really fantastic, I felt that I was actually making sorta some small (but primitive) progress for my ukemi. Hopefully tonight I can get more practice as well.  School's ok. I'm getting some work done early before it piles up too much towards the end of the term. Hope I can keep up and just drive myself a little bit harder towards the next few wks. I know some of my deadlines coming up so I should really be planning out the phases of my work properly and early now.  Timetable for this term seems quite alright. Though I expect things aren't goinna be finalised till next Fri. Anyways, so long as I got time for my work and Aikido, everything else should fall in place nicely ... I hope.

      Haven't made an entry here for sometime.  2 wks ago I tried out rock climbing, well, more like wall climbing. It's an indoor climbing centre (Rockface - www.rockface.co.uk) in town. I've got to admit, it was scary for me. But there was a certain thrill and adrenaline rush to it as well. I have a great fear of falling even thought I was very well secured with the rope. Last week, I went for my second try. I think I've gotten worse at it. But I'd really like to go again, juz to get over the fear of falling.  It was a bit depressing to know that the girls (some of my friends before me) actually climbed better than I did. No lah, of coz I know I'm not competing against them lah and I won't rush it either. But I think maybe it's kinda a guy thing. But I hope that's not going to stop me. Gonna try. Well if schedule permits, I might take it up back in S'pore too. We'll wait and see.  Term starts next Mon. Argyh!! So much work I need to do. On the other hand, it also means Aikido class is starting soon. And I'm still thinking of joining swimfit in school to refine my swim techniques. Sigh so much to do and so little time. I'll see how things goes, might just stick to Aikido. Still my strongest passion so far.  Talking about Aikido, heard that Jesse might be stopping Aikido. Might not be true, but it'll be a real pity if he does. He's got a natural talent for it. Sigh, wish I'm half as good as him. Can't even get my ukemi right. I hope I can train and improve my ukemi under Sensei Pauline this term. Gotta work harder.

      Yea well, the only reason why I can practice bokken at home is because I either hold the bokken really low, or I try empty handed, or I do certain motion of it sitting down. I figured I can emphasise different area of what I learned in the following 3 ways and also considering the space constraints. Can't practice bokken work in my room either, too cramped.  I'd usually do it in the living room. If the weather was warmer, I'm thinking of laying some cover in the backyard and workout from there. Fresh atir in UK is very shiok. I heard that during the summer, Pauline Sensei sometimes conducts classes out on the grass. I've seen some camps where they do move out into a huge field to train. Though I'm not sure how dirty the gi at the end of classes.  In Singapore, I also can't be swinging my bokken around like a maniac lah. Parents will kill me first and I don't think any amount of Aikido can save me then. Usually I'd try to wake up early to practice in the carpark. Sometimes the neighbours will see me and they probably think I'm some kind of a maniac wielding the bokken around like nobody's business. Hah... but it's ok lah, coz private carpark, the public can't see me. Just one or two person catch a glimpse I can just ignore.  At home in UK, I've already scratched a bit of the ceilings and walls during bokken practice. Hope they won't ask me to pay for repainting. Heh heh, then again I might shift some furniture around just to hide the scratches and marks.  Sensei mentioned that Chiba Sensei will be dropping by and staying over at her place for a night sometime around end of April. I'm wondering if I will get to see him face to face and in real life. Wah, a bit scary to face a traditional Japanese Sensei, man.

      Lastnight's class was quite tiring. Again we continued from kokyu-ho techniques which we learnt the previous night.  I felt really breathless and my breathing was COMPLETELY off. Really need to get my breathing back in check someday.  I felt a bit kanchiong, because Sensei actually wanted John and I to just demo a bit on breakfall. Wah liew, I was so kanchiong I think I got really unnatural. Basically I felt very conscious tht there were a few pair of eyes on me. Sigh ... when the mind is not calm, the body naturally follows. I distinctly remembered a very cuckoo fall but at least I didn't hurt myself.  When the first hour was over, Angelo turned up to join us (he had missed Tue's class). Sensei told us she was going through some techniques for our 5th kyu grading. Argh ... imagine that. I was happy of course, but I still don't feel confident with it. But she also said she had to check the syllabus again so yesterday I think we only did some techniques which (may/may not) be inside for 5th kyu. Oh no. John said he'd be glad to help us train, and that we could meet up just before the grading (good ol' John!).  Well, anyway class went on and we did shihonage from gyaku hamni. Some tenchinage, iriminage amd kotegaishi/kotegaeshi (err ... dunno wats the right romanji spelling, need to check up someday when I can remember). Well, throughout all the throwing around, I got back my more normal ukemi than the cuckoo style I had demonstrated just earlier. Felt real comfortable about it then as well.  Anyway we ended by being uke for 2 beginners (Steve and Alex) who had just extended their training hours into the second hour with the seniors. Must admit, Steve seems to be picking up really comfortably. They were doing about four variations of kokyunage and we had to just keep rolling and rolling one after another. Good practice for both. At the end of the rools I did somehow manage to get a bit of my breath back.  Now that Aikido for the week is over, I'll have to concentrate on completing my essays and working on my VRML and VR projects now. OKOK, maybe I'll just revise a bit of bokken work with David once a twice each evening. But I gotta go home and prepare dinner for the house today. Hmm ... haven't quite thought over what I need to cook tonight yet. Hmmmm .... gotta go dig around the fridge.

      Like I mentioned in my previous post. Lastnight's class was really fantastic. Our (David and I) first bokken class in the UK. Yea, sure I'd done it before in Singapore under Ah Hee Sensei, but I think I really wanted to learn something from my first Sensei as well.  We were talking to John about it just before Sensei arrived at the dojo. He was surprised (well, actually Sensei was as well) that I had never done it before. He said the last time they did it was pretty recently. Must've been the time when I was back in Singapore. Anyway there was a request and Sensei said it was fine if we wanted to do it that night.  Class started with some kokyu-ho variations. Some I've done, some I've not. She mentioned my ukemi was better than when I started out again. Guess if I didn't bruise myself (surprisingly), I must've learnt something about ukemi the past few months after all. But there is still the part about giving in ukemi that I really really really really need to work on. I'm always afraid to go charging (commit) in as an uke. Think, it's still the fear of being thrown and falling hard against some1's good technique. But I also realised one thing, that if I don't commit properly, I can get injured easily because I probably won't be able to react in a relaxed manner wen taking ukemi. I really ned to work on this issue and resolve this contradiction within me soon. I feel it's a major obstacle in my training right now, and I'm sure I can easily piss of the nage sometimes by not helping them learn the technique. O yea, I also tend to have pretty messed up breathing during  ukemi. That explains how breathless I get. Talking to Begh (housemate), she pointed out to me that in gymnastics (she was on the Singapore's National team, y'see), it was the same thing. That you keep practising and practising to perfect it. They sometimes spend years perfecting a small part which lasts only a few seconds during a sequence of movement. WOW is all I can say, but the link to Aikido is there.  Halfway through class, we switched to bokken. Sensei wanted me to put on the tsuba for my bokken (well since everyone was waiting for me, I'd thought I'd just ask if I really had to put it on). But when I was in Singapore, I was the only one using the tsuba. Haha ironic. Anyway in Singapore, I suspect the tsuba comes separately at an extra cost, so most people never would buy it. Sensei first taught us how we should position the bokken. When seated, the end of the handle of the bokken extends just a few inches above the knees. It is placed on the right side, with the blade ('sharp') edge facing ourselves instead of the person on our right.  You hold the bokken in right stance all the time. Right hand is on the top of the handle, just below the tsuba, and left hand at the bottom. For both hands, the grip is relaxed. You have to grip it in such a way that the back of our hands are both facing us and that the tips of both thumbs is usually away from our view. I've read somewhere that the grip is mainly on the last 3 fingers for each hand instead of the index fingers and thumbs. These two fingers seem to be just a guide of sorts. We are not supposed to hold the bokken like we would hold a machete. When holding the bokken in stance, the end of the handle should be approximately just 1 fist away from our center, with the blade being horizontal. The shoulders, elbows and wrists should be relaxed instead of being locked and stiff.  We started with some basic cuts/shomen strikes first. When raising the bokken, use the wrists a little first to initiate the movement, then just raise the whole arms. Be careful not to raise/lock the shoulders. Blade is raised to behind (and probably just above) our heads. The raising motion also aims to be in such a way as to protect our own shomen with our hands just above our foreheads. When striking, we were told to concentrate just on the last 6 inches of the blade edge and be relaxed. It should bring us back into the starting stance, meaning relaxed posture, unlocked joints, 1 fist away from center, horizontal blade, grip with back facing us and tip of thumbs fairly hidden.  After a few cuts we proceeded on to learn 2 variations of an 8-directional exercise. We had to bear in mind our posture constantly.    First Exercise : We will be facing North, South, West, East, South East, North West, North East, South West  1. North  We were told to raise and cut down. While cutting down, we took a step forwards with the front (right) foot.  1a.  On finishing, Bring the sword up to protect our heads. This is different from the previous raising action we did initially. I'm not sure how I'm suppose to put it into words, so I beg your pardon if the way I'm describing it sounds kinda confusing or silly. This time, the raising motion is done by kind of twisting and raising the hands to our left. Of course hands are still above our forehead. The tip of the blade is now facing the 'imaginary' person opposite us, edge of the blade is facing skywards.  2. South  Now we turn around to our left side 180 degrees, and cut down. You'll find yourself standing with left foot in front and right foot behind. (But hands still same as original - hands will never change position here.)  2a.  Bring sword up by twisting hands right and up at the same time to our forehead. Tip of edge faces our opponent.  3. West  Now we move our back foot to our front (but don't pass the front foot), and while we cut, just slide to the right by 90 degrees.  3a.  Raise the bokken by twisting the hands left and up to our forehead again, blade tip facing our front again.  4. East  Turn 180 degrees left to face behind and cut down again. You might realise we have just finshed North, South, West, East directions.  4a.  Raise the sword as we originally did, both hands to our forehead, blade tip pointing behind the head now  5. South East  When cutting, move back foot to face right by 45 degrees.  5a.  Raise hands left and up such that blade tip faces our front.  6. North West  Turn left by 180 degrees and cut as well.  6b.  Raise hands right and up with blade tip facing front.  7.North East  Move back foot 90 degrees to right and cut at same time.  7b.  Raise hands left and up keeping blade tip facing front.  8. South West  Turn 180 degrees left and cutting down.   Second Exercise : We will be facing North, South, East, West, South West, North East, North West, South East Please note that the second exercise is similar. Difference is that because the first step has changed it also alters the side in which you will be turning. But the angles will be the same. So are the raising and cutting movements.  1. North  We were told to raise and cut down. While cutting down, we took a step forwards with the back (left) foot.  1a.  On finishing, Bring the sword up to protect our heads by twisting and raising the hands to our right. Tip of the blade is now facing the front.  2. South  Now we turn 180 degrees right side, and cut down. You'll find yourself standing with right foot in front and left foot behind.  2a.  Bring sword up by twisting hands left and up at the same time to our forehead. Tip of blade pointed front.  3. East  Now we move our back foot to our front (but don't pass the front foot), and while we cut, just slide 90 degrees to the left.  3a.  Raise the bokken by twisting the hands right and up to our forehead again, blade tip facing our front again.  4. West  Turn 180 degrees right to face behind and cut down again. You might realise we have just finshed North, South, West, East directions.  4a.  Raise the sword as we originally did, both hands to our forehead, blade tip pointing behind the head now  5. South West  When cutting, move back foot to left by 45 degrees.  5a.  Raise hands right and up such that blade tip faces our front.  6. North East  Turn right by 180 degrees and cut as well.  6b.  Raise hands left and up with blade tip facing front.  7.North West  Move back foot 90 degrees to left and cut at same time.  7b.  Raise hands right and up keeping blade tip facing front.  8. South East  Turn 180 degrees right and cutting down.  You can repeat the exercises by turning back to North direction again. Throughout we really need to keep posture, and sword grip and position in mind.  Interesting huh. Damn cool man. Can't wait to learn more. It's a pity there won't be class next Tues as Sensei will be away for awhile. Wednesday's class will be taken by someone else (Paul, I think).

      Dammit, I had typed a whole chunk of lastnight's Aikido class and I just cancelled accidentally!!! Again.!!!! Now I need to retype everything because I think I need to refer what Pauline Sensei had taught me for bokken class lastnight.  ARGH!!!!! When shit happens, they really come in 1 big chunk. I'm really not sure I'm in the mood to retype everything now but I'll probably do it later after my Jap class. Sigh.  Lastnight I had a bit of a tiff with my girlfriend ... again. My house had arranged to eat 'Yu Sheng' lastnight after I returned from Aikido and they had invited my girlfriend the night before too. I had turned off the sound to my mobile during Aikido. Lastnight we couldn't get a lift back and took a bus back instead. Maybe we were still pretty excited over our bokken class and David and I were talking about it all the way home. We dropped by the pizzaria and bought 2 small sized pizzas (buy 1 get 1 free) home. The moment we stepped through the door, David's phone rang. Apparently, I had forgotten to turn on my phone after Aikido. My girlfriend had smsed me and called me a few times after my Aikido timing. She was expecting to join us on the way back to my place for 'Yu Sheng' when we were passing by her place. She was really pissed when we spoke on the phone. I went down to her place and followed her back to my place. It was my fault I really think so in this case. Because I seriously forgotten to turn on my mobile again when I should have. I apologised to her twice, but she'd make passing comments about how she's used to it (my kind of attitude) and that I won't change. She feels like I'm not really putting much effort into a relationship. But I'm really not sure I want to change my lifestyle and habits. I dunno is it because I think it's not worth the effort. But I know I do feel very sian when I see her 'sian' expression. Last time she once commented that I tend to ignore her when she tried to contact me. Though I've told her I didn't do it purposely. At least now I do make it a point to carry my phone around more often, that my phones are almost always charged. That I check my phone a bit more frequently than I did. That I grab a seat in my lab that's near the window where there's a decent mobile reception. My computer labs I think is kinda magnetically shielded from all the networking equipment and concrete building. That's why in the labs I'm quite hard to be contacted. But it's gotten to such a degree that I'm beginning to feel that I'm being artificial now - dunno if that's the right word to use.  I'm not trying to defend my actions above. I know a lot of lazy things that I'd do. Sometimes I don't call her daily / regularly. I know there have been times when I don't call her for even a week. Of course, if I was really doing serious work that's probably still a reason. There are a lot of times when I was just being lazy. It's quite sad. I think we humans are sometimes just like that, we know there are things seriously wrong with some of our usual habits but we just refuse the change them. Thats a big flaw on my part. It's a very bad flaw in fact.  I also know that my housemates just want to help. But I get very sian hearing that I'm the one at fault ALL the time, that I'm the one who don't put in effort. I think it's not I don't put in effort but instead what I put in is what the other party (or even what some other people) would expect in a relationship. I don't know what that's saying about me, it might not mean a big thing, but it might also mean that I'm not ready to be in a relationship now. All this shit just goes to tell me I'm a very kok-up person. Everything I do can never be right. I've zero credibility, that I'm just a pretty useless person just because I don't do what other would people do. I hate the feeling I'm getting out of this relationship now. My personal esteem seems to be at a all time low (zero!). Juliana (housemate), was trying to talk to both of us lastnight (well I'm pretty sure she's talked to my girlfriend). The moment she started, I really had to ask her to stop. I was just simply not interested in hearing that I've been doing this or not been doing that anymore. I'm also sick of hearing about things from other people. Sometimes, I've been told I don't speak up enough, hence don't communicate sufficiently with my girlfriend. Whatever I did, I must've made my girlfriend really sian about talking to me because she don't anymore, she'd jsut show me a sian face and be very cold whenever she's not happy. That's the only way I can tell that I did/didn't do something. Makes me very jumpy about what I say and do whenever I'm around her.  Aikido seems like the only thing that calms me and makes me relaxed (mentally). I can't really find the 'peace' in my mind outside the dojo.  I'm probably going to give myself a few days to think things over lah. To see which direction we are headed. If I think I'm going to be hurting the both of us a lot more in the long run, I'm just not sure we should go on. We sure don't need this kind of a distraction at this point of time as well.  I've mentioned the word breakup twice before. And I really hate to make it even seem like I'm threatening her or anything. It's never never been my intention even hint that at all but she has said something which seemed to say that's how I sounded last time. Maybe that's really how it sounds like. This time, I want to be really really really sure about what I want, or what I don't. No point dragging on if I'm (yea yea it's me again, always me me me) just going to hurt the both of us in the end.  I just need a place to vent my fustration and I think blogging is a good way for me to do it. It doesn't matter how many people reads this (or don't), it's just for me to rave and rave about my moods. Sorry if I've bored anyone to death. But you can expect a more interesting post next time as I'll have a lot of details about my Aikido class lastnight. Cheers.

      OK, both Shuhua and Eileen mentioned this commenting / tagboard service to me so I thought I'd check them out. I've just attached the relevant commenting feature into each posts. Anyone with any comments can now feedback to me anytime. I'm still not sure how I'd like it but whatever the case, I think I'll just try it out until it becomes too much of a chore or interferes with what I'm doing.  Happy reading.

      Alamak, even with all the reminders I still didn't manage to free up time to watch the footage of advance ukemi.  I guess, when you're busy, it's probably quite alright lah. But I really hate it coz I think I'm also usinga lot of excuses to slack. Especially when it comes to my school work. I'm behind schedule on my final year project and also my essays. Really need to catch up at this point in time. I have tonight, but I think my Aikido is probably gonna tax me up quite a fair bit for me to work efficiently. Maybe if I don't use too much strength or energy and see how things goes...  What's this tag board thingy  urlLink  you were talking about? My friend jsut sent me an email on something he called a 'commenting service'. That wouldn't be the same now would it?  I've submitted a mini-project for my VR module. I'm gonna make a virtual dojo webpage. Wah a lot of things I need to look into. Musn't be too difficult and and interfere with my final year project schedule, and musn't be too simple that I can't get a decent score. Really troublesome. But interesting lah. Just wish I had more time to work on this instead of cramping everything in now. Think when I go back Singapore I might look for some kinda course or books to do my personal project andhost it on my website or something. At least with a VR website, I can probably escape Geocities' stupid pop up on the top right corner of my pages. Spitz at them... ptuiz.  Anyway, I got about 4.5 hrs to work on my final year project now before Aikido leaving for Aikido tonight. Hope I can accomplish something today. Gambatte kudasai!

      Dammit! My stupid touchpad on my laptop is so touchy. Just tapped lightly only and it responded when I didn't want it to. Basically I typed a bit of stuff just now and they're all gone now. I'll try putting the stuff down below again but I won't bother to rethink my exact words.  Busy weekend. Tomorrow morning need to go down town to buy meat for the week's cooking. After that need to come home and go back to Uni to do some work. Been lagging behind lately and I'm panicking. Daniel, my housemate, was asking if I'm swimming also. Doubt it. I'd rather get a bit fatter if I can clear up more of my work. Anyway, I still go Aikido so I dun feel like I'm being really slack or anything. But I sure do wish I'm keeping up with my swimming though.  The girls (housemates) today were really noisy from dinner onwards right till just now. Dunno why they're so hyper. In fact, got a bit irritating for awhile. But sounds like things have settled down a bit now. Think worst thing is that with their high pitch voices they tend to be a bit noisier when they are slightly hyperactive. Guys (like David and I) can get loud, but not really noisy I think. Tried doing my essay just now and I only kinda got 1 paragraph done. Need more time and effort or I'll never finish my 1st essay this Sun and start on my 2nd one. ARGH!!!  Sigh, really dun feel like missing any Aikido coming week. We'll be doing nikkyo this Tues I think. And the Tues for the week after, there won't be any class. Think Sensei Pauline's going out of town for awhile. Just got my bokken from Sensei last Tues, really wanted to refresh some stuff that I'd learnt in Singapore but my living room isn't quite high enough for me. If weather was warmer I'd do it in the garden. O yea, and must remember to watch Donavan Waite's Advanced Ukemi this weekend. MUST REMEMBER!

      Wah, at least  urlLink you've  had a good practice.  My training on Tues was pretty alright. Wasn't great but still ok. Wed, I had to skip the first hour and could only go for the second. But I don't feel very warmed up. 1 hr class always never feel alright with me. Feels a bit abrupt. Like everything ended too early. Dunno lah, just crap lah.  Sensei taught us 4 variations wourking our way up to a technique called Uderiminage. Wah, took me a while to remember the name. Think she said it's called 'arm entwining' throw or something like that. It' a very good and effective technique, but I must admit I had a lot of problems being uke. She pointed out that I wasn't giving enough for nage to do the technique. Sigh, spent the whole day working on the giving part, but I still can't quite get it. Alamak how how how. Sometimes I realise that even if I do certain things right, I lose it the next time I practice. How come I can't keep things consistent. Ok lah, this giving area is something I've never been able to do properly. Sometimes I can do it to a 'passing' degree for certain techniques but for uderiminage it was absolutely crucial, and I just couldn't. Think this weekend, I'm gonna go take a look at Donovan Waite's Advanced Ukemi footage again. Try to understand something that I might've missed out.  ARGHHH!!!!

      Wah piangz, Eileen just informed me of her new blog. Alamak, and she mentioned that I neva informed her about my blog earlier until few weeks back too. Haiz, like I said, paiseh lah. First blog and all that. Was hoping to build it up quite a fair bit first before letting people know about it.  Anyway, it's quite heartening these pass few days regarding Aikido. Well, first off I'm glad I help introduce Aikido to David, my housemate. He's really happy doing it now. Last 2 people I introduced kinda lost interest after 5 mins. I just felt that they only wanted some kinda company and that they weren't really interested in learning at all. I don't mean to be rude, but some people in my Singapore dojo gives me that kind of feeling as well. David would always be asking about stuff and pondering over the things he learnt. I must admit, that by going to the dojo instead of the University class, he gets more personalised attention from Sensei Pauline. That also helps him to pick things up a bit faster than most of the beginners I've seen in University. Problem with most people in University is that, they come and go very fast and Sensei rarely has a student that stays with her for long. I feel sad sometimes when I think about it. But University students tend to have academic workloads and it's hard for them to turn up consistently as well, even if they are really interested. I get the feeling that Sensei is well aware of this point and she just hopes that she can make them have a good start so that wherever they go when they leave, they'll be able to go along nicely and comfortably from there in their Aikido practice.  Tuesday's Aikido class was quite alright. A little dis-orienting for me because I've not been 'revising' what I was taught properly. Been thinking a bit about school work and all that, you see. Maybe I'll plan a few mins daily just to 'revise' my ikkyo, sankyo thru rokyo. Either next wk or the week after we should be working on nikyo. A bit excited and apprehensive at the same time. Coz I know I need the practice, but I also know it's gonna hurt quite a bit haha.  Wednesday's Aikido class was alright. Sensei made a single comment that my ukemi was much better than before. I'm glad I'm actually learning something. I really really pray that I can remember to apply them from now, even if I don't do the same exercises wherever I'll be going. I do agree my ukemi seems to have improved a little. Obvious because I don't seem to hurt myself as much as before. But of cause there's a whole other room for improvement and I'm really hoping to pick up some more about this area.  I just borrower a video from Sensei Pauline on O-Sensei. It shows a bit of history and a little of his techniques. Truly remarkable. Problem is that because they were originally from 8mm footages, the quality are not very good. It's also quite funny to see the many senior Sensei's of Aikido when they were young. Some of them really looked quite different. I really couldn't tell which was Tamura Sensei. But I was able to pick out Saito and Kisshomaru Senseis.  Recently I also found a new club in Singapore, Ban Sen Juku, from a Belgium website. The most interesting thing to me is that they offered Iai training, one of my greatest interest. From my really limited understanding and knowledge, I just feel that Iai training can be (or is) a really integral part in Aikido training too. The relation in posture, movement, technique, stance and even balance just feels so close to each other. Prior to my return to UK, I found out that Ah Hee Sensei is actually a certified teacher for Goshindo (long and short sword), and I was thinking of approaching him to learn from him when I return to Singapore. I hope to drop by BSJ S'pore to find out more about their classes and syllabus too. It's great to have so many options available. To think that a few months back, I was just lamenting that anyone interested in swordwork could only pick up Kendo. But that, to me, is another different aspect of swordwork and one that I'm really not too keen to learn. After about a day however, I got an email saying that the club wasn't established in Singapore. It was a mistake on the Belgium site. Nevermind, I can always ask Ah Hee Sensei about this.  Sometimes I really wonder what is my interest in all these martial arts. Am I really interested in learning them. And how long I can keep it up with pressures such as, family life, girlfriend, future job pressure, work schedules etc. But I think I maybe thinking abit too much about it. All these details aren't stopping me from learning yet. But I'm really trying to avoid being put into a spot where I have to prioritise or choose one of them someday. I really want a balance and I hope that the people around me will be able to accomodate and understand that. Like I said, it's way too early now. So I'll just take things as they come.  Been contemplating my last few months here in the UK too, like what I plan to do and all that. If I can finish my project before easter holiday, I hope to go on a 3-4 days trekking trip. Think that should be quite fun but really is highly dependent on the progress of my project.  After that will be my exams. If God wills it, I really want my last paper to end before the last weekend of May. Sensei Pauline has mentioned there's a 1 wk summer camp being organised up at Bangor University in North Wales (Chiba Sensei will be there!). I'm really hoping I can go for it, but again, it depends on when's my final paper.  After exams, I probably need to spare 2 wks on a tour with my girlfriend (Corrine!!). I'm hoping to visit a poly classmate and his wife in Sweden, who is a Navy regular and was posted there for sub-marine training.  After that really depends on when my parents are coming before my convocation. If they come over early, naturally I need to spend time with them and just pay a visit to some places here. If they're gonna save some money by coming only for my convocation, hopefully I can find and join some uchi deshi programme here in UK. Currently I've only managed to find 2 dojos online. Of course I'll be consulting my Sensei on this as she may have a better recommendation or suggestion but whatever the case I will only go if she gives her approval for it.  All the plans I have are really dependent on how much money I have left when the time comes. I estimate that to go for all of these I may need at least 500+ pounds. Of course if I sacrifice some of these ideas the required budget will be less. Since I don't intend to tax my parents by asking them for more money, I think my budget will be a tremendous consideration when the time comes. Sigh, sometimes just wish money can drop from they sky when I need them. I don't need a lot, just enough to fulfil my plans. (But I guess if they did, I'd only make plans for trips to Hombu dojo, Japan and the likes hahaha. Moore's law truly applies as well in my case.)

      I was doing more reading and research on Aikido.  Been to the late Saito Sensei's tribute pages. He has really left behind a legacy. A huge number of students from different countries have benefited from their experiences with him. His passing is a truly sad event and I feel that he will be sorely missed. But we can all be glad that his many students show that a part of him lives on in them and I hope that every bit of his legacy will be passed on and down to the future generations of Aikido-kas.  I've also been reading up on Aikido Yuishinkai's founder, Koretoshi Maruyama Sensei. He once held office as the President of Ki no Kenkyukai.  He offered some particularly enlightening insights about Aikido. I've exerpted some from their  urlLink website .  "to move quickly does not mean body speed, but mind speed.  Through Ki extension and by using the mind, the body can respond naturally and quickly."  "When questioned about aikido politics and the Aikido Yuishinkais founding premise of, Aikido without boundaries, Sensei explained that all styles of aikido are welcome to train and that Aikido Yuishinkai students are free to experience training wherever they choose. Sensei further explained that politics are like American English.  Depending on the geographic part of the country you happen to be in, everyone thinks their own accent is the correct one.  He expressed that there was only one aikido, that taught by the founder, Morihei Ueshiba.  Differences are created by different perceptions.  Much division is created by money and ego. Maruyama Sensei doesnt see his aikido as right and everyone elses as wrong.  He says aikido is like a feast.  Some choose the salty foods and some choose the sweet.  Everyone should decide what they like. He said Aikido Yuishinkai was like a beautiful fruit tree.  It does not need to be advertised or promoted-people will come to pick the precious fruit."

      I've been surfing around some Aikido websites again. Just to keep myself updated on the happenings in Singapore. It's really tough doing so when I'm on a separate continent.  Anyway, I was estimating how long it took for anyone to find the Aikido in Singapore website. Basically, it takes a while. I realised it actually goes to the other clubs first, such as Ki Aikido, Aikido Yuishinkai and Aikido Federation before they see my site. A real pity.  I also noticed that ShinJu-Kai pops up quite readily in a general search on Aikido. Though I've been to their websites countless times, I've never searched for the term ShinJu-Kai before today. I realised that among all the clubs in Singapore (so far), they are the only one which has been expanding. I noticed an Aikikai Shanghai branch which is affiliated to ShinJu-Kai. This is really cool. Now I'm getting kind of interested into the strategy that ShinJu-Kai adopts in spreading Aikido. Even Philip Sensei's original organisation Aikikai (Singapore) has remained kind of stagnant for a period. One might even argue that they've already downsized following Freddy Sensei's resignation from Aikikai (Singapore) to form Aikido Federation (Singapore).  Sigh, a sad thing in the Aikido world. I realised it's not entirely uncommon since the old days. Say, Koichi Tohei's split from Aikikai to form the Ki-Society, and also US Aikido Federation's leaving of the International Aikido Federation in 2002. All these are way out of my league and I just hope that I will be able to steer clear of all these in my Aikido learning.

      I was just lazing this morning before my classes started this afternoon. OKOK, not really slobbing lah. I did do some ushiro ukemi in the living room. Didn't hurt myself ... yet. Proabably because I did it really slowly.  After awhile, it suddenly dawned on me about an experience with some beginners I had last week.  I was paired with a new-comer to the Uni's dojo and we were going through Shihonage. Well, each time I brought him down to the ground, he was able to slip out of the pin I had on his arm either completely or at least halfway by rolling out from under his own arm. This brought to mind about what I was doin (or wasn't doing).  I wasn't able to completely hold him in a pin because my technique wasn't really good, and second because I wasn't commmitting fully into the technique either.  Just a few minutes prior to my blog (and what prompted me to write this blog), I was surfing around AikiWeb and reading some articles. That's when the picture of the scene I had in last week's class just popped into my mind. (I dun understand why because what I was reading didn't bear any close link.)  Anyway I remembered a second instance in which I paired up with Steve, who's been with the dojo for about a school term. I remembered him being stiff when I was still fumbling with a kokyuh o technique on him. (In his own friendly words, he said it's probably him "just being difficult"... nice chap hehheh.) Anyway, some of the techniques I did went easily on others but not on him. Similarly, I was poor in my technique and I was still trying to be 'nice'.  I'm not saying I should go around breaking pple's arms, but I'm just hoping that I can train towards being able to feel how a beginner is coming towards me and still being able to handle him despite his 'stiffness'. In addition to my previous blog, here's another point I can look forward to by training with someone who is unfamilar in Aikido.  I should explore the little loopholes which my partner exposes and make use of them fully. If I should 'hurt' him/her a little in the process (pls note that I dun mean injuring my partner), I think that is a form of training for them too. If they decide to stop participating because "that chap in the dojo always gets too rough", I think they are limiting their own Aikido experience. But if they should see and understand something from it, I think they might've discovered something about Aikido.  We should endeavor to moderate a little of our "niceness" to our partner, not to make things unnaturally easy (or hard) for them. Instead, we should probably apply whatever level of restraint and 'nastiness' with the thought that whatever we do to them will enable them to realise something for themselves. It's not easy to keep this in my mind when I'm thinking of learning a technique by pairing up with a senior, but it sure will be easier to try it out with a junior.

      Err the guys are still playing the drinking game ... ar duh ...   But at least, they are all having fun and enjoying themselves.  Was surfing around just now and I saw Aikikai (Singapore)'s website, wah they actually went to the extent to post a certificate of Hombu's recognition certificate on their website. That's like ... wah liew ... such a cheapo thing to do. I really have no idea what they are doing lah ... but with all due respect to Hombu and the art, I think it really suxs. Brings down their image. I think the best way is to put it under the section "About Us" instead.  My goodness. ShinJu-Kai actually post a notice on their site saying that due to the pneumonia thingy, they're suspending classes for the next few practice. Looks like the case is really quite a big thing in Singapore now. And if anyone hasn't checked out ShinJu-Kai's photos page, I'd really suggest popping in for a look. They've got quite a few good shots of the whole event.  Tendoryu's website still hasn't got anything up yet. I'm eagerly anticipating what they are planning for their website.

      My housemate is having a bbq in our backyard right now. Basically inited the biggest buncha people. All from engine dept. They're on a drinking binge now. Making a bit of ruckus but still within acceptable limits. One is feeling like really drunk right now and he's gone to bed (at 6pm heh heh). He tried to make me drink 1 shot on his behalf but I stood by my ground. No compromise when it came to drinking alcohol.  OK lah, last week was siongest week for me but also quite glad that it's all over. Tues I had 1 last supervisor meeting. It was a group meeting in which they went through all the key points expected in a good report. Was really helpful. One very impt point he mentioned was that if we felt that we did pretty bad for the program, the marks would really count in a report. I've got 2 wks to get it done. Wed I had my Jap test. Basically listening and written. Wasn't terribly difficult just wasn't really a walkover. I prob won't do well but I think (hope)  I might be able to clear it.  Night came and I went for Aikido (also after having been skipping it for quite sometime). It was the last class in Uni. Again I brought down the ideo cam but I really didn't manage to get much good footage. And worst, most footage I captured was at a really bad and odd angle. Think I'll probably get more footages in my coming 3 classes thiss holiday. We did variations of kokyu nage. Started gyaku hamni katatedori with the normal tenkan turn and throw, followed by a ryotedori tenkan and throw. There was one in ai hamni as well. All these led on to the final variation. The last one we did was with 2 persons, each grabbed an arm with a 2 handed grab. Still kokyu nage and it was an immense test for coordinating both left and right hands. Sensei pointed out something to me tonight. That I needed to respond with much more confidence "You're a 5th kyu now and going onto 4th. Gone were the days where you wait and pause before you perform the technique." I accepted her gracious comment and I keep reminding myself to practice as she had said now.  Basically that evening there was only 6 students. John, Yannis, me, and the beginners were 'Magik' (think that's how his name is spelt), and a couple; Alex and Rachel Royal. Gotta comment on these 2. They are really friendly and nice folks prob about 30+ yrs old. Alex is quite stiff but he's trying hard, especially with his ukemi. He get really tired and breathless sometimes a bit too soon. Rachel always like to grab me as her uke/nage. She says she like me not throwing her as hard as some would I think. Haha ... something I really should be working on correcting.  At the end of class, I took a dojo photo. Will try to post it online somewhere this holiday. We ended about 30 mins early and went to Staff House for a chat and a drink. Had a cup of coke and some chips. It was an enjoyable get together. Sensei shared some insight into the character of Chiba Sensei. He's a very hard and formal budo man. She said something about a 'love-hate' thing. You either love or hate the guy really. Very very domineering person who knows exactly what he wants. Eerything he asks of you may seem hard/tough. But the things he expects from you, he's already done it and gone beyond that. However much and hard you think you're doing, he's done it much more and much harder. However much you've pushed, he's done that before as well and beyond. That's why I think he has such expectations. But he really is a very nice man. He has a many students but he really isn't the type that most of them would have a relationship with. I think it's something like when I was serving my BMT. Some Sgt don't expect to get too close to the recruits so as to maintain the line of command and all that. A lot of people has mentioned to my Sensei that she has a very good relationship with Chiba Sensei which I agree as well. I've not seen them together but I think she's like one of his closer students. In fact 3 wks from now, he'll drop by (on his way to France) and will be staying 2 days at my Sensei's place. Heard he loves to fish and my Sensei is staying near a really nice fishing area.  Fri came and I had my 30 min demo. Both the lecturers were late. I was quite panicky about it. Slept about 3 hrs (though I actually intended to grab a nap of juz 30 mins) the night before while still working on some last min stuff. The lecturers were quite decent about the whole thing and I think things went a lot better than I deserved. I had to mention that I didn't use any 3rd party software to do my VRML geometic productions and I think that realy scored some small point with them. The overall product isn't too fantastic though. After my report is done, I'll try to setup a webpage where I can put my project up.  Anyway, got home. Took a nap and got up for a run. Manage to feel my stamina coming back then as well. Prob do more runs this holiday and some swimming. Will still be going to Uni to get most of my studying done. Night I think I'll work on my VR module project (diff from my FYP). Basically model a Jap looking dojo which may double as a Virtual dojo online. If anyone has any ideas about what I can put inside, I'm pretty open to suggestions. I'm definitely going to put in video clips for viewing.  Sat came, went to get groceries in the morning, tried to revive the server but to no avail. Hdd looks like it's goin soon. Looks very unstable now. Anyway my housemate decided to use her laptop as the server but that means that we can't go online after she's gone to bed because she refuses to on her laptop 24/7.  Oops, I failed to mention that after my project demo, I went to grab a G.I. hair cut. No. 1 on the back and sides. Kewl man. But freaking cold when the cold wind blows (hmm isn't that a song?).

      Woohoo!!! It's all over!!! Project demonstration. Yeeehaaaaa!! ... OK I'm ecstatic now but I do realise I got a lot of things to follow up on within the next 2 week. Project report for 1. If u guys are interested, I'll just upload the thingy somewhere. But you'll need to download a plugin for your browser to be able to view VRML. I didn't manage to have time to integrate these into Java (heard it takes a whole lot of time so I decided to forego it, no point spending that amount of time when it's just 4 buttons to press around.)  A lot of stuff has been happening this past week. Aikido, work, house, friends. I'll share them later coz ... today is the LAST DAY OF SCHOOL!!!!! I need to clear some stuff and photocopy some notes so I can start my lessons next week. Hate to come running to school and waste time doing all these during holidays. If I have to come, I'd much rather it was productive rather organising all the shitty stuff mentioned above.  Ja mata.

      OK just now saw my supervisor liao. It was actually a group meeting of all his project students. He was giving us tips on how to proceed with writing our dissertation. Looks like if I cannot write my program properly, I have another shot at it by writing a better report. The weightage isn't very clear/well defined. I think they really need to see your program and your report to be able to give an overall score. Still got hope lah basically. Must fully use the next 2 weeks to write 1 swee swee report.  After the group meeting, I met him in the labs to clarify some VRML thingy he already told me before. Heng, he's quite patient with me. Seems like I'm very kok-headed. Anyway I'm just waiting for my coursemate to finish his class before we go back to my place for makan. Beats walking back alone.  Only lastnight, my ex-girlfriend's housemate got robbed. I only heard about it this morning. The moment he left the train station, 4 guys shoved him against the fence and robbed him of his mobile and train pass (dunno if he lost any money). Heard they were going to beat him up but when they saw someone coming they ran off instead. Frankly, just imagining myself in his shoes and I feel a bit pumped up with adrenaline. Not because I want to nikkyo them lah. But because there's a sort of helplessness in the situation. I'm not sure I would've resisted (of whether I can in the 1st place). It's lucky that my ex got home just before her housemate did. I can't imagine how dangerous it would've been for her to have been robbed by the 4 guys.  I guess I'll just have to keep my eyes peeled whenever I pass by that area late. And I think the guys in the house need to take more care and effort to meet the girls and walk them back home. Really terrible. Wish I was able to take 4 guys on or at least have 'that' kinda level of Aikido that I don't have to worry about being attacked suddenly. Haiz ... Aikido o shimasu, gambatte kudasai!!!

      Well, no surprise that my house server crashed again 1 final time. Think it's almost breathing it's last coz no matter what kinda options I restarted it in, it just came out the MS blue screen. Can't even enter safe mode anymore. Suspect the harddisk finally gave in. Anyway, lagi best. Means I can concentrate properly on my project meeting tonight, my Jap test tomorrow and my project demo this Fri. DAMMIT!!!! Kuusooooo!!! (Note the effect of knowing  urlLink someone  who throws in Jap verses every now and then.)  Oh yar, last weekend Annie (housemate, in 2nd year medical school) had a group presentation to prepare. She invited 2 of her friends over and one of them (another Annie) brought 2 Chihuahuas!! Cute leh. I always knew how one looked like, but to have 2 of them running around and licking your finger was like ... wooohooo. Did I mention they were cute little bugger? Fed them a bit of ham and they started to hang around my feet when I wanted levae the kitchen with my ham sandwich. Heard they'll be dropping in sometime this Easter again and they'll be going to the nearby park for a walk. Woohoo ... Chihuahuas.  I'm probably not gonna start server revival operations till this weekend. But only after a well deserved break and maybe a lunch in town or something. FRI!!!! FRI!!!!! C'mon!!! Anyway, won't be online till my server comes back on. Cheers.

      Well can't believe it. I had actually done a bit of progress for my project the past few days. But still some way to go in terms of coding. I love VRML. I'm not proficient at it but I think it's just wonderful. Before term ends, I'm gonna copy every past year project I can find on the module site. They make for fantastic references. Gonna burn them on a cd and go back Singapore to study it properly. Kewl man.  Anyway, I finally finished my book, Warriors of God, by James Reston Jr. Yea yea, I'm surprised I still have time to leaisure-read books, but it took me quite a long while. Been getting back into reading since I came back to UK. Think I owe my thanks to one of my housemate. He's like a freaking walking encyclopedia. Well, navy regular studying Economics lah. 1 of those award/scholarship/bursary winners (think not considered scholarship), so must be a real smart fella I guess. Quite interesting to hear his views on current affairs and all that. Anyway back to the book, it's about Richard the Lionheart and Saladin during the 3rd Crusades. There were 5 Crusades in all, and the only 1s that were really considered a success would probably be the 1st and the 3rd, but the latter is really debatable. Some interesting facts, Richard the Lionheart was a gay. Apparently he had an 'relationship' (ahem ahem) with the kind of France (who ultimately became 1 of his most direct enemies). Richard hs always been made out to be sort of a war hero and goodie goodie guy when in actual fact, it seems like Saladin had exercised more kindness to his enemies than Richard did. There was this particular moment that I remember in the book where they were going through some diplomatic discussion for a possible peace treaty and when Saladin didn't reply, Richard actually marched a the Muslim prisoners of war to the front lines and had them executed in plain view of the Muslims. Saladin on the other hand had displayed a great level of graciousness to his enemies by releasing his prisoners of war during the capture of an enemy fort/town. During the final battle of the 3rd Crusades, Richard was unhorsed. Saladin sent him a horse only because it did not 'befit the status of a king to be standing on the same level as his own men'. But despite all these, I really must agree that Richard was one helluva tacticion and strategist. In that sense, Saladin might even be just a notch below him. 2 great leaders.

      Dunno if anyone has seen this, the  urlLink Aiki Forum . Looks good. It's still relatively new but seems promising.  Benedict Loh, the super administrator, is a Computer Science undergrad (I'm assuming that means he's a NUS student) who trains with ShinJu-Kai (Gek Poh dojo).  Well, looks like Singaporeans are taking a first step into making a mark on the Internet. Hmmm now all we need are names like Aiki.net, Aikido.net, Aikido.SG, etc.

      OK I've just evaluated the Interactive-X blog site. Well it looks simple and nice enough to use lah.  It doesn't seem like I can modify much html codes inside. Looks really funky (maybe a little too much so for me). You can upload MP3 onto it as well, provided they are original MP3s which do not breach copyright laws (where's the fun in that then, sheesh). There's 1 really irritating thing about it, it keeps refreshing something in the background, I dunno what. Once it got so bad it was doing it like every 3-5 seconds. I wasn't even able to key in my login ID and password properly. When I finally did, it just constantly refreshed and I can't get anything done. Think it's just an occasional hiccup because when I closed the browser and went back to the site, it never got that bad again. But it still does the background refreshing thingy coz u can hear mouse click sounds every like 10 seconds or so.  Bottom line? I'm not gonna use.

      I had forgotten that I had registered with  urlLink another blogging site . I'm not sure if it's better or not but it looks funkier than Blogger.  Anyone tried / checked it out before? Any comments? Looks quite good though. Doesn't seem to have ads inside either. I Haven't tried customising it at all yet. Not sure if it's possible.

      Hmmm I'm thinking I may need to postpone the trek with the guys next month. I think I may be squeezing in too much stuff before the exams. I'll put the thought forward to them about doing it right after the exams instead. Anyway, it'll be summer by then and we should be expecting better weather and temperature also.  Haiyar! It's no wonder I was told to reduce the suaning for 1 of my housemates. Coz she just got together with David recently. Alamak, I should've known. I was finding it rather suspicious also. How come he can suan but I cannot suan ... hmmmmmm  . Now I understand lah huh. OKOK must give my brudder some face haha.  And my finances / budgeting this term has been a real mess. I think come Apr I really gotta get them updated. Still have enough cash lah, just don't have an idea of exactly how much I'll have for each month. And I really should keep track of all these so that I won't have any problem with planning for trips later. Basically I can just easily look and know whether my cash is enough or not. It's a good habit that always seem to get mess up when I reach the 2nd term.  Gonna have to skip Aikido tonight and tomorrow. There's suppose to be a weekend course this coming weekend. Had to give it a miss. If I'm lucky, I can probably attend the on with Chiba Sensei around the end of May. Keeping my fingers crossed now.  Tentative plans will prob be like: Apr - Easter holidays and study for exam, postpone trekking to after exams - Email SPF asking about intake dates and contract details May - Check with Pauline Sensei about the possibilities of uchideshi programs in UK - Revision lectures + Exams Jun - Exams may end in 1st wk. May go trekking for few days - Visit Marcus+Ivy in Karlskrona, Sweden - Visit Karlskrona Aikidoklubb (wooo, is dat swede/dutch language) - Return UK collect results - End of school - mid Jun, pack and start shipping stuff back to Singapore - Visit Gary?? OR Uchideshi program (3-4 wks) Jul - Convo (16th-23rd) - Parents coming either juz b4/after convo Aug - Return S'pore latest early/mid Aug

      OK lah. The pace of my life this week is revolving a bit too fast. A fully packed week due to my final year project, slow progress, my 5th kyu grading on Wed, worrying for my coming jap test in 2 weeks, my project demo in 2 weeks, possibility of goin on a 5 day 4 night trek on the 1st weekend of the Easter holidays, project documentation due in 4 wk's time, 1 jap test when school reopens and studying 1 year's worth of sch work in 4 wks while juggling the above mentioned stuff. ARGHGHGHGHGH!!!! OK lemme blog a bit to calm myself 1st.  Tues's Aikido was ok. I recorded the class and had them digitised. If anyone's interested, I can send over via ICQ. Also digitised the 1st AFS grading. Well, left a bit of the 2nd kyu grading lah, basically only the tachiwaza not digitised. We went through the 5th kyu syllabus and I was kind of just going through the motions in training. My heart and mind just wasn't there. At the end of class, when we did a revision of the whole night, there were some techniques I just couldn't remember. Shitz how do you remember everything anyway. Until now I always have this problem. Maybe it's because I'm not concentrating fully lah. Well, when class ended, we were told that grading will be next Tues. I was still thinking that I had the weekend to find my senior and clarify some stuff.  Wed came. Just before class Sensei asked if I received the 5th kyu grading syllabus which she had emailed me that very evening just a few hrs ago. I replied I had not because I had left the house early this evening. The 1st hour with the beginners was ok. Sensei made us do some techniques which were actually part of 5th kyu grading. Being the fool I am, I didn't notice. Like I said, I just went throught the motion of class again. We did quite a few times of ai hamni nikkyo but somehow it always registered in my brain as an ikkyo. The 2nd hr came, and again I just followed blindly. We did a lot of techniques. If felt like a blur to me because I wasn't really thinking much. Basically just using my eyes and not my brain. I probably saw a lot of stuff but never really understood them. Haiz... We started off with hanmi hantachi kaitennage. My partner, Yanni / Yarni (Greek), couldn't be nage because he has a bad knee. So while waiting for a chance to ask Sensei if he can do the tachi waza version, we just carried on 1st (problem was Sensei was concentrating rather hard and long with the beginners so we actually did quite awhile of hanmi hantachi). Wah, wat a killer. I started off ok. But quite possibly because I was already half tired out from the 1st hr, I lost my stamina after mabbe 6x of the technique. My knees were so knackered out. Until ultimately I felt off balanced and out of breath. When permission was given for Yanni to proceed with the tachi waza variations, the reprieve didn't help me much. Because he was good, his turn always finished really fast and soon I would be nage again. Techniques carried on and all I wanted to do was to finish so that I can go home for a rest. As uke, most techniques that night were forward rolls and I also burned myself out over these.  In the last 15 mins, we were told to line up. Thinking it was the end of class, I was quite thankful and hopped quickly to the end of class. However, instead of ending, she asked Angelo (also grading for 5th kyu) and me out. Next she wanted 2 ukes. The beginners were told to get comfortable (but some of them, not knowing what was really going on, just kept on kneeling for the remaining 15 mins). We were told to do a variety of techniques; katatedori gyaku and ai hamni shihonage, ai hamni iriminage (jodan and chudan variations), ikkyo and nikkyo and some others I can't remember at this point. Nikkyo was the one that caught me. Like I mentioned, I kinda thought they were some weird looking ikkyo variation so I took awhile to remember what I needed to do. I was simply horrible. There was a few rounds of gyaku hamni tenchinage (2 variations). Next was kokyu ho (standing) and kokyunage. Randori was quite ok I suppose. She asked us if we still recalled the sankyo, yonkyo, gokyo, rokyo which we did for a straight 2-3 wks sometime ago. I think both of us could only remember certain variations but not all of them. I basically did 1 sankyo, 2 yonkyo and 2 nikkyo. As usual my nikkyo suxed. I think this was Sensei's way of giving me a 2nd chance for my nikkyo. Haiz ... I dunno lah. We ended grading by taking ukemi. It was a whole lot easier to me than asking me to be nage. At least I had more time to clear my head. Taking a few rolls here and there helped a lot.  Well, both of us passed. Angelo did considerably better than me - "nice strong techniques, but need more work on ukemi". My comments were "techniques were nice and technically good, but lacked 'fire and life'. There were a lot of stuff in the head, but not enough was coming out in action". Come to think of it, I wasn't even really like applying my techniques properly, it was more like trying to get the actions 'right'. That's my problem I guess, my Aikido never works because I never really use the technique on my uke seriously. She ended by saying she wants to see me work on this area for my 4th kyu. (Despite, knowing that I'll be graduating this year.) At the end of it, I'm happy I passed. But I wasn't happy with my performance at all. Quite sad really. I had wanted to do a lot better actually. Well, that just leaves me with a lot of areas I should be looking out for then.  This grading made me realise a bit more about myself. My non-aggressiveness during Aikido is not really the right attitude. I think like omote and ura versions of a technique, there are times I should be stepping in instead of stepping back. Causing a bit of pain to my uke is acceptable (so long as I don't make it really excruciating for them lah). Think my attitude during class needs a lot of work also. My mind drifts a bit sometimes.  Thursday I woke up to find my knees and elbows were a bit bruised and one had a small cut on it too. Think something on the mat caused the cut when I took ukemi for ikkyo. There were 2 marks on both wrists but I don't remember being yonkyo-ed the night before. Went school for a few hours in the morning and went back home. Had to prepare dinner for the house on Thursday. Very sian lah when it came to feeding them sometimes. I admit that I'm not the best cook in the house, neither do I put in a lot of effort cooking my dishes. They have to be practical, easy to cook and edible. But 2 of the guys were making a bit of noise that my cooking lacked effort. What the heck?! Cook for you guys also need to listen to this kind of crap. So I just 'jokingly' commented that at the most I can always pull out of the cooking arrangement and make my own meals instead of sharing. Whether they can tell that I wasn't exactly in a good mood I do not know, but the atmosphere sure didn't get out of hand. Later on that night, I had supper and again we came back to the topic about my attitude to food. Having calmed my mood down a bit I was able to jokingly point out that one of my housemate is too picky with food. I don't have an answer to this lah, maybe I'm imposing my taste on them, but I think they are putting me in a similar spot by imposing their taste on me too. Anyway, I'll see how things go. I do enjoy their cooking but if I have to tax myself every week (even though it's just once a week), I really just can't be bothered at all.  Sorry if I sound like I'm complaining but I think I need to spend a bit of time outside of my house and alone. My housemates are all nice people but I'm sorry to say that the chances of staying in contact with each other will be almost impossible when I go back to Singapore. There are just some things we can't stand about each other and I don't see me being the type to stay in constant contact with them when we aren't really that close. The few bonding sessions we have had while in UK really doesn't make us that much more closer. It only exposes us to what habits the other person has but that does not mean we can accept it. I occasionally need to remind myself that there must be a ton of things that people can't stand about me and they're just keeping quiet only. That helps me to tahan their different lifestyle. Sad lifestyle lah in UK. Can't expect too much, just live with it and go home after that. Don't be mistaken that I'm really having a miserable time in UK. I would still recommend anyone to try staying abroad for a period. There's a lot of things you will expose yourself to rather than cacoon yourself in Singapore. I think I just have too much stuff on my mind and I hope things get better this Easter holiday.  I went back home for dinner just now but a part of me didnt really want to stay home and listen to crap from people. So I decided to come to Uni to do some work and blog out my unhappines and grievances for the past few days. Heh :P

      I know I know, I was suppose to be working but I just visited the  urlLink Aikido Federation's website  and I saw the new addition of video clips and the kids class at Gombak. Arhahahahaah!!! Some of them were so funny. I saw one guy making a funny face when Freddy Sensei was trying to teach him iriminage. And the last 2 clips looked like they were playing games. What on earth was that all about? Hmmm ... strengthening their arms, maybe?  Just had to make a note of this on the blog. Cute fellas. Oh yes, Ms Ng was inside in the background and assisting. By the way, who was doing the recording anyway?

      Wow, another club in Singapore - Tendoryu Aikido Singapore (TAS). Their  urlLink website  is still being updated.  2 days ago, their secretary emailed to inform me that CAA and TAS were not related. She sounded friendly enough. Luckily I checked my account today. Updated the Aikido in Singapore blog but somehow the site seems to be down pretty often. My personal blog doesn't seem to have it as often. I might have to change it to something more reliable for Aikido in Singapore.  I emailed my Sensei to ask if I can record down some of our training sessions for personal interest. She hasn't replied my email yet (just checked prior to publishing this blog). But just in case, I've already brought all my stuff to Uni since this afternoon (coz I'm not going home first). Even had to loan the brand new 38 ltr backpack which Daniel (my housemate) just got for his birthday last weekend. Alamak, opening ceremony by me somemore. But the bag was cheap and good (by North Face). I'll probably go get one this weekend (if the sale is still on), otherwise I'll always have problem carrying my Gi and notes for training on Wed. Today was especially heavy because of the video camera and a tripod stand I loaned (from Daniel again :P). Wah, I tell you, look damn professional leh. Hehe. Even worst, heng heng everything I bring with me is in black. Black tripod bag, black backpack, black t-shirt, black gloves. Daniel said, all I need now was a black sunglass.  Really hope Pauline Sensei won't object. If I can, I'll digitise some nice clips and send to  urlLink Eileen  and  urlLink Gary . It'd be interesting to show everyone how cuckoo I can be sometimes hahaha. Cuckoo-Tan ...   ...  OK better finish up some stuff before I go and see my supervisor in about 1 and a half hour. After that, it's Aikido!

      Just went to check out the price for a plane ticket from London to Denver International. Wah, expensive sia. Going to cost me about 350 for a RTN ticket. But I still need to check one more lobang before I know if its possible to make the trip. Chamz. Was estimating my budget and I may not have enough to go both places. Haiz ...  Maybe if I can sell a few more phones I might be able to make it. But I think if ultimately I really can't. Then I might just stay on in UK to do an uchideshi program here instead. Need to get my Sensei's approval of course.  So much details to check out and confirm before I can start making a choice. Ma fan!!!!

      Eh yar huh, nowadays Shuhua's always going to ECP. What for anyway? Looking for some charbor to sian there issit? :P Eh don't forget there's a lot of army people there leh. Remember to wave your pink IC around and throw it in their faces shouting "  Ar hahahaha, chow recruit / NSF, wahahahahha ... ORD liao ORD liao!! Me 3SG (NS) Foo now ... wahahahah you suckers!!" Eh wait wait, I still got 4 mths to serve, scarly you'll see me there one of those days.  Yea, well even though I was kinda in a bad mood, but I think I might have overeacted. Coz when one of the girls threw an old Chinese New Year decoration at me, I kinda went a bit off the edge and just said, "Eh please, I feel like scolding some vulgarity now hor, ok." Think that kinda told the whole room what kind of state my mood was in. Of course, now I think of it, I'm just glad I didn't. She didn't like do anything really bad. And even if the others were a bit noisy, I think it doesn't really warrant an overeaction on my part. I dunno, sometimes you really get the kind of effect like Stephen Chow's movies Xi You Ji (Journey to the West) part 1 and 2, where Tripitaka was like a freaking fly always buzzing around the ears. I mean, c'mon lah, even Guan Yin in the show tried to trottle him once. To those who've not seen it, let me try to illustrate this point:  Wukong was trying to steal some heavenly device and got caught by Guan Yin. While meting out punishment, Tripitaka arrived at the scene and started pleading for mercy on Wukong's behalf, but he has this stupid habit of talking too much (in a very irritating sort of way). He says: "Wukong, why didn't you tell me you wanted the magic box? I mean you should have told me you wanted it. If you've told me you wanted it then I would've given it to you. You didn't need to steal it. If you didn't tell me about it, then how can I give it to you?... "  And somehow, the sentence isn't quite over, he still went on and on and on and on. If you actually translated it into Chinese, you can tell it's a long sentence. Especially irritating since all the sentences contained basically one meaning only. Just that it's magnified 10x. You probably just need to go watch the show yourself to know how funny it really is.  Anyway, think later I'll apologise to them about my mood lastnight. But I still think it was a bit irritating. I like to watch my own show and movie quietly. Anything you don't understand, I think can be settled at the end of the show. Of course, if your memory isn't too good, then that's probably going to be a problem. Think in this case, just remember that it's a S-H-O-W or a M-O-V-I-E, and just accept it as it is. That's a good enough reason. I also really can't be bothered to put too much effort to convince others about how I interpreted what I've watched, unless the topic deserves a good discussion.

      OK ... I'm like in a really bad mood now. Was watching TV just now, and I really can't stand it when folks just keep asking questions throughout the show. I'd really prefer it when everyone can just watch quietly and just ask questions during the commercials or after the show. I don't care to what extent that you understood the show so far or anything. If you really wanna ask it. At least ask someone who is willing to answer, not distract others so you can get your answer. Maybe such demands are unreasonable, or maybe I myself would do it sometimes, but really ... I'm not in the mood to self reflect now. When I do cool down, I'll do it. Sheesh ... all this shitz over one stupid televesion show.

      O yea, about Tamura Sensei, my Sensei told me some things about him before. Coz I was watching the summer camp they had in 2000 and Tamura Sensei was 1 of the 4 instructors there. Can't remember what it was he was teaching but I think it had a lot to do with feeling uke. I think a lot of the yudanshas at the camp that he was correcting didn't quite get that as well. You can tell they weren't reacting very well a lot of times. Heh ... guess we're all learning. And I heard Tamura has like one of the longest warmups ever. Sensei Pauline was commenting that they planned him in a certain slot because they know that was one of his habits. Heh, sometimes he'd look at everyone there and say "Oh they don't need any rest." but actually may be some of them might think "Oh but we do" instead. XP A lot of Tamura Sensei's warmups I heard Sensei Pauline mention sounded really really familar to Freddy Sensei's, maybe that's where he picked them up from. Interesting. One more farny thing was that Pauline Sensei said sometimes Tamura Sensei would pretend that he didn't speak any English. Well it's kind of a tradition thing to have some kind of speech at the end of the camp and Pauline Sensei reminded Tamura Sensei a few times about it. Then I think after trying to act blur for quite awhile, he said "I'll give 1 if you'll give one." So my Sensei went up, clap her hands and said "Excuse me everybody, Tamura Sensei says that he has something he's just dying to tell you" XD~  Self-nikkyo? I know I can't do it. Best I can do is do more of those wrist training push ups instead. I'd like to try some koshinage and sumiotoshi though. Didn't do those much before but I think you'd most probably need to know some really proper breakfall if training with someone like me. Beginners in these techniques can't actually make it very painless for ukes. :P

      Shitz dah, just before I started this blog, spilled water all over myself. My housemate just made mee goreng for us, y'see. Had to drink water and ... splash. 'Puo1 Leng2 Sui3'. Anyway, let me just continue while I wait for my singlet to dry.  Wooooo  urlLink some people  reading technical stuff huh. FAQ somemore. Just telling me to get into a book will put me to sleep. In fact, just thinking about it, makes .... me .... a. .....   ... little ....... zzzzzzZZZZZZZZ .....   ...  This morning was supposed to go Chinese Quaters to 'yum cha' and have some Dim Sum with my housemates. But after buying groceries, I just felt really lazy to leave the house. When those that did go returned, I wished I went as well. WINTER SALE!!! Argh, David bought a nice 30ltr backpack, quite cheaply too. Hmmm ... maybe I'll go next Sat or something. Just hope the sale is still going to be on. I'm so used to being around Uni and home that it slipped my mind about winter sale season.  Feels kinda weird not training Aikido last week. By the way, I simply do not understand the  urlLink slamming exercise  you were referring to. Maybe I'll do act it out in front of my PC when I'm more free. About moving angmohs, well my Sensei (being of small built) really have no problem moving anyone of us who are bigger than her. And you gotta remember the european guys are also a whole lot bigger than me. And er ... I'm sure the fact that she's a 4th dan probably has something to do with it as well. Dunny thing about slamming, I've only heard the term used in Singapore. Over here, they use the term taking breakfall on quite a generic basis. Only diff is how soft/hard nage executes and nage takes breakfall. When I do gyaku hamni variations of kotegaeshi, the static versions are always very weird. Think really need some kinda giving in from uke if nage don't do it well. But once you bring it up to a more dynamic approach like a tsuki or sho/yoko-men, think can do it more smoothly coz there's a flowy feel then. If uke don't let nage do it ... think might as well use some other technique for effectiveness. Doesn't mean it's always the nage's fault. (I get that quite a lot ... from uke's perspective I mean haha). By the way, where do you think you stand in terms of technique and ukemi in the whole class? I'm sure you see some cuckoo things by some people as well right, pretty much like back home. Think I'll be doin nikkyo this coming week. Even if I don't I think the next one will. Coz Sensei gonna spring a grading test on us sometime this term (within 3 weeks). Panicky sia. Not ready leh. Also scared I may need to skip training in my last week coz projects are gonna be due then.  I understand what  urlLink you  meant by "throw yourself when the nage was just about to throw you". I have this problem with over anticipating my nage, like ALL the time. If they did something unpredictable, I doubt I can adjust myself well enough to take ukemi and come out unhurt. My Sensei tries to help us by making us do randori in the last few mins of almost every class. One it helps us recall what we've learnt for the whole 1+ hr, two it helps us take ukemi at a more unpredictable level. I think it's good and helpful for me but I will never be confident. My memory isn't very good. Even if I can remember a bit, my hands and legs rarely follow what I want. My brain just can't multi task at that level I suppose. So I always start after seeing the first few students do some techniques. Heh heh, monkey see monkey do. It's only after a few gos, then maybe I'd change the order a little. Yupz, as Tommy said, my Aikido also "has no life". Gary's right, Tommy's a good partner to practice with. There was this period where I almost almost always heng heng paired up with him for iriminage. It was like 95% of all my iriminage practice. Dunno why so coincidental. Haha I recalled coz after he grabs my neck and throws me, he sometimes commented "wah, you very wet ar you." and I'd just laugh. Damn farny man. Miss the irimanages with him hahaha. O yar, and I also enjoy the after-class-sessions with Jesse. Err ... 'cept that one time before I flew off to UK where he kinda damaged my specs. Now a bit scared hahaha XP  Hey the grabbing part y urlLink  ou mentioned I like what my Sensei does. She always tell us that when we grab nage, pretend there's a 50p coin between our palm and nage's arm. Whatever the nage does, uke needs to follow in such a way that the 50p coin won't drop off when you are doing techniques. Of coz there were always some occasions where we used a real 50p coin to try it out. Works a whole lot better than normal but just remember not to depend on it too much such that uke becomes really artificial. Err, and just in case someone who reads this don't know it, remmeber to let go of the arm when you do get thrown. Otherwise you'll usually find that while your body is somewhere else but your arm is still remaining on nage's arm ... gross out man. Anyway I think it's especially good when doing sitting kokyu-ho. A lot of people I do it with don't practice the grabs properly at all. Over here, my classes place a lot of emphasis on this. Think it's a trademark with my Sensei. In Singapore, almost none of the 6th kyus do it, some of the 5th kyus might though. Anyway, different Sensei - so different style and empahsis also. Sometimes when I grab my Sensei's wrist, she will say "I want you to hold it, not stop blood flowing through it" hahaha ... think that's my point. So I usually try to tell myself consciously to grab lightly to the point of just a touch kinda feeling, but with the palm having almost full and flat contact to her arm.  The part about ma-ai (distancing) is something I'm not doing right either. It's even harder when I want to apply atemi properly. My Sensei points out to me quite often that when I atemi nage, I should make sure I can at least touch him. Otherwise nage will need to shift in more just to do the technique on me. I'm not helping lah basically. I try to remind myself that but I got no 100% effective enough reminder at this moment. With my kinda atemi, my nage could probably just ignore me and step back and walk away. Heh, I'm lousy lah. But in Singapore, a lot of people I practice with don't quite get it leh. There were more than one occasion that I'd just not do my technique and just stand there coz my uke isn't even touching me. I didn't want to point out too obviously but they just hardly get it. Think the atemi I like best is Syed's. Strong, stylo, well at the very least it sure feels and looks like his arm is really gonna hit me (not just graze or touch me only). My Sensei will usually just stand there and not budge, then gimme a sian expression. If I still don't get it, then she'll say something. :P There's a Greek guy in my Uni class who's a 5th kyu. He has really nice ukemi and soft technique. Trying to take note and learn from him. Especially his ukemi is like ultra soft and I like the way he commits in his atemi. Soft yet commited enough for nage. With him, I know that if he falls weird, it's probably because I'm making him do it that way. Me again ... duhz.  Err dun really wanna comment much about the Iraq/UN/US/UK issue here, but I think since US/UK are gonna commit in a strike anyway. They might as well get it over with. I mean they've already expressed that no matter what other countries say, they're still going for it what. Everybody don't want the war obviously, but since there's no holding back so why ... hold back. Go lor go lor.   urlLink Heat wave ? Well, these last 2 days just got wet. REALLY WET AND WINDY. Doubt we'll get any good snow now. But can't complain lah. Weather has been really good since I got here. I should have guessed it wouldn't last. Heard things are gonna get wetter and 'windier' (??) coming weeks. Sianz. Hate walking 30 min to Uni already, now it's gonna be walking to Uni wet.

      OKOK I know I said that I won't be blogging for awhile but I just wanted to make a point. My project IS STARTING TO WORK!!!!! WAhahahahahahaha ... Woohooo!!!!  OK lah, not like working completely. But at least the stupid vehicle is moving (in the wrong direction and along the wrong axis) and I can show my supervisor something tomorrow. Woohoo!!! But think tonight still have to burn midnight oil (drums of them). Darn it!

      OK, it's official. Back to bachelor status now. Had a bit of talk with my ... ex. Well, at least we're still friends. Time will tell if we can remain good friends as we were before we got together. Anyway ... like one of my housemate mentioned, this period is really one of the worst possible time possible for us to put our relationship to the test. Everyone's so busy and all ...  Thanks hor, brother Shuhua, for your comments on my blog. I think I managed to read all of them unless you left some on the blogs which dated about 3 months back. Yea, well I didn't really tell anyone about my girlfriend (ex now) when I was in Singapore. Probably only the 3-4 of my NS kakis and Gary and Marcus/Ivy. Gary knew because we see each other often enough during Aikido, plus I always drop by his place regularly. Marcus because I had mentioned to them before the last time we met before he went to Sweden. Yea, my blog does look like a training manual of sorts. It basically documents what I'm going through daily. As Aikido is a huge part of my life now, it's not surprising that most chunks of it are Aikido related contents, an Aiki-diary if you will. Anyway my VRML project is very slow and status is quite bad now. I'm gonna be skipping Aikido to make up for lots of lost time. May need to spend a lot more hours in school from this Mon onwards. Ai pia jia eh yia! Anyway, own time own target just feel free to drop by and check me out. Leave me a message on ICQ too if you like. But sometimes I maybe asleep or in school. Might have left my laptop running to download some stuff.   urlLink Una-san  (??),  urlLink Aikiyoda  did do 200 cuts a day while he was in Singapore. In fact he was the one who psychoed me into it as well. I did it consistently until I came to UK. Took me a long time before I got my hands on a bokken. I doubt I can do anything physical exercise consistently until my 1 month Easter break. But by then, it's really time for exams revision. Think Gary said he's gonna be getting a bokken there. Well he's definitely going to be getting another set of gi. Damn sponge monster still dirties the dojo mats everywhere he goes. Ar duh...  OK time to get back to my second essay and project.

      OK just an update.  I'm going to be really busy for the next 4 weeks. Probably won't blog much unless I'm like really pissed about something, or really need to note down something. I'm probably not going to Aikdo this week. Just to catch up on some work first.   urlLink Foolz!  I can't do my 200 cuts a day lah. I'll probably scratch my ceiling paint, or my bokken, or even both, if I did.

      My goodness. Made the same housemate cry again lastnight. I don't understand it, it sure looks like I don't practice enough tact when I'm talking to her because the same thing seems to be happening over and over again. But it's weird because we're quite alright friends in the house.  Basically 2 days back, I had pointed out that she tends to forget to clear up some of her stuff and it was becoming a sort of a habit. I wasn't really nasty about it. Her bf did mention something as well. Maybe she felt we were picking on her so she kinda just lost her temperjust a little because you could see her face turning red and her pitch increasing. Well, I have to admit we weren't picking on her lah. It was meant more as a joke and a reminder. But I was very surprised that she got the impression of "why she's the only one being reminded instead of the other people who've been doing it as well". She has a small point to this, but the way I see it, when a problem comes up, it's natural for me to approach the people I feel closer to as I think that together we can help to make things better. I'm thinking she feels picked on lah basically. But I honestly don't feel that I've said anything or outstepped my boundary. I'm sorry about whatever unpleasantness there might be but I really don't see an apology coming from me over this matter. I don't think she's taking my intentions the right way as I wasn't trying to make her the scapegoat for anything. Past 2 days, I noted that she's always making statements like "I'm going to use this particular cup, instead of xxx" => personal cup => can wash at personal convenience, or "OK, you said you'd wash it. I didn't force you to do it huh" ... Sigh ....    Granted, we're all imperfect and forgetful at times. I also tend to forget to do things like clearing up after I'm done. I'm grateful for the next person who comes along and does it for me (which may / may not be all too often), but I really don't think that the next person should clear up after me if they feel that they are being taken advantaged of. There's nothing wrong to just leave the old dishes wherever and just point out to people that they've overlooked clearing up. It's a good reminder, ONLY if you don't get too nasty about how you 'remind' them.  This incident brings to mind the situation we had (have??) at the BV dojo. Where people tend to just leave and not keep all the mats. In an ideal world, if everyone just kept one, it would make things so easy. But as things turn out, the world isn't a fair place. The sooner we accept that the easier we can proceed with doing our job.  It's alright to NOT do some stuff, just don't be too difficult about it. In contradiction, don't push others too far by taking advantage of them, if we just opened our eyes a bit now and then, we may realise that there are rubbish or dishes that disappear even though we never seem to clear them daily.  Also realise 1 final point. I appreaciate what some people have been doin for me in an invisible sense, maybe it's high time I showed some form of appreciation instead of keeping quiet about it.

      OK, I've sent in the email to the Singapore Police Force enquiring the specifics of a career with them as a Senior Police Officer.  I think bottomline is that I don't want just any deskjob for a career. I definitely like something which is a bit more physical than that. I just hope investigative work is more my cup of tea.  I've got my fingers crossed on this now. Really hope things turn out well and I get some kind of promising news from them asap.

      Things I got for my birthday:  On the eve 2 of the girls baked muffins. OK lah, wasn't meant to be my birthday thing but it was still nice.  On my birthday, they made cookies and I took them. 1 of them made me a bowl of 'Mian Xian' (mandarin) / 'Mee Sua' (hokkien dialect). 1 baked a chocolate cake (Mississippi Mud cake/pie, if I remember the term correctly). Had a well spread dinner which was ultra filling. Basically too much food for even the likes of me to finish them all. But it was good.  Got 2 birthday cards. 1 stuffed monkey, and a Bible (graphic novel / comic). Everyone knows I get tired of reading the conventional Bible, so ... heh :P The monkey thing was coz I mentioned before that it'd be really kewl to wear a gorilla suit and just act as a monkey. But they said suit rental for just 1 night was just so expensive. The monkey's cute.  It was a different experience this birthday. Very much so from my 1st year here as well. Definitely more fun then the ones I've ever had in Singapore. Love the people here.  Quarter of a century old ... think I'm in a quarter-life crisis already.  This will probably be my last post on anything even remotely related to my birthday. Cheers.

      25 years old today! Quarter of a century old!! Oldest person among everyone in the house now!!!  Was feeling a bit crappy yesterday until the later part of the night. The (3) guys removed my top and carried me outside the house. Thank goodness they were decent enough to leave my bottoms on. Of course, could be the fact that I didn't quite struggle against them. More you resist, more tempted I'm sure they'd be to carry out a more ... er ... vicious 'sabo' session :P  Hmm being my birthday and all, my mood today has been good. Weather's all nice and sunny and I hope it'll remain like that for the rest of the day. Sigh, I think the people around me also has a sorta positive impact on my mood as well. OK, had to go up to my room and 'act blur' about the cake they're going to make for me today. Touched. Really. Usually I'd not even bother about my birthday. Last time I tried asking people out was sometime ago in Poly. Wasn't particularly fun then either with people being late and all that. Shucks...  Well, let me just set some record straight about stuff that I've blogged about previously. Some may seem downright nasty and all that about people I've came into contact with, that's why I'd really like to re-evaluate my expressed opinions at the time of blogging.   urlLink  Monday, November 25, 2002   About the websites of Aikido clubs in Singapore. No offence intended but my opinion still stands, but please bear in mind some of these sites have seen some other changes by now.   urlLink  Wednesday, December 25, 2002   About the 2002 X'mas dinner at my accoms. Think whatever reaction I had then was clearly exaggerated to a certain extent.  I do still prefer that dinner can be an affair where each and everyone of us are able to sit down and eat comfortably. Well, I suppose a certain level of discomfort to squeeze slightly more people around the table is still acceptable lah.  I'm still unhappy that I do not speak up about things that I may feel pretty strongly about. But I'm also now aware that staying with other people is about a level of acceptance and telerance with each other. There are things people can't stand about me as well. Give and take lah.  Part of the reason why I wasn't too ecstatic about the party was because I didn't feel comfortable mixing with the crowd. Granted, I'm not a very socialable person and I do sorta 'pick' the people I mix with. I think 1 thing I need to work on is being more sincere like how Daniel is. But of course, things like this calls for some kind of moderation too as that doesn't mean mixing with every Tom, Dick and Harry (no offence to anyone by these names). Mustn't let my mood get in the way of my behaviour too often. Think being a certain level of diplomacy is involved in maturing.  Important note. I don't mean to direct any unhappiness I felt then at any of my housemates. I'm glad things happen, for whatever reason. I learn that little bit more each day.   urlLink  Friday, February 21, 2003   A bit of comment on the girls' volume in the house. Realised that us guys get pretty noisy as well. We're no different / better. Just give and take and be considerate to everyone. But of course, we need to be frank and tell each other when anyone feels bothered about the noise level. Everyone in the house is reasonable. To be the 'nice person' and make yourself take things lying down is kinda unnecessary because if the other party knew that he/she/they was/were a pain in the butt, the party involved will just control a bit and make the necessary accomodation. Everyone in the house is nice. There shouldn't be a problem speaking up and talking to each other about how we all really feel.   urlLink  Monday, March 03, 2003   About my breakup with my ex-gf. Think it was all for the best. Wish we can be better friends then we are now but I think there is a certain amount of resistance in both of us at this point. Wish things weren't like this but until each of us start to think and behave differently, there definitely won't be any improvement. At the very least, we are still seeing each other on and off when she comes over for dinner.   urlLink  Month of March, 2003   Realised my mood was really atrocious and unforgivable the period just after my breakup with my ex-gf. I seemed to be taking out any resentment I felt on people around me, most often on 2 of the girls in the house. I'm so sorry for that but I'm also really appreciative of how tolerant my housemates were. Self reflection ar, ah-boy!   urlLink  Friday, March 14, 2003   About cooking. Really need to point out that I'm one of, if not the, laziest person in the house when it comes to food. But as time went on, I realised a point Justin pointed out, it's a real moral booster to be able to look forward to coming back home to a good dinner. No doubt I don't feel as strongly about food as some of my housemates do, but I guess putting a bit more effort into cooking wouldn't hurt anyone. I guess sometimes I just feel at a loss about how and what to cook because I obviously don't cook as much as the other guys. Maybe asking for a bit more help would be a good start. But I'm figuring, with the exams coming up soon and so little time left that'd we're staying together, there may not be much of a chance. See how lah. Anyway, just liked to point out that irregardless of how cheesed I might have sounded in that blog, I'm really quite alright with everyone and their expectations. Like I mentioned, everyone here is reasonable. I've not came across a really unreasonable request yet.   Sunday, April 06, 2003 [ Try  urlLink link 1 , or  urlLink link 2  ]  About meeting this new 'someone'. I can't say for sure it's not a crush, neither can I say that it is. I can only say that I really like what I've seen and know so far. From my previous relationship, I've basically came to realise a lot of things I really 'do not want' in a partner. With this new girl, there are none of these bad qualities and tons of good ones. Naturally I'm greatly disappointed she's not the least bit interested. Neither can I say for sure that things will definitely work out between us in a positive way, but if she was willing, God knows, but I'll give it my utmost and best shot at the chance.  These days, I'm constantly blowing hot and cold around her. Want to be a good friend but when I feel that I'm getting too close I really need to cast myself a bit further just to keep my emotions in check. I'm still really happy she's not been mean or unkind to me so far. In fact, sometimes I don't feel any of the awkwardness of the situation all thanks to her. It's hard to control these things I suppose but I thoroughly respect her for her decision. I know she has her own problems and as much as I'd like to share her burden, I know that it's not my place to decide if she has to share things with me. In my poly days, I learnt a particular lesson with another classmate of mine in an almost similar situation: - If I can't be a help to her current situation, the very least I should / could do is not  BE  one of her current problems.  I still stand by this belif even after so long. I'm no saint or angel that I'd try to be so wonderful or 'wei da' in Mandarin. But I just think it's really worth it sometimes to make some people happy at my own expense. I may be criticised for being a fool or a love-sick idiot but there's no changing the fact that given another 100 times, I'd still choose to do the same in a similar situation. There are just some people that I know who are truly worth making an emotional sacrifice. I basically do not want to jeopardise the friendship that's available now by even attempting to bring things up to another level (not that there's even a hint of hope). I'm happy with the way things are now.  A summary of things now, I love all my housemates. Nice wonderful people and I've learnt so much from each of them. They're all so unique and special in their own way. I love Aikido, and looking at the way things are, it's the only thing which never gives me any pressure in my everyday life (well, that is, if you overlook the occasional physical bumps and bruises one may get during training).

      The eve of my birthday today. Got a few well wishes here and there. Got a call from Gary from US as well. It was nice to hear a familar voice again.  Just 2 days back, I played some basketball and got a knock on my glasses. Now it feels a bit dodgy. Sigh, no choice lah, people will probably see me in contacts a lot more often these days.  Today was relatively quiet. Was considering going swimming at night coz 2 of my housemates were playing soccer in school at the same time. But in the end, I just decided against it. Got a bit of a throbbing headache now. Guess, it's better this way. 1 more hour to Friends. A bit sad lah the life here but I think it's coz exams are coming lah. So things just seem a bit more boring. Of course, there's a lot of studying to do. Sianz.  Just thought I'd best update some details on what's been going on before my papers start.  Oh yea, 1 fantastic piece of news. Aikido is still on this term in Uni and at the dojo. Problem is I can't go too often because of the exams. Argh! Looks like I can only go for the coming week and the 1st week of Jun. Depending on where I'll be going after all my exams, I may / may not be able to attend the last session before term closes.

      OK, have to make a note that I had apologised to Juliana yesterday 1st thing in the morning. She seemed fine lah. Looks like I was just caught between the 2 lovebirds. OK not so guilty liao. Basically worked on my report on and off the whole day until about 4pm. Went running with Justin, David, Juliana. Coz of the crying thingy the night before, I owe Juliana 15 rounds but only managed either 8-10 (coz I miscounted) rounds. Nmind, try again until I get there.  After that we had a fantastic game of frisbee. Woohoo!!! Played 4 on 4. I wasn't particularly good and I got tired really fast. Towards the end I got a cramp in my left calve/calf (watever lah) muscle. Basically that kinda meant the end of the game for me. Went back for dinner and pia my report again. Finished and went to bed before 2am.  This morning, I got up early and touched up some stuff. After that took a cab to Uni (wet weather and my left leg still quite tight from the cramp mah). Time now is 9am exactly. Library should have just opened. I'm gonna go submit my report and get it over with. Damn! It feels good now that it's over. Going for a quick swim at 12pm. Hope my leg holds up today. Going home after that and I plan to watch the Steven Seagal aikido documentary - Path Beyond Thought. Caught snips of it. It was daaaaaamn good.   urlLink Eileen , I've already transferred the clip to Gary. Thought you might be interested too. It's awe-inspiring.

      Goodness, I directly / indirectly made Juliana cried this evening during dinner.  I was washing the dishes when I heard some topic the others were talking about, one of the comment was funny (to me lah) so I laughed out like really really hard, long and loud. And she just left the table, supposedly all teary-eyed. Sheesh, no doubt lah I didn't like make the comment lah, but I think it felt like I was laughing at her directly in her face or something. Sure, some of them said I wasn't the one to make the comment so I wasn't like really responsible. Still, I think to say that I had nothing to do with it is absolutely irresponsible. Sighz, ... guess I'll have to apologise to her tomorrow. Will try to finish my report by tomorrow morning so I can stay awake overnight to apologise 1st thing when I see her.  Goodness, feeling a little bad.

      I just recalled some clips of Steven Seagal's Aikido. And all of a sudden I just wondered about the best form would be having no form at all. I look at my stance in Aikido, I feel like I'm preparing myself for an attack either this way or that. For instance, when I'm in right posture, I'm basically expecting an attack to come at me a certain way. And when it doesn't, I get all mixed up and everything just goes out the window. I suppose the form probably refers to something more metaphysical and mental.  I noticed Steven Seagal has a stance in which he stoops down a bit and relaxes both his hands. In some scenes, he has his hands fluttering all over the place so quickly I can't even catch what he was doing. I guess, that would include a distracting element to someone who's attacking you.  I for one would love to learnt how to achieve his style of iriminage. Bam bam ... and nage would be on the ground already.

      Have to make a note that my ex came over for dinner few days (Wed I think). She brought her junior along as well. Think that's a good thing, coz it could mean that she's not unhappy about the last incident anymore. That's good. And I do have a slight ease of mind now. But like Eileen mentioned, I don't dwell on it too much. Afterall I've already gotten over the occasion by opening my house's door to her anytime she may want to makan here. We (I was with Justin and Daniel) were doing our warmup jog up a slope from our place to the park nearby when we met the both of them coming down to our place. Couldn't chat much then. But everything seemed ok. Even after dinner things seemed pretty alright. Just that they left kinda early after dinner instead of hanging around.  Went running today again. It's turning out to be a guys thing in my house. All 4 of us went for a run at the park. David, being his 1st run, had a bit of a hard time. But I can tell that he has quite a bit of power still in his legs. I think if he ran a few more times, I'll easily be the slowest runner in the house. I guess that's the difference between Officers in the SAF and normal foot soldiers like me. OCS training is something to be reckon with. Which kind of makes me wonder. At 25 years old when I graduate, will I be able to take the training in the Police Force. Hmmm ... well, guess there's no point pondering over it too much. Just keep training and bring my fitness level up first.  After the run, I was feeling fine but Justin and Daniel had a slight headache. After dinner, I feel a slight groggy feeling. Could be a fever or something going around the house now. Think I'll pop either 2 panadol or 2 raw eggs in again. Need to keep my health up the next few days. I need the extra energy to complete my final report before Mon.  Now that David's decided to join us for a bit of running. I think after Annie (housemate) gets back from Spain with Juliana (housemate), and we're back into playing frisbee again, I'll see if David wants to do a few forward rolls while we're at the park. I can do it in my backyard lah of course, but I think the daily bokken exercises I've been doing has worn away the ground quite a fair bit and it looks a bit too dirty now. Whereas at the park, all we need to do is pick a small corner and we can roll around on the grass. Err ... only thing I think we need to look out for will be dog shit. It's a park afterall :P I'm kinda keen on training my forward rolls with some obstacle in front. Might need the other guys' help to curl up in front and let me jump over. And I'd love to try jumping over the 2 taller guys and train my rolls into getting some distance and height in as well. Well, the girls are due back tommorrow anyway so I guess I can look forward to my rolling exercises soon.  O yea, talking about this, just few days ago Justin and I were running and we saw this guy standing in the park practicing some kind of self defence moves or something. Err ... OK lah, not trying to like put down the guy's efforts or anything but to do some things too openly in public is kind of weird. And I think he does look like those half half pattern who hasn't exactly been learning much for a long time. I mean, whether I'm in Singapore or UK, I only practice my Aikido in a private compound. Sure lah, the neighbours may see me, but I usually pick the weirdest hours so as to minimise the no. of people who might see me. I mean, I'm not that good anyway so I would really hate to expose myself more than I really needed to. Only my housemates and family are like the only ones who see me practice regularly, but they know me enought to be able to tell that I'm being serious and just wanted to be alone when I'm concentrating during those times.

      Just went for a run. I think it's either the ice cream Venetta I've been eating these past few days taking effect on my fitness, or the weather is just getting cold, because I seriously had a slight problem running these past 2 sessions. After the run, I even felt a bit of cough coming up. Just took my grandma's remedy, 2 raw eggs. Justin and David were disgusted by it. Haha. Must admit lah, the initial taste is kinda hard to take down, but it gets better after that. Anyway, so long as it's effective, I don't mind the awful taste for a few seconds. Let's hope my stomache can take it tonight because I haven't taken this remedy for some years and I'm not sure of my stomache is used to it now. Well, maybe some water to help it go down later.  I emailed a complaint to the bus service and I'm hoping to get some kinda reply soon. But even so, I think I've cooled down enough to be able to forget it lah. Afterall, the thing is over already. Sigh ...  OK I gotta go work on my report liao. Final year project write up, ARGH!

      Damn the bus service over here!!! ARGH!!!! R$&^$#())(*&(^&%$#  I'm suppose to have be in Aikido right now but because of the stupid bus service everything went haywire.  Left my house at 7:15pm to wait for the bus to take me to the dojo. Waited over an hour for it but it never turned up. Mind you, because it's daylight saving now, it was still mighty bright when I started waiting. After 1 hour however, it was difficult to keep my spirits up as the temperature got colder and the sky got darker. Class was supposed to start at 8pm. I thought I'd just have to make do with being a little bit late for class. However, at 8:15pm I decided I can't wait any longer. I dialed for a cab which arrived 5 mins later and I reached the dojo under 10 mins. Unfortunately, Sensei had just locked the door to the building thinking I wasn't gonna come.  The situation at the dojo was this, it's basically something of a community centre. But the instructors there do not have the keys to the place. Instead, the place is open at a certain timing and classes are scheduled 1 after another. Which means there's always someone there to open the door for you. As my Sensei does not have the key to the place, she can't reopen the door again. And she had only closed it 2 mins prior to my arrival.  ARGHH!!!!! ... I don't blame my Sensei for this. Anyway, she was so nice about it, she reimbursed me my cab fare back, even though I said she really didn't need to do so. She said I'm just a student, so money and all that was kinda important for me coz I'm not earning anything yet. (Sigh, nice hor.) I really blame the bus service because I suspect the people at the bus depot were probably just slacking around. I know for a fact there's a big match between Madrid and Manchester United. That probably account for the absence of the bus during this hour. I'm gonna find a number and make a really formal complain 1st thing tommorrow morning.  There's a lot of reasons why I'm pissed. 1. Sensei Pauline had shifted about a month ago and she basically needs to take an hr's drive just to come down to teach us and another hr's drive just to get back. (By the way, that's also the reason why she's looking for another dojo location to change to. Meaning she's probably not goin to be teaching University's class in the near future. So even if I do decide to return here for my Masters, I won't be able to train under her anymore. ARGH!!!) Basically she wasted her trip down (much like the rest of us) today. Because of the distance, with due consideration to her, we, the regular students, always try our best to inform her of our attendence in advance to prevent her from making such wasted trips down to the dojo. 2. Sensei paid for my cab fare though it's not her fault. 3. Today was the LAST class for the Easter holidays. Sure there's a class once term reopens. But besides turning up for the 1st week of May, I probably will be absent for about 1 whole mth due to my exams and all that. After which, if I'm lucky enough, I'll be able to attend 1 more of her class before she goes to the US (either on holiday or for some Aikido camp thing there I suppose). 4. I also caused Angelo to make a wasted trip down to the dojo. Sure he stays nearer compared to Sensei but he still made a wasted trip down and he had to gimme a lift part of the way back to my place, something which he does every week. (Sigh, another nice person.)  All because the STUPID BUS NEVER CAME!!!!! ARGHHHHHHHH!!!!  After getting off Angelo's car, I was still feeling kinda frustrated. While walking the rest of the way back home, I kept looking around, probably hoping some fools would try to jump me and try to rob me or something. Just so I can use some Aikido on the fella. Luckily, nothing happened. Must admit the walk did me some good to cool my head down a little. I entered my house and saw Justin and David watching soccer (damn Madrid vs Manchester United). They were surprised that I got home so quick. Explained what happened and went on to make myself a cup of tea as well as attacked a piece of chocolate flavoured Venetta ice cream cake or watever you'd call it. (Mmmmmm ...) Really wanted to practice my 8 directional exercise (happo-giri) but our backyard had no yard light and I thought it'd be too dark and cold to do it at night anyway. Brought all my stuff to my room and passed Lynette. Explained the whole deal to her again and came back online. Met Gary on ICQ and made noise about the whole thing again before I decided to blog things down. After I post this blog, I'm gonna surf for the Midlands bus service website to get a number where I can make an official complaint. I'm definitely not in an Aiki mood tonight. Hopefully when I wake up 2moro, my mood will change for the better.  Can't wait for morning so I can do my happo-giri exercise and go running in the evening. To end this post .... well, ... ARGHHGHGHGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Eileen's blog kinda made me notice I'm always talking about Aikido in my blog. So I thought I'd say something a bit different for awhile.  Taking a breather today from running. Been really making good progress the past 3 weeks. Started off with about 4 rounds initially, each round is estimated to be about 500m maybe. At that time I weighed about 68kg. At the end of last week I weighed about 66kg or so and I managed to be clocking about 6-8 rounds per run. Did 10 rounds once but at a really slow pace then. It was kinda fun. Like I said, the run yesterday was quite crappy. I miscounted and had actually wanted to stop at the end of my 6th round. But when my housemate (Justin, aka personal runnung trainer haha) stopped running, I realised I had already done 7 rounds already (coz he managed to lap me by 1 more round). Had to suck it in and just finish the final lap. Was really on the verged of giving up mentally. Wah liews. But at the end of it, felt good that I still managed to complete 8 rounds instead of giving it up at 6. By the way, I've been maintaining a constant 65kg so far. Doubt I'll get any lighter than this.  OK can't leave out Aikido stuff completely I realised. Coz I need to make a point with relevance to my legs. The exercise I've been doing has a bit of impact on my legs. They feel stronger but as they are still aching from my (almost) daily reps, they do feel kinda sore right now. I'm targetting to increase some kinda endurance training to my legs by increasing the hiji/higi tai practice I mentioned a few posts earlier. And if I can help it in terms of schedule and studies, I may swim once/twice a week as well. Legs legs legs ... very important. Keep overlooking them. No choice lah, my legs are generally the weakest area coz of my lack of emphasis in every exercise I do.  Which reminds me, really funny, when we left for our run 2 sessions ago, 3 angmoh girls were in front of us. While we overtook them, 1 of them called out "Woooo!! ... Sexy legs!!!" Hahaha, I felt like laughing out there and then. I immediately called out to my friend in front of me, "Eh Justin, calling you leh." His only reply was "Siao." Hahaha ... We sure have some funny moments over here.

      Went for a run today and I felt like crap right after, though my appetite was good. After the run had a slight stomache ache and had to really visit the toilet. Well, sorry I had to share this piece of news online but I just couldn't understand it. My fitness was definitely improving and I was surprised the way my body reacted to the run. Anyway, I took lotsa water and that kinda helped. Did a few more reps of 8 directional exercise just to take my mind off the discomfort. Also watched Steven Seagal's Above the Law just now. There were some cool moves but being a movie, I really dun think he was being very Aiki on tele. Well, that's Hollywood for you lah. If I'm not wrong, there's a stream of Seagal's movies for this month. Woohoo can take note of his techniques and scutinize them. Ikkyo!!! ..... Nikkyo!!!! .... Sankyo!!! ... Rokkyo!!!! ... Kotegaeshi!! ... Iriminage ... and a whole lot of other moves that I really have no idea about. Could be a combination of some other variety.

      It's only been about a month and I thought I'd met someone who is really nice to me. I've always thought that I would take a bit of time before I even get any ideas about another relationship. Well I made a mistake about the girl's intent and the we had a good talk about stuff. It seems that all the girl did was just being really really friendly and sociable and that kinda gave me the wrong idea. Sure it was embarassing but what struck me the most was the amount of courage she must've mustered to come tell me nicely. Take note, I know a lot of girls who just have a problem telling people they're simply not interested in the guy. They tend to be really really nasty about stuff. But with her, she was really nice about it and that helped things along a whole lot. The way things turned out was so great (honest!), we could talk again right after the conversation we had. It's really kinda embarassing talking about all this stuff online here and now. But when you think about, I think I managed to face the truth of the situation. It's a growing process and I'm not ashamed of sharing it with anyone else. In fact, it feels kinda good. :)  Girls out there take note on one area you may want to work on. Guys out there take note about another area you want to be careful with. Heh ... today has been a good day, let's hope 2moro will be too, especially being my last Aikido practice for this month. Gonna video it down again. Erm, talking about Aikido, the daily practice I put into my 8 diretional exercise is definitely helping. I dunno any meditation stuff that I can use to usually calm myself but doing repetitions of bokken work for about 30-60 mins is definitely a way to reduce any tension you have and clear most thoughts from your mind.

      Yesterday's Aikido was really interesting. We did a full session of weapons work.  We did a quick warmup / revision of the 2 8 directional cuts, followed by a new pattern she called hiji/higi-tai. Till now I still can't find anything on hiji/higi yet. Think I'll check with her again by email.  Anyway for starters, we're required to 'Zha Ma Bu' and start making shomen cuts. After that, we needed to shift our center / lean left and right while swinging the bokken to our side to deflect invisible blows coming down on us, immediately we had to shoft ourselves back to the middle and do a shomen cut again. With paired work, it actually became really nice and it was something like a I-cut-you-while-you-deflect and immediately followed by a You-cut-me-while-I-deflect motion. When you do it continously the exercise seems really really nice. Next stance had 1 guy in hiji-tai and another in our normal sword stance (right stance). Uke does a shomen cut with a step forward, and nage blocks (not parry/deflect). The block is just the shifting of hands to the side and up while raising your hands above your head, ultimately the tip of the sword faces your opponent and the edge is facing skywards. Anyway once you're in this position, the tip of uke's sword is kinda resting just before the tsuba. What we need to do now is bring our handle to our center. It gives a parrying motion which throws uke's sword off to the side. Again, doing this continuously make things look really cool. But please note that nage (whose sword gets parried aside), should remember to follow the parried movment other wise the sword may hit your knuckles, as I managed to find out the hard way. I'm just glad my fingers till work. 1 final exercise was a parry. Nage attacks with a shomen, uke in higi-tai shifts 1 side and glances the blow away before returning with his own shomen cut. At this point I can't remember clearly but I think nage basically twists the arm/wrist or something along that line and deflects the blow in a direction, uke having had a blow deflected follows his deflected sword and swings behind/above the head to return with another shomen cut. Repeat process and you got a slightly complicated exrecise.

      Today was the 1st day since the end of term that I came to Uni. Had to loan some books and do some photocopying. My eyes feel sore and tired from sleeping late lastnight.  It's been about a month since my breakup with my ex and I was doing some thinking and reflecting about my last relationship. I dunno why this occurred but I think it's because of what my ex said a few days ago. Can't rem which day she called last week, but she was asking me something about how to run scandisk on WinXP. Gave her instructions and she thanked me and we hung up. After that I went to watch TV and was downstairs the whole evening. Suddenly, Lynette (housemate and course mate) got a call from my ex, who was looking for me. (Apparently, she called my mobile 3x and because I was downstairs I didn't hear my mobile. Mind u, my room is on the 3rd level.) My ex was pretty pissed, she started telling me things like, what on earth did I install in her laptop without her permission and why did I put XP in her laptop in the 2st place when I last helped her to reformat her harddisk. Then she said everytime she tried to run NJWin (think is a chinese recognition program), NJWin would crash. She started blaming me for not asking her before installing XP instead of win98 etc. She said she tried running scandisk and it won't even carry that out properly. I was a bit pissed but I really controlled my temper. I told her I didn't know what the problem was and that I dunno how to rectify it. I said I could put in win98 for her again if she wanted me to (considering that it was the start of my holidays and I can make time to settle it). All she commented was she didn't want me to do anything to her laptop and since I couldn't solve the software problem she kinda hung up abruptly.  I was really annoyed with her tone. But I can understand it a little better when I found 3 missed calls on my phone and found out my house phone was in use by my housemates that evening as well. She might have tried calling me and the house so often that she just blew it. Plus she probably encountered the problem more than once each time she used it. But understanding her reasons for blowing her top don't mean that I'm excusing her for it. We are after all no longer a couple and I would really appreciate it if she stopped speaking to me like I bloody owed her something in my last life. To me, it only sounded like she called me up just to tell me off about me having installed XP on her laptop instead of Win98. To a certain extent I do admit that I don't remember consulting her before doing that. But another point I'd like to note is that I distinctly mentioned to her before that XP doesn't need NJWin anymore because of it's capability to recognise other languages (I installed that component for her as well). The only reason she might have for installing NJWin would be to play Chinese games. If she wanted to type or surf chinese sites, XP could've handled that.  I do not excuse my self from any part of my involvement in her frustration (no matter how small). But I really don't think she should overlook the big picturet that I wasn't intentionally evading any of her calls and the vents that were out of my hands (house phone in use). Also to note is that I had volunteered helping her reinstall back Win98 if she wanted me to. Because of all these, I really cannot excuse her for her behaviour. I'm sorry things turned out this way but I've made a resolve to not hold back these kinda emotions with respect to anymore outbursts by her directed at me. Naturally, her close friends will get the picture that I'm some kind of monster as they never heard about my side of story. I dun think I give a damn anymore. Just so long as I know that I really didn't do anything wrong (or intentionally did it). If she just want to call me up to give me a piece of her mind on the phone instead of solving her problem, I dun see the point. I absolutely refuse to entertain anymore such outbursts like that as though I was still her bf or something. Since I'm only a normal friend to her now, I do seriously expect to be respected as 1. Afterall I really don't blow my top at anything like that to my friend. I really have this feeling that all because of the way she responded, she isn't treating me as a friend anymore. Who on earth flares up so easily with a friend.  I don't want others to be too judgemental about her in anyway. Afterall, you never heard her side of her story and everything I've said is 1 sided. I think my ex is still basically an OK person just that we have a great deal of extreme differences that makes us clash around a bit too much.  Goodness gracious. I'm glad I'm documenting this part of my life and that someday I can look back and laugh at myself or something. I hope that I will learn something from all my earlier posts, no matter how insignificant they may seem.

      I'm in a pretty shitty mood today. Feeling the preassure of tommorow's paper. I think also partly because of yesterday's paper being quite bad. Very very sian. 1st paper on Wed was good. Really good. Half the paper was exactly the stuff I revised that morning. I should quite easily secure a pass. How good I do depends on how much sense the lecturer makes out of the crap I wrote in extra. The 2nd paper (yesterday's) was terrible. I'm afraid of failing this module now. Seems like the opposite. It's such a broad area that things I wrote in might not be complete or they are wrong. To make things worse, I might not have remembered to write all the points I studies before. Argh!!.  What makes today top the icing on the cake is that I have a 5 min demo for my VR project at 5:30pm. Even Annie who took her exam from 2-4 came home before me. And I haven't even left the house at that time. It takes me 1hr to walk to and back to the house for a measly 5 min demo! BASKET!  Decided not to take my dinner at home. Probably grab some unhealthy fish and chips later on the way back. Might take some time to practice my bokken and handstand to ease the mood before I start my revisions again. Damn the day. Even the weather is all wet and windy. ARGH!!!

      OK I managed to find out what the stance I always seem to be using during bokken practice is really called. It's Jigo-tai, meaning defensive posture. Term is broadly used in Japanese martial arts besides Aikido, eg. Karate.  Another term is 'Masakatsu agatsu', True victory is Self-victory. In Chinese / Kanji = Zheng4 Sheng4 Wu4 Sheng4. Meaningful, yet so hard to accomplish for so many of us.

      Haven't blogged for over a week now.  Let me just describe my last Aikido lesson last week. We did weapons work and I managed to video the whole thing down as well. Managed to get some pretty nifty footages too. There's only about 15 mins worth because we basically did tons of repetitions. I must admit that my bokken work has been improving a little. The daily exercises do help me really well. Even just this morning, I'm not sure how but I managed to get the feel of what Pauline Sensei mentioned before in the cutting motion. That it was pretty similar to fly fishing where the wrists will twist first. Don't know why it happened either but I got a sudden smooth feel to things and I do notice that the sword tip does fly a bit faster. Only thing I still noticed was that my shoulders seem to be locking up easily sometimes as I progress on in my cuts.  Anyway school revision has been quite tensed. What some of us are doing is that we do stupid stuff to ease the stress. Begh was on the Singapore's gymnastics team for the SEA Games a few years back. So we suddenly asked her how to do handstands. We've been trying like crazy daily. Haha... really interesting. A few knocks and falls here and there but Daniel, Justin and I do seem to be progressing. Justin seem to be able to get the most balance because he's not afraid of falling. I'm slow because I am afraid of falling too hard. Daniel seems stiff in the beginning, but at least now he seems to be able to do a cartwheel while practising the handstand. Now handstands are like a daily regime for us. We'd just do it against the wall for awhile before trying freefall. If I'm lucky I can let you guys see a 4 min footage I recorded. Annie did manage to snap some photos of us but I probably won't get to see those until after the exams.

      OK lastnight I had to camp over in school to finish my VR project. The virtual dojo looks like crap. But I really have no time to make it too complex, what with exams and ll just less than 2 wks away. Quite disappointing.  Typed up a crap report (no point wasting too much effort for 10%, plus the lecturer really isn't too interested in a lengthy one anyway. He stated the requirement as anything below 2000 words.) Submitted my project half a day earlier and I went back home. On the way, bought fish and chips at a takeaway for lunch. Finished and took a bit of a nap. Woke up and basically replied some emails.  Seems like most everyone I know is either going to be busy or unavailable the next 2 wks. Unless I've got something interesting to post, I'm probably taking a blog break as well. Might throw in some occasional stuff on Aikido.  Almost forgot, I went for Aikido on Wed night. Only 3 students. Me and 2 new beginners. Well, one of them actually did a beginners course at a friend of Pauline Sensei's about a year ago. He was a really polite chap. Well mannered and cordial. I noticed that hee understands the formality aspect of the art and our normal practice as well because of the way he behaves in a dojo. The other guy had no experience but we did some ikkyo waza throughout the session.  I think I made the right decision to go down because it would have been weird if there was only Pauline Sensei and the 2 of them. I'm sure she can still teach as effectively but it would be nice to take some ukemi from her. Hope I wasn't being too stiff that night. The first thing she did when I arrived was ask if the families of my housemates and I were alright. Told her noone had any bad news from home so far and things seemed pretty much well under control in Singapore. Last I heard 2 days ago was that there have been no new cases in Singapore.  I almost forgot to mention the short conversation we had after class. I remembered she mention that Chiba Sensei was visiting her the last 2 weeks so I asked if she had enjoyed his company. Turns out Chiba Sensei didn't come to UK. It seemed that he injured his foot/leg before he went to France for a seminar. He was in so much pain that they had to send him back halfway through the seminar. She said it must've been really bad as she has never known him to have to cancel a trip or seminar before. On the scheduled trip to UK, the teachers in UK were suppose to attend a seminar organised specially for them.  Apparently Chiba Sensei is a Buddhist monk as well. His study of Aikido is not just about taijutsu but weapons work (Batto-ho), ZaZen and Buddhism. Pauline Sensei says he encourages these 4 disciplines for anyone who is serious about doing Aikido in the long run. I put forward a question to her about Buddhism as a religion and having the need to take up this religion even though I don't really want to or believe in it. She says, Chiba Sensei doesn't really expect you to be a convert from your religion but instead to accept the discipline invloved in all 4 elements. She quoted an example saying that when you sit in the lotus position (I think adopted by buddhist and yoga in which you sit cross legged but with your foot lifted up on top instead of under your knees) for 45 mins, you are in such pain or discomfort and that you are so alone that there really isn't anyone else but yourself to tide you through this. The idea is that you have no choice but to look within yourself for strength. Strangely this idea comes to mind when I'm doing my running and swimming. In swimming, I can tide through the feeling of being tired and just keep going for ages and long distances. But when it comes to running, I have a problem staying focused and pulling together to push myself past the no. of rounds or distance that I had decided to run. Sensei says no one would really just sit there and do this for no particular reason. I also never thought of stopping in the middle of what I'm doing to just hold still and look or listen at the world around me. I guess if I look at 2 of my Christian housemates, they always have a daily quiet time of prayer with God. I'm not sure what is the point I'm driving at, but I just see a lot of co-relating situations and similarities in a positive and negative sense in my self and people around me. Sensei made 2 points to me, as an Aikido-ka under Chiba Sensei, she encourages anyone to take up the studies that Chiba Sensei encourages. But on the other hand, at a more personal level, she admits that despite being pretty competent in taijutsu and weapons work, she doesn't go into ZaZen or Buddhism. But that's because she has looked at herself and feels very much comfortable with what she sees in herself currently.  It was an interesting chat lastnight. Food for thought.

      I'm working on including my journal of the trip to Scandinavia and another of my trek of the Cumbria Way in UK.  Previously placed them in the blog here but I found them way too long to be included in just one blog. Photos have been developed but will be scanned in when I can.  The journals are both pretty long. Cheers.

      I've just returned from my 1st trek.  Decided to cut my trek short. Instead of going for both treks, I decided to stop. I've finished Cumbria Way (whew). It was quite an experience because I've never gone for such a distance for 5 days. For guys who've done the route marches in BMT, it's not particularly difficult. It was a matter of getting used to doing the same thing for the next few days.  Anyway, a lot of reasons why I decided to cut my trip short. I've had to because I realised that my trip to Scandinavia actuallt burnt my finances by quite a lot. A lot of complications involved. Also, I managed to contact a property owner about renting a space for my parents during convo, I'd thought I best settle this fast and there's no better way than to come back early to do so. Next, on the last day of the trek, I got caught in a drizzle/rain. Basically I've been sick for the past 2 days. Last, I'm not sure I want to do 2 treks 1 after another (though I do have a 2 day rest inb between them). I do really want to go back to Scotland but I think I'm not physically and mentally prepared right now to do both. There's just too many thing hanging on my mind. I'm not one to be able to multi-task so I think I'll just tackle one issue at a time.  I'll be posting my journal of this trek online soon as well. Photos will take sometime though.

      I just read thru all the blog I've missed so far. Been quite fulfilling, I see. (Aikido training, work, school, etc activities.)  OK lah time to update people about my existence.  I just got back on the 18th morning about 4am. Immediately, I asked the cab driver to wait while I grab some stuff and went down to the Uni straightaway to check my Provisional results (may be subject to changes). I know it's a bit early but I was really nervous lah ok. My dept is accessed using ID cards so it's open to us 24 hrs anyway. When I checked my results online, I went to double check on the notice board. I got a 3rd class Honours. OK lah, to some people it's not fantastic. But to me, considering the fact I was expacting that I didn't manage to achieve my honours successfully, it was a tremendous relief. I'm seriously damn happy about it. Was really worried that the money and time spent in UK would be wasted if I didn't at least get home with a honours. granted lah, back in Singapore most people treat 3rd class the same as a normal degree but that's besides my point.  Just today, I managed to get my official results already. No different from my provisional. Still damn happy about it.  Well I did enjoy my trip to Scandinavia but it was a real experience with multiple hiccups along the way. I've managed to maintain a written journal in my notepad during my travels and I'll type it in asap. Meanwhile I only have a few days to settle some admin stuff and get my final results. I basically need to settle convocation details, accomodation for my parents, bills, handing over of the house back to the property management, packing my stuff for shipping back to S'pore, shop for some emergency items for my trek starting this Sun, air ticket, etc. Really 1 big pile of shit to do in 3 days.  By the way, I need to state for the record that the phone line in my house together with the Broadband internet will be cancelled this coming Sat on the 21st of June. So I probably won't be able to come online anytime soon. The best I can do is check my emails occasionally in Uni but that's not confirmed yet because I may be travelling around with my parents. A brief summary is found below:  Current - 21st Jun : Busy settling packing and admin. Won't be sleeping too well next 3 days.   HOUSE PHONE AND INTERNET CANCELLED.  Only contactable by mobile phone +44-77-1717-4992. Not sure of the temporary address at this point in time.  21st Jun - 8th Jul : Trekking in Lake District area all the way up to Scotland. Landscapes aren't suppose to be too difficult but the distance is going to be quite an experience for me. 8th - 14th Jul : Bumming and settling admin for parents visit to UK. 15th Jul : Parents arrive in UK. 15th - 25th Jul : With my parents. Note my convocation date is 17th Aug. So I'm probably busiest around this time. But I'm probably not contactable at all then either. 26th Jul - 2nd Aug : Visiting Stradford upon Avon (again. Sianz ...) with my folks, dunno wat on earth my parents wanna do there a 2nd time. 2nd Aug : Parents depart for Singapore. I'm on waiting list currently, so not confirmed if I can go back on this date. 2nd - 3rd Aug : If I dun fly back on the 2nd, I'll juz be buming around. 4th Aug : I've got a confirmed flight back on this date. Will depart UK latest on this date. 5th Aug : Should arrive in Singapore.

      My exams are finally OVER!!! Woohoo!!!  The studying is over. Now is the worst part. Waiting for my results. I definitely know that I didn't do as well as I'd liked. Dammit. There's a good chance I won't be able to get my honours even. I really have to acknowledge that fact after my 2nd last paper. I dunno how but I guess a degree is what I'm hoping to look for at this point. I'm still trying hard to accept this fact. No choice. Can't do anything now but pray.  Went back and slept and slept. But I dunno why I think the adrenaline is still rushing and I didn't quite sleep for as long as I intended. I definitely need to force myself to bed and catch up on some rest which lost. Especially so during the last 72 hrs.  Tonight the house is really empty. But it's good lah, coz I got Aikido anyway. Going for practice in a few minutes.  Tomorrow night I'll be heading off to Oslo, Norway for a trek with Justin and Daniel. Cool man. Can't wait for it. Will probably be trekking for about 5 days or so. But don't think it's out in the wild lah. There are towns and cities and hostels along the way for the trek. Civilisation really isn't far away from our route. It's suppose to be a simple and comfortable route in Oslo. After that, we'll hit Copnhagen and take an overnight ferry to Stockholm. Will buy a train ticket to go down to Karlskrona, Sweden to visit my naval friend, attached there for submarine training. Oops, reminded myself that I need to call them up once I get my hands on the ticket. Finally I'll meet up with my housemates in Stockholm and fly back to UK to get my results (which won't be good).  After a few days of rest, I'm heading off to Scotland for trekking again. Lake Coniston all the way up to Edinburgh. Will be back just before my parents arrive and hope to prepare for the convocation.  All in all, I think I'll be back in Singapore on the 2nd / 4th Aug. Hope to resume my NS around the 18th Aug.

      OK I'm back in Birmingham now. Got here lastnight amd will hang around till Sat morning before I head of to Stradford.  For today, will be settling stuff in Uni and taking a day trip out to Chester (where's dat? no idea).  Past week of tour was quite crappy.  Went Leeds coz my dad had to meet a business associate. It was damn paiseh when my dad actually asked them if they may have a job for me. Wah lao ... seriously leh, dun wann do IT job liao and they're like forcing me towards that direction. But heng lah, they dun sound too negative at all towards a career with the Police Force. Think when I get back I can apply immediately for real by going down to the recruitment office personally.  I hr drive away is York. Quite nice. We stayed there overnight. My dad was quite pissed with the Hostel. Actually went into a bit of tantrum for a bit. Can't stand it. Argh!!  Next day went down to Edinburgh. Wasn't bad. Went Glasgow as well. Spent 3 days in Scotland. Quite nice. they got a lot of nice museums which were free and they were actually really interesting.  Went down south to the Lake district. The worst day here! Mom insisted on diverting here and there to see this and that and we had to drive in the country roads when it got quite dark. Considering there's more daytime in summer, you can tell it was already about 10+ when we lost daylight. Kept telling her we won't be able to get to the accoms with enough light to spare but she wouldn't listen. She seems to be on this marathon where she juz want to hit the entrance of this or that spot, take fotos of the entrance (coz she dun wanna pay entry fee and go in) and ciao off to th next place. Wah lao!!! Dad didn't help either. He's basically the type who expects standards in things but coz of the cheap and budget rate my mom is able/willing to fork out, we dun see or do much. So he's always complaining about things like staying in Hostel lah, no privacy lah, low class lah ete etc. I mean c'mon man, we're in a hostel dorm, if u wan that kind of standard, jolly well check into a hotel if you can afford it lor. ARGH!!!  There's actually a lot of things to do and see in Lake District area. It's a national park but they dun suit the older folks like them. And they refuse to go for walks and treks coz they feel they 'can't take it even thought those are simple ones. Argh!!! I can't go do any water sports coz of bad weather and budget. Argh!!!  Damn weather was poor since Tues too! Argh!!  Yesterday must be the best day. We were leaving Lake District area and we stopped at this cheap factory outlet spot. The moment my mom stepped out her shoes broke. Heng heng we found a Clarks factory outlet. Went in and bought 6 pairs for 89 (think is about S$200+). Was damn worth for 6 pairs. There was Buy 1 get 1 free, buy 1 get 2nd for 12, buy 1 get 2nd for 5, and some other shoes which were going cheap. Plus, the range was a lot more than I expected. I got myself 2 pair, my dad got 1 pair, my mom/sis got 2-3 pairs since they sometimes shared shoes. I suspect this may be the highest point of my trip liao. Well, unless my housemate Annie is able to pop by next week for a visit, then that'd probably be the highest point of my trips. But then again, with my folks around ... I think I'll still be in a sian mood. Siaaaanz ... argh!!

      Graduation day today.  Off to a 'great' start, couldn't find my wallet. Woke around 6am and took me 1 hour to find it. Realised David had taken it by mistake the night before. All the while my parents were nagging in the backgorund .... buuuuuzzzzzzz. Didn't get any peace until after it was found. Sheeez... Left the house with Lynette and both our parents for Uni. Drove down, despite my recommendations to walk down. Weather was really dark and gloomy. No sun today. Duh...  Went to collect our convo tickets and the gown in the Avon Room, University Ctr. It was quite easy to put everything on. Was really chop chop. I must admit, despite having only achieved 3rd class, I still feel rather proud to be wearing it. Dunnoz, maybe it's normal for under-achievers like mua. Hyuk hyuk hyuk. We went around the Uni to snap some shots before the doors to the Great Hall opened. That would be where the ceremony is gonna be held.  Our parents went in to grab good seats in the front row as soon as the doors opened at 930am. Lynette and I met some people here and there and decided to take some photos with them before we had to be seated in the Great Hall. Took us awhile but we went in by 10am. I kinda fell aslwwp while waiting and I was jolted awake by the orchaestra's fanfare that followed when the procession (of Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, lecturers, etc, arrived. It looked nice and kept me awake pretty much for the whole ceremony. The Great Hall was kinda warm, and I'm sure the shirt, suit, tie, gown, and hat didn't help to keep us cool. We listened to some speeches (less than I had expected, which was good), and preceeded. I was lucky to be the first half of the ceremony. Saw a few familar faces here and there. At the end, we followed the main procession out of the Hall. A lot of waiting around before the dept photo was taken. Paid 21 for it. My parents finished 2 roll of films which we sent for developing in the Uni Ctr.  When we left, the mood (expectedly) turned irritatingly and nasty. Parents were like blaming each other about where we can grab (cheap) lunch. Of course, I got part of the blame (as usual). The graduation day had to start and end in a crappy manner. I'd say that's a tradition. What a day.

      Everyone's parents seemed to arrive UK on the same day. David's, Lynette's and mine. It was heckuva day. Been running to and fro and rushing places. Dun understand why either.  My parents arrived as well. After some slight difficulty, they did manage to get themselves 1 street away from me. I walked down to meet them and direct them the right way (which was like 500m away only).  The evening they hung around and they got me really pekchek. 1 of my housemates reminded me to be more patient (obviously they could tell I was starting to rise my voice and all that). Told myself I'd try to contain whatever impatient feelings I've got but it's tremendously hard with my mom. The dun-listen-but-wanna-talk-more-and-harping-on-same-topic-but-can't-get-main-point-across chitter chatter juz gets me everytime. My dad's at least is more objective about stuff.  I have a feeling it's going to be a long 2 wks. Watever lah, at least I do have the convocation tomorrow to keep me busy for the next 24 hrs.

      Kewl man. Was surfing around when I found this:  Singapore police off to help build peace in Iraq   urlLink http://straitstimes.asia1.com/topstories/story/0,4386,198752-1057787940,00.html?   This would most probably be the kinda stuff I hope I can do someday. Cross border policing.

      Just read an article about Kata and Waza from Aikido Journal.  urlLink http://www.aikidojournal.com/new/article.asp?ArticleID=463   "Kata should be practiced according to a certain order or prearranged method which is based on a rational relationship (rial). Thus, we are not falling because we are being thrown but rather we are practicing a kata designed for us to be thrown. When we master a rational movement (kata), it is expressed as a natural movement (waza). That is, if you become able to execute a kata spontaneously as a result of repeated practice, you are no longer performing a kata but are executing a waza. We learn through kata and become unconscious of the fact. In other words, as long as movements require our attention they are kata, when the kata become spontaneous they become waza."  Interesting explanation on wats kata and wats waza. Of coz the remaining article is even more interesting. 'Cept that the whole article is available to paying members only.

       urlLink Eileen's  updating of the AFS gallery only serves to remind me that I should update my own photo gallery soon. So far I've only scanned 1 out of the 10 rolls of film I had developed. Just started editing some of them to make them clearer. But I look at the other 9 rolls ... oh man.  Time to plan my day liao. Looks like a busy period ahead.

      During the Aikicamp, I was commenting to Cody on his getting his 4th kyu so soon and he commented on something like once you've clocked up enough hours you can easily get the grade.  This just brings something to mind. Is that how Aikido grades work? That once we've achieved the minimum no. of hours and we're about able to get the next grade. I really don't think so but I still get a bit of a nagging feeling that it may be slightly true. But shouldn't it be the case that techniques and understanding be the main factor when it comes to grading? Part of the reason why I may have the wrong impression is also of the regularity of grading dates. Sorry I'm always doing some kind of comparison, but back in UK, we never actually set when a grading may take place. Pauline Sensei would at most give 1 week's notice but I did hear of a grading being sprung on the students the very night itself. Her purpose of course, is not to cause panick and fail any of the students. But it does seem more effective in the way they would handle the stress and sudden preassures in real life.  I sometimes wish things were just simpler where everyone just train train train and forget about grading. That'd be wonderful. If it comes it comes, if it doesn't well, no loss either.

      Had a family meeting tonight. Haiz ... it's tough having to make ends meet now. My Mom's CPF has just finished as of last month. We're discussing about what we can do to help out with the money situation at home now. Very vexing. Even worse, my dad likes to lament on the fact that I extended 1 extra year of study for my degree, over expenditure in Norway, etc. Nothing I can do about it now but he seems to enjoy the finger pointing exercise from this. Sianz ...  Looks like I'll need to be doing some parttime job soon. Probably gonna do some waitering at a cafe or tuition. May need to inform Sensei that I seriously can't afford to pay him for Aikido anytime soon. He was kind enough to say that he's ok with waivering the fees for students who can't afford it. All I need to do was help him out in the dojo and maybe some demonstrations here and there.  Lotsa shitz to handle. Need to try and send out more resumes now. Oh man ... so much woes as a fresh graduate. I just hope I can enter the Police Force soon. Or at the very least get some kind of confirmation. If I don't, might just have to settle for a boring IT job for money's sake. Also, seems like my Dad not very supportive of the idea that I'm going into the uniform service. He is OK with the govt sector as long as it's non-uniformed. I dunno leh, that's exactly what I'm working towards. But will need to be very sure before I decide.

      So sad today. Annie left Singapore for UK this morning. So many things to say and do but not much opportunity.  I guess I can only look forward to the future.  I guess I should start working towards my goal as a police officer after my NS. Time to start reaching for it instead of waiting for it to fall into my lap. Hope my remaining NS life will be able to help prepare and gear me up for a new life with the police force.  The part waiting for news is the worst.

      Muahaha ... planning my leave liao! The way I see it, I maybe clearing them on every Mon after the exercise ends in early Sep. This way I can enjoy a long weekend and still not interfere with the life-runs in camp. Woohoo ... But of coz it's still flexible lah, if I get any interviews here and there, I'll still need to shift the dates around so I can go for them.  Err ... if anyone out there has anything to suggest about the way my leave should be planned. Please gimme some tips too huh.

      OK today has marked the end of my 1st week back in NS. 6 days has passed. I now have 116 days left as of coming Monday. Countdown!!  Err anyway, the week was quite uneventful. 1st day itself was the day reservists had to report to camp for a 1mth exercise, so naturally my precence was a low priority to my AS1 (manpower officer in charge). The interview and briefing was a quick one. Saw some of the old regulars who were still there. But it's quite sad, 2 of them are just waiting for the SAF to discharge them. All because they didn't pass their IPPT (hence no promotion coming). I guess some people didn't see fitness being such a serious aspect of their job feequirement when they signed on. It's not uncommon among many of the regulars I've seen, and I'm sure they won't be the last.  I wasn't sure where I'm attached to so I basically reported to 2 'bosses' when I can. The SSG in charge of workshop and the brigade RSM. Currently I'm attached to the RSM at least for the duration for the month long exercise as his PA (personal assistant). He treats me quite well. 2 other guys have been temporarily attached to him prior to my arrival, Neo and William. Both nice friendly blokes. Neo is an MOE local scholar and William is a poly-grad from TP. Both are quite a funny combination during office hours. It seems like the RSM will be trying to retain me for the duration of my NS under his office but it's still too early to say if that's going to happen. I wouldn't know anyway, I'm just a foot-soldier. But I do hope that a good balance of work load is possible in office and workshop. I seriously want to try driving an M113 again.  Tues was my first liferun in camp. It was an internal run by my own unit instead of a sister unit conducting it. Was a good slow pace for 4.5km.  Wed work has basically started.  Thurs was another life run, this time we joined our sister unit in camp for 5km. Being an infantry unit, the level of cohesiveness and spirit they have is simply admirable. They were actually cheering all the way.  Fri things were quite busy, even for Thurs we extended our hours a bit beyond office hours but not by much.  Sat was an outcamp run from Pasir Ris camp to Pasir Ris park. Originally I was just supposed to run 10km, but I met an officer I was attached under when I had just passed out from BMT a few years ago. He remembered my face but not much besides that. As I talked to him I kindly of went past the route I wanted to take and had to go for the 15km distance instead. My timing was an atrocious 2hr 2 min. But that included a lot of walking in between and I suffered quite a few cramps on both my calves. But considering that it was only my 3rd run and 1st long distance for a long time, it may still be acceptable. I hope I'll be able to improve before the Army Half Marathon on 14th Sep Sun. Didn't managed to get much work done today but will need to do some stuff from home to prepare for Mon.  Sigh ... NS life.

      Today marked the end of the Aikicamp with Hattori Sensei. Just wanted to mark it down as my first Aikido camp. It was an enjoyable experience. I'm just disappointed that I did miss some lessons and I can't remember a lot of the things I was taught, especially weapons work.  If I could just understand things better, I might be able to practice weapons at home. But ...  Anyway, I did meet a lot of nice people (and a crappy one) at the camp. I'm glad on the whole, I still enjoyed everything.  I do have some wishes though ... wished Gary was training there as well (hope you're reading this dude   haha).  Tommorrow will be my first day in camp. I have to get used to wearing uniform again. Not a problem though.

      Annie had arrived from UK just 2 days ago and she'll be hanging around for a week. She's trying to source for air tickets to Taipei to visit her grandmother there. Her return flight back to the UK from Singapore will be the 27th of Aug because medical students will be starting their term 1 mth before the usual time on the 1st of Sep.  Today I met up with most of my housemates in UK. All but David managed to go out for dinner. It was an expensive but happy day. Of course, it was a real pity I had to excuse myself from Hattori Sensei's seminar at BVCC but because Annie will be around for a short time before I needed to go back to NS, I really had to juggle my time between Aikido and her.  Most of us met at City Hall around the afternoon. Then we went around the area to look around. Spent awhile at Citylink mall and then went for dinner all together at Marche in Suntec. After that we took a short walk to Esplanade mall to look at the night view of the area there. It was really nice. I must admit, the new look looks much better than the old days.  It was disappointing that the night ended so early but becasue Justin and Daniel had to return to base early tomorrow morning so we all went home pretty early.  For me, tomorrow is the start of the Aikicamp and I'm suppose to go down to help move the mats. I had previously arranged to meet Richard at about 10-1030 in the morning, but I needed to collect my glasses and the shop only opens at 1030am. SMSed Richard and he said it was ok and I could make the 2nd trip down to shift the mats. I've a feeling it's gonna be a great camp and a great day tomorrow.

      The seminar / combined training today with Hattori Sensei at BVCC was great.  I have to admit, it was nice seeing some familar faces again.  Paid my arrears, collected my jo, and even managed to get some short clips of Hattori Sensei teaching the dojo. It was a waste that I didn't manage to get the part of him showing some weapons technique to the dojo. He was trying to relate the empty handed forms with the swordwork. It was truly interesting.  I found a lot of people have improved tremendously. They've adopted a very style which seemed quite common in some of them, and yet still still makes themselves stand apart from the rest. I'm not saying they're very great or anything but I was pleasantly surprised with the improvements in the past 12 mths or so.  Just which I had made that kind of progress when I was in UK. Just makes me want to train harder. I haven't started my bokken exercises since landing in S'pore. Think I'll start real soon. Once things get settled, I may ask Ah Hee Sensei if he still conducts weapons classes. Would be really happy to be able to supplement my taijutsu with weapons.

      PC has been acting up just yesterday. Managed to kinda get it working again. Haiz ... been working on it since last week after I landed in Singapore.  Has anyone seen the NUS Aikido website? It looks really good now. Much much better than before, and definitely way better than even their associations homepage.  Talking about new websites, the SPF has a totally new and kewl look too. Was checking out the recruitment page when I saw the new look. They even have a link for the STAR (Special Tactics and Rescue) Team. My only beef with them is that it takes longer to download now. First of all it requires plugins like Macromedia. After that it takes time to download and travel in between links (ie. Loading xx% etc).  OK talking about the SPF reminds me of my NS. I got my official notice to resume service on 18th Aug. Just occured to me that I'm not exactly sure how to travel there and the time I'm suppose to report. Think I'll need to call CPC for the unit no for all the details.

      Been working on my PC for the last 2 days. Damn thing keeps failing. Seem to have sorted things out. Dad's PC is probably just spare parts now and I've set up space for him on my PC as well. Ah .. anyway I dun think I need to PC much. Hope I can shift the thing out into a more public area. I just dun like people running in and out of my room constantly.  Today went NUS to check out prices for a 2nd laptop for my sis. She's quite eager on getting one. Some good deals for NUS students but I only got my cousin there as a lobang and he's already bought a laptop from Uni. 2nd purchase isn't possible till Sep and even so the price is gonna be increased I think. Anyway, there's a computer fair on during the 1st weekend of Sep, might as well check that out then and get one there. I'm sure there are pretty good bundled deals.  Went for my first run today. Pleasantly surprised to realise i could still run pretty OK. Then again it could be coz I started 3km only. Halfway back I was overtaking 2 girls when 1 of them called out to me. Such a coincidence, it was Begh (UK housemate). Wasn't in the best of condition to stay for a long chat so I departed pretty soon. Probably give her a quick ring these days when I've settled my things. Hmm ... maybe I'll go run again if I can wake up early 2moro. Maybe grab an earlier night today. Past 2 nights I've been sleping no later than 3am.

      OK juz got back to S'pore this evening. My flight was delayed about 30-45 mins but my parents flight was early about 30-45 mins so we basically arrived almost the same time.  My flight was from via Emirates, from Birmingham to Dubai, where I had to take a transfer from Dubai to Singapore with a stopover in Columbo/Colombo. That's where the delay occurred. For a stopover, only passengers whose destination was  Colombo needed to alight. Those going to S'pore just stayed onboard while the plane refueled. But some buggers actually alighted and they didn't get back on the plane on time. Basket, the least they could do was take note of the time and listen to announcements what right. Really selfish coz they delayed everyone else and it was really inconsiderate of them.  Anyway, I was suppose to meet a friend who was working at the airport but coz some miscommunication and my parents early arrival we didn't manage to meetup. Nevermind lah. Was quite knackered out tonight. I tried to stay awake on the plane as long as I could so I'd have to go to bed early to recover from jet lag. But I feel so awake now.

      Dunno what came over me but I just decided to be adventurous. I signed up for the Singapore Marathon 2003 which will be held on 7th Dec. Though it's a full marathon (42km), I'll just be running the half marathon route (21km). I'm even considering the biathlon which is organised every year in March but I think I need to seriously cross train properly before I can take it.  Still dunno what came over me.  Yuishinkai's seminar will commence this coming Thurs to Sat (2nd-4th Oct). I think I'll register for the Thurs afternoon seminar. It should be an interesting experience. After that I should have more than enought time to grab dinner and head on down to Siglap for Aikido class at Siglap. I just hope my leave application on Mon will be approved.

      Today I visited Yuishinkai's dojo at Upper Boon Keng Road / Geylang West CC with my friend who trains there.  Yuishinkai has a really soft touch to their techniques and their class practice with an open attitude. There was a casual atmosphere throughout the stretch of class. Everyone was friendly and approachable.  We started with some stretches at a faster rythm then I was used to. A lot of ukemi too. A lot of emphasis on Ki extension and balance (ie. imagine your head is lifted by a think string, etc). It was an interesting and fulfilling class. Sure it seemed slower then the class I was used to. But they pointed out plenty of minute details in my technique I had not noticed before. Ki extension (the simplest one), isn't that impossible for me afterall.  All in all, it was a really fascinating experience. I might actually drop in more often to reinforce some of my concepts and fundamentals again.

      The last 2 days were terrible. Again it's because of poor working attitude and irresponsible behaviour of certain individuals in camp.  Basically a sister unit was unable to provide the usual guard duty personnel for certain days due to a sequence of outfield exercise they were involved in. Naturally, our unit had to be pulled in to replace the guard duty personnel. In the process of all the reshuffling, some people had to cover by taking up extra days of duty.  1 particular person went to get MC in order to escape from a duty day allocated to him. In the process, other people had to be arrowed to take up his duty. He is so childish and irresponsible. Instead of reflecting on his actions, he feels that it was my RSM's fault that other people got the duty. This mentality is dominant in several people, they do not see the fact that these extra duties HAVE to be fulfilled, and that my RSM actually had no choice but to allocate them to the men. It wasn't some random punishment meted out to the men for nothing. It was just something that HAD to be done. Such childish and selfish thoughts and behaviour are what I have to put up with most often in the office. Looking at this particular person, I feel seriously disappointed with people as a whole. I feel sorry for my 2 friends who have been seriously affected by his inconsiderate actions.  I have a final full day guard detail tomorrow on Sat. So looking forward to it because that's the last duty of the month for me. I really have to GAMBATTE!

      It's another duty day for me. Staying in camp (again). Haiz ... can't wait for my last duty to be over this Sat. But then again, it's the worst, guard duty. More walking around camp. For a whole day somemore. Boring, but needs to be done, what to do? Must think of some ways to entertain myself this duty.  Oh, later gotta order takeaway. Hmm ... wonder if we should order pizza, Mac or KFC?

      Right ... I'm now in camp whiling the night away. Got stupid QRF (Quick Resonse Force) duty. Basically means if the camp is under attack or something, QRF personnel will be supporting the guards at the guard room at any point in camp, hence the term QRF.  Had a difficult afternoon today. Basically being in RSM office means I gotta plan out the monthly duties (eg. guard duty) for the whole brigade. Haiz, it's proving to be quite an ordeal. Basically what happened was that when I came in, my friend Neo had already planned out a duty plan. Problem was a neighbouring unit had to go on exercise and that meant they couldn't send the men in to do duties for certain pre-arranged dates. They requested a swap but now the dates we got were not favourable. Means some people had to to have their original duty dates rearranged and some actually got extra duties beyond their monthly average, while others got their duties so closely packed together it became difficult to have enough rest in between. Some last minute medical cases had to be pulled out from their duties at the last minute, leaving even more empty duty slots for the month and insufficient people to fill them.  It seems like even I myself will be doing some of these extra duties.  I've heard of several unhappy grumblings and it feels bad to be the'bad guy' to have to do these. I've been making changes since last week and till just now, things have been pretty disorienting and hectic. It seems there are so many factors to consider, their personal commitment dates & their other duty dates (which is a lot to be going through on an individual level).  Neo has been helping to try and sort out the duties together because he has more experience than me. Originally, he wanted me to handle it because I'll soon be the one taking over this completely soon. But it was just too much for one person to handle.  It's impossible to please everyone in the brigade and I thought of taking up more duties. But Neo said it was not worth it as nobody here will appreciate it. That's true. I think all I can do is distribute the extra duties amongst everyone (including ourselves) and whoever is unhappy about it, well ... tough luck. But it sure isn't going to earn me any friends in the Brigade.  Also realised one thing, sometimes it's necessary to be the bad guy so as to get things done. If I ever get into the police force, I think I will enforce this belief. It is not only necessary but crucial to get things moving quickly. Humans are forgetful, most of them will soon forget this unhappy month and just carry on their duties whether they like it or not. To allow things to drag on so long will only serve to remind them of their 'torturous experience'.  Hope QRF won't be activated later. They usually test our readiness one/twice in a night. I wanna sleep .... :(

      What a tiring day the past few days had been.  I did my first guard duty on Fri night. When it was finally over, I was so tired from the lack of sleep. On the way back home, I was nodding off while standing on the MRT. Got some weird looks from people too.  Got back and went straight to bed. Slep for over 3 hrs. Got up and redied myself to go back to camp. We had book in by 6pm coz of the Army Half Marathon the next day. They wanted to ensure we had enought water and sleep the day before the run.  On Sun, we all got up around 230am. I was tossing and turning around 0055am. Probably becoz I wasn't used to sleeping in a new environment yet, or becoz I had gone to bed so early (730pm). Took a 5 tonner to Division camp. The 5 tonner is like a truck with little/no suspension system. But becoz of the time, everyone learned to enjoy and sleep on the ride despite the bumps on the road.  We had breakfast in with Division and departed for Kallang Indoor Stadium which happened to be the start and end point.  The competitive runners started at about 0545hrs whilst the non-competitive ones started at 0600hrs. I was in the latter. I paced myself with a fellow campmate, Chan Kai Chong. The pace was comfortable for me and we made it through the first 10km rather easily. After that, Chan started feeling uncomfortable with his ankles and I kept on encouraging him forward. Throughout the whole run I was considering if I should leave him and just proceed on my own instead. But I convinced myself that it was pointless. I think the run meant more if I could see him through the remainder of the run. Towards the last 2km, Chan stopped more than a few times and I had to slow down with him. Partly to make him know that I wasn't goin to leave and that I'd be foregoing my timing if he chose to give up and juz walk.  We both completed the run in 2hrs 35 min, that was just 5 min faster than the timing I had 3 yrs ago. I wasn't exactly satisfied with this but I felt a wee bit consoled that at the very least I did the right thing by completing it with Chan. From another point of view, it was probably Chan who helped me maintain my pace. If I ran alone, I might've overburned myself somewhere in the run and not complete the whole distance. All that's left is to better my timing and test myself again next year.  At least at the end of this event, I know where I stand. There's room for more improvement and I have 12 mths to do it. Ideally I'd like to complete under 2 hrs but let's just take a few mins at a time.

      Today I started my regular Aikido training at Siglap.  Most of the other students were transferred over from students class so they almost all from secondary school and one from primary. A funny lot. Made me feel a whole lot younger (Sensei mentioned that too at the start of the class haha). But they were a cheeky lot as well. Sensei seemed well and happy teaching them. Some of the specifics of a technique may be missed by them, but I did realise that a lot of them were pretty good and soft. Maybe it's the age they've started and they've grown to develop a nice foundation for Aikido. I realise I'm even looking at how they do certain stuff to curb some of my bad habits here and there. And they were pretty soft as well. All in all, it was a good start for me and I'm happy going back there for my regular training (at least while I'm still in NS lah).  Did know four of their names. There's Leon (Pri 6), Weide (I think), Daniel and another I can't quite remember now. They were asking me lotsa questions about NS (I went right after camp so I was in uniform) and I answered them as best as I can. Some of things I told them were the brighter side of things. I think it's no point giving them the nasty stuff and direct them towards a very negative attitude of NS. I did give very neutral and fair comments that a lot of things depended on them how they perceived everything and their attitude. Think they were a bit young to fully understand what I was saying as well but I hope that they'd grasp a bit of what I was trying to convey.  Oh yar. One more thing. NS pay came in today ... so did my eMart credits. WOOHOO! Bought my AHM running attire ... goodness, the V-cut on the running shorts made me feel really 'exposed'. I miss the Mizuno sponsorship we used to have for AHM runners.

      Got a call on Fri afternoon saying I need to return to camp on Sat for the run instead of going to ECP. ARGH! Camp runs are so boring. Anyway, yesterday I went back and we had a 15 km outcamp run to Pasir Ris park. It wasn't as nice as ECP, and there wasn't any early fall out but I did manage to go a lot longer than my 1st 15km run a few wks back. However, after the run, both legs felt really weak and my knees felt kinda bruised / sore. I think I'll need to take things easy the next few days just to make sure that I'll be ok for the AHM next Sun.  This morning I woke up early to go for a quick jog. It seemed to help my legs and knees a bit. Either that or it was the sleep I got lastnight that helped. Later I'm gonna be going to Comex at Suntec to get my CD-writer. Been waiting for ages to get it. Hopefully can meet up some friends and catch a movie later on. Dun wanna stay home all day again.

      RSM gave us, his 3 stooges (Neo, William, me), the afternoon off. Naturally the morning was spent clearing up last night's dinner function in the officers' mess. Haiz, and wat a mess it was. Anyway, William was damn happy about the off. You could tell that he worked a little faster than normal. I think Neo and I only wanted to clear up what we could before we left. I was seriously pondering if I should stay on instead of leaving. Leaving camp in the middle of a day when there's no transport provided is a serious burden on my transport cost (in fact I think I forgot to scan my card when I alighted the bus home... argh!! $2.40 gone.). Decided to go for the off because the 2 guys were pretty tired from lastnight's function and they really wanted the rest. If I was the only one who stayed on, it seems a wee bit like I was spoiling market for them. Anyway, William did lompang us all out to the MRT.  I dunno, I can tell some people weren't very happy about us getting the off when they didn't. I had a serious talk about how the young NSFs feel about things like off. I seriously can't stand the way some of them think. Granted some of them are practically 20-ish kids but I seriously dun remember being so particular about whether I get to take off or not. Even lasttime, I rarely asked for any and I'd just accepted those that did came my way. The only time I asked for off was when I couldn't cover enough days with my leave so that I can depart Singapore for my Uni's induction programme in UK. I think it's normal to be given off by someone else, but a direct superior, due to dept work commitments, is unable to release his men for the off they had been given. What's wrong with that? As the SAF always say, off is a privilege, not an entitlement.  And I can't stand the selfish attitude some people have in NS. We had to shift some tables back to our bunks this morning. Some would only shift what was rightfully suppose to be in their bunks and leave the rest of the stuff untouched. Some went on to lie on their beds to rest while others cleared up the other stuff. Some would be so scared of doing things one way that they'd do everything by the book and it can really seriously piss people off as well. Flexibility in a lot of matters is necessary. Without a bit of EQ when it comes to doing stuff, it's easy to offend someone. And in this world, it's always good to be on good terms with people and just practice a little Aiki-attitude. Do others a little favour because you dunno when you'll need help from others someday.  My unit has a seen a lot of improvements compared to when I was around. Vice versa, there's a horrible and ugly side which I saw a lot of this morning in the unit. Espirit de corp is not a quality that has been cultivated into my unit. I miss the old days when life was simple and all you needed to do was do things together. Eat, suffer, play, enjoy together. The army teaches us a lot of stuff. Maintaining the right attitude, being an example for your peers to follow - work harder than others if it's an area of your forte to influence others to work as hard, help when you can, be cordial to people, even more so to others not in your unit, and especially so where a co-operative effort may be needed someday. Start everything nicely but end them even nicer. Don't keep thinking of what posible rewards you will receive because it will only blind you from putting in 100% to finish the job at hand.  A lot of nasty attitude and examples were experience this morning in a short span of just 4hrs. Detailing all of them out will take too much effort and pointless. These are matters I hope to foget when I go to bed. But if people with the right attitude appear a lot more, they do provide a more positive atmosphere for me to work in. These are the only things and people I want to remember when I leave.

      Yes! Exercise Tiger Balm 2003 has ended today. The closing ceremony was a tremendous success. The Americans really got into the whole thing and participated wholeheatedly. It was a great bilateral exercise.  Our RSM seemed to have scored some major points with Division. The performances and various other arrangements turned out exceptionally well. The food was nice too. There was a superb video clip which was made by my unit. There were more than a few requests for copies of the video. Even I feel like asking if I can keep a copy. But I didn't get to leave camp until about 10+pm.  Tomorrow, however, is gonna be a major cleaning up process. Think that's going to take a brigade effort.

      RSM (Regimental Sergeant Major) wasn't around all morning and didn't came to camp till mid afternoon. I had to prepare the laptop for some presentation coming thurs. We spent a great deal of time waiting and had to do OT. A bit sianz about the late book out but I reckon I should start to prepare some clothes and leave them in my locker so that I can stay in camp whenever I need/want to. No point going home everyday also.  Had quite a long chat with 2-3 reservists in the day. Shared a lot of insights about how I felt about our education system(one of them being a teacher), past experiences and stories out in the field (which wasn't much for me), etc. It was nice.  The next 2 days are probably gonna be the busiest for me. Really have to be ready to stay in if it gets too late. It surprised me even more that the RSM had to go to anothercamp even late at night. I guess this exercise is taking its toil on everyone.

      Went to report sick in camp today. All because of the bad case of rash/infection I had around the time I went trekking in Norway. It's been stuck to me for a month already. But it is healing (very) slowly. At least he gave me some cream for it. Seriously hope the rash dun impair my AHM training. I only got lesst than 2 wks to train for it now.

      Had a nice day at Ikea. I expect to return again after I do more organising of my cupboard. At least things look neater now instead of being all stacked up. Tried the Swedish meatballs that Annie had recommended ever so highly :P. It was pretty good. A bit on the pricy side though, $5.50.  Caught 'Intolerable Cruelty' today too, starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones. Was ok. Was about a lawyer and a lady who married and divorced pple for their assets. They started out on opposite sides, then slowly fell in love and got together. They tried to trick each other all using the idea of a pre-nuptial agreement. I think the pre-nup is a safe way for these kinda 'weird' marriages. But to require things to reach an extent like this, I think there's a real lack of trust. If that's necessary, maybe it's not right to get married afterall. It felt nice to see them tearing up the pre-nup in the end tho. At least it meant something, but there was also an earlier similar scene which was faked to lull the guy into a force sense of security.  Just caught a documentary on SAF peacekeeping forces in Timor Leste. It was inspiring, to say the least. This used to be restricted for regulars only, but I'm glad they opened it up to NSFs and NSmen as well. I would've loved to do this during my NSF period for a few mths. It would've added more meaning into my NSF life.

      Just got back from the combined training at BVCC. Was quite surprised. There weren't as many people there tonight as I would've expected. Freddy Sensei took us for the first half and Ah Hee Sensei the second half.  The training wasn't like very very very enriching for me, but I enjoyed it a lot. Think I really sweat things out tonight. Probably a result of training in aircon room for too long. I really can't wait for Thur's class. Wanna train again. And we're using our jo too! Whee...  Alright, just made a lunch appointment with Darren Lim, an old Uni friend, to go to Ikea, shope around and we'll prob have lunch there too. After that hopefully we can go out for a movie too. Been soooooo out of touch with shows. I think I've got a lot of back lot to watch. Argh, wish I had cable so I can download movies everyday!

      Okie dokie ... feels weird to be clearing some of my leave and off these 3 days.  Took leave for the afternoon, was considering if I should go donate blood. Got an email sometime back saying there was a blood donation drive at Selarang camp so I was thinking should I use my personal leave time for this. In the end when I reached Tampines JC, I thought 'what the heck, might as well since I'm still in the east side' so I alighted. Got to Selarang camp and realised there wasn't any mobile blood bank there. ARGH!! wasted my personal transport fare and time. And it was only last night that I saw on the news saying there weren't enough regular blood donars each year. Haiz ... maybe I'll check their website again next time before I do anything like that.  Woohoo ... tomoro on off. Goin Ikea to do some shopping. Hope I dun buy too much coz I still wanna go for the Aikido combined training at BVCC.

      Resumed my Japanese language class in Singapore today. School is called PYAESS.  The first half was just going through grammars by a young teacher. She seems awfully shy/quiet/inexperienced maybe. It was kinda boring and slow. But I figured, what the heck, maybe give her some time and we might all just learn something. The second half was basically conversational practise and some exercises. It was conducted my an older teacher but at least she was more proactive with the class. Much better I would say.  I left realising I knew more of content compared with the other students but more out of practiced. Plus my memory with vocabs and some grammars of what I learnt aren't that greath either. Haiz ... looks like I'll have something to work on from now on, in and out of camp.

      Yesterday was a 3/4 working day for me only. Evening we had the 9 Div Chain-of-Command Relay. It was really really tough. Our earlier training runs were not as effective as we had thought. It was kinda disappointing as we had only gotten 6th and 8th placing out of the 14 teams. But I felt inspired, we had done out best and given our all for this run. I think the atmosphere and mood gave us a lot of pressure. A lot of us started the run too fast, I know I did. Just 100m or so and I knew there was no way I could keep up this pace and complete the race. To make things worse, the flag we were carrying though light, but was cumbersome. I carried it in a high-port stance similar to the way a rifle is carried. I should have used one hand to hold it instead. The first half of the race our 2 teams did extremely well and we were well ahead in 4th-5th placing. But as we went on we just got slower and slower. I also think that several units actually placed their better/faster runners at the end of the relay. The infantrymen from 3 and 6 SIR were truly inspiring. I wish I could train my legs stronger so I could've put up a better fight. Only 1 guy overtook me, despite my best efforts to sprint towards the end of the finishing line, I was just about to reach him when he gave a final boost and zoomed onwards. My mind and legs just couldn't go on. Right after, my muscles from the calves ached right up to my ass and there was a 'numbing' sensation. Most of us could hardly stand. Unbeliveable.  After the prize giving ceremony I tried to rush down to Siglap for Aikido. Unluckily the aircon had broken down and Sensei decided to end the class earlier at 9:10 pm, the time that I arrived. All I did was help to keep the mats and go on home for a well deserved ultra long weekend. He said I should feel free to visit any of the other dojos to train if I could make it from my camp in time. I'll probably try to work something out and pop by the other dojos to train more regularly.  Arrrrrghhh ... time to sleep. I'm sure I'll be feeling the effects of this evenings run in the morning.

      Today's training was pretty OK. Considering I'm still feeling pretty taxed from the guard duty 2 nights ago.  We did 2 slow rounds of a full run-down (with a slight change in route), and then we went for 5 laps of slope training. It consisted of about 200+m I think but it sure was tiring. On the actual day, we still need to run with our unit flag / colours instead of using a baton. A lot of weird rules like the flag cannot go below the runners head, etc. Demerit points will be given and penalty timing of 20sec-2min can be given depending on the seriousness of the breach of rules. Mad ...

      Sooooo tired after lastnight's guard duty. I think Thur's Aikido class really taxed me physically since I've not done that much slams for quite awhile.  Had a hard time trying to finish my rounds with my SBO on. Shoulder muscles feeling strained now. Even my calves are aching. Got no idea how I'm going to run tomorrow morning. Prob let my RSM/S3 know I'm not feeling physically at my optimum and I wanna refrain from getting an injury before the actual run this comin Thurs.  Ohh ... my aching muscles ...

      Today our Bde had a friendly soccer match with another soccer team from 8 SAB, I think. However, they were the representative of the Armour formation and were quite professional. Naturally we lost, 18-0 hehheh. Anyway, the rest of the Bde had to stay as supporters. I became the ball-picker instead :P  I had to rush down to Aikido after that as there was no transport out. I was just on time. Managed to settle payment for the mat fees at the CC (been owing for quite awhile), and rushed on to change into my gi. There were 2 adults watching (father and son I think). I got slammed more than a few times today. Was getting into it, but I realised I tend to fall really hard. More than once, I landed weird on my back (hope no permanent damage was caused :P). Somewhere in the middle, I managed to fall really soft for some not-too-soft-slams. Dunno how I did it, but I seem to have a vague idea. Really need to try it out again at slow-mo to be certain in future. Today's training was great! At least I left feeling like I've brought something away with me.  Oh yea, 2moro guard duty. Sianz ... gonna miss the ECP run. Hope to make up for it this Sun at Selarang training run.

      Today I visited the AFS site. Read the updated news of Gombak closing down and the merging of Gombat and BB East dojos. I think Freddy Sensei must be feeling kinda sad about this. Also just realised there's a combined training every last Tues of the month. That's a fantastic idea. Sensei is encouraging each one to cross train with people they've not seen before. I think this should be a regular practice which should be carried on as time goes by.   urlLink Eileen's blog  has a fantastic account of a training session with Tommy. I think it's really wonderful. I also believe it's a great way to improve the stamina.  I'm staying in camp again. Somf of the nicer folks in camp are doing overnight duties today so I though staying back shuold be quite interesting. Anyway, probably going for a quick run around 8:30pm later since this morning's life-run was cancelled due to bad weather. Again, the whole Bde got screwed up by the RSM. Over discipline and performance again. I think he made really valid points about the discipline in the Bde. Problem is not many people realise it till it's too late. When that happens, we all deserve the lecture we're getting. Even I realised my discipline slackened down. Before the Sun run at Selarang, I did take my own sweet time to get to camp even though I was already late. Instead we the juniors made the officers wait for us. Of course the weather was bad but still it didn't project a good image. I guess some things can be quite ' wayang' (just to put up a show / front for people to see), but image is pretty important too. We all know how kokup things can be in NS, but if we let foreign powers know every knitty gritty mess we encounter, I think we'd have been attacked and conquered a long time ago. Professionalism is not something found in every organisation, or every level of an organisation, but it definitely needs to be projected to external parties. It's like a hawker ctr and a foodcourt thing.  OK almost time for the run. Ciaoz.

      Yesterday was a great Sunday.  I joined the training run at Selarang camp (my previous camp). We're preparing for a relay on the 23 Oct. There'll be a no. of reservists and some active personnel participating. I've only just realised I'm going to have to miss the training at Siglap then. Argh!! That is unless someone gives me a lift down immediately after the run. Drat!  Anyway, we did a full run-down (900m) twice, followed by 100m sprints thrice and a final run-down again. After each sprint, the losing team (we were divided into A and B) will need to do 10 push-ups. All 3 times, my team (B) kanna pumped ... haha. For the last time, Team A joined in as well. This training run showed me that the reservist officers have a great deal of endurance in them despite their age. For the first 2 run downs and sprints, I was able to keep in front one of the older reservist. But the final sprint and run-down, he was in front of me and I was all but depleted both physically and mentally. It was a truly great session that morning.  I think besides feeling tired, everyone left that morning feeling really good.

      Today was Enlistee's day. I woke up really early and left early. Got there way to early and there wasn't anyone there. To make things worse, it was raining so heavily. I tried to explore the area to look for somewhere to grab a bite. After walking around in the rain for awhile, I decided the closest spot was too far and I turned back. By the time I got back to the gathering pt, almost everyone had arrived except for a few laggers here and there. Finally the event was cancelled but breakfast had to be consumed as they had already been indented (ordered, to u civilians out there). Me and some of the guys wandered around looking for somwhere to hang out and decided to goto the Kallang Leisure Park. 2-4 of the guys played bowling while I just watched and napped. After that we all went back home. Kinda a waste of the morning, was looking forward to trying the Dragonboat thingy since I was already there. Damn the weather. Anyway, Saw RSM just now. I decided to join in the 9 Div Panthers road relay as a reserve. Going to go back to Selarang (my old and previous camp) for training the next few Suns.  In the afternoon, met Darren (Uni friend). We went down to sign up for the same Japanese language class. It's going to cost 200+ for about 10 weeks, 1430-1730hrs every Sun. Hopefully I can pursue this longterm. I think it starts 26th Oct. I might've remebered wrongly but it seems to be clashing with the Panther's Run.

      My guard duty on Tues had left me really worn out for the whole week. Maybe it was due to the 2 life runs we I had before and after the guard on Tue and Thurs. A warrant was pushing us to run under a certain timing each 3km run. I managed to get a better timing on the latter training but it was still pretty slow to me. My next guard is going to be next Fri. Yawwwwwnz...  This coming Sat is our Div's Enlistee Day. They've organised some stupid Dragon boat competition at the Singapore Dragoin boat Association at Kallang. Heard we'll be rowing a 1.2km race. Sounds interesting lah but considering it's a Sat, I'd rather have a simple run in camp instead. Anyway, no choice also.  Eileen has a nice saying from Tommy on her  urlLink blogpage . It's meaningful and it reminds me not to be too judgemental of others, a common tendency.

      Yesterday was a relatively great day. Met Lynette for dinner in Tampines coz I had a few hours free before Aikido. We had a good chat and I was really happy to hear that she's got herself attached just recently. Can tell that she's beaming the whole night from the conversation about her new beau... haha. Think it's about time and she definitely deserves it.  Was thinking back since the day I knew Lynette back in 2000. I remembered it was still in NS, prior to our departure to UK. I got no idea how, but we had chatted on mIRC and then ICQ. Somehow or rather we met in UK after that. The person I knew then was really quite temperamental. Most of us would be 'afraid' of offending her somehow. But now, she's really quite different. She's a good friend and she has controlled her temper a lot. Her willingness to go out of the way to help a friend and standing by her principles are just some well noted points of her strong character. She deserves everything that life has given her because she's worked hard for it. A good listener whenever anyone of us needed a ear to grumble to. Hah :P  After this long good talk, I rushed down to Siglap for Aikido. Today's class was good. It incorporated soft feeling techniques (morote dori ikkyo and nikkyo waza, if I got them right) and some jo equivalents as well. I could actually feel the techniques working. I managed to co-ordinate myself for some techniques to blend wif my uke. Kokyuho was done with Bridgette (spelling??), I noted she has a very strong way of doing kokyuho. Very good and effective. She's able to 'feel' the strength I'm exerting out and divert them to move me around, I'd say, pretty effectively to a certain extent. But I can't do it well. So much I can learn from a sec sch kid. Puts me to shame man. Haha ... Still, it was a good night.

      OK, gotta post some comments about the grading on Sun. It was interesting, (tiring for most of them), but I have to say, it lacked the extra 'oomph' that I was expecting ... Not enough killing!! Muahahaa!! I think my favourite part was still free practice for the 1st kyu grading.  But I'm still happy for those who had taken their grading that day. Hope they excel even further in the days to come.  Yuishinkai's seminar will be starting this Thurs. Having applied for a full day's leave for Thurs, I'll be attending the afternoon session from 2-5pm. My friend had suggested that I drop down for the morning session for a look even if I'm not training in that slot. It's a good idea but I'm not sure I can wake up on time. I'm also planning to go down to Sim Lim to buy my PCI firewire card for my PC. It's high time I started burning some of my videos from UK and the grading on Sun into CDs. Hope I can finish this fast instead of procrastinating.

      OK my third visit to SNEC today. Good news is, it's only a bad eye infection. Hmm ... the redness and irritation apparently seems to be caused by one of the eye drops I was given. THey told me to throw everything away and they'll give me something else. Can tell the difference between an experienced and less experienced Dr today. The more experienced one would say, "Don't worry. It's nothing serious." "Just use xxxxxxx, and the redness will go away. You'll feel much better after that, guaranteed." Was quite elated lah. But during the checkup my medical docket seemed to have gone missing for awhile. My father made a bit of fuss over this. I just kept quiet and didn't want to interfere. If I did, it might make things worse for the nurses there. Sigh, I pity people in the service industry sometimes.  Anyway, I was given 6 days MC. Looks like my Sat duty need to be swapped with my friend's next month. Drat, and I was hoping to clear up everything before Dec so I'll be a lot more free then :P Oh well. Things are looking up at least. Next checkup due on Mon. Hopefully I can go back to Aikido on Tues and get some last min prep for the marathon next Sun.

      Latest news after my visit to the Singapore National Eye Centre this morning. Just abad infection. I was told I should have kept on applying the antibiotics despite the discomfort I was feeling. OK No choice, each time I just suck it in and bear the pain during my first application. At least the goodnews is that I only need to apply it every 2hrs now instead of 1 hr. My next appointment will be on Wed afternoon. Meanchile, I'm going to just make myself comfortable in bed.  Had to email Marcus and Ivy that I won't be able to meet them at the airport on Wed morning coz of the eye thing now.  Oh yea, imagine my pleasant surprise when an old poly classmate just emailed me on Friendster. I immediately forwarded it to our class members. Maybe after I recover I'll ask him out for coffee or something.

      Today my eye feels like it has gotten worse. I was fine with the medication lastnight till even this morning. But after I woke up from an afternoon nap, it seemed to have gotten so swollen and stight that I can barely keep it open. It feels so tensed and I'm not sure how I can relax it. Medication don't seem to be helping so I dare not apply anymore. It gets so tight now that tears can't flow out freely and I gotta use my fingers to keep my eye lids open while my eyes tear. Will be seeing the specialist tomorrow and I hope there'll be good news or a change in medication.  I hope no extension of mc is required coz I'd hate to make someone from camp takeover my sat duty. I also hope I won't need to be warded after that either. Really hope there'll be some good news tommorow. I doubt I can meet up with Marcus, Ivy and baby Zelda at the airport on Wed morning if my condition persists.

      Went to the Polyclinic to check out my eye thoroughly this morning. The doctor would've referred me to the Singapore National Eye Centre but being a Sat and all, it would've been closed. He had no choice but to send me to the A&E. So I went to SGH A&E where the doctor wasn't able to see anything wrong, again he referred me to an eye specialist. Well, after all the referrals and waiting (not complaining about these, I'm kinda used to this all thanks to NS), the verdict is that it's most probably a bad eye infection due to my contacts. First off I going to have to stop using them, second I was given 3 different type of eye drops; 2 of these were antibiotics and 1 of which was hand-mixed by the specialist herself (suppose to be stronger). From now till first thing Mon morning, I have to use the eye drops on my right eye every hour, with 15 mins between each different type of eyedrops. Was quite surprised because I didn't feel that it was that serious. But turns out I needed to follow this. The specialist even asked me if I could do it, otherwise she'd ward me in the observation ward. Looks like I'm going to lose some sleep for the next 48hrs until my 2nd appointment with the specialist. She was kind enough to slot me in first thing in the morning even though she already has a full schedule.

      Had a most horrible day today. Spent awhile at my aunt's/uncle's place trying to link up a spare PC and laptop into their home network. Wasn't successful. Apart from the obvious stuff I changed, I have really no idea what is wrong with it that I couldn't get them to go online. But this has been draggin on so long now. I'm very sian of doing this shitz now. I hate maintaining PCs. I don't mind doing it when it's needed but not setting up stuff and new technologies. Think everyone is kinda taking this for granted now. If I can only find a permanent fulltime job, I'll definitely refuse anymore of this requests.  I got home soon after. My dad wanted to view a TIF document. Simple question which lead to a whole big arguement which lead to a lot of hollering, shoving and throwing of stuff. I didn't help matters by the tone in which I replied him. Neither did he want to listen when he's at the peak of his temper. Got a chair thrown out of my room (damage to the floor, nothing to the chair). During all the shoving around, my mom knowing that I had a bit of sore eye on my right eye tried to stand between the both of us to protect me. In her frustration she grabbed the nearest object to throw on the ground. Bad mistake, turned out it was a $3000 piece of engineering equipment my dad had loaned from his principal co. in Australia. Shitz ... I guess we don't have to pay it back anytime soon coz it's on long term loan but still ... ~$~  I let him get to me again. I find it so hard to shield out the comments coming from my family unlike those coming from an outsider. Each of us had a part in the way things got out of hand. It's a frustrating moment. Things cooled off pretty quick but I still find it really irksome to spend time at home rather than in camp. I'm considering spending time in camp even when I'm on leave. No point coming back and making things so difficult on everyone right?

      Lastnight I went for Aikido at BB East. Oh man, seriously, I think age is catching up with me liao. I'm aching all over. Plus the past 2 nights we had to do situps and pushups.  BB East's class was a comfortable size despite combining with Gombak students. I liked it but I think Tommy was right. The aircon isn't a good idea. Too comfy for me. I think I might just continue at Siglap and drop by BVCC/BB East on just 1 more extra day when I can. This way I supplement my training and I still get to train with the young kids/teens at Siglap. Eh ... but it still feels weird to not be paying mat fee at the dojos I'm popping by. But at least given current $ situation, it's not a bad thing either. :P  Got my Medical FFI back in camp this afternoon. Woohoo, 1 more milestone towards my ORD!

      Today's Aikido was GREAT!! I can't say I did achieve really fantastic stuff or understood everything, but I definitely, absolutely, totally enjoyed it. I have nooooo idea why.  Was a bit late again missing warmup and all that. Not a good idea coz it's the same both times I popped down to BVCC that this had happened. Really need to keep my timing in check.  Today was the first time I paired up with Sunny (kowtows to Nidan ... capable of some really hard throws). I can tell you every iriminage he did on me, I didn't get what he was trying to get across to me. Seriously ... I only thought I understood it the final time he did it and then it was over liao. Wasted. Didn't even manage to take a decent ukemi for him. Fell like a piece of rock each time and I know I could've hurt myself badly if he really wanted to throw me. Dun understand it, but I still totally enjoyed it. Each iriminage I did on him he could've done a reversal. OK my iriminage was craaaap. Absolute shitz ... but I still enjoyed it. Dun understand it. No frustration at not 'getting it' either.  Today's a weird mood of training for me... but a happy one.  Out've the blue my mom was in the neighbourhood to pick me up. On the way back in the car, we actually had a decent conversation. I'm still quite skeptical about how long these moments can last but it still feels nicer to be talking rather than hollering at each other.

      It's another week of leave for me. Time to get some old chores cleared up. Will also be intensifying the training over the next 10 days. Hopefully I can train more often.  I was watching the show Glory on HBO this morning. It's basically about the first black infantry regiment that was formed during the American Civil War (North vs South). I realised a lot of things that our current NSF are taking for granted. Back then, they were despised so they weren't issue guns, uniforms and weapons for training till much much later. Now, the moment we enter BMT, we get our standard issue items almost immediately. Each one of us just put on the uniform like any piece of clothing. Some don't even bother to make themselves neat and tidy in uniform. Just 2 days back, I was on the morning MRT to camp and I saw a PTE wearing his no. 4 camo uniform but instead of having his boots on, he had his PT shoes! He looked like a stupid clown. It was a disgrace to the uniform and himself. Naturally he looks like he might've gotten some medical excuse for his foot so he needn't put on boots. But c'mon man, everyone know that you can't wear this outside of camp regardless of medical excuse. He should jolly well change out of his uniform and slipped into more comfortable footwear instead. I was really pissed when I saw it. Really. Felt like asking him which unit he belonged to and lodging a formal complaint thru Mindef. But I also thought, this is prob one of those psycho people in NS who has the wierdest thinking. Signing extra duties will hardly change them. It'll only make them more resentful of their NS life.  The black soldiers trained in their normal shoes (for those who had them) until their foot were cuts and badly bruised. When the South heard that the North were recruiting slaves into service, they passed a law saying any black soldier in uniform who got caught will be punished and the commander, put to death. This was something like psychological warfare to stop the blacks from enlisting. The Commander was expecting most of the current no. of blacks in camp to leave service but not one of them did. How many NSF today have the kind of, or even any, commitment to country? They only see it more as what NS can give to them rather than vice versa. Didn't John F. Kennedy say the famous words "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for you country." These are just empty shells to the average Singaporean. When push comes to shove, not many will choose to stay on by choice. It's quite heartbreaking really.

      It's another duty day in camp. I've been really bored but I used most part of the afternoon surfing around and checking out Aikido sites. I realised it's been a long while that I had been reading in on forums and articles. As I surfed on, I found many articles of interest. Some of which beared some relevance to thoughts and misgivings I have about attempting the coming grading next month. I've been feeling indecisive about whether to attempt it. Most part of me feels that I shouldn't.  I came across some articles at AikiWeb and I began trying to evaluate _my_'fear' or unwillingness to attempt a grading. It dawned on me that at 6th kyu grade, I do feel a 'wanting' to attain 5th kyu. But I feel pretty often that I am unable to handle, execute and receive techniques. It could be due to this lack of confidence, but a lack of confidence to do what? To pass my grading? No, because if Sensei would allow me to register for it, it probably means that I have met the standard to take and pass the grading (how well I perform on the day itself is another matter). It may be the confidence to live up to the next level of performance. I do feel more confident just practicing with juniors and peers and I may be trying to avoid facing the challenge of the next level. It sounds very much like I'm avoiding what I'm not good at instead of facing up to it and trying to overcome it instead. I think I feel a bit apprehensive of facing the responsibility of holding the next grade as well. Such that if I do a technique worse than a more junior grade, I won't feel good about myself. That sounds very much like a struggle on ego. All because I do not feel good appearing like a substandard Aikidoka of the grade I am holding.  It shouldn't be that case. An uncle once told me something which I interpreted as 'Do not let the success of others intimidate / demoralise us. We should, instead, use their success to inspire ourselves onwards.' I've remembered the meaning conveyed in many instances and I thought I did as well in my Aikido training, but I realise now that it might not have been so.  Enlightenment: I will never be the good Aikidoka I hope to be wherever and however I train, but it should not stop me from trying to be.  I will always be a substandard Aikidoka of the grade I'm holding, but as soon as I become the substandard Aikidoka of the next grade, it makes me a better Aikidoka which I've been at the previous grade. To put the arguement into a more personal context; I'm proud to be a substandard 6th kyu. When I become a substandard 5th kyu, it means I am an improved substandard 6th kyu and I should be glad about having improved. Rather than compare my current standard of Aikido with others, I should be trying to attain the level of Aikido the better ones are practicing. 'Looking bad' itself is a great lesson on humility on the mat.  We should not let our current state hold ourselves back from the next.

      Argh caught Matrix tonight. Seriously man, I really felt that each epsiode seems to be getting worse. I didn't find it special anymore. And so many people had to die in this episode. Instead, the extras don't seem to be really dying ... duuh.  Before the show, I visited Ajisen Ramen for the first time. Spent about $15 for dinner there but it was pretty nice and filling too. Mmmmm....

      Today's Aikido at BVCC was nice and enjoyable. Came a wee bit late during/after warmups coz I had to hold the fort at home while waiting for our new fridge to be delivered. By the way, the old one konked out on us yesterday. Had a hard time clearing some of the food. Let's just say I went to bed a bit heavier and feeling satisfied.  Wasn't the only one to be abit late. Tommy and Cody came while I was changing. We did shomenuchi ikkyo, iriminage and I'm sure there's something else that I just can't remember right now. The second half was a lot of suwari-waza. nikkyo and sankyo. Felt a bit more balanced than lasttime. But still had a lot of problems. It's weird though, I never used to feel that suwariwaaza was fun, but I did today. Maybe things just felt they were in place... dunnoz. We kinda ended with kaitennage (and of course kokyu ho). Again, my kokyuho felt really crappy. All in all, it's been fun. Looking forward to Thurs's class at Siglap.  Oh yea, got home just in time to see the new fridge. Wooo...

      Had a bit of bad news from UK yesterday early morning. Apparently 1 of my old housemate has broken up with my friend (one of the Navy regulars). Sigh, it was totally unexpected. Think she's feeling damn bad about it now. Can't say I dun totally understand how it happened but I still felt really sad.  As 2 of my ex-housemates are still staying together in UK now, I kinda had a quick chat with the other girl to see if she could help talk to her. Apparently things haven't been exactly great between these 2 girls as they've been drifting apart since last year ever since one of them got into the relationship with my friend. (Hope it's not getting too confusing at this stage coz now I'm talking about the 2 girls and there's nothing to do with my Navy friend.) Somehow as we talked, I made the other girl felt like she wasn't putting enough effort into trying to make their friendship work.  But contrary to this I only said the things I said because she was always the stronger one, more sensible and with a more open heart. I think I must've really made her feel like I wasn't supportive/was laying some kind of blame on her because she sounds kinda upset even today. I feel so bad now and I've tried desperately to explain to her what and why I said. I'm really at a loss now coz I wouldn't want to lose this really good friend.  This has really spoilt my day because now I can't keep this out of my mind. Plus I'm really scared that this incident might've scarred this friendship bad enough to bring it down a level, something that I'm really afraid of but feel so helpless to be able to rectify because of the fact that we're on separate continents. I may be scaring myself unnecessarily but the more I think about it, the more I feel that's the case it is now. I'm really feeling down in the dumps and disspirited.

      OK and update on the situation. Somehow things kinda died down. The bunk didn't get any extras over the whole bunk deal. But turns out the 'suspectee' (??) went to see RSM about some things and it didn't turn very pleasant. Heard he was complaining and commenting about making complaints to MP, etc. Goodness man, seriously don't know how NSFs think these days. I'm pretty disturbed byt what I would kinda describe as 'mental' cases serving NS. Even one particular clerk in my unit has the weirdest way of thinking about responsibility. People who took a lot of MCs means there's a requirement for him to dig out their dockets and file in medical paperwork. For people who don't take too many MCs often, he feels that because he doesn't touch their dockets too often, hence when it turns out some document went missing, it's these people's fault and not his fault for losing the documents. ??? How on earth is that logical? ANd he has the nerve to say things like "I could've complained to my psychologist, who happens to be an MP, and these people will get into trouble." Oh c'mon man, I've not heard a more ridiculous logic. If an MP is willing to carry this case forward, I'd classify him/her as another nutcase.  These 2 guys are harmless really. It's just the way their thought process works that's really disturbing. It's not that I'm unsympathetic to some of their cases, but I find it increasingly frustrating to try to talk to them. Most of them are in a world of their own. Whenever I speak to them, they can hear me but they don't really listen. And I do worry for them like how they're going to cope after they ORD. The world outside is not as forgiving or sympathetic as the SAF.  Well I've been sick the past 2 and a half days. Still went for Aikido on Thurs and it felt really good. Somehow I just didn't feel as sick after that. Going to camp was kinda difficult as the medicine made me drowsy pretty often.  Realised the Singapore Marathon is drawing closer and I still haven't clocked up enough distance to feel ready for the run. Now that I'm sick, I'm not sure I'll get enough traiing inside to be ready in time.  Eileen, also just reminded that grading is drawing near. But no preassure on that. I feel so happy training that I just want to continue attending lessons rather than go take the test.  Oh yea, I'm still eagerly waiting for some kinda response from the Police Force. Dec is dragging really close now. ORD loh.

      Gotta post this in a separate blog instead of updating the previous one.  The whole bunk went into the RSM's office to get to the bottom of the matter. Apparently some people have their suspicions of who the culprit really was. There wasn't anything said outright but a lot of indirect talknig behind the back has been going on for awhile. RSM explained the seriousness of the situation and the procedures of how he would handle the matter.  One particular guy had a lot to argue back. I think he feels really indignant about the whole deal. He feels very strongly that he is annocent and that he should be allowed to go for his evening class. Of course lah, I think a confinement is a small issue which we can / should handle ourselves within our unit. No point making the whole mess blow up to even the SAF Counselling hotline or watever. Sigh, NSF these days are having so good life in camp that a little bit of regimental punishment makes them feel like a huge injustice has been brought to bear upon them. I have no idea whether he is innocent/guilty because of his response. But what surprised me was another storeman standing out to take responsibility for the offence. He gave ambiguous facts about his motive and events which led to him playing such a prank. But I don't think he was the real culprit. I think he was just saving everyone the trouble of a confinement and having the matter closed. A brave lad if I do say so myself. But RSM has no choice but to take into consideration about what he had said. Tonight he has released everyone and he will come to a decision tomorrow instead about hsi next course of action.  After we were dismissed for a few minutes before we reconvened, I did a bit of explaining to this storeman. If the real culprit gets caught and it turns out that he had lied about being the real culprit, he might be charged for lying in the SAF. (This can happen if RSM finds that he doesn't like being lied to, or if the RSM decides to make an example of him to show that anyone who tries to 'help' others by taking the rap for an offence, that this may be one of the outcome.) Especially pointless since this guy has plans to further his studies after his NS. It would be bad if he gets some kind of blemish on his record over this matter, especially when he's not the culprit.  After our 2nd meeting, he asked to speak to RSM privately. I have no idea what it's all about or what's the outcome of the matter. But I think there'll be some decision tomorrow morning.

      Sianz ... today I'm on duty and some shit thing happened. My whole bunk got indefinite confinement from today onwards.  A storeman in my bunk got his locker locked up by some unknown bugger. This storeman went to complain to the RSM who asked for the culprit to own up. When nobody did, he decided to confine our whole bunk until the culprit surrenders himself. Goodness. Being the duty spec today I'll have to stay in anyway but I'm wondering if it drages on till Thurs, how can I go for training at Siglap. And what's going to happen if it drags on till Sun? How am I suppose to go for Japanese class.  I can only hope for RSM to change his mind within the next 2 days or that the culprit will own up soon instead of dragging down the other guys. That's regimental life for you.  What a malicious and brainless prank to pull while you're still in the Army. Good gawd...

      ~@##^%^#$!@ Had a really heated argument at home today.  An account of the issue: Mom made lunch and left her portion to cool on the table. I finished up mine. She distinctly told me that's hers. After awhile, my dad came down and asked if the plate was his. I have no idea why but I somehow felt that my mom had finished her share and the portion on the table was his, so I said she'd eaten and he went on to finish the food. His share was actually still in the pot. Halfway thru the 2nd serving (the one from the pot) my mom came down and made a helluva ruckus about the whole thing (her share being eaten). My dad gave her what was left. She just kept on yelling (high pitched and irritating volume) about the whole thing and kept poking (not physically) my dad. He of course yelled back. I also joined in the yelling and I actually got so heated up I called her a b***h. Fact was, more than 1 profanity was flying around the house not just from me (though I don't think my mom said any).  Went upstairs to prepare for my Japanese class later. And my dad came up to scold me that no matter what she was still my mom and that I shouldn't have behaved that way. Bottomline: I call 'em as I see 'em. Not denying my fault in the matter, made the mistake of telling my dad my mom had eaten and being rude to both of them. But to me, that was the only way I managed to get my mom's attention and to stop. My dad, being a sensitive man will probably keep harping on the issue even after me and my mom had forgotten about it.  Conclusion: Think we were all in the wrong somway or the other. I can't say who made a more serious mistake than who, but I can only say I felt like shit after my behaviour (though I didn't show it to them). But guilty or not, I can't say there's a solution to how they should be spoken to. Mom is in her own world and points take 3x the effort to get to her (if it even goes in at all). Father is in a world of his own too and talks in circles (he may have his reasons for doing things but the way he does things hardly works out. He is so keen on pointing out things to others he overlooks his own problems).  Course of Action and the rationale behind it: Made a point very clear to me in my head, I'm not going to let them affect me anymore in this way. From today onwards, I'm going to switch off my frequency to them. There's no point in communicating when noone knows how to. Plus I'm no longer bothered about whether we do or not. My friend, Neo, said what will my kids pick up from the way I treat them. I only told him I'm not condoning what I'm doing. But with my kids, I'm going to teach 'em another way. If what and how I teach to the next generation don't work, I'll accept my failure in this area and I will live with whatever the consequence maybe then. It's a set of double standards I guess, I won't stop trying with my kids, but I've absolutely given up on my parents. They may have brought me up, but I'm still going to take care of them in future as best I can, just don't expect too many words to be coming out from me anymore.  There you have it folks. The true scenario at home. It's been like this for the past few years. If anyone has anything enlightening to share, please do. But I doubt there's anything that can be said to change my course of action anymore.  Going off for class now.

      Recently joined this really interesting thing online called  urlLink Friendster . How it works is that you'd need to first register as a member (free). Using email and/or names, members get to search and add their friends into a personal network. Once added, you can view your friends' friends and so on. The interesting is that sometimes you'd realise a lot of you actually have a friend in common. What's unique about this system compared to ICQ/MSN/Yahoo messengers system is that you get to see how other people are linked to you. Eg. Me -> Person A -> Person B -> New Friend.  Feeling a bit out of sorts today. I think it was because of doing Guard duty on the last day of the month. It doesn't feel like it's my last duty for Oct because coming week I'll have another duty soon. In fact for this month, I had a really hard time planning out duties for the Bde again. It's so hard to be fair because there's just way too many things I needed to take note of when planning. It's getting so tedious and yet I dare not really slack too much on this as it will make a lot of people's life miserable if things weren't planned out properly.  I'm looking forward to the last day of Nov as that's approximately the day of my last duty again. But that's also my last duty for my NS. Wheee!!!

      Saw Return of the King yesterday. Was good but I would've expected things to be much better. Think it was still good. Now I'm really tempted to read the book and getting the extended / Director's cut on DVD and watching all 3 shows again.  Was feeling lazy on Mon and didn't go for Aikido thinking I could go on Tues instead. But lastnight I was out with my cousin (after the movie) and so I missed practice again. Haiz ... must be getting a bit lazy these days.  Found out today that my dad's Pacnet is on a 1 yr contract and we have to pay about $300+ if we wanted to cancel it. WTF! And to think I had asked him whether we were on a contract or not. He nonchalently replied no, making everything sound as though we had the better end of the deal. Oh goodness, I can't even upgrade the plan to broadband according to Pacnet. Argh ... feel like puking blood. Now the 2nd alternative would to maintain the co. a/c, and cancel the pte a/c instead and replacing that with SCV's connection. But why on earth would we need 2 unlimited a/c?   ... looks like no broadband/cable for the next 10 mths at least. Might have to discuss with my sis to see if she's willing to pay the extra. But then again, we'll still need to setup our own wireless network and the equipment seems like it's gonna cost us a onetime amunt of $500 or so, excluding subscription plans. ARGH!!! This is so irritating.

      Uneventful day today. Sorted out my photos which I had taken in UK on my trips and graduation. Took me till the night. Besides ordering them and deciding which ones to develop extras, I started putting some of them into the new album I bought yesterday. Halfway through, I remembered that I had yet to scan in all of them. Hmmm ... it's too many for me to finish one shot. Oh man, sometimes maybe a digital camera is the better alternative afterall. At least I can just copy into my hdd straightaway.  Shouming (cousin) has already found a job with NCS. Mom was nagging me again today about getting a job. Also told her I didn't get shortlisted for the police. That kinda got her going again... nag nag nag nag nag. Oh please, it's not like I'm not looking for jobs. She just like to build up everything based on assumptions. Well, let her assume then ... I just want to be left alone. Preferably with zero interaction. Told my dad I'll find and take whatever comes along first, but I'll still reapply for SPF coming Feb. He asked if I really had to insist on the SPF. I said, it was my interest and we kinda left it at that. I'm getting a lot of grief from them these days. I also don't want them to have the excuse to try to psycho me out of applying for the SPF. Trying hard to not let what they say affect my decision. Naturally I recognise the need to get a temp job first. I also don't want to lobo around to be nagged at for the next few months to a year. Prob find something / anything that comes along. Even if it's a perm job I'll still take it. Just in case SPF rejects me again, at least I can fall back on this and continue on while waiting for the next application date. I guess that's the tentative plan I have now.  Will sort out all resumes, CV and copies of result slips first. Apply whatever comes along. While awaiting for reply, will need sort out the littel details at home, clean up my room, clear the junk. If time permits, think wef 2004 I can attempt volunteering at the SPCA on weekends/Sun. OK, got a plan in order now, time to put into action.

      Lastnight's dinner at RSM's place was OK. Our Ops WO actually had a bit too much to drink and was being all rowdy when we left. Haiz ... not the first time I've seen / heard of this. A bit too much sometimes.  This morning I called up the SPF. Had some disappointing news lor. The lady on the line said that they'd already replied to shortlisted candidates. If I've not gotten anything it means that I'd not been shortlisted. I was really keen to enter this batch of intake because it's in Mar 04. 9mths of training will end around Dec 04. Anyway, I asked for the next intake which is in Jun/Jul. Recreuitment will start as early as Feb. Looks like I have a good 2 mths before my next application and 6 mths or so to the intake date if I'm successful. Hope things will work out fine this time.  In the meantime, I'm going to have to take up another job first. Hmm ... I wonder what's available and suitable...  Today's Aikido at BB East was pleasant. Didn't feel like I absorbed a lot a lot though. Ah Hee Sensei was there as well. At the end, paired with  urlLink Eileen  again for kokyuho. ARGH!!!... again I can't grasp what I'm doing wrong. I can feel my upper arms getting tired so I was using strength instead of actually doing it the right way. Still, can't get my iriminage to work properly though, but I tried the 'keep your' hands in front' thing and it kinda helped a bit.

      Yesterday evening, my family all went over to my aunts' and uncles' place for dinner. It was quite nice but my appetite wasn't particularly good. Maybe coz of the cough I've been having. Haven't seen my cousins for ages. 1 went to study in Canada, heard she's doing pretty well. Haha, apparently she had some moles removed. Haiz ... charbors ... Haha but it was nice seeing long-lost cousins again though. Another was finishing her final year in NUS. She brought her boyfriend along. Quiet guy and quite cham coz he was pratically in one corner and not many of us were talking to him. Heh... I was too busy sleeping to be bothered with the others. But her 14 yr old brother!! Good gawd! Haven't seen him for a few years and he's already 1.8+m tall!! Pengz ... I wanna kill myself liao. Now I know where did all the tall genes go in my dad's side of the family?! Oh, can't blame me for falling asleep there. They were playing one of their church service ... but it was in Hokkien and the pastor had a Cantonese translator   ... Hey, but at least I did manage to understand the gist of everything. Anyway, I also didn't mean to fall asleep there. It just ... sorta ... happened. Haha ... the cushions I was lying on felt soooo comfy ... zzzzz  My aunt's side of the family also invited some relatives. Their daughter is currently doing her degree in Manchester. Heh ... good lah, heard she was quite havoc in S'pore a few years back. Hopefully mellowed down a  bit by now. But one thing that struck me, they seem to have the mentality that overseas is much better than Singapore. I dunno, I think it's a real misconception lor. I've always encouraged people to broaden their horizons but ultimately I'd always say we have to come on back here. I dislike the notion of people going abroad and deciding not to come back. This excludes longterm overseas attachments of course. Just so long as you are aware of where your roots really lie. Of course some people will always argue that it's the local government's fault for not being able to retain local talants. No doubt a certain extent of this maybe true. But this brings to mind one thing I read from the newspaper recently. I can't remember what the topic was about but this Minister was saying something like Singaporeans have got to grow up. They should not expect too many handouts from the government. Absolutely true. I think we've had too comfy a life here soemtimes that we start to complain once things get a little tough. Sometimes I pity the government for what they have to put up with. I wonder,  rather than taking the easy way out why not make a difference by coming back here. Obviously most people will always say the local environment is not conducive for them to make the kinda of changes, be it in a legislative or a political stand. But if you decide to 'go along', what else is there to complain? Most just want the best of both world, no restictions to do what they want and an environment where they can make the easy changes they want.  Anyway, I was happily announcing to everyone of my ORD status hahaha... CPL (NS) Tan :P Almost everyone was asking me about what were my plans now. Think I only briefly mentioned Police Force to one uncle and aunt. Dunnoz ... dun wanna say too much until something more concrete appears. Haha will they get a shock if I really do enter the service.  I spent the whole day at home today. Finally digitised all footages of UK and Aikido into my computer. But I didn't burn them in CD yet. I've practically used up ALL my harddisk for this. 60Gb of space originally, now I have 3Gb left. But I'm not too worried lah, after I burn them into CD, I can free up the space.  OK I've decided to call the SPF tomorrow to find out if my application has been processed or rejected. Justin was right, have to bug them like siao to get a reply rather than let them drag my time. At least I'll know when I can send a second application in again. But seriously man, hope there's some form of good news soon.  Tomorrow evening I've been invited to my RSM's home for dinner with some of the regulars and Neo. Neo kept psychoing me to buy a gift and all that. So troublesome. I went to my dad's display case to pick an unopened red wine to just give to him. Afterall they don't really drink. I got no idea why my dad used to buy so much wine... duh. probably get it wrapped up later tonight. Nothing much on tele tonight either. If I'm like really bored, I'll probably start converting stuff to CDs.  I know X'mas is almost over but I just wanna wish everyone a Merry X'mas, season's greetings and  Happy New Year.

      HWAAAHHH .... I had the greatest lesson lastnight at BB East. Really forgotten how good Alvin teaches. He was also pretty vocal and his points were so specific. Yesterday he went through a bit of how uke should fall from kotegaeshi. Personally, I 'm never really good with taking slams unless nage is able to guide me down properly (think Syed tried one on me about 2 yrs ago). Maybe that's one point Alvin had noted during grading, that once we were into the thick of things, slams and footwork seemed to go all haywire. He went through the motion of how iriminage works and footwork. Seriously man, he just turn turn turn with such ease. Came back to try but I still felt a bit cuckoo just turning 3 times, let alone more.  Alvin also emphasised a lot on on feeling and leading the uke, keeping your hands in your center during iriminage, something I've NEVER been able to do properly and still maintain posture.  Paired up with 2 beginners who had taken their 6th kyu at the Sun grading. After that managed to pair with 'Daniel' o_O" ... for nikkyo somemore. A bit stressed sia, didn't wanna cause him too much pain so I went ultra slow and I didn't really dare to 'experiment'  too much, hyuk hyuk hyuk. The experience wasn't as bad as I might've expected and he was quite grateful too, kept saying thank you. But he was constantly asking about how to do this and that. Told him I didn't know that much either so couldn't answer him too much and just have to try and 'see'. After that paired up with a sec sch kid I think? I'm just guessing coz he seemed too big/tall to be in Pri sch and he had highlighted his hair a wee bit too much to be accepted for a pri sch I think. Then again these days, kids seem to dunno eat what one, they just grow at such a fightening rate. We experimented a bit more on the techniques we did.  While waiting for the bus home, Alvin trotted along. His student, a Japanese lady, was with him. She came down to have a look at our training it seems. Found out that Alvin was NIE trained, went into the govt sector, 'couldn't stand it' (in his own words  ) so he left and entered the pte sector instead. Since 97 he's been teaching Eng with a pte school. Most students are foreign nationals here in Singapore, like the Japanese lady, trying to master the Eng language or preparing to take some proficiency test. (Alvin mentioned TOEFL/TOEFEL, forgot the spelling liao since poly. :P)  Oh yar, saw Tommy and Karen there too. Hwah, everyone seems to be running all over for training these days.  Shitz man ... all in all I had such a wonderful time there and the other dojos I seriously dunno how I can train under Sensei, Sunny, Syed, Alvin unless I do it like 4 days a week which is financially impossible. Haiz ... need to be really specific about my choice of dojo liao. But once I enter SPF I got no choice but to train BB East coz there's Weds nights off and book out on Sats ... BUT IT WON"T BE ALVIN TEACHING!!! .... argh   ... And coz of my appointment, I'll be missing the end of mth combined training at BVCC tonight too. ARGH...

      Took my grading this afternoon. Felt really good but realised that I started getting a little bit too excited because I began rushing into things once I was uke and got thrown all over. No idea is it because of the adrenaline rush or the disorientation. Sensei's comment was 'slightly better than fair', which seemed to mean average I think. But nevermind, I've noted some points I should improve on. Free practice for one should be smoother and I should try to keep my ukes in front  of me (like ALL THE TIME ... heeeello, duh). I used really limited techniques during free practice so I need to practice using a broader range. My nikkyo and shihonage still need some work. There was once, as uke, I used shomenuchi instead of yokomenuchi. Somehow I kinda heard wrongly. I was a little puzzled how come my partner used techniques which seemed more suited for yokomenuchi instead. I'm not sure if I managed to change back to the correct strike in between though. My footwork during free practice wasn't as sure or precise as it should have been. For one thing my kaitennages didn't feel like it used to be during usual classes. Free practice, I forgot most of the kokyunages that I usually did in class. Got no idea why. Even the way of just tenkan and turning to throw was lost on me... duh.  It was a really small crowd compared to any previous gradings I've seen. Which was good, I thought. There were a lot of things I noted. There was this malay guy who maintained a continuity during his free practice. He made sure his ukes were always in view most of the time and he never stopped. My partner had strong and better techniques, I thought. At least I could feel like he was actually doing something to me. I also noted one small point about myself from pairing up with him. I didn't maintain as much close contact as I would have hoped in order to execute the technique or taking ukemi. Those would be the times when I felt like I was doing something weird or falling wrongly.  Hmm ... after this, there's a lot I would like to work on. For one thing it'd be intent during atemi. Sensei was saying we're too relaxed sometimes. Footwork and posture not just during pair work but especially so during free practice. And taking slams :P All in all, I'm glad it's over. I'm satisfied with the day's training.  I just remembered, should I be submitting my grading card for Sensei's signature?

      Heard from  urlLink Eileen  that there's gonna be just a total of about 20 students due for grading today. Quite a small no. Dunno whether that's a good or a bad thing either. Woke up this morning with less of a fever but a bit of sorethroat. Seriously hope I feel up to grading later.   urlLink Ruth  seems like she's considering stopping blogging because she's worried about what some people might find out / read from the blog. I was kinda worried about this when I first started too. But I soon realised that it's simply a way of self expression. It helps me to self-reflect the mood captured when I'm blogging. Sometimes I'd realise I've been a pompous stick-in-the-mud and a real jackass, but I also learned that so long as I behave according to how I've blogged and vice versa, that my actions do not contradict my thoughts captured during my blog and vice versa, there's really no issue. Nobody can pop on by and influence me to 'shut down' my blog. Because if they are not able to accept what's been said, they can either email me or post their own comments. After blogging doesn't mean everything (my attitude and mindset is final), somewhere along the line I may still change my perception and my stand accordingly if I'm convinced that I should. Sometimes we need to place past events under the light and re-evaluate them again for the sake of self-reflection and growth lah I suppose.

      Finally got my pink IC. Can officially call myself CPL (NS) Tan now. Spent the morning trying to settle on a draft for my testimonial. Got my RSM to vet through it and got my S3 to sign it. Took me a long time and I felt so tired when I left camp. Must've caught a cold entering / leaving aircon offices and the weather's been all hot and cold in the late morning / early afternoon. Was so tired on the MRT and bus journey home I was practically asleep 95% of the time. Wasted leh, there was this really adorable kid standing in front of me in the MRT with his mom, aunt and sis I think. I was kinda awakened by him and he kept staring at me with a bewildered look as I slept. Imagine, me just waking up with a sleepy look on my face with this little boy staring at me all the while and poking my lap now and then. Well, maybe not quiet a poke coz the MRT was really cramped but it sure woke me up. Haha ... really adorable fella. The cute type you can just pinch his cheeks and just go "So cuuuuuuute."  Was suppose to go for the Combined Training this evening. But when I got home I felt so sick that I decided to grab a nap first. Slept right past training hours and even dinner time. I guess it wasn't exactly a bad thing either because I really felt refreshed after the sleep and my mind is a lot clearer. I'd really hate to be too sick to take my grading this Sun. Anyway I hope everyone else there will be enjoying their session. I really really wanted to at least take a look but the weather wasn't very forgiving either. There was qutie a heavy downpour then as well and I felt even colder than usual. Better go for water parade within the next few hours.  Neo has been bugging me for the web address of the 302 that had messaged me. Kept on and on about it it's starting to be irritating. But of course lah, I know he don't really mean anything. Anyway, I'm just kinda let the matter rest and forget about it. Got a long week ahead and lots to clear up before the year ends. Tomorrow I promised my mum to stay home and do some spring cleaning. Might as well stay home instead since grading's on Sun.  Oh had to point out something today. This Robin kept harping on and on about running every weekend at ECP. I said it's a great idea but I can't for this week. He just had to try and convince me again and again. I got a bit impatient and I had to sms him back telling him to just start learning how to take 'NO' for an answer. Didn't sound rude, but I made sure I expressed my opinion really firmly. Think he took the hint, but still messaged me back saying he's going to make it a point to train every week and aim for the full marathon in 2004. Didn't reply his final sms but I was thinking, it's of course good that he has goals like that. But setting too much too soon won't get anyone anywhere (reminds me of me intensifying my Aikido training lasttime too). I personally would love to be able to participate too but I would probably want to be able to complete the half marathon at a better timing and more effortlessly than I do now before even attempting it. I mean, it's not like I can complete 21km that fast now either. Anyway, I respect his decision and I don't want to have the I-know-it-all-or-better-than-you attitude when I talk to him.

      Tonight's Aikido at Siglap was really nice. We did a few katate dori gyaku hamni nikyo which kinda stretched my right wrist a bit. But luckily after practice my wrist still feel fine so Iguess the discomfort was only momentary. There were 2 new white belts as well. They were pretty friendly guys but I'm not very sure how old they are or what do they do. They were quite chatty amongst the 2 of themselves but still pleasant when training with them. Felt that they kept an open mind during class so they were quite receptive about everything in general.  I'll be attending the combined training at Tanglin CC tomorrow with Ueshiba Aikido. Like Sensei had said, 'it's been too luxirious for us' because we're so used to having so much space in training that we fall all over the mat space available. Training in a cramped and crowded environment wll help build an awareness during ukemi (and not kill someone by landing on top of them), as well as more control over how and where we're falling.

      OK been looking through my blog and all that recently and I realised 1 thing. My English has been going down the drain. It's been happening since my Poly days. Not a good sign. So much so that it sometimes affect my speech, most probably in a grammatical sense.  Sigh ... 1 more new year resolution.

      Came back from duty yesterday. Felt really tired coz I kept myself awake waiting from an overseas call from my friend. Turns out she wasn't free to call yesterday. Well, that's fine, but I knocked out almost immediately at 11+. Took me awhile to hear the phone ring and answer it. Turns out it was my S3 (he's my Major to  urlLink you non-military people   ) calling up for something. Anyway, today must be the day I purposely skipped my Jap class just to nap at home (notwithstanding last Sun coz of the marathon) and I'm aware that I'll have to skip coming Sun's class for the grading too. That means I have only one lesson left. Doubt I'll continue the class coz I want to finish my ePrep online courses for the next 3 mths before I do anything. Think it's a good time for me to attempt to fix in some volunteer work at the SPCA as well. Will see how things goes.  About coming grading. I don't feel prepared. I probably know the syllabus, but I think I need some more refresher on them this week.  And this Thurs... ORD loh! Haha... Got to remember to go get some food to treat the guys when I go back.  Just got a message on Friendster from someone in camp who's in a different unit from me. He's gay and I'm a bit uncomfortable of being told that I'm 'cute'. But I've seen the guy before in camp and he seems friendly+harmless enough. How did I deduce his 'gayness'? His profile lor, he says he is 'Gay + Dull + Stubborn + Persistent + Sensitive + Introverted + Friendly + Loving' and in the 'Who I Want to Meet' section was, 'Non homophobic people'. So I messaged back saying I don't want to sound presumptous but whether he was one. He said yea and he's kinda trying to hit on me. Don't mean to make this sound like a joke but I think he's just being friendly. Hmmm ... my first 'gay' contact online. Think the first time I actually came across gay was my first day of NS in Nee Soon. Do  urlLink you  remember? The 2 storemen issuing out equipment were all 302s (military classification for gays). Anyway, told him I'm probably ok talking to one but I'm totally straight. Hope that's the end of it.

      Been overly 'hecticated' (ar ha! learnt this new term from my fren in UK.) these 2 days so wasn't able to blog. Well yesterday was a bad and good day for me.  Was supposed to meet Robin (sec sch friend) for lunch then maybe go around Orchard for a bit before we went down to Siglap. He said he wanted to take a look at Aikido. Was all ready to leave when my dad popped over with a problem. Something was wrong with his PC. I got no idea what he did or what happened (but I dare say it's almost always the user's fault 95% of the time), but the PC somehow kept showing fuzziness and discoloring on the monitor. It just refused to go away. Was actually thinking of leaving since I already made an appointment, but then realised that I won't be back until after Aikido (which means I can only work on it about 11+ after a shower). Haiz, decided to try to fix it then. To my horror, the damn thing just got worse when I restarted it. It just kept on rebooting and never got into windows. Couldn't even enter safe mode. Was seriously pissed coz while working on it my dad was in the background mubming and grumbling away, about why I never set his emails on my side so when his PC is down he can fallback and use my PC instead. Goodness lor! Gimme a break lah. His emails are downloaded from server into his hdd lor, even with an internet connection on my side he also can't view his old mails what. Fish lah! Tried very hard to solve the stupid problem. Manage to find out that the hdd is not faulty (whew...) so I transfered his emails to my PC so he can at least access his mails while I'm away. Throught the 4-5 hrs I was working on this, I let Robin know about what I'm doin so he can at least carry on with whatever he wants to first. He said since he was already in Orchard, he'll hang around in the library and hopefully we can have dinner later. This was a bit preassurising lah, coz I wasn't sure how long I'm gonna take and I just had to rush to do what I can with the PC. Anyway I short circuited my external HDD casing in the process. Was seriously pissed with myself too. Used to bea ble to use this rack and shift it between different systems via a USB connection. Now I need to open up the whole PC and plug it in instead. ARGH!!!!  Anyway, I was almost done when  urlLink you  smsed me about Sensei going down to BVCC instead. By this time it was raining quite badly for awhile already. Anyway, my dad did me a favour by dropping me part of the way where I avoided the rain and to grab a bus down. Originally arranged to meet Robin at Heeren, but didn't know exactly where we were meeting. I waited at the bus stop for awhile before walking over to Taka. Called him continously and smsed him for 30-40 mins and didn't get a reply (Robin, if you're reading this I have to tell you man, this is something typical of you. Better change ar!) I called until his hp actually went flat. At this stage I was seriously exasperated because I had to way fo reaching him and I kinda lost the mood to even go for Aikido. Gave him a final sms saying that I'm going home. On the way to the busstop, I got a call from him. We arranged again to meet at Orchard MRT control station immediately. Apparently, this bugger kept his handphone on silent mode!! ^%$#%!!! Was seriously pekchek man but I figured things weren't totally his fault coz I kinda made him wait all afternoon alone anyway. Haiz ... For both our benefit, I decided to goto BVCC instead of Siglap for the evening to train. Wasn't in quite the mood to travel long distance to Tanah Merah at that point.  We grabbed a bus to Holland V and had dinner at BK. After that we went over to BVCC. Aikido was great lor! It was the first time I was in Sunny's class. Very good. He was very vocal and kept coming up with a lot of points for us to note. Like  urlLink you  said his movements were really something. So relaxed, smooth and natural. I felt like a cuckoo when I was practicing lor. He kept emphasising being serious to my group (Edwin and another guy) coz I think they were joking a little bit too much/loud enough to get noticed. Heh ... well it was still enjoyable. I just didn't manage to accomplish tho. Ended the evening with kokyuho with  urlLink Ms Ng  there, ar I still dun get it lor. Sometimes can, most often can't. Seems like every 6th kyu-er and above I came across are able to do it leh. Haiz ...  Anyway like  urlLink you  noted, Robin was sitting outside even tho he was actually here to 'take a look'. I know him long enough to just leave him to do what he wants even if I think some of his actions might be a bit weird. He has his reasons for his actions I suppose, I'm just not able to agree with his rationale sometimes. Anyway, I used to be very judgemental of him in sec sch. In fact a group of us kinda gave him a hard time then coz he was quite 'different'. I've kinda grown out of it liao, think it just comes down to respecting what he wants to do. Anyway, most of his actions dun quite affect me so that's fine by me.  Well that's yesterday, but today I spent the whole day testing the PC and fixing it. Managed to find out that the graphics card was faulty. Seems that the motherboard was a bit dodgy also. Anyway got the thing to work and had to reinstall windows twice, plus all relevant software. Than spent hours customising small itsy bitsy things to prevent the 'ignoramus'es in my home from meddling too much with the system and making more problems for me later. All the while my dad was again popping in and out asking me if it's ok already, what's the problem with it, why it like dat, etc etc. ARGHHH!!.... Actually had the intention to go Sim Lim get some parts, exchange some faulty CD-Rs, get some clothes from Seiyu and asking Robin to join me. But things just dragged on so long (was in front of the PC since 8am till 9pm straight) that I kinda dropped the idea. I felt too tired anyway and I have to go back camp first thing tomorrow morning for overnight duty. Well at least, I'll have 1 whole day to sleep and rest there without being bugged by PC problems. Think I'll go Sim Lim/Bugis on Mon instead. Probably ask Robin if he's interested then.  Sigh, the past 48hrs would've been sheer torture and demoralising if not for those few hrs of Aikido at BVCC...

      Today has been a nice day again.  Been home all day until the late afternoon when I had to go for my medical appointment at the Eye Ctr again. Dr said my eye was healing and I can reduce the medication to 2x a day now for the next 2 wks. My next appointment will be in Feb 04. Heh think he'll be discussing my options of wearing contacts and some kinda of counselling on how to maintain my contacts. Haiz ... troublesome but no choice. Forgot to remind Sensei he should change his contacts more often instead of wearing it for over the stipulated period, otherwise liek me like that, damn troublesome. Dad was nagging me to lay off contacts for 1 yr. See how lah, will try to not wear them for as long as I can, hopefully more than a year.  Following  urlLink your  post, I didn't think that Daniel was ultra weird or anything when I saw him today. I suspect he might've mellowed down a bit since last week. One good thing tho, despite having experienced 'unpleasantness' he's still willing to come back and continue training. Of course lah, it could be because he feels that he had already paid for 3 mths liao, or he came back expecting some kinda public apology ......... Anyway, today's Aikido at BB East was quite fun. Dunno why either, just found it really nice.  Just checked my email and found that the Half Marathon results have been  urlLink posted  online already. I should receive my cert by the 15th. The site is quite cool coz besides posting the results online, it also has a link which does some kinda analysis of the runners' performance.  Summary: I finished 498th out of 1409 participants. Finishing time is 2hr 21min 16sec. Net running time is 2hr 18min 54sec. (Like I said in my earlier post, it took me about 2min+ to get past the starting pt.) Placing in the entire field was 612th with 1270 entrants behind. About 32% of entrants ahead. Placing among the Males was 497th with 911 entrants behind. About 35% of entrants ahead. Placing in category was 368th place with 662 entrants behind. About 36% of entrants ahead.  Split Times (whatever this means??): 10min 36sec per mile or 6min 35sec per km Speed: 5.7 miles per hr or 9.1km per km  I must say I'm feeling really proud of myself at how much I've improved sicne the AHM. At least now I've got a benchmark to train myself. Yesterday, just asked my friend to help me get a form for the NUS biathlon in Feb 2004. Not sure if I'll signup for it yet though.

      Right knee was hurting from the run yesterday. Read somewhere it's normal to feel sore and fatigued after a run. Not sure if I'll have any problem with Aikido tomorrow night either, but I think I'll try to train. Afterall, I'll be in the West side fixing my friend's PC in the afternoon anyway.

      Alrighty! Today was a good day I think. I remember waking up earlier around 2+ and it took me awhile before I was able to get back to sleep. Nervous and excited I guess. :P  Got up at 0415hrs, washed up and had a quick breakfast before I went out to meet the cab. It was already waiting when I left the house. Went down to Neo's (campmate) place and waited awhile before we went to the National Stadium. A lot of road closures so we alighted along Nicoll Highway instead. There was already a crowd by the time we arrived. I called Robin (sec sch mate) and we met up at the bags deposit area which was actually just a small lorry labelled A and B. Things were pretty organised and systematic because lorry A only took bags for tag IDs 4000-5200. Mine was 4440, not very auspicious lah :P. Despite the crowd, it wasn't as bad as the Sheares Bridge Run/Army Half Marathon. Today's crowd was just around 10000, but I heard that this event attracts a lot of foreign and professional marathon runners each year.  We started the run at 0600hrs. There so many people packed together at the starting line that we had to walk for 2min+ before we actually reached it. The 10, 21 and 42km runners all started at the same time, but the end point will be different. 21km will end at ECP, while the others will end at Padang (if I'm not mistaken about 10km). The first 5-6 km was nice and comfortable, but it got kinda boring the moment we hit ECP at the Fort Road junction. I had to start taking drinks at almost every drink booth fro this stage onwards to sustain myself. The first 10km was quite alright and light. All the while, we were all running at a small pace and slow speed to conserve strength and energy. Along the way there were cheering teams and drink stands which really helped the runners to push forward. I think the toughest part for me would be the last 3-4km. By then my legs were feeling fatigued, my pace was smaller and speed was slower too. Kinda entertained the thought of ending it early by walking but I kept telling myself "There'sonly slightly more than our usual 2.4km run left. I can do this!!" haha ... I think Standard Chartered will be mailing my timing to me at a later date. There's this electronic chip on loan to runners that we had to attached to our shoes. It's suppose to monitor the start and end time to provide us an accurate record of our running time. Apparently, some metal plates were placed on the ground at the start and end points to act as a trigger for these chips.  Well I did finish the run in the end, my timing seemed to be around 2hr 20min or so. This was considerably better than the 2hr 30+ min I did for AHM. But I expect there's some discrepancies because AHM used a clock to record the timings. Somewhere during the run, I lost sight of Robin and I think he went on ahead. Hope ghe got a good timing for himself. Neo was just under a minute behind me. I was surprised as he was usually a better runner than me. After the run I must have gulped down about 4 cans of Gatorade and 1 bottle of mineral water at the end point. Didn't manage to meet up with Robin as he had to go to church soon so Neo and I took a free shuttle service back to the Padang. By then the first runner had already finished the Full Marathin. It was an incredible timing of 1hr+, just under 2hrs. Oh man, by the time I finished 21km, a bunch of others had already finished 42km. Wooooo...   From here Neo met 2 of his old friends and the 4 of us made our way to the 42km finishing pt to see how everyone was doing. It was quite encouraging really to see so many people cheering. We went to grab some food at BK and changed into clean clothes. The weather today had been fantastic. Not sunny at all and neither did it rain. I think this was a very important factor during the run.  To conclude this long entry, I hope to go back for AHM 04, but I'm not sure if I'll go for the Singapore Marathon 04. Even if I do, doubt I'll sign register for it as I still think $30 is still pretty steep, considering it's an early bird price. 42km? Hmm, won't entertain the thought for a few years at least. Maybe only if I can shave down my timing to under 2hrs? Hahaha ...  How do I feel now? The mind is fresh and awake but the body is really sore. Because I'm wet through down to my shoes and toes, it kinda made my nails brittle and the skin wrinkled. Luckily the nails didn't break like it did during AHM. Some light abrasion along the ... ahem ahem ... common areas and the sole of my left foot feels bruised though it seems to be getting better just by removing the shoe. Threw away my old series SAF New Balance running shoes, which in my opinion, is a lot lighter than the new one.

      OK today was quite nice, met up with an old sec sch classmate. Went to collect my race entry pack at Pan Pacific Hotel for tomorrow morning's marathon, and had dinner with my friend. Apparently he's also interested to participate but had not been able to register before the closing date. Anyway we've arranged to meet at the luggage/bags deposits area instead.  Went straight home after that to rest and book a cab at 4:45am. Still have to pick up my friend at his home before we go down to National Stadium (start pt). At least I'll have co. for tomorrow's run.  OK. 8:30pm liao, time to sleep. Looking forward to an interesting morning...

      Was rushing to the dojo. Prior to that had to meet my friend at Tanah Merah MRT to return his jap textbook. Had loaned it last Sun to photocopy (cheap cheap :P) and die die needed to return coz he need to do the homewk. Anyway, that kinda made me late for practice.  Heh,  urlLink you  had to give us your wonderful warmup again :P But can tell lah it's not as tiring as the other time. But I still dun understand how on earth you can hold your leg up so long. I can feel my whole body quivering and straining in jus a few seconds.  Hmm ... Sensei kinda lost a bit of patience with one of the kids in class. But seriously lah, he's quite a joker. Maybe coz of his age that's why he still feel like having fun rather than train seriously. Oh but something Sensei mentioned today that stuck. He likened aikido with horce racing. Sometimes horses would run really fast but lose stamina later, some horses which look like they can't even run but start to pick up later on in the race. The latter being the good horse of course. But it's the same in Aikido too. I was recalling the time when I had really wanted to train 4-5 days before I returned to UK. But all along in my mind I was expecting to slacken down my training to just 2 days. Of course lah, commitments in NS can't be helped either but still ... (Alamak! I'm a lousy horse!)  Oh btw, I've tried and tested liao. it doesn't matter if you put 'www' in front of the address of your blogpage. I was wrong. Publishing didn't seem any faster than the other time. So pple, dun bother updating my add/link. I'll change back later.

      Aikido lastnight was quite interesting. A lof of feeling techniques. We did katate dori ai hamni ikkyo, iriminage and shihonage. Shihonage went on to some others which I can't recall the name or be sure of. Was quite tiring but fun. Dis some kotegaeshi as well.   Aching like siao this morning, still had to make myself go for my run. It's prob the last few things I can do to prep myself for the marathon this sun. Goodness, I dunno how I'm going to finish the distance. Been out of training for too long already. I've only just gotten back to getting used to a slow but more regular pace of running. But I'm not confident of getting a better timing this time round. Which reminds me, I think I better visit the website again to familarise myself with the route and procedures for the run. Still need to plan breakfast and time to meet friends on that day itself. Sigh, more liasing.  And I really have to say this, I'm STILL waiting for some kind of notice from the police force.

      Something I just found out about Blogger. It seems like it's been taking really slow to update and I might have found a reason why, Blogger seems to be updating straight to www.your-blog-ID.blogspot.com first.  What I did was update my links on my blogpage, my links on my homepage & my commenting facility (enetation). Hope this helps everyone. Oh yea, and remember to update your link to this page too :P I suspect this the reason why the no. of comments displayed don't seem to registering properly either. Updating enetation on your blog address might solve it. I'm still testing it now.

      OK 4th appointment at SNEC shows I'm on the road to recovey. Next appointment will be on 10th Dec. Oh, and they've extended my MC till then as well. Goodness, I've been on MC since 22nd Nov. Everything still looks blurry and unfocused for my right eye though. Hope it'll recover with time instead of becoming too permanent (?!).  Think I'll still go back for duty on 13th Dec. Friends have been covering for me last mth, feeling a bit guilty. Anyway it's not guard duty so should be quite light. Doubt I'll need to 'see' anything that clearly. But think parents are gonna make noise again if I go back if I'm covered by MC then.  Prob resume Aikido this Tues onwards. Time to put in more effort in my Japanese too. Realised missing one class last week made me really rusty. Had a lot of trouble remembering the vocab everyone was using. Oh well, gambatte!  Oh yar, my friend's church booked a whole cinema for LOTR on the 21st. Actually wanted to get the old housemates together for this. But coz of some having other commitments and the grading date/time kinda clashed, so I had to rearrange. Probably just meet up for a meal or something instead.  I'm still waiting ernestly for some kind of response from the Police. They're taking so damn long. This thing is just nagging on my mind now.  Oh yea, I registered some courses through the ePrep programme for NSFs. Quite interesting lor. NSFs are given 300 credits => $300 to apply for some of those eLearning courses. We juz need to pay abt 10%. Signed up for a series of continuous Java programming courses and one on Information Privacy. Can't wait for the materials to be sent over. Prob stop Japanese after Dec and do some self revision while I continue with this ePrep courses for the next few mths. Best thing is that all these are OTOT (own time own target). I just need to schedule my free time at home regularly to make sure I get some work done.  Oh well, time for new year resolutions :P ... Looking forward to 2004 where I'm prob gonna embark on a whole new phase of my life.

      &^$&%UFR%&$&^%!!!! My spare harddisk seems to be slightly corrupted. I was trying to copy some Aikido pictures of which I had scanned from my Sensei in UK. But 1 directory seems to be corrupted and I can no longer retrieve the pictures and originals. ARGHHGH!!! Worse! One of these photos actually includes a photo of my Sensei!!! ARGH!@#!@#!@# ..... I'm so pissed.  Think I better start backing up my data onto CD. Especially those GBs of Aikido clips I so painstakingly downloaded and catalogued. If even those are gone, I think someone had better just take a bokken and chop my neck off. Don't matter that it's blunt, all the more painful it'll be then.

      Right, just got back from Malaysia. Visited some relatives there (mum's cousin ... I think :P). Not gonna be able to attend Alvin's classes tonight. I think I can officially call my angbao collection complete by now. I'm pretty sure I've visited everyone I was supposed to and everyone that needed to come to my place had already been here too. Well I have to go pay my mat fees with my angbao money this week, plus use the remainder for a new pair of specs. Figured these things shouldn't wait too long anyway. Might as well settle it since I've got the moolah now and it sure beats withdrawing large amounts from the ATM later.  Sat I was supposed to visit Daniel's for lunch there. Prior to that, I was at a relative's when I got a call from David saying the visit was cancelled. Apparently Daniel's dad had a fall that morning and Daniel was at the hospital with him. Luckily that same afternoon, I got news that he was fine and we could still visit him if we were all able to. But I didn't think it was wise to be disturbing his family at that time.  There's been quite a number of accidents around my area just the past week alone. I know coz I've been hearing a lot of 'screeeeeech CRASH .... BANG!' and they've pretty much all sound the same. Just a few hours ago a car flipped on the road just opposite my place. Naturally there were police, ambulances and reporters. I think it's partly due to the wet weather which pretty much started on the day of CNY itself. Weird coincidence. Unfortunate too that all these area happening on a festive season.  This CNY I noted that I needed to know my limit when it comes to eating new year goodies. I feel a bit sick because I've been having too much pineapple tarts. I think it's because of all the butter that's giving me a very bloated feeling now. Wouldn't go for Aikido even if time permitted. Gosh, seriously man ... I feel like puking. The pineapple tarts were all home made by my aunt that's why they were especially good. Not too sweet like those you may find outside sometimes. Perfect I would say. I don't have much appetite to have my dinner later either, so bloated now.    OK I'd better go nap now. Hopefully my poor appetite will be better when I wake up.

      Did a small change to my blogpage template. Added some Hopes and Wishes columns. Basically covers some long and short term goals I'd like to try and keep in mind.  On the 20th, I met up with Begh and Lynette for dinner at my friend's restaurant called Swiss Culture,  Suntec City mall. We had an ultra filling meal there and I think the food there has improved. I have to admit he is doing pretty well. Anyway we had a really good and long chat there as well. In fact, I only just received his housewarming invitation by SMS at his place next Sun. Hopefully my NS kakis will be attending too.  On the eve was reunion dinner with my mom's side of the family. After that, us guys decided to catch the Last Samurai (starring 'Tomu Kurusu' - Tom Cruise ;P). 2 of the ladies went for KTV and another went to catch a midnight with her boyfriend. All our parents decided to go home for the night. I haev to admit, the Japanese actor acting opposite of Tom Cruise did outshine the latter in the show. There was just so much more depth to his character. The action sequences were pretty fantastic too but you can kinda tell Tom Cruise's swordwork, was way different from the Japanese's in the show. Not enough sword fighting scenes as I would've liked as well, but that's just me lah. Thinking of buying the DVD when/if it's released too.  It's the year of the monkey now. These 2 days were quite uneventful save for visiting relatives and friends and vice versa. Got another interview next Tues. Something similar to an interview I went a few days ago. It's to be attached to schools to teach IT. Mr Tan ... haha ... can't imagine students addressing me that. Sounds weird ... dunnoz.   urlLink Gary  finally received the CDs I sent, though he did mention one of the discs seemed a bit dodgy. This week I should be able to attend Aikido. Hope to pop by on Mon. It's been a long time since I managed to put in any serious time into it and I really want to get back on track again. Back hasn't given me any problem past week, but I don't think I'm going to push myself if it still feels weird during training.  One not too happy thing I just remembered. Dad thought he was helping by 'asking' his cousin and brother if there's any job vacancy they might know of. I'm glad there wasn't exactly a response or a positive one. Seriously felt like I was being shoved into an area I don't quite want to be in. Didn't want to put him down for his request in front of others (nor did I when everyone left). -- See 'Hopes and Wishes'. -- And I'm so getting tired of him comparing me with my cousin who just finished his course from NUS too. Same as Gary, just that he took his honours year as well and he's got a good job paying him 2.3k. Dad keeps poking me about why he is good lah, why I'm not lah and all that. Geez ... I'm getting fed up just blogging this down now. But I also recalled soemthing my aunt said to me lastweek. "Afterall lah, he's your father. He want to say let him say lor. It's not like it's some outsider / boss outside telling you off now. It's all within the family." Ar, she's right. So far keeping this sentence in mind helps me a bit but I dunno how long it'll last lah. Ultimately I don't see myself as someone who is willing to back down if I feel that a gauntlet is being thrown in my face.

      Didn't exactly have a great night yesterday. Day was fine coz I had the whole day pretty much to myself. Dinner time came and my parents were like arguing over who gets to make dinner. Duuuh ... me? I'm just contented to get some food at the end of it. Each was like criticising the other on the 'right' way to cook this or that. Goodness lor, who cares so long as the food at the end is decent enough and edible. Plus it's just fried rice!!! DUH!!!!  Again, arranged to meet Begh this evening. Once again, this stupid incident (over the silliest issue) made me delay dinner and had to cancel. @*^#$#...  Anyway, mood died down pretty fast while we were all eating. Think it's because of the Quan2 Xin1 Zhong3 Dong4 Yuan2 3 (Snap 3) on tv. The night was OK after that.  Sensei sms saying BB East had no training on Sat coz the hall was being used. I emailed Sensei about my back and videoing for the session when I pop down. Hopefully get a reply sometime this weekend. Otherwise may have to sms him liao by Mon.   urlLink Eileen  finally popped back onto the blog to 'show face'. Haha. Thought she MIA liao. And Gary sounds like he's enjoying his training too much to want to leave US. I dunno, I got the same feeling in UK as well. Just gets me thinking what was the difference I felt about here and UK exactly? Hmmmm .... class size, environment are the obvious ones. But what about with relation to training? I got no answer yet.  Realised I've downloaded too many articles of the past and not done enough reading for all of them. Was reviewing some when I came across something called 'Verbal Aikido'. Damn interesting article about handling verbal attacks. Just somehow got me thinking about how I can apply them when my parents make noise at me (or even vice versa). Dunnoz, maybe I'll post it after I finish it in detail and reflect a bit more over it.  Also realised my scope of job applications is slowly expanding from what I intended. Initially was non-IT/ programming intensive. Now it's starting to include things like VB, SQL etc. But then again I hope there's more willing to take in multimedia applications and stuff, especially those with 'willingness to explore and experiment' kind of criteria.  OK time to get back to my ePrep programme again. Time to get a job ...

      Missed training ... again. I must have missed up to about 3 weeks worth of training I think. I dunno if it's a damn coincidence with illnesses, injuries, clash of timings (duh ... and I'm not even working permanently yet), plus a whole lot of other shitz, or is it that I'm slacking and feeling just plain lazy. Sure hope it's not the latter though.  Anyway, today I helped carry some buckets of water for some washing. Though my back was OK liao, but apparently it wasn't 'OK' enough. I've just decided to stop training till after the Chinese New Year. Best to ensure a complete recovery to avoid complications. Think that's the best alternative. But I don't really want to miss out Mon's lesson, it being the last one before CNY. I'll probably email Alvin this weekend see if I can pop down to watch and video his class down. Just for the fun of it.

      Haiz ... I've only just ORD for less than a month, and I've got notice to return to camp on the 31st for Mob Briefing liaoz. Oh man ...  TV repair man came today. Woohoo ... New sofa came today as well. I was quite irritated with the delivery people. Original arrangement was that they will remove our old set for $20 when the new set comes. I told them it was arranged in advance and even written on the order slip in black and white. The delivery people were still insisting that they can't do it. What peeved me off a little was their response came pretty much when they heard that they were going to be paid $20 (only). I got the impression they'll probably do it for more money instead (I've always thought such things usually got done at a rate of $50). Finally, easiest response was we didn't want to accept the new sofa and would like to cancel the order. Now they had to call their office and ask. There was a lot of arguing and finger pointing, though not in a really nasty way. More like them saying aloud "Customer won't listen to me, you go and talk to him yourself." etc over the phone. I was getting pretty irritated as well. In the end we said, we'll accept only whenever they are ready to take over our old sofa. Way I see it, several thing made me pretty mad with them. One, they delayed delivery beyond the original delivery date. Two, the taking over of the old sofa was arranged when my mom placed the order and it was written in black and white. Three, the way the delivery people reacted when they heard of the $20 was seriously negative like a "Impossible!" or a "No way!". Four, when we talked to the manager of the store, he actually had the audacity to say something like he has no control over the delivery people. If he has no control then who does? Oh please. We're not not unreasonable people here either. We can see their truck is too full to take our old sofa set. Their suggestion was for us to leave the old set in the carpark first and they'll be back tomorrow. But we have no guarantee they will return to collect the old one after we accept the new set now. My dad's back isn't good and there's no way I can shift it out alone either. Plus our estate management do not allow such things to be done. And there's absolutely no space to leave it outside the house as there are more than one household in the estate who own more than one car. It was simply ridiculous. If they'd only just come back later when they're truck has space, I don't see why we can't work it out. But the driver just kept saying it's too late lah, cannot lah, etc etc. Idiot! Ironic thing was that, after one hour they called back saying they now have space to takeover our sofa and handover our new set. DUUUH!!! Anyway, I'm just glad that episode is over. I think I've already done my part. Despite paying them $20, I still helped them carry the sofa out as well. Maybe I should've kept $10 for myself instead. God knows, I needed the cash anyway... My father was quite insistent that we let them carry all the sofas but that would've been impossible, mean and physically impossible anyway.  Begh (UK housemate) SMSed me about grabbing some coffee tonight. Was supposed to go, but the whole episode above delayed my dinner and I didn't eat till like 8-ish. Had to cancel the appointment.  Anyway spent most of today finishing up my book 'Black Hawk Down' and going through my Java ePrep modules online. I think I can finish the unit I'm on by this weekend and quite possibly start on the second unit. In total I've 3 units to complete and another course on Computer Security. Hohum... too much time to spare at home anyway. Just started reading Lord of the Rings and realised it's not exactly an easy read. The book I got had small prints and that didn't really help. I'll probably take a long time to finish this book. Worse, I promised a friend to finish another book she had recommended. I just might KIV LoTR first.  When lifting the heavy sofa today, I was careful not to make my back any worse than it seemed to feel. Fact was, it seemed to be recovering fine this past week. If nothing goes wrong tomorrow, I'm probably going down to Siglap for training and to pay my mat fees as well. Owed it too long already. Talk about owing, I also need Sensei to sign my grading book and pass him the grading CDs ;P. Lucky I've packed all this in my bag already. Hope Gary's degenerative brain syndrome won't affect me haha.

      I was reviewing footages of previous grading clips this morning. I dunno why but I just suddenly recalled a statement I made on ICQ to  urlLink Eileen  sometime ago. I mentioned "Is it me or do the standard of people taking the grading seem to be lowering these days?" Well first of all I see myself having been stagnant and even backsliding a bit to a certain extent for a period. Second, certain gradings just don't seem as intense as the one(s) I had seen before. However, I also realised that every batch of students will be different. Some improve fast and some slow, while some others don't. The 'standard' of improvement is also on an individual level too. Let's say for example some dude did just OK during his 6th kyu test, but suddenly he did better than normal during his 5th kyu test. Such improvement(s) is relative and varied in different ways. It may be philosophical, technical, even personal (attitude, habits, etc). What we see during a grading is not the whole picture. To be specific, I've always felt that Soh was a pretty stiff uke whenever I paired up with him few years back. But he has seriously improved a lot since then and that difference really impresses me (though I'd still prefer another uke instead. Guess I'm still standing on the same point instead of moving on and 'improving' this attitude :P ). Something along the 'some horses run slow first then pickup speed, while some run fast at first and get's punctured later on' theory. Also, I'm trying to remember that such things can't be 'compared' with others. I mean what's the point right? So long as there's personal improvement, it really doesn't matter how much. Just as long as you're happy with how much you've grown. If you're not, well that's where you work towards it I suppose.  What (I think) I really want to say is that, despite being bad at what you do now, don't mean you can't be good / improve later. Maybe the problem will be how much we really want to improve and actually committing ourselves into it to do it. Whether achieving it or not, well I guess there'll still be no regrets with the results. But what about in cases where you can't afford to fail? Hmm, gimme some time to dwell on that. Haven't thought out a moderated thought on this yet.  All this thinking of my career kinda made me visit the SPF website once again. Just noted that as of this year, salary stated on site will be reduced by 15%. Well, still not a big deal to me considering I didn't want this because of the money. But I'm considering applying to CNB too. Actually given a choice, I would've wanted to do uniform service in the early years (4-6), try out 1-2 years of UN peacekeeping, and then maybe opt for a transfer to somewhere eg. CNB, CID, etc, depending on what I've learned in the force. Haiz, just hope I can be shortlisted someday. Pity I can't just waltzed in and sign on.

      Well, I've got quite a lot to write about. Dunno where to start.  For starters, I missed Aikido on Thurs coz of work. Fri morning, I went for the interview at a small french-german company consisting of just 3 persons. The Dir was not available then because he was at the Dr's, I think. But the other two had given me the impression that the company held a lot of promise and there was a lot of space and possibilities to grow. The company provides several software packages in the form of inventory, revenue monitoring, reservation sys to the hospitality industry and more in the region. They are already providing support to several big hotels here and I was so impressed with what they had accomplished with just 3 person. It doesn't surprise me that they actually need to hire another person to help out either. The job sounds really challenging to me though somewhat less technical which was exactly how I had pictured it. I'm guessing that once I go into this, there'll be no room for me to jump back out into the IT/programming aspect of IT anymore. For starters there'll be a lot of answering of calls to answer users' queries and help solve their problems. But as time passes, they hope that more responsibility can be assigned to assist certain areas of their work for on-site installations, trainings, upgrades, maintenance, etc. This is why there may be some travelling involved overseas. What really struck me was the great working atmosphere the team had. The Dir is transparent with the revenue the co. is generating so everyone knows where the money is coming in from. The only down point was that they were only able to offer 1.6k for the first 3 mths during training, and then 1.8k. This is seriously low to what I'm hoping to get. I was really frank when I left and I said I needed to think things over because of the pay. They were really generous, cordial and open from beginning to end.  I asked a lot of opinions from my parents and friends. My parents agreed the the pay was a bit low and that the job entails some OT usually, being a customer service oriented job. I'm not surprised even if there may be a need to remain contactable during weekends and public holidays despite it not being the official office hour. Neo especially made me re-evaluate what was it I really wanted from a job/career. (YO! You happy now boh? Got mention your name leh! :P) I realised a lot of things about myself that I had tried to avoid asking myself for sometime too. Conclusions I had drawn, I wanted to be sure that I'm not just taking up any job to 'escape' the programming area of IT, that what I really wanted was job satisfaction instead of just monetary rewards. That I'm willing to take the job up to another level and push myself beyond what others may not want to do. All these are what I expect of myself when I've decided to place my foot down on the direction my career will be taking and I don't see any other way beyond this. I'm still willing to keep my options open at this point because I still feel really keen about the SPF. But everything I've heard about the job has seriously tempted me to try out something else on a long term basis. In fact, I've only just emailed them saying I'm willing to take up the job if I do get shortlisted. Let's hope everything works out.  Went back to work in the afternoon and didn't manage to talk to my boss about my decision to stop work till the end of the day. He was nice about it and he actually took up a chair to have a good long talk with me. I was aware he had delayed/cancelled a delivery/meeting that evening just to talk to me and we spoke till about 2 hrs after closing time. He's a honest, traditional man who is open to many things. After hearing things out from him I realise how much he had gone through. I even understood why he had requested that I be willing to try things out in the co for a week before he decided to pay me. No doubt I may have helped him out for free the past 5 days but I really hadn't done too much there either. Sounds a bit foolish but I do pity him more than I pity myself. I also respect what he has put himself through to have what he has now, and what he is going through now just to keep the company going too, but there's all the suffering and hiccups from yester-years that I didn't see which has made him a stronger person. He was actually quite keen to help me grow both as a person and in the company and it's a pity I wasn't the right person for the job.  The long talk with him made me almost all of us just want a comfortable job that we can work in because of the stability it provides - entering a big company where things are already stable and there's a system in place. But if you're in a small co. and you're able to make something out of it or turn things around, I think that's where we can impact the greatest difference and climb our way up too. I was kinda relating these thoughts - from the interview, the long chat session - to my asipirations to join the SPF. I realised that it meant more to me that I make a difference in Singapore in whatever small way I can than to get a great paying job. But on the downside, I also realised that I really wanted that comfortable level and stability much more. I wished what I felt was evened out on a 50-50 basis so that I can have the best attitude for things, especially so since it will affect my decision on selecting a job/career now. I dunnoz ... I just hope I've made the right decisions and reevaluations of my job-selection criteria and I'll be really happy about the decisions I'd have made when I re-read my blog 10 years down the road.  Almost failed to mention that I kinda strained my back lifting some stuff on Thurs/Fri. It doesn't feel particular bad but it sure feels damn weird. I'm not gonna make myself start training anytime soon until I'm sure it's nothing serious. I've seen too many bad back-related injuries in NS to take this too lightly. Anyway, it may not be bad to stop lessons for awhile, I can concentrate fully on finishing my ePrep course and job-hunting too. Oh noted one point about my CV during my interview. Apparently they kinda got the impression most of my experience were all very short-termed. I quickly explained the dates to them that all these were fixed due to sch vacation dates, contract, internship dates etc. Looks like I better include a new point "Reason for leaving" in my CV just in case most people aren't aware of how the local academic dates work. Just felt this might be a very important point in a CV.

      Had a stroke of good news today. Got another interview this Fri. Will probably need to drum up some excuse to get the morning off then, afterall, I'm not being paid yet so not quite a loss anyway haha. Anyway this new job sounds quite interesting. It's labelled as a Software/Helpdesk Consultant, but it's with a co with some European roots so there's actually an opportunity to do quite a bit of travelling within Europe. Not sure how things will turn out, but I hope it'll be good. Anyway the company is going to be in Sci Pk 1, so getting to BVCC and BB East should be considerably easier for me. Woohoo... no excuse to not train liao ... well maybe unless I keep forgetting to bring parts my gi ...

      Today  (well, technically speaking it's yesterday coz it's past midnight already now) was an eventful day. 1st day at work. Didn't find an apporpriate time to talk to the boss about my pay yet. Will probably need to do so tomorrow. My mom was worried that they might be exploiting me, but I don't see it lor. Everyone in the office is seriously nice, but I do agree that the talk about pay has to be settled sooner or later. I guess I'll just bring it up tomorrow nicely lor. Seriously hope for at least $2k, but I'm seriously considering taking the job for a little bit less also. But I think I'd be spoiling market if I accepted something way too low.  Anyway, today was spent mostly troubleshooting PCs and some hardware problem in their office. I can only KIV it because after 1 whole day, I still can't say for sure why they have so much problems. OK, being a small company kinda made them really messy. But I can tell the boss is really friendly to everyone working there. Everyone is addressed on a first name basis, the boss included.  Went to BB East for Aikido. Was going to change in the toilet when I realised I FORGOT MY GI'S PANTS!!! ARGH!!!! .... Seconds later Alvin entered the toilet and I had to tell him the pekchek news. DOH!! Went into the dojo and everyone was asking me why I'm not changed for training. Oh Man!!! I received more than one suggestion to train in my jeans instead. I would if only I could. Sigh :( But sitting along the sidelines today wasn't a waste. I noticed a lot of points in Alvin's class. A lot of kokyunages from katate, morote, ushiro ryote doris, etc. Each one of them an extension of the previous technique. The things to note especially was centering, leading and footwork. I think from his past few lessons, he repeats these points almost religiously. I must say, I can tell what I'd be doing wrong just by watching everyone today. However towards the last 20mins or so of class, I seriously felt frustrated because I really needed an uke to let me feel what I'm trying to fomulate in my mind. At the end of class, I took the same bus as Alvin again. Always enjoyed talking to him about stuff off the mat because I always pick up some way to being 'Aiki' off the mat. Told him about not getting into the SPF and he was quite encouraging. I guess some of the stuff he's saying I know them as well, but you sometimes just needed to hear them from others to register it in your mind. Anyway was quite a good day lah.  Got back home and something nasty happened which I don't feel like blogging in too much details. All family related but I wasn't involved at all this time. Still, find it very hard not to be burdened by some of the disputes / conflicts sometimes. That feeling of loss and helplessness is very irritating. I don't want to be judge, jury and executioner but I think everyone was at fault. Even myself even though, like I mentioned, I wasn't involved. Shitz ... sometimes I feel that every problems I noted are related somehow or other to the material world. If only luxuries didn't exist and everyone knew the contentment of just living simple lives. An unrealistic dream, if I do say so myself.

      Went for the job interview this evening. It was a small company which specialised in printing, manufaturing souvenirs, badges etc. The boss was a nice chap. Throughout the conversation I could feel like he was accessing me, though in a relatively casual sort of way. Turns out what they need is someone who can do almost everything and assist the boss. Seems like the job scope, includes creating systems (not programming, I mean more like procedures) to help their admin, maintaining the PC(s), software and quite possibly hardware troubleshooting, general admin, coordinating work, etc. In other words, the works. It seemed like a comfortable place to work in, despite it not being anything like the big corporate places most graduates seem to be working in these days. We've not really discussed the specifics of the work contract or pay yet, I'm hoping to leave it till Mon. Seriously hope it's at least decent, otherwise I won't be able tot take it up even if I really wanted to. But I'm wondering what aspect I can pick up here. Besides the expected admin and business knowledge, there may not be enough in a technical sense even in the design and IT field. Serious delimma, I'm not hoping to jump into IT, but I'm also not trying to trade that off for something too broad. The boss said something about having 'faith' in the company (dun ask me how that came up), and I have to admit it's something I don't have. But that's probably natural because it's the first time I've actually seen the co.

      Well knackered out today. Woke up this morning and started packing my room. Been at it for almost 11 hrs or so, but at least my room looks like a place for living in now. Will try to make it a point to clean up regularly every Sun morning just to make things easy.  Well, I've classified what's junk; to be thrown, what's to be donated (gotta call Salvation Army tomorrow), what's to be kept. Seriously man, I just realised there's a lot of small knitty gritty things I would like to keep but I had to stone wall myself otherwise I'll be keeping practically everything. My dad was well impressed with my effort and initiative. Somehow he also tried to do the same thing for himself but I think it got worst, so he was quick to lose his momentum. I was practically sneezing and wheezing a little because of all the dust. Hah, also noted that there's a lot which I'm getting rid off without asking my parents. If I did, they'll be nagging me and making so much noise about throwing good stuff out. I seriously have to bypass them if I need to get this done. And no more waiting around to consolidate what needs to be given to the Salvation Army/Red Cross/whatever. All these will just delay me from getting everything done. Hope to clear up the categorised and packed stuff within a few days. Next week, if I'm still jobless, I'll start chopping up my old toys cupboard for firewood muahahah ... so therapeutic. Gonna shift my furniture around alittle here and there when I do get my new loft bed. Hopefully by then I'd already have a job so I can get some new shelves to replace the space for the old cupboard.  Oh yea, tomorrow I'm checking out a Graphic Designer cum Coordinator job. It's located fairly near my place near Whampoa Drive/PIE/Jalan Toa Payoh. Hope it's something decently paid with a good and enjoyable workscope so that I can accept it on the spot.

      What a boring weekend. Got so much to do by Mon. Worse still, I was down with high fever after work on Sat. My whole household has got it too. Probably some kinda viral fever going around now. Anyway, I felt something was wrong so I popped two paracetamol and water paraded myself for a straight 4 hrs or so. By the time I went to bed, I felt a whole lot better. Sun morning came and I think I managed to get over my fever ok. But still felt weak and as though a sore throat/cough will be coming up soon. Oh well, that's normal whenever I get fever. Worst thing is that I need to formulate some teaching structure when class starts Mon onwards. In fact I'll probably be quite taxed for the next 6 weeks.  Some friends from NUS just formed a committee for GOLD - Graduates of the Last Decade. They pulled me in as a member sometime ago. Been missing  the past few meetings and just when I thought I can join the one on Sun, I fell sick. Shucks, didn't want to make it seem like I'm trying to siam the meet but I'm in no condition to join them at all this weekend.  Sat was suppossed to go for volunteer briefing at SPCA. Problem was that it was conducted at 1130hrs and I was still working at that time. Had to miss it but they said they'll schedule another one for Mar. Hope this time, it'll be in a more decent time slot.  This Tues, I think I'll approach Sensei for permission to train with Yuishinkai on Friday nights. Dunno how he'll take it. I dun wanna make it seem like I'm belittling AFS, but I just hope to expose myself to their form of exercises and training style. For one thing, I like their 'extra emphasis' on Ki compared to Aikikai style, but I also don't want to train completely in Ki style. I find that they are a lot more vocal in class (like during Alvin's classes), something I can relate to in UK under British Aikikai.

      Today was weird. I was the only non-beginner today with 2 white belts when Richard arrived. 3 of us laid all the mats ourselves. Everyone else came just a  bit later than usual. I was surprised to see Darryl from BVCC drop in as well. Then Bridgette came. After class started the twins Darrel and Daniel arrived too (later I found out one of them got his slippers stuck in mud and was 'trapped' there for over an hr while he waited for his brother to go home and grab another pair of slippers). 3 sec after Richard started warmups, he asked me what belt I was. Told him 5th kyu, then he wanted me to take the warmups. That's when I kinda freaked. Told him I'm not familar with taking warmups but he said we all needed to start from somewhere. So I took them thru what I could remember, with some pointers from Richard. Ar ... it still feels weird to me lah. Made mistakes here and there probably coz I felt nervous. Never thought I'd take warmup at all one day. Still dun really want to lah. Dunnoz, figured I'm not the kind to take up too much dojo responsibilities at this stage, just enjoy being one of the foot soldiers so I can train. Anyways, I did take the warmup slow and easy because I felt that usually we were just rushing through the motion of it too quickly. Of course, I didn't make them do any killer warmups that Eileen or Sunny did. Haha ...  We did gyaku and ai hamni nikkyo today. Went through very slow processes but it still felt like we all learned something today. Hah ... Richard brought his toy gun again tonight as a prop for nikkyo techniques. Farny man ...  Btw, asked the twins to come early next time coz I really dun wanna take warmups anytime soon. Doh...  Like to share some things Richard said as well which I, well, never exactly quite thought over before. He mentioned that uke and nage when practicising are on equal standing. No one is better than the other. A senior needs to bring himself down to a junior's level and the junior to that of the senior's (mabbe not in terms of technical stuff, but could be in terms of attitude, observations, etc). As a senior I why should I feel good at being stronger than a junior? No basis for feeling proud of that as an achievement. To me it's ego at work. Something we need to rectify and eliminate. All of us have heard this before I'm sure, that we should help each other when it comes to learning the technique.  A point on ego that Alvin Khong told me a few months back. When I asked him how long he has been training, he said "Since the year xxxx, you go and calculate." He says he don't like to keep track of the no. of years he has been practising Aikido. It's only to boost your ego. Why would you be counting up the no. of years of training anyway? Counting up to what? To tell people about it? Makes me so ashamed man. Before we had that conversation I'd always tell people, I've been training xx no. of years. Now I'm trying to adopt the same attitude by saying "since 2000". But I gotta admit in mind there's still the thought that's counting, more out of habit than anything else.  Daphne and I had a talk about something last week on 'False Humility'. It's like when people praise you, and you just say things like "No lah, no lah" "Dun have lah", etc. She says I have a problem about listing out my flaws all the time. She said I need to be more accepting about my strengths. True I think. Told her it's cause I hate it so much that people who dunno me gets a lot of false impression about me. Simply HAAAATE it. I rather people see me as I am, even if it means seeing my flaws first. But it's true, I tend to refuse compliments often. I think there's nothing wrong with simple "Thanks" for the nice comments afterall. Something I need to look into. Heh :)

      Right, yesterday due to a stupid misunderstanding. Lim Koon and I kinda got Daphne mad at us for the whole day. Worse, we didn't realise it till today. Luckily she's not the kind to bear grudges. Actually wasn't actually anyone's fault. I felt that it was just a huge misunderstanding. Anyway, never mind. It's over and it doesn't seem that anyone's been seriously psychologically scarred over the matter :P... whew.  Aikido was great. I realised a lot of things about my technique as I was doin it. For Shihonage, Gary's pointers on keeping arms slightly bent is good. I tend to pull with straight arms. I went home and thought things through but I think the bent arms helps me a lot more to bring uke down to my centre.  Lotsa kokyunage free practice in the final 30min. My group was with Karen, Li Hsing (Johnson's gf) and Alvin (I think, I've seen him but not sure if that's his name). I think I was basically rushing too much liao, I felt like I didn't manage to maintain my balance, posture or even do proper atemi. But still, at the end of the session it was fun. Did a series of kokyuho with Darryl again. He's better at feeling the force from uke than I am. But I felt that he has a bit of 'Wallop' in him too. They both tend to be more concerned with showing what they can do, than help their partners. It's not like they are selfish or anything, they just think that they are helping better in that way. I'm saying this because at the end, Darryl was basically the one doing more of the feeling movement instead of just bringing me down. But he did so much until I didn't think I was an effective uke as I didn't have the energy and strength to keep applying force against him. Oh well ...  I'm a bit nervous about starting the eLearning classes next week. I will be busy for the next 6 weeks or so taking classes of students and teachers. I have about 60+ teachers to train, re-train, conduct workshops and 1500+ students to take. All of which needs to be familar with how to use the eLearning system around early April. I think I'm going to ask Sensei if I can go Pillars from next week onwards because I'll probably need to do OT ocasionally. It'll also mean I can probably grab a bite before training coz Pillars and Siglap are so much nearer. So far I've been skipping meals whenever I need to go BVCC. Not a good thing in the long run.

      Right the booths setup at Lido today was by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Seems like recruitment was more for SCDF and Coast Guard. Both were interesting lah but neither was what I really wanted. Anyway, I spoke with a lady and I was told they weren't taking any SOs now. Each year there's only 2 batches of intake and sometimes just 1 batch even. My heart sank when I heard this. But oh well, I'm happy with this job now and I'm sure I will learn stuff here. Might as well make use my stay here and pick up what I can first.  Tang did advise me to take up the Coast Guard thing first and just go through the 9mths training in Police Academy first, then request for a transfer to the land unit later. But I know that approval is subjected to vacancies in the force. If there isn't any, I seriously don't want to be stuck within the Coast Guard.  Also spoke to the lady about the contract scheme. Bond is just 2 yrs, not 6 yrs which I initially thought. That's good news. But I forgot to ask her about UN Peacekeeping. Was also told that they will advertise in the newspapers and on the website when recruitment for SO is open again. She also that if they were taking anymore people this year, I could send in my resume sometime in Aug to the ManPower office. I won't need to send in my application anymore though because they've stored it in a database already. Well I hope the rest of this year I can build up my resume and get a reference from school. Maybe that will help my application then too. She also mentioned somethat the 3 wks overseas leadership training is conducted in Thailand now, instead of Nepal like I had thought. I guess they rotate the locations every now and then. Sure hope that when/if I get in, I'll be able to go somewhere either really nice or exotic. Thailand's OK, but it wouldn't be my first choice (as though I've any).

      Been getting busy in school these days. Things look like they're picking up. But it could be because there's a lot of last min stuff that needs to be done or at least made presentable before the Minister of Education's visit to the school coming Tues. Goodness, I know Tracey (HoD IT) would like to present something on eLearning during the visit but I'm hoping I can do something light then instead. Still not sure I feel up to it at such an early stage.  I've been working on getting the IT notice boards up past week. Took me 2 days later than intended to finish it up. Basically I put up some minor content (after amending the language to suit primary school level) and surfed around for cute pictures to be placed on the board too. Well, I decided on Neopets. Seems like a craze of sorts with the kids these days. They do look kinda cute lah but I got no idea what those creatures really are. Most look like a cross between 2 different animals, while others I got no idea what they really are. But it catches the kids attention. While pinning it up on one of the boards, some pri one students started crowding around behind me and they just went "Oooo, so cuuuuute." o_O"... I dunno if it's a girl thing lah, but when I sat in one of the classes Daphne (resident IT trainer) was conducting - MS Publisher -, some girls presented their final work. When pictures of animals or pets were shown, they just went "Ohhhh, so cuuuute" again.  Well, my friend Tang informed me of a Ministry of Home Affairs career fair this weekend. Will be meeting him for lunch before we pop by together. I know SPF isn't recruiting but there's no harm taking a look either.

      Tonight's training was pretty ok. Did a bit of group work here and there. But think the greatest learning point was during kokyu ho with Johnson and Darryl. I'm beginning to feel something there. Though I'm still somewhat stiff when it comes to executing it, but I did manage to find the right way myself at least twice. Geez ... sure took me long enough.  We had quite a few beginners today so Sensei took them through the basic ukemi and maybe some simpler techniques. Ah Hee Sensei took the first half of class today. It was nice. Pairing up, we started in shomenuchi position (uke and nage's extended arms touching against each other), nage kinda guided uke in while doing and irimi tenkan himself. Nage will kinda follow in and flow to face the opposite direction. Ends with both facing each other again. Did these flowy movements 2x each and non stop. We progressed on into ikkyo, sankyo and kotegaeshi using these flowy movements. I think it was good coz everyone tried to be continuous.  2nd hr, Sensei took the class again. We did a series of kokyu nages in groups. Didn't maange to learn much coz everything kinda went really fast. Did manage to ask Johnson for help with my kokyuho during the break though.  One thing really pissed me off though. After class, I helped to keep all the mats and went to change. The stupid Aunty was nagging me to leave. I was TRULY pissed tonight. She was well aware I'm helping to keep all the mats. In a way that's like doing her a favour so she can lock up faster too. Being the last one to change, I beared the brunt of her naggings. I was still buckling my belt when she started saying things like "Dun dress up in here, if you wanna dress up go outside." Told her I wasn't even ready / decent enough to go outside. Fact was, I was trying to get myself minimally ready so I can bring everything out to pack nicely and tidy my shirt at the lobby. Here I am trying so hard and I'm still getting nagged.  I've concluded that I'll try to avoid training on days that the naggy aunty is around. If I come on a day that she is, I'm not going to finish keeping the mats anymore. Just pack up and leave halfway. I'm getting seriously pissed with her responses.

      Today was the day of the Aikido demo at ECP. Gotta admit things went pretty ok. I loved watching Syed's demo with his Pillars Youth students and all of them taking slams. After the whole thing I walked to the busstop wif 4 students from Pillars and found out that they paid mat fees monthly instead of every 3 mths like the CCs. Hmm I'm now considering taking additional training from there as well. Oh just a note, I did help a bit as uke during the demo but I think my ukemi was stiff and awkward. Well, there's always a first lah. Fun though, but I wouldn't want to really try again till I can take more decent ukemi and apply proper atemi.  Another reason why I felt really happy was because I met my sec 3+4 form teacher, Ms Lim, Well technically she's Mrs XXX now I think but I didn't remember to clarify this. Anyway I was giving out Aikido phamplets when lo and behold, this lady (she didn't change much even after giving birth) walked past, refusing my phamplet at the same time (HUMPH!). Anyway, my first instinct was to call out "Ms Lim! Ms Lim!". She didn't turn her head but I noted that the name did make her turn her eyeballs in my direction. So I called out again and kinda waved at her "Ms Lim from Buona Vista Sec?!" That kinda got her attention haha. Well, she couldn't remember my name lah of coz since I hadn't seen her after my Os (she was posted out soon after I graduated). Updated her my past 3 years and told her wat I'm currently working as. Apparently she's now with Tampines Sec (or was it Primary??). OK lah, at least not too diff to find out if I need to look for her again. Anyway, this kinda reminded me of my Sec 1+2 form teacher, Mr Lim. I think someday I gotta call up MOE to see if they can help me out liao.  Oh, saw the huge blackish bruise on Eileen's arm and it was horrible. I'd imagine it feels worse than it seemed lor.

      Just got back from the combined training. Whew I'm really tired today as the unofficial cameraman. Seriously, not having a  tripod makes it difficult to hold out for so long.  I'm quite pissed with myself actually because I didn't manage to get good shots using Eileen's digital cam. Most, if not all, were way too blurry and fuzzy. And to make things worse during Sensei's certificate presentation I didn't manage to snap the photos fast enough either. Haiz ... I should've spent more time using it before the actual presentation. Either that or I should've used the videocam to record down the whole sequence. In any case, I messed up.  Anyway I tried liao lah. Can't do anything about it now.

      OK I've just gotten Sensei's approval to video down tomorrow's certificate presentation and the combined training at Tanglin. I've even gotten permission from my HoD if I can arrive earlier in school so I can leave earlier too. But even then, I think my timing is going to be really tight as the last time I tried getting home at peak hour, it took me aaaaages. Anyway, no choice lah. Just do what I can liao. Eileen will be loaning me her digital camera as well so I guess I'm going to be the unofficial cameraman for the night. But seems like she'll be late because of late classes. Everything seems to be falling into place nicely woohoo.

      Been to school since yesterday and it was quite an experience. Met the school's IT resident trainer, Daphne, who is from another company. She said she's new as well but she seems to handle the kids very well. I sat in for one of her webpage building classes. One thing that struck me was that the students may be cheeky at times but they were obedient. It's either the school has disciplined them really well or it's because they're just girls... I dunno. I was quite blur when I saw some of them already blogging at such a young age (think that class was Pri 6). Goodness ... kids these days. There were some really talkative ones too. But in this school a lot of the students were happy to pounce on the chance to show what they were capable of. Daphne actually picked some of the students to present to the class and they were really hyper about it. After that the last 15min was basically a mini concert where some students decided to sing for the rest of the class. I have to admit I was seriously entertained on my first day there. Can't stop laughing. They even did a dance. It just makes me wonder whether they do these kinda stuff in their spare time (choreographing that is), and somemore all these were all impromtu rather than pre-arranged. OK, it still feels ultra weird to be called Mr Tan and I don't really remember to greet them back when they greet me "Good morning" or something. If it was just passing by the corridor it would've been easier. Today was a bit more boring. First of all I had problem getting access into the labs and had to wait for Daphne to arrive. The whole day was spent testing if their old educational CD-ROMs could run on their newly migrated systems with WinXP installed. Did finish most of it though but still left with some. Should be able to complete on Mon.  Which brings another problem. There's absolutely no way I can leave school and arrive on time at Tanglin CC on Mon evening for the combined training, being a new job and all. If the award ceremony is at the start (which I would assume it to be), I think I'll miss it.  I've gotten confirmation from SPF saying they are not recruiting anymore SO at this time. Well, I'm still disappointed but I think it's for the best now. I can concentrate on working for the next few months and learn something here. The school seems like a really nice place to work in and the Principal, my HOD (Tracey), Daphne and TA (technician) all seem and sound like nice people to be around. There's one thing I do wish for though ... more male toilets in the school. Hahah :P

      Tonight's Aikido was greeeeaaat!. I didn't do too fantastic things, but I just felt really comfortable. Got no idea why also. I think my ukes for today helped as well.  We did a form of kokyu nage backstretch which also seemed a bit like going into a shihonage. Dunno how to explain it, but I'm sure we've done it before. Paired with a relatively beginner who might have practiced for sometime before because he was a pretty good uke as a newbie. After that we did Shihonage and I think it wasn't as good as I really wanted that to be. Didn't get too many locks on my uke. Also paired witha  little chubby girl and Karen. The new girl was either sec sch or late pri sch and I think she felt really awkward about the training. But luckily Ms Wong was there to always reassure her. But she did apply a shihonage before she made my elbow 'point upwards'. Think I was quite lucky to have reacted when I did so I got away unscathed. Sensei did call out to her but a bit too late. Think it's a common mistake for beginners to get this wrong lah, I still remember when I first did it. End of the first session was practicing sitting kokyuho with a lady. It was quite nice because we did koyuhos so continuously that everything was relatively smooth and we did not feel as tired as we might have usually been. But I think both our knees and legs were feeling quite sore because of all the kneeling.  Second hour basically was spent with Karen as my partner. We did a variety of techniques from iriminages to koshinage. I tried to apply what Gary said about keeping the arms relaxed and they did feel better during the technique. But I wasn't able to keep it up all the time. I thoroughly enjoyed today's class this evening.  Asked sensei if he will still be teaching in Siglap. He said yes. Apparently Sunny had secured a new job and is not able to teach on Thurs at BVCC. So Sensei will resume the same plan again after a period.  About my first day at work, it was pleasant. Went directly to school to meet the HoD. Met Victor and Emily from the co. who were there to discuss the specifics of the contract with the school. Nice people. After that I returned back tot he co. with them and tried to familarise myself with the system and services they were providing to the school. Though not difficult, there really was a lot to learn and remember. I did feel that the package was extremely well designed and its concept was good. It's a powerful and flexible package, I think schools who use it are really getting a damn good deal here. I think the main challenge here is how to make teachers adopt a more open attitude in learning elearning and making them want to apply it to their work. Because the possibilities of how the system can help them are endless from what I've already seen. I wish I had taken some kinda Education Psychology stuff that I can apply to this kinda situation. I've heard so many stories of how resistant to change people can get sometimes. There's quite a challenge involved as well because not to be confused with purely training that so many commercial schools seem to be involved in, our co is really much more into spearheading elearning. The initiatives they've adopted is really quite fresh to me. All employees have to choose to develop an elearning module in 2 mths in an internal competition within the co. It's really to encourage employees to enhance their development skills and keep in mind that elearning is really the aim behind everything we do. There's like some kinda monetary incentives for winners of coz. I'll only be going over to the school from Fri onwards. Figured it's the best time to do so because the end of the week will give me some time to familarise myself with the new environment before I reeeeaaaally get rolling. I'm expecting there's gonna be tons to do and catch up because according to the HoD, the school is already like 1 mth behind schedule. I've already got a teacher's list and there's about 75 of them in all. Heard that students range around 1300 if I remember correctly but I've not seen the exact list yet. Also managed to meet another trainer, Danny, whom the company had attached to the school across mine. It was quite refreshing

      Been keeping away from my blog for a few days coz everytime I tried posting comments on it, there'd be some kinda stupid error. Got kinda sick of retrying and trying to remember my comments then.  Found a job at last. Multimedia Educator with an elearning development company called  urlLink AskNLearn . It was all pretty rushed because everything was confirmed last minute. I'll be attached to Katong CHIJ Primary as a content developer for the teachers there. I'm to update and put up elearning content for the teachers according to the curriculum they tell me I think. Anyway the Principal and teacher in charge wants to meet me on Tues 8am first. Pay's 1.6k for 1st 6mths probation and there'll be an increment later (how much exactly will depends liao). Think the school also rushing now coz Feb has started and they're still not done yet. Haiz ... a lot of clashes. Actually arranged for the Salvation Army to come my place collect stuff the same morning, now I have to rearrange. I'm hoping I'll get some time off to prepare myself for the job and settle my own stuff first. But I think that's going to prove difficult. My impression is that they needs things done urgently so I may at most have 1-2 days of training with the company first and then I'll need to go to the school liao.  Yesterday was my first mob briefing as a reservist. Spent the whole morning in camp listening to stuff I had already heard when I was still serving NS. A lot of things about teh stupid reservists around me sometimes. Some of them bring their 'civilian' mentality into NS and I absolutely hate that. They say things like "I will complain, must complain, etc". I got really irritated hearing things like that. Obviously after ORD these are the ones who have forgotten what it was like during their NS. Once you are back for NS matters whether you don the uniform or not, you better jolly well behave like a damn soldier and not a civilian. Suspect these are the chow geng kias during their NSF days. Some of the new/young reservists also feel that after ORD, they are considered 'king' lah, 'untouchable' lah by SAF or something. Dead wrong, they obviously haven't seen many DB cases for reservists so far. I've personally seen a group of reservists being handcuffed together in a string just awaiting the MPs to come pick them up. Worse case is for no reason/some stupid excuse on their part, they now need to disrupt their professional and personal lives, get their heads shaved, and enter DB to serve their sentence. In fact, the MPs were nice enough to give a certain 'discount/offer' that if we had 10 or more who needed to be sent to DB, they'll provide the manpower and vehicle to come and pick up the prisoners themselves. I really never see the point why reservists sometimes do all the knitty gritty things to avoid their liability, if they had just finished things in the first place ... Anyway, after the brief I had a nice talk with my RSM and he was willing to act as my character reference (though he just knew me for 4 mths).  After the mob brief I was supposed to meet Lynette and then we'd drop by to visit Daniel. Suay thing was my timing got kinda messed up and she spent a long time waiting for me. Got scolded by her over the phone which was quite well-deserved. Anyway I did a lot of walking and when I got to Daniel's they became quite sympathetic because I was wet with perspire. Had to take 2 cans of green tea and a huge bottle of plain water to cool down. If it was anyone else, I'd be so embarassed visiting someone's place so wet with perspire. But with Daniel, aiya ... hahaha, Anyway his gf, Charlotte, was there as well. We all had a good chat and departed after about an hour a half. Almost had to meetup with my NS friends to get a housewarming gift for one of our kakis the next day. Was really glad it was cancelled because I felt really really really tired today. Felt like knocking out when I got home but dinner was to be served soon, so I pretty much made myself stay awake, finished dinner, called the company to settle some details before I could finally went to bed. Woke up damn early today and realised it was Feb now.  New Yr and CNY has been over for awhile now and it only made me realised I did waste some time in the past 31 days or more. I'm glad I had finally gotten some backlot moving, things like clearing stuff for the Salvation Army to pickup and volunteering with the SPCA. Some other things I'd really like to do is visit my NP lecturer, Agus, before I start work soon. Some disappointment I felt is that I didn't get into SPF. Even worse I've heard of news saying that they might have closed applications for Senior Officers for the whole year. I'm thinking I won't give up yet, but I'll still keep my options open for now. When I spoke to my RSM, he had mentioned that even the SAF have their vacancies filled up pretty tightly now. Seems like they now have a pool of people enough to last the next 3-4 years. Just imagine, if the SAF can afford to be choosy with their applicants, it'd be worse for the other uniformed service isn't it? I'll try to check up on CNB side as well though.  Weather seems great this mornin and it's still early to avoid the traffic. Think I'll go for a run now. Time to resume marathon training liao. Just another thing I had put off since CNY coz of the wet weather then.

      Right, today was quite a nice day teaching classes in the mid and upper Pri levels. They pretty much paid enough attention to me. I realised that the secret was just to get their attention. Worst case scenario is that after 1 hr you still can't find the right way to get everyone's attention that will kinda make one pekchek (frustrated).  I also got the chance to stand in for one of the P4 iClub (something like an IT club). When I first entered, the kids were kinda trying to siam their assignment and they almost immediately started surfing for irrelevant stuff when my HoD (their original teacher in charge) left the room. All the while saying their excuses out aloud for me to hear, and trying so hard to justify why they weren't doin work. Only 1 group concentrated more on gettting their stuff first before they started surfing around for leisure.  Very first thing I did was try to be firm with them and said you MUST get your stuff ready before you can surf for leisure. That didn't seem to work. I was aware that they were surfing for fun out of view. Tried to stop them once or twice but I didn't think it'd be useful.  Me: Now are you sure you are allowed to surf around for Neopets? Kid 1: Yes. Me: (Don't exactly believe them.) Are you sure? Then what did Mrs Hoa tell you to do? Kids 2 and 3: Nothing. Me: Nothing? Are you sure nothing? How can that be? Kid: She just said to look around for fractured fairytales but we cannot find. Me: Now, she has already told you what you need to do. If you want to surf around for other things you can do so after you have done her work.  Some mumbling went on around the groups and they kinda ignored what I had said. But after awhile one of them noticed me typing away. I was actually typing out a question paper for my HoD as she said she wanted it later when she popped back in. It seemed urgent for her so I thought I might as well just spend about 30mins to help her out in it.  Me: (Typing away.) Kid 2: Mr Tan, how come you can type so fast? Me: You just need practice, the more you type the faster you will get. Kid 2: Are you typing the things for the elearning? (Because I had just taught this girl's class 40mins ago.) Me: No, I'm trying to finish typing this for Mrs Hoa, she will be coming back in later. Kid 2: Huuuuuh! Me: Now you see, that's why I've been telling all of you to do your work first before you start doing all these other things. At least finish your work before you start playing around because Mrs Hoa will be coming back later. I dunno what she will say when you cannot finish your work. See, even I am trying to rush her things out first so I can give it to her later. Now, I leave it up to you. If you want to play, you can continue but if she scolds you later, you have no one to blame but yourself. (And I went back to my typing in earnest.)  The kid kinda went balllistic and told the others. That helped because I started to notice them working a bit more though they still kept their leisure sites and homepages opened. But I figured, as long as they were working, it was ok. Slowly one group after another started saying things like, "Mr Tan, I just can't find the fractured fairy tales", "Where to find" and "Cannot find leh". To help them kick start a bit, I decided to help them search around for some link first. Found one and wrote down the URL for them, told them to pass the paper around to the other groups as well to share the resource. Some felt rather surprised and others even admitted that they saw the link but never clicked on it. My answer to that was simply, "Now, the Internet is so big. Everything can be found online. It just takes a little bit of effort." Hahaha the usual Gary Tan's 'everything can be found online' statement.  Slowly group by group they started to come over to ask me for small help here and there like "Mr Tan, my link cannot work" - typo error of course and "Mr Tan, can I print out the stories for the script". Felt happy that the different approach worked. As I went on to finish my own work the girls started surfing around for those ghost websites. But at the same time they'd get so scared of the sound and flash screens of ghosts zooming here and there that they started screaming around in the lab.  Girl 1: Eh come and see this come and see this! Very scary one! Girls: (Started huddling together over this particular PC and staring intently.) What? What? Girl 1: You stare at this for awhile and the ghose very scary one! Girls: (A bit of silence for awhile ...... then suddenly ...) AAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! (and everyone run away from the PC). Me: Goodness what on earth are you doing? Girls: Mr Tan Mr Tan, very scary. You come and see. (Another says,) Ya Ya Mr Tan come and see. Very scary ghost. I dare not clost the window now. Me: (thinking to myself) Is it really so scary? Wah if I also get shocked then it'd be so 'diu lian' (embarassing). Me: (walks over feeling a bit curious) What is it?  Apparently it was some website with tons of flash based screen shots and animations of the supernatural. Some looked really faked though. But it still made the girls scream. Anyway the girls showed me quite a few flash screen shots and some of them were preview shots of horror movies. I even saw one of 'The Eye 2'. It seemed scary enough though, but with so many kids making so much noise and all that, it was kinda an anticlimax. After awhile they got kinda bored with trying to scare me with these flash sites.  Girl: How come you not scared one huh Mr Tan? Me: Aiyo, how to get scared. Everytime I watch the things you are all around me screaming into my ear before the thing even appears.  Anyway, towards the end of class my HoD came back and they did manage to show her the work they did. She seemed satisfied enough to leave them for another 15 mins to surf around for fun. Aiya ... kids lah, harmless to give them a bit of R&R I suppose. Anyway I did enjoy the company as I worked on my company reports that afternoon.  The final class that I took after that was a Pri 3 class and they were so inquisitive that it was quite enjoyable teaching them as well. One thing I realised, the P3-4s enjoy doing quizzes. They kinda treat them as games. So I'd promise them I'd let them go through the quizzes if only they'd listen and let me finish up fast so they'll have more time to work on the quizzes. Turns out there wasn't enough time and I still had to make them do a survey. But they treated the survey as a quiz and some even enjoyed doing these. Haiz ... kids can be so naive sometimes. But what they don't know won't hurt them lah.

      New school term for Primary school started yesterday. The classes I took were all pretty pleasant. I did feel a bit more pressure teaching the upper Primary though. They were a bit too quiet and it made me all the more nervous.  Anyway, for yesterday and today, there were quite a few cancellation of classes. The feedback I had received was that everyone thought the updated copy I sent out last week was not confirmed yet. Anyway, not a problem lah. My second email to the school seems pretty straightforward liao. Things should work out just fine after this.  There was a fire drill yesterday. Daphne was taking a class of Pri 2s in her lab and I was in a separate lab doing my own work. Suddenly the fire alarm went off. First of all I tried to ignore it for a few secs/a min. But I found it to be too irritating a sound to be something minor. I immediately suspected some kind of an emergency or a real fire. I decided to pop my head out of the lab for a look. Most of the kids were lining up and moving towards the field. But out of all these activity, I noticed the Admin Manager standing outside Daphne's lab and being all calm and relaxed. That's when I knew for sure that it was only a fire drill. I walked towards her and I was thinking "OK, can check if Daphne had moved the students out of class already or not as well." As I neared the Admin Mgr, I did notice a standing board with fire painted on it. For a split second, my brain actually registered that it was the exact spot where the 'fire' started. But I still decided to walk right past it.  Admin Mgr: (sees me) Eh you just got burnt. Me: Huh? Oh, erm ... fire drill huh? Am I involved? Where should I go? Admin Mgr: Just follow everyone to the field. Me: OK (Decided to take a longer route to avoid walking past the 'flames' in front of the Admin Mgr :P)  At this point I didn't pop by to check on Daphne's lab even though I was just outside. I kinda assumed that since the Admin Mgr was standing outside doing nothing, maybe the class was empty and Daphne had already taken her class out to the field sometime ago. Not bothering to check, I just went to the field blindly like a sotong. When I reached the field. Our HoD asked if I had seen Daphne and I said "I think she knows, she should be down already." (Again, I'd like to use the army term 'You think, I thought, then who confirm?') Tracey suggested that I could call her to check. After standing around for awhile, Daphne was nowhere in sight. That's when I decided to call her.  Daphne: (answers call) Ya Aylwin, I'm in the middle of a class now. Me: Oh it's a fire drill now. Daphne: Ya but I'm in the middle of a class now. Me: Huh? ... (a bit lost for words) ... but it's fire drill. (Can't remember what she said right after but I just thought, maybe she knows what she's doing. Or she knows that she is excused from the fire drill.) Me: Oh ok lor (Hangs up).  At this stage I did feel a bit stupid. Thought I didn't have to participate and there I was standing in the field with everyone. OK, mistake made. So just went along with everyone until the 'all clear' was given. Then suddenly who should I see coming down to the field but Daphne and the class's form teacher witha bout 30+ little Pri 2s trailing behind them. OK that's when I thought "Heng ar... I came down liao." Haha ... I went over lor and they were commenting/discussing amongst themselves over the mistake. Later on I was told the form teachers said that the kids were all 'Chow da' (burnt). Well, was a comic day lah with me and the kids all getting 'burnt'.  Today I had some classes in the morning while most of the remaining ones in the afternoons got cancelled or rescheduled due to the same reasons I mentioned earlier. While doing my own work in the lab, a class I had taught before came in for their lessons. These were all Pri 1s and they were quite funny partly also because of the way the teacher was trying to handle all of them at once. There was this particular little girl who had trouble handling the CD-Roms and she was too afraid to ask for help. She was kind breaking down into tears quietly.  Kid by name of Vanessa (2 seats away from Cying Kid): Mrs Lim, Samantha is crying. Mrs Lim: Why? She's always crying. Why is she crying?  Now Vanessa is one hyper kid who irritates her fellow classmates very often. I think she's the one who wants attention from people (I posted about her a few blogs ago).  Mrs Lim: Yes and you Vanessa, you are so busybody that Samantha crying you also can see from your seat so far away right?  Now Mrs Lim is only saying this because Vanessa tends to do alot of inappropriate stuff at a inappropriate time. Always so hyper and disobeying instructions (purpose, if you ask me - just for the attention she can get). Anyway I was keeping my ears opened and I took a look at what could actually be Samantha's problem. I just saw a quiet meek mannered little girl with a pony tail and big round eyes staring at the monitor. Aiyo ... also dunno how to help her. From what I can gather, I think she just feels helpless and she's one of those who is too shy to ask for help. Pri 1 lah, I guess it happens. Anyway Mrs Lim just tried to explain to her that if she needs help she should just ask. I guess she's handled enough of such cases before to know that 'spoonfeeding' the kids too much won't help. It'll just make them more dependent and they won't learn anything.  Anyway a few moment passed and I naturally just turned back to check out if Samantha might be having anymore problems. I think everything seemed OK lor. But she suddenly turned over and she saw me looking over at her. I just turned back in a nonchalant way and hope I did not manage to embarass her. But I could tell her face and eyes were slightly redder than normal because of all the crying earlier.  Later I saw her walking over to the teacher and I assumed she had manage to pay heed to Mrs Lim's advice about getting help when she needed it. But ...  Samantha: (Whispers something too Mrs Lim. Too soft for me to hear over the noise that the class was making.) Mrs Lim: Aiyo, why do you want to look for your sister? She's not free lah, she's in class now. That's when I realise that Samantha actually has an older sis somewhere in the same school.  Haiz, I also dunno what I'm trying to say about the situation lah. Just think kids can be so difficult to take care of sometimes despite being so adorable.

      OK something really disgusting occurred on Thursday. That morning I happily donned my shoe and went to work as usual. Spent a whole day in school and went Aikido at Siglap after work. Arrived early as usual and started to change. Lo and behold, guess what I found? There was a freaking dead cockroach smeared on the right side inside of my right shoe. Ewwww ... freaking gross. Cleared out whatever of its remains I could and blocked out the thought as I went on with Aikido for the night. Can't quite shake the thought out when I had to change back and go home after class. Moment I got home, removed my shoes and went to wash my gi + socks (blood  smear on my socks). Thoroughly washed out the inner regions of my shoes with a  fibrous brush and an old tooth brush. All the while the remains were like being removed really slowly. I figured I must have worn out a whole chunk of my shoe with all the hard scrubbing I did. Lesson learnt? I always shake my shoes to throw out whatever dirt, insect or creepy crawly first before sticking my foot in now.  Yesterday went to River Valley High to take a company test. Technically I was late but when I arrived it seems like people had just settled in a few mins ago only. Test turned out to be OK. Was decently easy, but it's not like I'll be getting a high score in it or anything lah. Just felt that they were reasonable questions though some terms were a bit technical. I was lucky that during my first 3 days in the company, I had an expert like Angelica walkthrough me a lot of the stuff. After the test, I went to Clementi central to make a new pair of specs. Cost me like $240. Freaking expensive but I figured getting one I really liked will last me longer plus I guess I really needed the new specs. The new one came with 2 clip-on sunglasses. Always wanted to get one to replace my old set years ago. My old ones are either too dented or scratched from Aikido or dropping them now and again. One small news, turns out my old specs degree were a bit high. It was like right eye 500, left eye 700 (astigmatism). But after the tests, it was 500 and 650. Could've reduced it to 625 but the optician said 50 degree reduction is a lot already and she recommends doing 650 instead because the eye needs some adjustment. After this, I met up with Tang for lunch at Mac's and we proceeded back to River Valley High area for Aikido training.  It was my first official lesson with Yuishinkai. Their ki emphasis is definitely a lot more structured then Aikikai. Maybe structured isn't exactly the right word. The thing is they use the words ki, ki direction a lot more than us. Just doing warmups alone, Frankie Sensei went through how our hips, center, arms, ki direction should be going. Very very very detailed. I can understand some but not all. At the end of class, he passed me some forms to fill up and a copy of their syllabus as well as one set of illustration for their warmups. Willl try to scan these in when I get the time, but anyone with Koichi Tohei's movie clip called Authentic Aikido will be able to see everything better. In terms of technique, everything was about redirecting ki, placing yourself, footwork, etc. That doesn't sound so different from what Aikikai style does, but practically to apply what I've learnt from the warmups was a whole different thing. The thing is, there are so many similarities between Yuishinkai style and Ah Hee Sensei's. I guess that's why Freddy Sensei said, all Aikido is the same. Just a lot of different 'brands' out there.  Stupid cough is getting from bad to worse. Think it's the cold drinks I've been taking since Thurs till now. Sigh, have to watch my food and water consumption again. Mon will be the start of term 2 and I need to take the class lessons for the upper primary levels. First week is like my killer week but subsequently the afternoons do get better. But still, I've got a lot of outstanding tasks not done or just started only. Need smokebomb liao, hahaha.

      Need to get so much stuff done today. School holiday almost at an end and I still don't feel like I've finished the most urgent stuff I need to. Looks like I'll be sleeping late tonight.  Tonight's Aikido was great. I took warmup again because Daniel and Darryl were late. But the good thing was that this time I was a lot more composed. My mind was quite empty and I'm pretty sure I took the warmup through the wrong order as well for some. No matter lah, the empty minded feeling I had just made everything feel OK.  We did a lot of iriminages. I managed to do some fairly decent ones tonight. Richard emphasised different way of feeling in iriminage tonight. I understood/felt some, but missed the rest.  I think I'll make it a point to grab different ukes/nages in future practices. Just to feel the techniques.

      Crazy day in school today. Laughed like crazee with Daphne in the lab till people were sure to think we were a bit gila. Bui tahan. But lunch was yummy ... MOS burger + chocolate ice-cream... mmmmm. Need to think what to eat for lunch tomorrow.  Went to grab a haircut today. Another garang haircut. But I still felt it wasn't short enough. Think I told the barber to cut no. 1 along the sides and back. Should've told him no. 0 instead. Anyway while waiting there was a father and son waiting in line just before me. Maybe it's working in a school that's why I seem to be noticing kids more. But this kid was damn cute. He was scrawny and dark and his hair looked like it was cut in durian style a month ago. Just that now it has grown and the hair seems to be protuding from all angles on his head. His father was convincing him to go for a shave with the blade later but he simply refuses. His afraid of the razor blade and insist on just the shaver only.  Dad: Later go for a shave OK? You see, other kor kor so brave. Kid: Dowan. Dad: Want lah. Kid: Dowan.  While waiting his turn, the kid was so hyperactive and was contantly running around. The barber was busy cutting the hair of someone else at the moment.  Dad: Can you don't run around or not? I want to listen to the radio programme. (FM95.8 was on.) I can't remember his exact words but the kid was saying something like this; Kid: When is it my turn? Dad: Later lah when you get into the chair. Kid: (Hops onto the empty barber seat in the middle) I get into the chair already. Dad: Not this one lah. The one the uncle is cutting now (for current customer) lah. Kid: (Blur look.)  When the barber was done. He went for a quick smoke break. The kid settled into the chair to wait. Dad: (Just playing around while waiting for barber) Papa cut for you want or not? Kid: OK lor. Dad: But if Papa cut means must shave one hor (meaning using the razor at the end of the cut). Kid: Dowan. Dad: Want lah. Kid: Dowan. All the while the father was pretending to mess around with his son's head/hair. But it looks more like a head massage for the kid. Dad: (Massaging / messing with son's head.) Kid: (Turned head here and there.) Dad: What are you doing!? Later uncle cut for you can move around like that or not? Kid: Cannot. Dad: Ar, ok ar. Cannot move ar.  Barber comes back and proceeds with haircut. Kid still moves head here and there. And when he doesn't, he moves his hands to scratch his neck (thereby making his head move as well).  To help prevent his son from moving too much, Dad: Ar close your eyes ar. Kid: (Squeezes eyes shut so tight that he appears to be frowning throughout the haircut.)  At the end of the cut, Barber: (To father) Your son's head is like those Indian dancing like that, neck and head cannot stay still one. Dad: (Laughs) Kid: (Staring at his own reflection and new haircut with blur look on his face).  I look at the son and he looks even more impish. Resemble more like a monkey now with his durian/GI cut.  Bloody cute kid, man.

      Lastnight's Aikido was great. Syed came down tonight. Did a lot of practice in terms of proper atemi, combining intent with momentum, flowiness, etc. Both from uke and nage's point of view. It was good. But I think it still took some getting used to because most of us usually did things really slowly. Too slow in fact to be considered proper practice. Like he said, if uke doesn't come in properly, it doesn't benefit either one.  Classes today was quite horrendous. Had to scold 3 out of 4 of the classes I took today. But the good class was exceptional and by far the most obedient so far. Told them about it and asked them to give themselves a round of applause. Haha...  The naughty ones, 2 of which were the older ones in Pri 3. Seriously man, at that age, they feel like they know enough things to be able to take a lot of short cuts and start ignoring instructions. Had to raise my voice at them a few times. Luckily Tracey gave me off tomorrow and school holiday starts next week. I can take the 1 week break itself to rest my voice as I've been feeling a bit of sore throat coming up since 2 days ago. Sigh ... can't imagine how I'll need to discipline the older batch of students later a on.

      Lastnight's Aikido was OK. Paired with a beginner for most part of the first hr. Did things like iriminage, shihonage etc. One thing he tended to do was that after being thrown, he just collapses flat on the mat. Much like what Leon does. I think he doesn't really know that he needs to pop back up asap, or that it's a bit rude in terms of dojo etiquette, and how dangerous it can be if someone just collapses on top of him by accident. Well, nmind lah. His first day, so better not scare him away with all the details yet. Maybe let him know about it the next time I see it.  2nd hr was more different. We did a few pair work for iriminage and kotegaeshi. After that we got into groups for free practice. I think Sensei has gotten a bit sian of us taking so long to get into groups so he basically went "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 group. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, another group." and so on and so on. Well after he finished pointing out my group, I turned around to face everyone. That's when I realised .... Jun was in our grp. I was like "Oh si liao si liao." Then I thought, "Heng ar, not doin nikkyo." Coz I still remembered the 1st or 2nd lesson when we had just joined BV and we did suwariwaza nikkyo. Wah ... the feeling still can remember sia. Anyway, the others in the group were, a law undergrad from NUS (tall pleasant dude I've been training with on and off, pretty decent in terms of technique also - 5th kyu I think), Chin and Lee (the Filipino 3rd kyu, think that's his name right?). Naturally none of us can move Jun in our techniques. The effect was something like this:  Nage: (Struggle with technique. Struggle struggle struggle...) Jun: Can't be moved / thrown. Nage: (Gives up) ...  Jun: (Forward roll himself) Nage: (Laughs at self and thinks ... "How on earth to do it on Jun?")  Well, Lee was quite unlucky for training lastnight. Kept getting small knocks here and there. Jun's iriminage kinda rubbed the gi a bit too hard on his lower mouth so it felt sore after that. Then Jun's shomenuchi kinda went a bit too hard and knock him on the forehead. Well no serious injury came about, but you can really see him getting little knocks by someone every few mins. At the end of class, I spoke to him for awhile and we just laughed it off. Oops ... must remember to burn him a copy of Hattori Sensei's vid to pass him next Tues.

      Class just ended. Gosh ... took quite a drain today. Took 1 class in the morning. Had 1 hr break, took another class, had 1 meeting right after, took a quick lunch, had a nother meeting, break another hr, took 2 classes after that. So tired now, need some Aikido to clear my mind. Hope I won't be too blur tonight. Luckily tomorrow is Sports' Day. I get to wear casual and I may/may not have a halfday. But I'm considering staying later to finish up some work. If I do leave early, I may go grab a haircut instead. But I'm trying to delay it till next Tues instead.  I'm starting to recognise some girls from the classes I'm taking. First was the little one who grabbed my hand in the library. I was walking past her seat and she grabbed my hand to try and ask me a question. Another is from a different class. ALways running around or irritating the friends next to her. Noticed that basically both just want attention. The former doesn't distract others while the latter does.   OK I have to take note lah, can't let the former just happy happy grab my hand or something. Teacher is still teacher lor. Need to maintain some kind of discipline in class.  I'm thinking more on how to 'teach' the latter. I may have to try some 'ignoring' tactics on her. Maybe isolate her by making her seat far away and alone from anyone. She gets really happy when she notices people gettting affected by her actions. Sit with her legs on the chair, places her feet on her friend's seat. Runs around pressing other people's keyboard.  In fact, there are quite a few students who seem particularly slow with the PC. It's either they do not have much contact with a PC, they can't hear my instructions, or they choose not to hear my instructions. Just some that I need to keep an eye out for. May actually have to try shifting them out of their old seats to somewhere where they can see what I'm showing the class.  OK time to go Aikido. WOOHOO!!

      Went to the Career's Exhibition yesterday. Went straight to Ministry of Home Affairs sections and asked around. Basically still no news on SO recruitment. I was told they recruit JOs every month. Haiz, guess I'll just keep asking whenever fairs like these pop up. Went with Tang actually. After that we went over to the libray @ Esplanade. It was one of the 'noisiest' library I've been actually. Coz being some kinda cultural / music hub, they had a malay dance/performance that afternoon. We hung around discussing about some of the politics, rumours, and different styles of Aikido. Even discussed some of our own perception and understanding of Ki, etc. Tang knows a lot. But what I like most about his training is that he kinda learnt by feeling rather than what I'm going thru now. I feel like I need to be told what I should be feeling for.  Not having a really great start to the week actually. Had 1 class followed by 1 meeting with the Pri 4 teachers. I didn't hold this one very well as I'm not sure what to expect and how to go about doing this. But the teachers were really nice and I think they were one of the easiest to speak to.  Next were the Pri 6s' teachers. Tracey was around to help. Really depended on her a lot throughout the meeting. She was really able to push for the eLearning. At elast everything seems to be scheduled rather than get pushed back.  I had my first Pri 3 class just now and they were a difficult bunch. They've reached the age where they can understand you but simply don't just because they think that they know better. Naturally a lof of double work was done. Rule of thumb I learnt. Treat them like Pri 1s until they prove themselves otherwise. Hmm ... maybe I should apply this rule to all of them instead.  After that I had my meeting with the Pri 4 teachers. Only met 4 of them. 1st mistake, I had overlooked informing them this was a meeting with ALL teachers of that level. 2nd mistake, I caught most of them at really bad timings. 3rd mistake, I didn't get my stuff ready before the meeting. Basically this was one of the worst meeting I had. Can feel the teachers actually trying to shove work to me. As much as I'd really like to help them with their stuff. It most probably won't be possible because I'm dealing with every level. I really wished Tracey was around to ofer some help then. I'm sure some would give her some 'mian zi'. In the end, the meeting turned out to be a waste of everyone's time. Nothing concrete was arranged. It was more of 'Let's wait till 2 wks later after sch reopens and we'll see what and how we can do this.' Sigh, seriously lor. I can tell some of them quite resistant to the new system. At least if Tracey was around, she'd know what is considered reasonable and how to compromise. A lot of things I don't know about the teachers and education sys in the sch now, so I'm unable to 'insist' on certain things. I guess I just need to make more friends with them lah. Bo pianz.  Got a class now in fact. P1s, the adorable bunch. Haha...  Meeting cousins (Shouming and Shouwen) for dinner later. Basically just a meet before the latter goes into NS and give him a treat for his As.

      Just checked out the  urlLink National Geographic Asia website . I'm quite interested to catch its Aikido part of the martial art documentary series on the final Fri of Mar. Looks like it might actually be Yoshimitsu Yamada Shihan in the show. I just wish there's someway I can video it down. Argh ... damn VCR spoilt long ago in 1999.

      Went Siglap on Thurs. Training was good. Richard teaches quite well from a point of view. I dunno why I just enjoy training with the beginners there. In this dojo I'm able to functiona  little better because I really feel that every student there see each other as equals regardless of grade. It's good.  Well except maybe Leon. The kid is still young. Typical thing he does is not maintaining posture and having a slack training attitude. Even dojo discipline is qutie bad. But I think given his age, that's still understandable. I dun see him putting much effort when it comes to laying mats. Always comes early, but takes donkey time to put on his gi, and like to walk around the dojo while we lay mats. Ocasionally lays one or two pieces then stops to chit chat and tok kok. The two white belts, Ming Lee and Jeremy, at least lay mats while they chit chat. I like their beginner's attitude, open to learning no matter whether they can do the thing or not. They have no qualms about laying the mats themselves even. I had to suan Leon a bit that night. I said how come he's always walking around and when people lay ten mats he only lays one. Ar well, still young lah. I leave it to him.  Had a long tiring day today. Took 2 classes of Pri 2s this morning. After that there was a meeting with the HoDs of every subject. My manageress came down too. Basically a lot of discussion was done about how they wanted eLearning to go with regards to their dept. We got some really enthusiastic teachers in this school and also soem slack ones (naturally lah). Well, dun wanna comment too much but I didn't get to really rest till like after 3pm. By then I was starving coz I only had a drink of soya bean at 11+. Took some biscuits from Daphne and bought some mashed potato and bread from the canteen. Cheap lah.  Oh yea, some cute thing happened in school too. All the Pri 1s basically know who am I since I've already taken their class. I was popping in the library to look for my HoD when a bunch of Pri 1s who were there during their recess saw me. Here's what happened:  Me (Coming up to library): (To Librarian) Lathifa, did you see Tracey around? Lathifa: She was here just now. Me: Oh never mind then, maybe I'll come back later. Me: (Turns around and see bunch of kids jus behind me. Dun quite recognise them coz I've only met every class once so far.) ??... Kids: (Murmur murmur murmur...) 1 Kid: (Trying to recall my name) Ar ... mister ... ar mister ... ya Mr Tan. Me: Yes? Rest of kids: Ya ya ... it's Mr Tan. Me: Yes? Why? (as I tried making my way thru them towards the lib's exit). OK come let me pass first. Kids: (Crowd even closer. 1 girl to my left saw my hand just in front of her and just happily grab it.) Me: ???? ... yes? why? (While still making my way towards the Librarian and the door.)  I need to go meeting now OK? Me: (Amused) ... (walks over to Librarian and looks to her for help.) Lathifa: They like you lah. Me: Come, need to let go. Mr Tan needs to go for a meeting now OK? I'll come back later. Kid (with my hand): (Hugs hand around her neck and shakes her head. - Think the aircon was quite cold for the kids and my hand was like quite warm - I think that's why she didn't wanna let go lah.) Lathifa: OKOK, Mr Tan got meeting lah. Kids: (Start to disperse. Girl lets go of my hand also.)  Here's when the recess bell rang. (Saved by the bell.)  Me: OK... byebye (still feeling damn amused as I made my way back to the conference room). Kids: Byebyyyyyyye (while rushing around like ants).  Hahahaha ... cute hor.  Skipped training at Yuishinkai today because after the long schedule today I didn't feel mentally competent to be able to do anything besides dropping dead on my bed tonight. Tried my best to catch the documentary on National Geographic about Muay Thai. But seriously, was way to taxed to do so.  Shouwen (cousin) got his As today. B, C, D. Dunno for what subjects. His GP was a B3 I think. Anyway, the male cousins will be meeting for dinner at Suntec next Mon. Gonna be eating at my fren's place - Swiss Culture ... again. Haha ... can't help it lah, we like the food there.

      OK let me just update what's been happening after Sun.  Mon I took my first classes. All Pri 1s. The first class was more hyper and I felt more lost on how I to 'teach' them. The next class was slightly better. However, being Pri 1s, it kinda took me 1 hr just teaching them how to login to the sys. That's normal lah since they're still so young. Tues, I took 1 teachers training in the morning and 2 Pri 1 classes again. Teachers training was slow but I did gain some insight on how I can conduct classes/workshops with them in future. Same thing for Pri 1s. But I think I'm either getting faster, or the classes are getting more obedient or are generally just more quick in learning because they seem to be going 1 step further than each of the previous classes. Anyway, just to share some cute moments in my classes.  In my first class. Bunch of Pri 1 kids raises hands and calling me: 'Miss'ter Tan, Miss Tan. Me: ... Me (to kids): Mr Tan  Trying to keep the class quiet. Me: Class be quiet. Girl: Keep quiet lah keep quiet lah... Me: (thinking to self) *She's making more noise than any of the others.*  Trying to 'por' them a bit just to get their attention. Me: Is MO1 an obedient class? Class: YEEEES!!!  After giving instructions. Me: Who has any problems raise your hand. Girl: (Raises hand) Me: (Walks over) Yes, what's your problem? Girl: No, I finished already. Me: ...  Something I heard last Sat on the bus to school/work. We were passing the Sheares Bridge over the Kallang River where you can see some nice condos on the river front. Daughter (Pri school age) to Father: Actually I want to stay here one (Points to condos). Father: Ya, I want to stay here also. Daughter: Next time I will built a house here. Father: A house? Why not a bank? Me (cannot tahan liao): (Smirking and controlling laughter. Exchanged smiles with the father.)  Kids say the darnest things...  Tonight's Aikido class was kinda disappointing. I didn't think I managed to pick up much or remember enough of it. Worse still my sitting kokyuho seems to be worse after switching partners. Seriously man, need some serious help on this. Managed to remember to bring down my grading booklet for Sensei to sign my 5th kyu grading after such a looooong while. When I renewed my membership, I think I forgot to tell him and he kinda just missed it as well. Also finally remembered to bring down Hattori Sensei's old video clips on CD to pass to Han via Sensei. Again something I've been owing for mths now. These days memory seriously not too good leh.  At the end of practice, Sensei said the Aikido trip to Hanoi has been confirmed. It'll be from 15-18th Apr and it costs S$900+. More expensive than Bangkok. Haiz, bopians. Can't go anywhere this year I think.  At the end of class I asked Sensei if it's OK for me to train 1 day each week with Yuishinkai. He thought it over for a few seconds and simply said that sounded OK. I'm quite glad really, hope I can learn something from both sides. I'll try to blog what I can whenever I can after each training.

      Work was ok. Updated my HoD yesterday about some stages of my work and I still felt like I was behind a lot of things I wanted to accomplish. But I got a reply from her saying that I was "doing a great job". So encouraging but also hope that I can do better.  Met up with Robin today. Like I was telling Daphne, coz on several occasions when I tried to meet with Robin, a lot of things would go wrong, I was kinda expecting the same thing to happen today. Things were ok lah, he was there waiting already when I got to Dhoby Ghaut MRT. The evening and dinner was quite uneventful. We couldn't quite agree on a movie so we juz settled for makan instead. He'd already seen 2 of the 3 shows I was hoping to catch. Oh well... I had to admit, things were quite boring over dinner coz I didn't really know what to say and all that lah. But after dinner we went Kinokuniya at Taka and browsed through some books for awhile. After that we went to grab coffee (well, tea for him lah) at Coffee Bean. There we had a good chat about family, life, philosophy of living, etc. Basically a superficial start in the evening ended with a good chat at night.  When I got home, I realised Zatoichi was still showing at Cineleisure... only there in fact. Gotta catch it latest this weekend before they stop showing it. Wasted though, could've caught it tonight.  Oh yar 1 more thing, traded in my Samsung T100 for the new Samsung E700. Quite cool lor. Didn't think I'd like it but I really do. Need to take good care of it. My new toy ... hehe ;P

      Those girls can really ji siao me.  On top of always pairing Daphne and I together just because we lunch often and work in the Labs, they were a but more thick skinned than usual yesterday.  After lunch I entered the lab to find Laura (a Mandarin teacher) with her class. They were typing words in Mandarin inside Winword. So I just hung around coz I had nowhere better else to go. As the lesson ended, some girls approached me saying there was something wrong with their elearning account so I tried to settle it for them asap. As the other students were making their way out of the class, some girl shouted to Laura in Mandarin "Huang lao4 shi1! XXXX (god knows who) likes Mr Tan!!" The other girls giggled here and there and Laura also found it amusing. I would probably eng siu them a bit by some kind of boliao reply if I wasn't in the midst of settling the elearning accounts on the spot. I basically ignored them, didn't even bothered giving them a look. I vaguely heard Laura saying something to me, and though I didn't mean to, I ignored her comment as well. (Oops, hope she wasn't speaking to me directly or directing a question at me then.) Anyway I heard someone saying "Ahhhhaha, Mr Tan paiseh lah." And I still ignored everyone else in class (except the 2-3 students waiting for me to settle their accounts). After I finished my task on the PC, I looked up to realise only 2 students were waiting. The other girls with account problems had already left. Idiots ... what did they expect me to do when they haven't given me enough details. Anyway I didn't manage to solve everyone's problem then and they deserve it too. I'm not their servant where you just tell me to do it and you walk off like that.  At this time I also just realised that Laura and the rest of the class had left sometime ago. Oh well, like I said, if I'm concentrating real hard, I can be dead to the world and just ignore everything else. Just hope Laura didn't think I was brushing off her comments/questions then, that's all.  Ar ... got a birthday present from Juliana and Asuka from Birmingham. Quite touched. It was a shirt and knowing how expensive things are in UK, I think the shirt easily cost them S$80-100+, and that's excluding mailing the whole thing over. Geez ... gotta send them my thanks.  Will be quite a busy week ahead. But I promised myself to work on the courseware which I need to submit back to my company on 30th Apr. To make it worse, I need to finish up my mthly report, wkly report, and misc shitz as well. Fish lah... tomorrow still need to get a new phone coz my line is under my sis's name and she is free only tomorrow afternoon. Oh boy. Think I'll have a hard time breathing. Only silver lining is that my parents will be leaving dunno which day for a tour in China or Korea, I also can't remember. Woohoo! Bo Zeng Hu (no governing authority) for 10 days.

      So much to blog about. Past few days saw a lotta things, felt a lotta things as I passed people, listened to people, heard of events, and experiences of my own. Was reading Guilian's last 3 posts on her OD and I gotta admit. Since lastnight I was in the same mood as her. Dunno why, just feeling damn bored and lifeless, slightly pekchek over nothing in particular. Blasting some music now. Most friends know that though I dun chiong, I enjoy a bit of noisy music like remixes and all that. Nothing completely techno or heavy metal type (can't stand those at all) ... Eargh!!   Aikido @ Siglap (Thurs night)   Something I was telling Gary on Thurs night after training at Siglap. Leon was his usual joker self during training. Was quite rude and not serious at all. Usually I didn't find that to be a problem. But that evening I felt a little indignant about things. Even Richard got more serious with the class in general. Made us sit down and gave us a lecture on etiquette and attitude. These days I found myself getting impatient with Leon also. And the effect of it is that I may tend to tell him too much what he's doing wrong and he's feeling so sianz that he pays even less attention to what he's doing. I might have to watch myself and converse less with him. He likes to ask and ask but never quite listens when he is being answered. Oh what the heck lah, I'm not his teacher anyway. Shouldn't even be teaching him anyway. Weird thing is I never face that much of a problem with the other 2 beginners. So I also dunno, is it Leon, me, or wat? What I remembered most distinct about training with Leon is that we were training halfway and he just walked over to another pair next to us to help 'demo' with one of the guys. I was like just standing there facing the wall where my partner was standing a few seconds ago. Damn rude. Richard saw it and that's when he told him to get back and not just walk off like that. Leon's attitude on and off the mat is the same, slacker attitude and not really putting much serious effort in anything. Can tell even when he is laying the mats. When he lays just 1 pc of mat, he literally sits down and starts fitting in the jigsaw mat. We always lay our mats in a ready position because it only lasts like 15-20 seconds, so there has never been a need to sit down. Sitting down and getting up again waste more energy and nobody I know does that. Only Leon. You can tell he is maintaining that 'after I sit down I don't want to get up again' mindset. Same thing when he does his Aikido. After being pinned to the ground, he stays there so long before picking himself up. Bad thing is 1 new brown belt girl (prob from kids class too) is kinda taking for granted that mat laying is a guy's responsibility. I don't see her helping at all though she gets to class a bit early. As a junior I don't think I should say anything to her directly, but last Thurs was seriously tempted. Why? Because I really don't want new blood to come into the dojo, see a senior not doing anything, and just follow suit. Being in a Pri sch now, I realise a lot of thing depends on a good foundation. We are literally cultivating the next generation of people (whether in school, society or in our dojo) and if they do not learn things the right way at the very start, it will be difficult to change them later on. But at the same time I'm also worried of the effect that may arise, what if for eg, this brown belter gets sian of being told to lay mats each time, may feel like I'm picking on her, then just keep arriving late to siam the mats? Also got a negative effect. There's no 100% method I guess. Dunnoz, may just speak up coming week when I see Leon and her again. Leon for one needs the extra work. He's been an orange belt for 3 yrs and I think it only shows one thing, that he has been stagnant for the past 3 yrs coz his mind is not moving forward. I've heard of pple avoiding taking the grading tests but never of the case that Sensei keeps one at his current belt level, probably because of his wrong mentality and attitude.   Friends   Friday came. Was really looking for ward to meeting some friends from Uni that evening. Was great seeing some familiar faces again like Begh, Lynette, Darren. Dinner itself was nothing special, just KFC. A bit quiet though we did talk quite a bit of crap. Usual lah, with Darren and me around, you can't quite expect too much serious talk. After that we went for coffee at Raffles Link. Nice place, but too bad it seemed a wee bit more enclosed. I still prefer Spinelli at Heeren but these days I figured it's just way too hot to sit anywhere without aircon. After that we left about 10-ish. Got home and I SMSed everyone that it was nice to meet up after so long. Got some SMSs back. But this Begh ar, said "Since when did I get so sentimental." Kinda got me thinking. I must be mellowing with old age. Harhar...  Just brought to mind how much I haven't kept in contact with my friends. It was only recently that I sent a short email out to my Poly classmates and updated what I knew of each other. Was glad that I got some mail back from everyone as well. Think I've kinda become the unofficial database administrator already. Probably arrange some meet up after James's wedding dinner. Despite these people, I've also failed to update groups from NS, people I knew from Aikido in UK, Birmingham Uni (there's a bigger group besides those I met up on Fri), my English housemates from 1st year Uni, and some really close friends from here and there. Funny how convenient you just let these friends slip out of view as time passes. With some lucky ones, you'll still be the same no matter how infrequent you meet up with each other. But with many, you'll just loose touch quickly.   Work   At work also some very small matters going on here and there. Overall I'm glad teachers aren't completely shunning elearning out despite their already busy schedule. But I think I need to do more as well. Gotta start prioritising my work. On the whole, I get quite a chunk of quizzes from teachers to convert into elearning during the past 1 wk plus. A bit overloaded all of a sudden. But they seem to be clearing up. Had to turn back 2 quizzes from teachers until my load is relieved a bit. I won't say it's unbreathable lah, but just that it seems like everyone is fighting fire at the last minute so deadlines are all packed in a bit close that's all. A bit too much all of a sudden that's all. Daphne was feeling down yesterday also. Shan't say too much except that it's all work related. I dunnoz, I dun feel that kinda pressure she does. In fact, any pressure I feel is mostly temporary and I never let them get to me for long. Maybe coz I'm more bochup lah, but it's only coz I know that if I dwell too much on the 'here and now' I'll just get stuck and stop moving on.  Plus the fact that the kids are constantly making fun when they see the both of us together. Dunnoz, again I'm not so bothered coz they seem to direct this more at her than me. I don't normally get affected by these but Daph sure seems to be. Seriously lor, maybe I need to step in to make them learn a bit of respect. Dun wanna use army style on them lah but last Fri itself I just did (again). 1 group of students came in to use the lab PCs and Daphne asked one of them (anyone of them) to go check on whether another lab is empty so that she can bring them over there for the lesson. Immediately one by one they just went "Chop! Cannot call me!" then another went "Chop!" followed by another and another. Most friends will know lah, I cannot stand that kind of attitude one so my response to that was "AR! You chop somemore! Chop somemore lah, I make sure ALL of you go to the lab and come back here together instead of just one of you!" They still proceeded to ignore my statement and went on "Chop! Chop! Chop!" So I said, "OK I count to 10. 1 of you better go or else it's all of you. 1, 2, 3, 4 ..." And one kid (group leader apparently) decided to go. Really man, army style. Haiz ...   Home   Getting exceeding irritated with small little things at home though I try very hard not to be. For one thing, my parents get really cynical at times. Eg if they see something on the news, they say things like "Ya they so stupid" or "These people deserve it." Basically really machiam Luo4 Jing3 Xia4 Shi2 type of comments. These days rather than comment too much I just step aay and go back to my room. Think it's all I can do, by removing myself out of the equation, nothing will happen. Another thing is my sis. She is so ji4 jiao4 when it comes to some small things. For instance, just eg. I was the last to come back home for dinner. She was in the midst of finishing her last remnants of food when I placed a plate in the sink (for washing). While I was finishing my soup, she washer her own bowl and can't even help to wash a bit of the stuff in the sink. Seriously I dare say I never consciously leave thigns in the sink for her to wash. If I do, it's only because I've already washed the first batch of stuff with soap and the soap on the sponge has gotten too diluted for another batch. I figured since she'll be washing after me, she can clear the next batch. Even so, I try to maximise the soap by leaving her very little washing. She's really taking things for granted liao. Even though things are right in front of her she can siam it like it doesn't exist. Really, if you want me to be frank, I have to say that there's a very good reason why she is still single. She'll be a horrible wife and I would pay my deepest respect to the man out there who can change her someday. OK, make no mistake. I'm not perfect either, but I think I'm not as particular about these things like she does. In fact my whole household seems to be that way. My parents also get this idea I'm very particular about small things and keep asking me before they do this or that to the extent it's irritating. I can only say that it's because they themselves are very particular people so they assume their son to be the same. I'm really really irritated at the way things are.   People in General   My conversation during lunch at BK with Daphne still rings clearly in my mind. People in Singapore gets damn haolian sometimes. Arrogance is what I call it. Just walking out of the fastfood they can not even bother to close the door again and let the aircon out like that. Geez. I'm really worried about the next generation of people when the current ones show these kind of examples. What type of people are we trying to cultivate. Being in school everyday I sometimes look up to what teachers are doing. MOE's slogan "Moulding the Future" holds true. But how many of them really believe in that when they took up NIE's offer/contract? Most just do it because of the economic downturn to get a job. What's the point in that? And S'pore govt itself is still way too result/academic oriented to get down and dirty during the filtration process to filter out un-committed people. Same thing I'm feeling for the SPF. I'm aware that uniform services sees a huge group of people leaving each year, but they only have themselves to blame for taking in the uncommitted people in the first place. Geez... really, we can see how a person or people in general are from the little things they do. Do you condemn someone just because of a sudden outburst? Natural for humans to be biased based on a first impression. But open outburst like that are not accurate. The best way to judge a person I think is if you take note of their behavior during the other times. When a person gets angry, it's because something happened and clouded their usual emotions instead. (Of course, those who have frequent outbursts ALL the time, definitely have a problem there lah.) We gotta remember not to let their emotions cloud us the same way it does to them. It only takes a celebrity 1 misbehaviour in public outside to destroy his/her reputation. But I think that can be so unfair to them. They are human afterall.   Movies   Really felt so bored lastnight I'm considering catching a show alone if I have to. Never tried that before. Anyway I was flipping the papers and came across some shows on my list. Zatoichi (some samurai film on a blind swordsman), Hellboy and Starsky & Hutch (comedy), just to name a few." Will see how lah...   Aikido @ ARCC   Was   late for training yesterday. Took 197 all the way from Parkway to Jurong interchange. Really roundabout journey. Took me 2 hrs to get there. I was late of course. And I didn't get anything right. We did static exercises/techniques for a long while but the moment I tried out non-static ones, all the basics went out the window - from moving hips first to simple arm and foot movements. Was quite disappointed with my practice yesterday. Only thing I really took with me, was the fact that I will never take 197 to Jurong East from Parkway anymore. But Frankie Sensei has a very good way of breaking down the exercises and techniques. I've decided to start doing their exercises more regularly at home every few days to familarise myself with the basics and fundamentals. Even just how to hold the bokken is like so difficult for me to grasp. Everytime there's the statement "extend ki" I'd just go "...." Heh ... I'm only glad I'm wearing my white belt during training instead of blue.  Beginner's mind, beginner's mind, beginner's mind, beginner's mind, beginner's mind ....................   Weather   Weather has been soooooo daaaaaaamn HOT! I have trouble sleeping everynight. I'm perspiring like a pig at home every night. Luckily I just bought 2 cans of prickly heat powder. These days I put some before going to work. When I get home I powder myself with so much powder after my bath, that it gets ultra cold for a good 5 mins or so. But at least it helps prevent me from feeling all sitcky and yucky at home. MMmmmm .... prickly heat powder. Again, another army must have item.

      Last 2 day's exhibition at Expo is finally over.  Sat's was quite good. Syed and Richard came down for it together with students from Pillars and Siglap. I thought everything seemed really well arranged for the day even though it was more or less impromptu. Lucky Richard was quite soft, and I managed some of the more decent ukemi for him. Syed again went throught his 'Seagal-like' randori and techniques. 'Eastern Seagal' was the term used hahaha. Thought the weather wasn't exactly forgiving, I thought the atmosphere was generally pretty relaxed during training.  Today's was conducted by Sensei himself and Alvin came down as well. More senior students turned up here and I really wanted to concentrate more on training instead. Sunny was around, and of course I didn't dare commit myself to most of his techniques. But that's no reason to stop nor, hope someday I can take more decent ukemi and his techniques.  Overall, I enjoyed yesterday's exhibition a bit more. Can't explain it, it just felt more like the usual class I'm accustomed to. Today, well I got the feeling that we were a lot more conscious of this as an exhibition than went through it like a normal class. Again, it was seriously warm and even Alvin didn't seem like his usual self. He looked like he was sweating a lot more than usual. Syed dropped by but didn't join the mat.'  Didn't manage to stay all the way to help with the mats coz Tang was waiting for me. After that, told Sensei sorry I couldn't stay (coz we loaned the mats to a Hanmudo exhibition after us and could only keep mats after them) and went to Bedok with Tang. We grabbed a bite there and talked for hours over Aikido. Dunnoz lah, we tend to discuss things like that. One thing about Tang is that he's as real on the mat as he is off the mat. So I learn a lot of things from him in terms of attitude and all that.  Anyway, can't wait to go back to regular training class soon. I've even planned to train up to 5 days a week when my parents go off to China at the end of the month for a holiday. Which reminds me, I better schedule my leave early to let my HoD approve soo it won't interfere with work then.

      Last night's training was OK. Syed did pop by the dojo but not to train, he only stayed awhile and then he left. Think the rest of the guys in Siglap will be popping by Expo on Sat. I guess if they are doing so, I should do the same. Emailed Frankie Sensei to inform him that I may not be going ARCC this Sat and I might pop by the Expo exhibition to help out Freddy Sensei & AFS instead. But that also means I'll be missing my weapons class this Sat. Drat!  Had a stroke of promising review from Richard lastnight, he said I had an "advantage" because I kept training with beginners both in Siglap and BV, and that he sees me improving. That's one thing about some of the slightly senior belts, they sometimes tend to siam white belters. I'd personally prefer to take a white belter first, and then rotate partners later on in the class if only I can be sure the white belter I'm leaving behind is able to get a decent partner. Hmm ... not trying to inflate my ego but I also pondered, what area did I improve on? I did feel that last night's training was smooth, I didn't get myself lock down by a stiff uke or anything. I dunnoz also. My uke is only into his first month of training and I also think he has improved. He's beginning to know how to follow nage's movement in a certain way. When we did Shihonage, he was even able to tell me that he was falling down when I wasn't even applying the lock and pulling him to the ground. I was surprised because he took the words from right out of my mouth. I really wanted to tell him not to anticipate what I was about to do. I'm sure he doesn't quite realise it, but he does a pretty decent job at maintaining his hands in front of him when he did shihonage as well as the initial hand movement of diverting uke's ki relatively naturally. I had to follow follow follow and I found myself rising up and down because of his height.Not on purpose but because he was actually controlling me.  But things change when I pair with a more senior belt. Maybe that means I can't blend properly as an uke? Maybe it means my ukemi still got some major problem I need to concentrate on. Food for thought, which aspect of Aikido did I improve on so far and which area is still lagging far behind? Hmmmmm...  Anyway, I know students from Pillars will be down on Sat as well, probably gonna see a lot of slamming again hehe...  Tonight went on to watch Passion of Christ with my aunts, uncles and family. Originally thought it was a family / relatives event. But when I got there, the freaking number of crowd entering the cinema made me realise it was a church which booked the whole cinema. Look, I have nothing against Christians / Christianity but I honestly can't stand events like these. Most of my freinds are aware I dislike crowds as well so I really felt doubly irritated. To be fair, the show was really well made. I didn't realise it wasn't an English film until when the show started. Very interesting. Movie was enjoyable just not the atmosphere. Sure, I realised it was Good Friday lah. I guess I should've expected something like that. But it only strengthened my conviction that I really don't wanna hang around a Christian crowd. Note that I said 'crowd', not people. Christian people, I have no problem with. Just not like such a huge crowd kinda size. Worse still, at the end of the show they actually turned off the credits and started to sing 1-2 Christian songs. Dammit! I'm the type who would rather take a look at the credits at the end of the show. People who work in the background are often taken for granted. Sometimes the least we can do is finish watching the credits - especially if the movie was a great one. Was basically showing my black face throughout and I hardly spoke to anyone of my relatives and family from the moment I entered Cineleisure (not the cinema yet), till the journey to Suntec for dinner. Think they could tell also that's why they basically left me alone as well. I'm feeling guilty about that but sorry lah, I show my mood quite frankly around relatives. Not that I'm bratty, just that I feel that sometimes no need to put on a mask among people you feel close to. Going to Suntec, I complained to Daphne via SMS about the whole thing hahaha ... Ms PA indeed, always there to hear me complain about stuff.  Luckily I had a great dinner at Swiss culture. (My sis's treat to my family coz she just got her promotion/pay increment.) My mood was basically turned around because of the dinner. Good lah, I wanna look back and remember the show for what it's really good at, not the environment of the cinema. That's giving the film due credit where it really deserves.

      Aikido was good today. Dunno why but things felt smooth and I actually found myself coming to terms with some kind of understanding. We only did shihonage, iriminage and kotegaeshi. Sensei asked for volunteers for the exhibition at Expo this coming Sat and Sun. I'm not sure I'll be able to attend Sat because of training at Ayer Raja CC. But I may go for it if Sensei really need people there. See how lor, but seriously I really want to go for my training at ARCC.  Yay parents going China end of this month for about 10 days. I think for that week or so, I'll plan to go down to BB East on Mon. Haven't exactly attended Alvin's classes for ages liao.

      The kids in school haven't been giving me too much trouble. The usual lah. I've found 2 classes who really have a lot of character. They may appear somewhat 'arrogant' the first few seconds you see them. But I think they display a level of confidence that makes them so at ease with being around people they've only met a few times (namely me lah). Class JO5, the group of girls who were screaming at the ghostly website I mentioned in my last post, and AM6, my HoD's form class. These two classes are really really alike that I find it quite intriguing, considering the fact ehy have different form teachers.  Just remembered that James called me sometime ago. He's inviting me to his wedding dinner on 7 May. But I think he probably won't be inviting most of our classmates down because he don't feel like he knows everyone that well. But I think he has to bear a part of that responsibility because he's been flying us so many aeroplane the past few years. Shuhua's gonna be invited so I guess that's one familar face there, whew. I think Yvonne and husband will be invited as well.  Failed the company test I took about 2 wks ago. When I went back yesterday for re-training, I finally understood why. Seems like I failed to attach the file I was working on and I basically failed the practical part. Geez man, what a waste. I coulda passed. It's ok doing the things again because I didn't find them to be too much of a problem. But I sure felt like I made a wasted trip down. Oh man...  Training at Ayer Raja CC was nice. I realised my mentality is changing a little. Originally I wanted to train with Yuishinkai hoping that it will improve my Aikido. But I found myself feeling twice as stupid, twice as lost, twice as lousy. But I still enjoyed the experience because it opened up another area to me that I've not felt before. Also made me realise that I may need to work twice as hard to reach the standard I hope to arrive at someday. Gotta gambatte in this area.  Spoke to Marcus (Poly classmate) lastnight and found out he's been posted onboard one of Singapore's submarine. Of course lah, considering he's a submariner. We talked about the usual blah blah about people to people relationship at work which you can find almost everywhere. Shared with him what I've been going through in my job since Feb. Was quite interesting and enjoyable having such a long conversation again. Found out Ivy's having another baby coming end of Aug. Woohoo ... damn happy for the both of them. Haha... I asked hime whether it was planned or accidental and he said they did plan for it but didn't expect the next one to come so early only.  A bit of reflection since my last post. Realised I've not been keeping to much in touch with my friends and old classmates. Feeling kinda guilty over this also. Spoke with Bin Soon via MSN also few weeks ago and realised some of our friends have switched companies. Think he's doing fine as well. Seriously man, hope to meet with them someday but I doubt this month is gonna be good for me. Think I better update our usual bunch via email soon.  On ICQ, I asked someone how was her day and I got a statement asking me to check out her blog. I'm not trying to criticise or direct this at anyone but I'm just trying to recollect and understand the thoughts that came to my mind after that. Sigh, I remember telling someone (could it be Gary? Lynette? Roy?) to go read my blog a long time ago, think it was around the time when I started blogging. Idea was just to get people to read my blog so I was quite excited about 'promoting' its existence. But I realised that that's so lame. If I ever direct someone I know to go read my blog rather than take a bit of effort to tell them about it, it only goes to show the person I am, the way I treat them, or value them. Nonono... I absolutely refuse to do so from this day forth. If I can't even bother talking to them (via phone or ICQ), why would/should they even bother talking to me, or respond in kind? Everything goes both ways. I gotta start treating people the way I want them to treat me.

      I love this.... really. It's one of the principles I live by. I only hope I can apply it in almost every situation I experience. Don't know if anyone is able to view the chinese characters in this entry.  &nbsp;   &#19990;&#19978;&#30340;&#20107;  ,    &#26080;&#21892;&#20134;&#26080;&#24694;  ,    &#26080;&#23545;&#20134;&#26080;&#38169;  .   &nbsp;  In this world, there is no good and evil, no right and wrong.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &#25152;&#35859;&#30340;&#21892;&#24694;&#23545;&#38169;  ,    &#21482;&#26159;&#23384;&#20046;&#19968;&#24515;  .   &nbsp;  What we know to be good and evil, exists only in one's state of mind.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &#20320;&#20043;&#25152;&#20197;&#22914;&#27492;&#22256;&#33510;  ,    &#30342;&#22240;&#20320;&#22826;&#37325;&#35270;&#20182;&#20154;&#22914;&#20309;&#30340;&#30475;&#24453;&#20320;  .   &nbsp;  The reason that you feel troubled, is because you view others' opinions of you to be of great importance.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &#20854;&#23454;&#20570;&#20154;&#21482;&#35201;&#38382;&#24515;&#26080;&#24871;&#23601;&#20250;&#24555;&#20048;&#20102;  .    One will be able to be happy if one is able to face his own conscience.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &#24754;&#20134;&#22312;&#25105;&#24515;  ,    &#21892;&#20134;&#22312;&#25105;&#24515;  ,    &#22806;&#29289;&#19982;&#25105;&#20309;&#20248;&#21705;  .   &nbsp;  Sadness within me, goodness within me, external factors has nothing to do with me.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &#19968;&#20999;&#29575;&#24615;&#32780;&#20026;  ,    &#20294;&#27714;&#24515;&#20043;&#25152;&#23433;  .   &nbsp;  Act with frankness, but ask only for peace of mind.    Yes I know it sounds wee bit profound. Sorry, not meant to be. I can only blame my poor translation skills haha. It makes more sense in chinese.

      Wah, Guilian actually put what I said about her honours into her OD. OK lor, it's nice to be appreciated I guess.  Right, have been laggin behind my regular blogs. Simple reason to it, I've been procrasitnating work and getting disorganised. I realised how it's affected even my personal life. Not physically but in mindset. My mind don't feel totally relaxed even over the weekends, I tend to forget / overlook stuff easily, etc. (oh no! senile liao!)  At least past few days I'm getting back into things. Haha, suddenly from watching all the Yi Tian Tu Long Ji vcd, I got a craving to play chinese games again. Was replaying my Jin Yong Qun Xia Zuan again. I think it's gonna be a long game man. Slowly lah, rushing also no use.  On Aikido, gee, realised I've been mising a lot of trainings at BV past 3 wks. In fact, think it was something like since Freddy Sensei went Vietnam. Alamak, I better decide properly whether I'll be training in Pillars or BV. And decide soon I must. At least I've been really consistent at Siglap and ARCC.  I suspect that I'm beginning to compare things in different dojos and clubs. But even under AFS, I Siglap gives me such a nice feeling compared to BV. Someone once told me, the average joe in BV trains so hard and so much but they don't seem to be improving much. Why ar? I have to admit that I'm kinda inclined to agree. From a personaly point of view, I see myself that way. Maybe that's why I really want to jump out of the box a bit to experience something different. Yesterday pia like siao to BV only to oversleep on the bus all the way to the interchange. Missed Aikido lor. Wasted, apparently Tomita Shihan, 8th dan, from Belgium was conducting the class. I didn't have the fortune to experience his lesson. Head his class was quite profound, but I'm interested in these. We don't get enough on this aspect I think. Won't be able to go BB East for training today (Tomita Shihan again). I never get to BB East on time one. Previous time I rushed like siao there to see them doing kokyu ho as a final exercise. Yestrday I got there in time to help keep some mats only. Must admit I felt quite sian lah.  Never mind lah, take things as they come.  I feel quite happy because Steff from 1st year is visiting S'pore with 4 friends. They are all English. Will be meeting them later for dinner, but a bit of delimma as to where to take them for dinner. Thinking of giving them a bit of treat if dinner isn't too expensive. Daphne was suggesting Don Noodles at Park Mall. Just nice since I'm meeting the girls at Dhoby Ghaut MRT. This week gonna be quite chor coz I'm not makaning at home at all until the weekends. ~$~

      Guilian got her results today. She's feeling so disheartened because she truly believes that she will be getting 3rd class honours. Makes her doubt herself a little, I believe. She now has a choice whether she should file for graduation (deadline is this Fri) or to continue and get a 3rd class next yr.  This brings back some memories on my thoughts and feelings about getting 3rd class. I remember doing badly after yr 2 (technically speaking it's my first yr because I actually skipped 1st yr and entered 2nd yr of the degree programme), so I had to repeat 2 modules. That delayed my studies by 1 yr because in UK, exams comes only at end of academic year.  Read some comments on her OD and I can see the expected comments she's probably getting from most of her friends around her. Things like "No lah, not worth the extra 1 yr lah - for 3rd class", "3rd class pay and Bachelor/Merit degree pay no diff lah", "wat for". Problem with us Singaporeans is that we think too realistically. We can't take failures man. I think it was DPM Lee Hsien Loong who said "If you are totally focused on your studies and other preoccupations, then perhaps you are sleeping but not dreaming. It is time for you to wake up and dream." Just an extract that was given to me last week (coincidentally).  One thing I can relate this to is Aikido. It's like when taking grading tests. It's not a paper chase. So what does it matter if it takes us 10yrs to achieve Shodan. Now, if what I want is a black belt, I can get that in 10min. Just pop down to the sports store down the corner and buy one lor. But if I want to learn something from Aikido, it's a different story. Sorry, I digressed a bit (it is MY blog afterall wahahaha!). My thoughts on the belt system in Aikido. Being a senior coloured belt don't mean you are better than one with a junior coloured belt. It only shows you the length of time, effort and commitment you've put into training so far. I believe results are the same way. But most of us take it as a  "I'm better than you" kind of system. Face it, no matter how good you are, you will never be the best because somewhere along the line there's always someone better. The moment you think that you have achieved a certain mark, that's when you will stop improving. No point comparing your results with others. If you get 3, there's someone wif a 2:2. If you get 2:2, there's always one with a 2:1. If you get 2:1, there's another with a 1. If you get 1, you think that's it? Oh pls, there's always someone stronger/better/richer than you in someway that will make you look at him/her and just go "waaahh!!" in awe.  We're so trapped in the paper chase, results status and all that we forget wat on earth we are doing in Uni. That aside, I don't have any delusions about why I studied what I did. For me, after 3 yrs of Computer Studies in Poly, 2yr-3yrs of Comp Sci in Uni, I've arrived to the conclusion that pure hardcore IT work is not for me. Though it took me almost 6 yrs to arrive to this conclusion I still never found it a waste. Where are you rushing that you can't afford 1, 2 or even 3 extra yrs of your life? It's not how fast you get something that makes it memorable. It's the process and how you get it. My mom has a bad habit when we go holidays. She likes to make it as cheap as possible by rushing to as many places as possible, reach the entrance, take a photo to show "I was here", if admission is chargeable then leave and go to the next spot. I kept telling her it's not reaching the places that count, like in a touring marathon. It's enjoying the places you've been. Even if you stay in one spot but you're able to truly enjoy/appreciate the really simple things it has to offer. I tell you, you will remember it as one of the most memorable holidays of your life.  The things I picked up those 6 yrs? Life overseas, Aikido, friends. All precious and things that I wouldn't trade for anything in the world. I think I deserve everything I have now. If I didn't work hard enough for some things, what I get at the end of it is, well ... mine. The good and the bad. Everything is relative. I can't just expect the good things and shun the bad right. That's not how this reality works. You take the good with the bad. Balance, yin and yang, positive and negative, chaos and order, etc. The only thing I regretted when I kokked up my 2nd yr was that I actually spent such a huge amt of money in UK that yr and not work hard enough. Sure I was guilty, but I had to get over it. Harping on it only holds me back.  So thinking about this, I suppose that explains why I'm really quite happy with my 3rd class. I've managed to endure through the whole process of things. Graduated too. Sure, during graduation I was the last few person to collect my results. Basically everyone at the convo can tell that I'm a 3rd class student. But I can tell you, when I see the fellows behind me. I feel elated that I had chosen to complete the whole course when I did. It's nothing about ego - not being the worst / being better than some others. I still felt really proud to put on the gown and being present for graduation that day. It was 1 heckuva moment for me. I still stood tall and proud. You have to know and recognise what you have achived in order to do that. Acknowledge your failures, accept them and you will recognise your achivements as well.  I can only hope each one of us really think about what we want. When we know it, we will then know what we need to do next.

      Wah, can't believe it man. Haven't been updating my blog for a while. These days the frequency of my blogging is getting pretty irregular. I wondered why, think it's because I'm starting to let things get more and more messed up when it comes to prioritising work and play. I guess that's what happens, people who manage their time well will always have time for everything. Whereas once I let myself get too disorganised, I will always find that I'm fighting time all the time.  Actually I did have a lot of things I wanted to blog about. But I may not recall everything now.   Aikido @ Siglap   Siglap CC saw a new student. A Japanese (national I think), by the name of Sakai. He's a judo yudansha, but I'm not aware of which dan. Was told he seems stiff but haven't quite seen his training much yet to know what that means exactly. Leon still as slack as ever. Tang came down to watch our training (he couldn't join in coz of the indemnity notice everyone need to sign during training) and commented on Richard's style. He uses a lot of Ki extension (as Yuishinkai would term it). I went down to Pillars Youth for training on Mon. Very shiok. Just need to get used to being around an all malay training ground. But I have to admit it felt really nice. Everyone was so friendly. In general even the white belts practice a lot more harder and have better ukemi than those I've seen in BV. I'm seriously thinking of transferring from BV over to Pillars for a few mths. One, coz the distance from work is so much nearer. Two, I feel damn uncomfortable not paying mat fees and training at BV every Tues. At least at Pillars, I'm paying $5 for each visit. I dunnoz lah, see how lor. Don't think I want to stop Siglap/ARCC trainings anytime soon. ARCC maybe far but I always have ample time.  Anyway, next week is going to be weapons class. Gotta remember my bokken then. Realised my bokken seems like it's cracking liao. Wah, seriously man, the ki my bokken experiences with Yuishinkai is taking its toll on my poor bokken. Hahah ... never mind lah, can buy a new one if it breaks.   Friendster   Friendster seems to be up again, but still as unreliable as ever. Got a message from someone but when I checked my inbox, I couldn't find a thing. Ridiculous lah, think Friendster did something . Anyway I dunnoz, forget it. Was checking through the testimonials in some groups I joined and realised that some of my earlier posts had been deleted. Let's not finger-point, and it is their perogative too. I'm more concerned about how Friendster is turning out. If we are only concerned with keeping the nice testimonials about ourselves, I think you might as well email a nice essay to your friend and ask them to post it on Friendster instead. As Neo once put it, it's all about clocking up good testimonials of yourself and that is so besides the point. I guess that's a reason why I don't log in to friendster much anymore. I do find it kinda pointless these days.   Aikido @ ARCC   Yesterday's training at ARCC was good. What always strikes me at the end of class is that I've learnt something about the way warmups relate to our techniques. We don't relate warmups to trainings almost 80% of the time. Even when something is said, it's only a few sentences. Yuishinkai will have a Ki class where they tell you why warmups are like this, how to relate it to your technique and what you should be feeling during the warmups itself. Slowly when we go on to techniques, they fit in nicely. Of coz applying it is a whole new ball game lah. We were doing the rowing exercise with a jo and I finally understood what I need to do or feel.  Holding the jo horizontally with both my hands with my foot in left stance. I lean my body forward and try to maintain stability still. Note not to overstretch myself. As I lean, my hands (with jo) automatically raises upward a little. As I pus out with my hands, I need to do it in a downward motion and hard enough to feel the skin on the back of my neck being stretch and 'trembling' a bit due to the force of the push. When pushing arms down, note not to loose balance due to overstretching. As I lean body back, arms will raise a bit to an almost hotrizontal arc. As I pull my arms back to my hips, I should be following the ki in which my fingers are pointing. When done without a jo, uke will feel that they are not able to hold back the force of this pushing and pulling motion.   Home   Finally cleared junks of old toys and clothes by getting teh Salvation Army to pick them up on Fri afternoon. Woohoo ... room got more space now. I'm 1 step closer to getting my loft bed. Next thing I need to do is saw up a old cupboard of mine into small chunks and getting rid of it. I don't knwo whe I can or should do this though. Need to plan my time a bit. Folks came back from Thailand yesterday afternoon. Dad had a swoolen knee, dunno why. Mom had a swoolen foot. Heard them mention something about being old and taking too much of a certain food. We are what we eat, that's for sure. Sis was home then so I asked her if they mentioned anything about us donating so many new (but unworn clothes) to ther Salvation Army. She said they made a heckuva ruckus when I wasn't around but nothing they can do about it now. Muahahaha ... my idea of Xian1 Zhan3 Hou4 Zou4 worked brilliantly. Anyway, I tried to appease them by just walking over to show them the whole series of Yi3 Tian1 Tu2 Long2 Ji4 (Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre) I purchased few days ago. Watched about 3 VCDs lastnight and I think they were hooked liao. Watched another VCD today. Probably after lunch can watch a few more. Muahahaha ... think it's the start of me getting a whole series of those oldies HK TV series like Shen2 Diao1 Xia2 Lu3 and Lu4 Ding3 Ji4. Shiok man.   Friends   Steff will be coming to Singapore next week with some friends from Uni. Heard she's starting a PhD in Brum soon too. Good for her. I think I better do some research on where she can visit for 4 days or so. I can only suggest eating and eating hahaha.  James's wedding dinner at the Singapore Marriot Hotel was good. You can tell he really loved the day. Good to see him settle down at last. Met up with Shuhua, Wanloong and Yvonne that night too. Was nice to see familar faces again.

      Niiiice... went for an evening run when I got home. Managed to clear my 3km at an OK pace. Traffic wasn't as nice as in the early morning. But I realised that these days it's difficult for morning runs because of work. Evening air isn't as fresh because of the recent haze and traffic on the roads.  My Kinokuniya 20% discount expires today. Kinda regret not going just now. I used one over the weekend and got myself a book, Secrets of the Samurai, by Oscar Ratte and Adele Westbrook. The same authors for Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere. Book was written in a similar style and it's not a pure Aikido book. Touches on the history, tradition, developments ets of traditional practices and arts. Also explains a bit about the philosophy of the Budo-kas then. Very very interesting.  I'm about finishing my book We Were Soldier, Once and Young soon. Damn tempted to read the Secrets of the Samurai next. But I figured I should probably start with Killing Pablo or Lord of the Rings next instead. LOTR is not an easy book to read for me because of it's language, background and the author's style of writing. I'll probably go onto Killing Pablo first. He was a head figure of a drug cartel which the CIA actually tried to take out. A lot of classified details in the book that makes the whole operation damn interesting. I guess the background of the story simply appeals to the policeman in me lah. Heh ...

      As of yesterday, I started taking P1 classes in some basic computing enrichment. In fact, it will be progressing for the duration of another 5 more weeks. Yesterday's classes were very bored with all the theory stuff I had to say. But today's classes were slightly better. Noticed a trend, the first class I take will kinda be the 'worst'. Probably I'm still experimenting on how to handle people and teaching contents across to the class.  Good weather in the morning because it rained. But that stopped pretty quick as well. Hope that cool weather will prevail from today onwards. Well, at the very least, I hope it doesn't get warmer than it already is.  Went Aikido at BVCC. Was quite good training. Freaking knackered though. Was totally wet by the end of the first hour. My uke had a problem keeping his momentum coming and I'm not so good at controlling him. Even the first thing we did (backstretch) didn't feel that good. He'd just grab, then go all heavy like a boulder. After my tenkan, he'd just hang on damn tight to my wrist but did not push. When he push, he keeps pushing me forward instead of up. Didn't feel like doing anything funny today, so I kinda left him as he is. Anyway, he wasn't stiff, just that he's not feeling enough as uke. Of course, as nage I probably didn't lead him in enough in most of the things we did. Oh well, takes 2 hands to clap.  Later on we did group work and there were a few throws. On one of them, after I was thrown. Something 'came out' of my nose. The feeling I had was like 'wah shiok, my nose feels so clear', as though I had just blown my nose like that. I wiped my nose with my hands and I saw red. As in blood. Fish. Was having a nose bleed. At the same time Sensei called for a stop and he demoed another technique. I quickly set down behind and started holding my head up. Didn't even notice what technique he was teaching. Wiped my nose a few times and the blood just kept coming. Think it was bleeding on and off for at least half a min. Not sure how long it was but it felt like ages before Sensei let us practice amongst ourselves. I asked permission to go to the toilet amid all the surprised look. Maybe some folks would be thinking, "Was it Sunny who gave Aylwin the bloodied nose?" "Or Eileen" muahahaha... Well, I cleared myself up quick and spent the next 30 mins or so watching instead. Didn't wanna risk more blood dripping over my gi. My hands got most of the blood, but I did touch my pants by accident and left a bit of stain there. Anyway, I hope the stains come off. Got them washed the moment I got back.  Got a Super Big Gulp for 2 bucks from 7-eleven after training. Woohoo ... shiok man. I felt too bloated after that. Should've stuck to the normal $1.70 Big Gulp instead. While waiting for the bus, the whole area suddenly blacked out. Not kidding, the only lights came from the headlights of cars on the roads. You could see the even streetlamps were out. The darkness stretched from Clementi area down to Holland Village, Commonwealth, Queensway, Holland Road (to town), etc and those are only the area I passed by on the bus. I believe it was quite a major black out and a huge part of S'pore was affected. Was kinda worried that my home would be affected too but luckily, the area from Orchard Road onwards seemed fine... whew.  A really weird day.

      Previous post had something related to Ki-ai.  In AFS, we're not really taught on how we really do a Ki-ai. But in Yuishinkai, we're told that it's 'e' (as in the word h a y) and 'i' (as in the word h i t). So it sounds pretty much like 'eeeh-eeee'.  Only a matter of how long you drag each syllabus. For instance we do a shomenuchi strike, at the start of the strike (when arm is swinging forward) the 'eh' sounds off and 'eee' comes immediately after. But 'eeee' is suppose to end together with your strike (when hand reaches maximum pt/end of strike at hip level).  I guess it applies to shomenuchi undo, rowing exercise, striking exercises, tsuki, etc. Good pt.s to note. I tend to only ki-ai during warmups. But never in a technique unless I'm told to do so.

      Attendance on Thurs night was OK. I was there first followed by Daniel and Darryl, Roxanne and Sakai. Weide needs to study and won't be training till end of year after his end of year papers (crucial year for him). Leon and Bridget MIA. Meng Lee wasn't around, most probably due to work again. The 2 beginners (couple) came a bit later than usual.  One Indian chap is starting to resume training with us again at Siglap. I did see him a few times here a long while ago but I think he probably moved on to train in another dojo. Recently he's been joining back with us again. Quite OK dude, but sometimes overly enthusiastic as an uke. Heh ... as Tang might put it ... sometimes we over-exaggerate our reaction/momentum of a grab, a pull, a punch, or an off-balanced motion as uke. I know I'm pretty guilty of that sometimes. A lot sounds coming from him when he partnered with Roxanne. Err, something like a partial ki-ai. But a lot of it seemed to me to be more of just making sounds on the mat. Dunnoz, ki-ai is something I'm still trying to understand.  A lady Yudansha popped by today. Spoke to her for awhile once before during last year's Aikicamp. Not sure if she still remembers me. Think she doesn't really train anywhere specific, but she's on good terms with Freddy Sensei. Heh ... I dunno why, it kinda reminds me of Ah Hee Sensei. Think her name's Jessie. Anyway, when we were doin warm-ups she came in. I was surprised as I thought she was taking the class for that evening. Later, Richard turned up. Than I realised class was as per normal. I pretty much partnered with Sakai the whole night. Jessie was teaching the couple rolls and some basic techniques while Richard went around guiding everyone in class. Was a good evening.  Was surprised that Richard called me up as uke that evening. Sure, it's not the first time I've uked for him in class. BUt the trend was usually that he would call the most senior student present to be his uke (meaning that if a more senior one came late, he will still be calling up the initial uke). That's why I was surprised because the twins were both 4th kyu and they weren't late that evening. But it was good practice, helped me to feel what a nage wanted me to do/how to move. A lot of leading in fact. Only bad thing is that as uke, sometimes I'm not able to 'see' how to do the technique.

      Will be starting to revamp my  urlLink homepage , the  urlLink Aikido in Singapore  site, its logo, etc over the next few months.  Hope to integrate Blogspot inside as well. So far I've started transferring the  urlLink 'Art of Peace'  and the  urlLink 'Quotes'  into blogger. In fact, I like them so much I've added the links into my own blogger template. :

      Feeling very happy this morning.  Checked my Friendster a/c to discover an old sec sch friend, Yuanhui, managed to find me. Steady lah. I immediately smsed him on the bus to work. He called and we spoke briefly for awhile. He highlighted a few more people from BVSS who were on his Friendster a/c. I popped back in and started adding or messaging people.  So surprised to hear that he has already ROMed. So happy for him. I can't believe the length of time we've not seen or heard from each other. Almost 8 yrs or so... gosh. Time flies so fast when you let it. Anyway, we both promised to stay in touch and try to arrange the next earliest date when we can meet up for a chat, makan or coffee.  After a few hours, I was quite happy to noticed that another classmate, Yinhong, replied the message I sent in the morning. Gosh, memories just kept flowing back. I remembered I was always throwing stuff at her and her friend or tugging her hair back in lower sec. Hahaha ... yes yes ... I was quite a monkey back then.  Anyway, it's good lor. I've always like my sec sch life and friends a lot. It was a pity I kinda let them go after sec sch and lost touch with everyone save for Robin and Roy. Roy, no need to say, he's my best bud even after so many years. No doubt we don't communicate as much but each time we do, we talk or email like it was only yesterday. Robin, well, can't complain. He's one of the few who still makes some effor to stay in touch with me after so long. It brings to mind another good buddy in upper sec, Jialiang, who had kinda drifted away over the years. Quite sad really. Oh well... I'm just glad my Poly and Uni friends are still around me at this point.

      After the grading (see previous post), I went down to BVCC for Hattori Sensei's seminar. Managed to grab a quick bite at Macs before popping over to the CC.  First thing I saw there, was a figure flopped over on a chair snoozing. Couldn't tell who it was initially, so I went straight to change into my gi first. When I came back I saw Tommy kinda poking at the body or something and it was stirring... oh ... Eileen nah... thought who.  Anyway, talked to Tommy awhile about that morning's grading and Yuishinkai's training. Class started pretty soon after that. It was quite nice all the way (though somewhat crowded) until we started weapons training. First few were still OK, but towards the end everyone was kinda 'I stare at you and you stare at me'. Well, for one thing, I had problem even see the whole kata because I was too far behind and there were just too many heads blocking me. I found that evening slightly disappointing because I was actually looking forward very much to Hattori Sensei's weapons class.  Mon evening, after work, I left early and went down to BB East CC. Hattori Sensei will be teaching there as well. Was early so I enjoyed the curry puffs I bought from Old Chang Kee earlier. Later I saw Iulian, Ah Hee Sensei, Alvin around and popped in to help with the mats. The night class was very very very good. For one thing, I was lucky to have paired with a pretty decent beginner (Kenneth, who seems to train at BB East). Also some group techniques went quite smooth too. But Hattori Sensei's weapons class that evening was the best. He revised what we did the day before, but this time he broke it down into parts and everyone picked it up a whole lot faster and easier. Really shiok lor. I like the fact that he's teaching mostly same things as what he did in last year's Aikicamp. Because we don't do enough weapons work, it's the only way he can make sure we are learning correctly, by teaching us himself. I wish like Tommy mentioned, there's someway he can conduct regular weapons work locally instead of just once or twice a year. Anyway, the final night's training went very well and judging from the applause, I think everyone felt the same as well.

      Right, I have to put in a separate post for this.  As I mentioned, during Sat's class Williams Sensei requested that some of us drop by if possible to help as uke for the Sho and Ni dan gradings on Sun. Sun morning, I went down to GWCC as arranged. Everyone was there early. After warmups, Sensei explained some common procedures during the grading (eg. bowing to kamiza, first, bow to ukes, time in between the bow to kamiza and time turning around to bow to ukes should be the same, bowing to ukes is on own discretion and timing and NOT after the call of 'Hajime!' - a shomenuchi strike would be on the head by then. Also, when nage was suppose to do a weapon technique or kata, they mus never never take the weapons themselves. Instead, someone had to kinda take the weapon from the ground and pass it to them instead.  Even the nages taking dan gradings had to rotate as ukes (3 shodan, 2 1st kyu). In addition, there was a 3rd dan (Japanese lady based in Australia I think, practicing for 8 yrs I heard), 1 1st kyu (I think), 2 green belt (3rd kyu), 2 white belts (namely Tony and me, Aikikai 5th kyu).   Shodan Gradings  Jeremy (1st kyu) started first. Katatedori grabs, shomenuchi and yokomenuchi strikes as well as tsuki punches. Basically everything was free play. After that were the bokken and jo katas. Jeremey did well but you can tell he was really nervous and he really got breathless very quickly. Usually his movement would be pretty good. After the kata came randori.  Pearly (1st kyu) - if I got her spelling right, came next. She was very very nervous. Pretty much the same thing as Jeremy. But she was so nervous she got quite a bit of the kata wrong. Plus her weapons work didn't seem to be as 'forceful/strong' as Jeremy's.   Nidan Gradings  Next Michael came. I'd say he performed the best. Everything was pretty much the same except that randori was against 4 ukes instead of 3. In addition, there were some techniques against the bokken and jo as well. Also there were some randori using the jo against 2 ukes. Anyway, I think he's nervous as well because he got a bit breathless in the middle. On a side note, Michael and his wife cross train in Kendo. I think they are shodan but they might have gotten their nidans by now (or will be getting it soon).  After Michael was his wife, Janice. She was pretty good too. I can't remember much save that it's almost same as Michael's.  Last was Mark Tham (the guy who created the Martial Art website on his homepage). He's a Wing Chun practioner too. His techniques are pretty soft and you can tell he adopts a lot of the 'Ki-style hopping around' quite often. But he has a very soft style. I distinctly remembered being his uke for his 'jo randori'.  I honestly can't remember who were the ukes for whom. I helped out in most of the katatedori, a few shomenuchi and most of the randori. A few distinct things to note is that I did some good ukemi, some weird ones, and some extremely horrid ones too. Basically we ran and fell all over the place grabbing, striking or whatever. Trying desperately to build up a certain rythm for nage. Sometimes as uke, when I hesitate, I kinda broke the rythm for them and they had to pick things up again. It was a good lesson on randori though.

      Only one thing to be said ... FANTASTIC!  Yesterday evening, I left school early so I was sure I'd be able to arrive on time. I even had time to grab a dinner at MacDonald's before going for class. When I arrived, I caught a slight glimpse of the seniors sitting in seiza and I could hear Williams Sensei explaining aspects of weapons work (bokken to be specific) to the class. I was both flustered and puzzled at the same time. I thought I was late and class had already started. So I quietly slipped away from the door to the toilet downstairs to change into my gi. When I came back, I waited at the door and saw Williams Sensei (for the first time), explaining or talking to the class. Next thing I noticed was that everyone had a bokken in their hands. Pengz ... I didn't bring mine because I thought weapons wouldn't be taught. Geez ... first I was late, second I forgot my weapons. Thought I really deserved to sit at the back of class to watch instead of joining in.  While I sat in seiza (which I later changed to cross legged coz of my strained left ankle), more and more people started arriving. That's when I checked the clock in the room and realised it was early. I did arrive early. (Whew!) and I noticed a stack of weapons on the left side of the dojo. So the class didn't bring their weapons either. (Double whew!) Just as class was about to start, Williams Sensei left the seniors and came towards us, the new arrivals. Frankie Sensei introduced each and everyone of us and he shook hands warmly with everyone. That really struck me. He was such a warm and friendly person. He carried himself in a very casual manner but the words he used often carried a certain 'oomph' that it always made us think. I do feel that I did manage to pick up some things. I only wish I can constantly remember his teachings. He was very relaxed and casual with the class. There were some laughs here and there as well. We started with warmups and he corrected us on a lot of technical things as well. Some of which were certain co-ordination exercises (musubi). As there were a certain no of seniors about to be graded on Sun, the lower kyus had to train separately instead. Still Williams Sensei came over to teach us. First thing he wanted to do was check our rolls. I picked up a lot about forward rolls. I only wished I could put into words what I had learnt that evening about my rolls. Suffice to say, I intend to spend regular and a good deal of time correcting the finer points of my roll. Williams Sensei was always kind with his words and he was always very encouraging to everyone. It made everyone feel like his praises was as sincere as his critiscms. Despite being pressed for time, the patience he displayed in class was extraordinary. Though he was constantly explaining things to the students, it never felt 'boring', 'tedious' or anything like that. On the contrary, everyone seemed to hang on to his every word and advice. It was one heckuva experience.  Today, I went down to ARCC for class and Williams Sensei conducted the class. Again, some of us came very early. We all hoped to join the class early and learn as much as we could. Prior to class, Williams Sensei showed everyone a VCD of his daughter taking her SHODAN (1st dan)!!! She was veeeeeeeeery good! Her movement and strategy was similar to the lady in the video Gary showed me once before (nidan/sandan grading I think). Even Williams Sensei commented that she was pretty good but her performance on that grading wasn't her best. He's seen her work much better under preassure and he pointed out some aspects of her techniques or weapons work that 'should improve when she gets more serious with her training'. And guess what? She only just turned 13!!! .... I wanna pengz liao. If that's the standard for a 13 yr old who isn't 100% serious with her training ... I can't imagine how she's gonna be like when she gets older. Anyway, even Williams Sensei did comment that he sees a lot of potential in her. There were tons of randori against 2 ukes. Her weapons work was also extremely good. Everything was smooth and flowy whether her ukes were kyu or dan grades. I was like ... speechless man. I only wish there's some way to make a copy of the VCD.  We started with warmups followed by some co-ordination exercises before beginners were split up from the rest of the class. Again, this was to facilitate the seniors training before the grading tomorrow morning. But this time, as there weren't enough ukes. They asked me Tony and I to join the seniors to help out as ukes because we were 5th kyu Aikikai. It felt great to be uke today because I did learn a lot as well. Each Senior (to be graded) would call up a senior and a junior kyu as ukes. The training went so good today that we will be helping out in tomorrow morning's grading. I saw Leong videoing down yesterday's and today's sessions. After the grading and Tuesday's sessions are over, I'll have to ask for a copy of the videos. It's too good a class not to share it!!  I'm really looking forward to the grading at GWCC tomorrow morning. But after that I'll need to rush off down to BVCC for Hattori Sensei's seminar with AFS. I'm feeling a bit guilty about sacrificing more than half of the seminar but I think I really don't have a choice. No regrets so far anyway, I'm sure whichever I go I'd still be enjoying myself thoroughly.  Williams Sensei ended today's class with a talk on how Aikido is applied in our daily living and such. A lot of good advice and pointers today. Tis been a truly Aiki weekend so far.

      Left school early yesterday but missed 2 buses of 196. Stupid stupid ... ptui ptui. Well was actually because I was in the midst of a serious discussion with Daphne. Piangz, she so sensitive about stuff. Chin cai lah ...   Aikido @ BVCC  Grabbed my haircut and missed the first hour of training. Still the second hour was ok. I kinda strained/sprained my left ankle when I landed badly. Noe whenever I need to do a forward roll which uses the left foot, I do it 'Judo' style. Why do I say that? Because I land exactly the same way Sakai (Siglap CC) does. Anyway not so bad that I can't walk properly. Only hurts when I fully extend my foot to be on tiptoe or when I twist it to the side. Just a strain I would think. Bought my ticket for the seminar this coming weekend and Sensei also announced a news. $5 to be charged per session when anyone drops by a dojo where they do not pay the mat fee. Think it's a good idea but I hope it can be enforced among the students tho. (One eg, I didn't pay for yesterday's class ; but I intend to do so from next session onwards.) I had thought that the $5 was applicable to only Pillars (cos it wasn't a CC but a pte spot). Joining 2 clubs means we are able to visit other dojos without paying mat fees. While keeping mats, Tommy was asking "Eh, so now how ar? U join which dojo?" Told him my impression was that cheapest 2 were BVCC and another CC (but can't rem which exactly. Still it's gonna amt to about 160+ (3 mths) or so coz I think the CCs increased the charges due to the GST increase.   Dojos vc Cost  Just checked, cheapest 2 dojos seem to be BVCC and BBCC (not BB East CC). But then again, joining 1 dojo and just paying $5 per session (if you train an extra 1 session a week) means total expenses will be about $130ish (3 mths). But the most worthwhile spots to train for the amt you pay would still be BVCC and BB East CC (if you consider at an hourly rate). Sigh ... too bad I hate Maths, otherwise I'd do up a statistical analysis of these costs.  But if joining 2 dojos means you can train any no. of times and anyplace... now that is definitely the best deal. Just sign up for the 2 cheapest dojo but make sure you get ur money's worth of regular training. If you are only to train a certain no. of times it may not exactly be worth it.   My Conclusion  I guess next thing I should do is seriously consider how regular I plan to have my trainings. I don't intend to leave Siglap anytime soon yet. Doubt I will increase my AFS training beyond what I'm going thru now because of distance, cost and time constraints. Also because I'm committed to Yuishinkai training once a week as well. I guess I will stick to Siglap on Thurs and ARCC on Sat with Yui. As for Tues at BVCC / Pillars on Mon, I may rotate it to alternate weeks or whenever my schedule dictates. Strongly doubt BB East is a feasible spot for me to travel to as long as it's a working day for me.  This morning I went running again. It's ok but I was kinda late. If I only made myself get out of bed 30mins earlier then I'd be able to reach school on time. Was feeling lazy. Actually woke at 6 but lazed in bed till 6.30 instead. Started slow coz I was afraid my ankle will give way when I'm running halfway. But it seemed fine. I'll be meeting 2 colleagues for lunch and a reservist in the evening. The latter is some financial advisor with AIA so I'll be finding out more about these kinda stuff soon. Hope to start some investment/savings plan within the next year or so so need to get some research done now. Evening I'll probably drop by to collect my samsung battery from James then pop home for dinner.  Can't wait for the Aikido seminars (AFS and Yui) to start soon. But it will be a very tiring week for me. Training will run consecutively for 5-6 days for me. Hope I can take it.

      Oh man, can't tahan. Really sleepy today that's why I turned to blogging for awhile.  Resumed reading everyone's blog and only realised how much I've missed out the past weeks. Especially this Guilian ... ultra long posts man hahaha. Anyway, my mind is quite dead to absorb everything I'm reading on these blogs so I only left minimal messages or comments here and there. At least I've managed to update the format of my blogpage. Now all the links are back. Only thing I'm hoping to be able to do is to include my old enetations link so that I can check the comments with regards to older blogs. Oh well, not a priority lah so I'll see how is it later.  Resumed my 3km run this morning before going to work. Felt great after that but I built up a lot of heat inside and I can feel myself still perspiring even after a shower. One good thing, I noticed I still maintained the stamina. Only big thing I needed to note was maintaining pace throughout the distance I'm running and I should be able to complete it OK. I think at this stage, daily running is necessary for me to get ready in time for AHM 2004. Doesn't sound possible but I may take 1-2 break days depending on my physical readiness, workload, etc.  Aikido at Siglap yesterday saw 2 new adult students - husband and wife actually. Husband was Chinese and wife was ... I dunno, maybe French? I detect an accent somewhere. Took warmups but I seemed to have missed out the wrists exercises. Haiz, felt like blaming others but actually it was my own fault. I was asking Leon what came after this or that exercise. Shoulda trusted my instincts more and just do the warmups in the sequence my brain remembered them. See lah, in the end made everyone miss out on warmups. Anyway, the couple were quite keen to bring their 5 yr old son, goin-onto 6, for the Sun class at Siglap. Good lah, we get additions in both classes this way. Just hope things didn't seem too slow and boring for the couple during their first day of training. Coz I realise a lot of pple actually stop Aikido even before they've started it.  I'm glad Sakai (judoka yudansha) stayed on. He's been with us for about 1 mth or so. He seems to be improving too. Still stiff but you can see him getting better. Paired with him for the duration of the evening. We did TOOOOOONS of shomenuchi ikkyo and nikkyo (omote + ura waza). Most probably because Richard had to give most of his attention to the 2 beginners. Well, that's fine. Most part of the night I shared what I knew to be the 'finer' pts of the technique with Sakai, tips mentioned or overheard.  As when I first started, Sakai tend to miss taking the side step. Pointed out to him we tend to be crashing into each other even before the technique was done. He did manage to pick it up slowly. I think the actual ratio of practice I had to his was only about 1:4. I tend to go along and let him repeat as many times as he wants till he got comfortable with the technique. Next mistake I noted was he almost always grabbed my arm when I used a shomen strike. Pointed out that it was more of a guiding movement. Other things I managed to point out were footwork, positioning, etc. Well, at least he was willing to listen. I only hope I didn't bombard him with too much information last night.  For kokyu-ho (my crappiest), Sakai tend to anticipate what I was going to do. So most often I really was just following his arms instead. I advised him to close his eyes instead and just feel what I'm doing. It helped a bit but not much. His 'stiffness' is most noticeable during kokyu-ho. But there was something really nice towards the end of kokyu ho. He did manage to move a bit more smoothly and lessen the stiffness. Not great, but still good.  At the end of class, managed to speak to the couple. They were asking things about belt colors and all that. Told them the twins (Darryl and Daniel) were more senior than me. They were a bit surprised and the wife mentioned something about seeing me 'teach' the other guy (Sakai). Ar ... I think I might've said too much liao with Sakai that's why it gave them that impression. Anyway, told them that us students aren't qualified to teach, only to share hahaha.  All in all, was a nice evening.  Will be meeting Henry tonight, he's one of the old M113 drivers I was with during our trainee days. Haven't sen him for a good 4-5 yrs in fact. Dunno what we'll be doin, but in the very least we'll be grabbing dinner. Hope to be able to catch a movie too before work piles up so much I can't do so.  Serious man, this holiday is quite a killer. I don't get these much stuff in a normal school term. Haiz, dunno how to finish everything before the given deadlines. Organise organise organise ... and stop procrastinating you fool!

      Yes man. Really pissed for yesterday and today.   One Particular P6 Class   Took a class for Ulead Media Studio yesterday morning. They were quite unresponsive and rude at times too. Now, I can take cheekiness to a certain extent. In addition, I allowed them to be on the Net for most part of the class. Wrong decision, they can't even concentrate on the task at hand. Very poor participation. Worse still, at the end of class, I found scraps of paper on the floor, on the table and spilled drinks. And no one bothered to clean it up. Such irresponsible behavior is totally unacceptable.  When they came back to class this morning, I wanted to overlook the mess they made yesterday but they started making so much noise. I had to step in, scold and lecture them. I know these are good kids, but sometimes I find that I really need to remind them of their place. At least now they are busy producing the video work I want them to. All I want, is for them to have fun and learn something out of the whole thing.   2nd Class Yesterday   The second class was a lot more fun and responsive. AT least they produced some really really good work and appeared more interested. But this afternoon, they were a bit more noisy and some of them didn't listen to the specific instructions I told them - no Internet until work is done. Had to raise my voice at them again. Today is a seriously tiring day. I feel very taxed even during lunch time. Will probably be able to get a good sleep later on the bus journey to BVCC for Aikido. Hope tonight's training will be a good one.  Another incident yesterday afternoon occured around 5pm. Classes had just ended for me and Daphne and the school auntie came to knock on our door informing us that she was locking up. I reeeeeeeeeally hate the kanchiong attitude I saw, comparable to the 'kanchiong spiders' in NS - what we'd call people who were rushing and panicky about stuff and always wanting to go home early etc. Just wanted to point out that things like off and early release is a PRIVILEGE!! NOT an entitlement. This policy in NS stands whether we're in NS, govt or pte sector of work. Just wish some folks will understand that.

      Can't believe the lapse in blogging I'm experiencing these days.  Been busy settling the coming IT monitors camp and Ulead Video editing classes for the holidays. Prep work seems almost complete but both will start running from next Mon onwards and stretch on for quite a period over the Jun holidays.  Sis will be visiting her friend in Philadelphia. Wish I can join her and drop by Gary's but too bad lah, boh lwee and boh si gang (no money nor time). Parents going China tomoro onwards. Woohoo ... nopw govt for another 10 days or so.  Most woulda noticed the new look to my blog. Think I'll need to do a complete revamp of my homepage to match my blog soon. But I doubt I'll be free to do this over the next few months. Love the new look Blogger adopted though. Best feature is that they now have their own commenting feature, but that'd mean that my old comments are gonna get scraped. Gee ... anyway, that's kinda why I'm only posting my blog on 1st of Jun, so that I can republish only my index pages and not the ones before. Hope I can retain those.  IT monitor camp is starting tomorrow. I think I'm as ready as I'll every be, but I'll probably wake early to run through some things and the whole program for the day in my mind... just to be sure. Daphne's taking the P2-4s while I've got the P5-6s. Hope I can make this as enjoyable and be as friendly as I can, no point spoiling everyone's mood by getting to mad with them. Just hope they don't push the teachers around too much and go overboard. Give and take lah girls (if anyone is reading this).  One of the P6 actually said they came across my homepage. Like Daphne mentioned my homepage has a lot of personal stuff. Not sure if it's appropriate to speak my mind and be as flamboyant about my thoughts now. But hey, it's me ... I don't think I'll change much on this. Even if they do see my page, maybe some of the things they read will be able to help them understand somethings about the way I do things. Oh well, honestly not giving this much thought. Err ... but it does mean that I now ahve to watch my language online. Geez ... what a hassle.  Been procrastinating my training for the AHM and Singapore . I think after this camp is over I better start planning my training regime and stick to it. Been meaning to do my regular runs a long time ago but everything just seems to get delayed. Ar well, it's my fault lah. Problem now is I won't be able to start until Wed (Vesak Day). If it's physically possible, I may do daily runs just to make up for lost time. Not sure if I can clock up enought distance in time but I gotta try.  Been looking around for the AHM 2004 details. Only managed to find a  urlLink website  which says AHM is on 1st Sep. That can't be right, 1st Sep is a Wed. These kinda stuff always falls on a Sun. Anyway, I'm guessing it's 4th Sep. Hope so coz that week is the kid's 1 week term break. Might actually do myself some justice by taking the Mon off/lve to rest and recover. Also been to the  urlLink Singapore Marathon  website but it doesn't seem like application has started yet. Anyway, I gotta check back on this coz I want to be able to meet the early bird registration. I wonder if both routes run past the Nicoll Highway (after the collapse).

      Something Syed said to us when he taught thu's class at Siglap CC.  He was trying to teach us a technique. I can't remember which one it was, but the main thing I remembered was NOT the technique, instead it was when we chose to step forward and back. Realised after being shown a technique, we'd photocopy and reproduce the same thing right down to the footwork, hand movement, etc.  Syed tried to explain why we moved back and forward. Depends on Uke's timing, speed of attack, etc. He told us the words above. Something I've spent a few nights dwelling on. I have limited understanding of the words as I try and try to place them into context when it comes to my training. Change the scenario, and I feel lost. Change the technique, the same happens.  "How" can I train with understanding... when do I ask the 'right' questions... what are the 'right' questions to ask to achieve this?

      Again, anyone who hasn't seen the movie may want to refrain from what I have to say in this particular post.  Story revolves around the brotherly love between 2 brothers. Starts off just before the Korean war, the simple but blissful life they were enjoying then. When war soon broke out, both brothers were forcibly drafted into service and sent out to the front lines. Younger brother was a the weaker one. Student before the war and on his way to enter University. Elder brother was a shoe polisher who gave up school to support his brother, their mother and a fiance (with her 3 younger siblings). Mother and fiance spent the day tending their own noodle store.  At the front lines, you'd see how the elder brother tried protecting his brother. In their first skirmish with the communists, the younger brother felt really lost and almost suffered a heart attack. The elder brother would think of ways and means of getting his brother out of the army. His only aim was to watch his brother survive the whole war and get him out unscathed. The commanding officer somehow gave the elder brother an idea that one way was to distinguish himself above and beyond the call of duty so as to get the Medal of Honor. With this, he could put in a request to get his brother transferred. This led to his brother volunteering for almost every risky mission that came along the way of the platoon.  Soon, the unit found themselves cut off from the rest of the army. To delay the enemy, a group was ordered to plant mines. The elder brother volunteered for this. On completion, they were ambushed. Here, you'd notice that the elder brother was brave and exceptional in soldiering. He managed to pull a wounded comrade to safety. But he would risk everything and more in his quest for the Medal. When ordered to pull back to escort the wounded back to camp, he insisted on staying on to fight the remnants of the enemy ambush party and finish them off. They were that close to losing the wounded soldier as he was losing a lot of blood. The SGT told him never to disobey his orders again during a battle.  Days passed and the cut-off unit were low on food, water and medical supplies. The sight of maggots gnawing away at the wounds of a wounded soldier was really disgusting. Morale was low. And in despair, one of the wounded got his hands on a weapon, shot the wounded soldiers in the tent before blowing his own head off. The elder brother suggested that they go on an all out attack. A logical idea as everyone had nothing to lose anyway. That very night, they striked back. The elder brother would put himself at risk time and time again in the same battle. The most exceptional was him taking out the command bunker and killing the enemy commander himself. The younger brother would also take his first life on that very night. This was the night of nights as it saw a transformation in the both of them. The younger brother would learn that sympathy to the enemy during a battle could mean the end of himself. The elder brother would let his heroic exploits get to his own head. He was branded a hero and the army was quick to use him for their own propoganda. They would feed him 'lines' to read out to the press. No doubt all these would fall under psychological warfare but I think there's nothing worse than playing with a person's mind. The US soon joined in the war to assist them. Elder brother was quick to get himself promoted to SGT and as leader, he would often put his fellow comrades at risk to accomplish the mission, even when the mission had been designated under somebody else. There was a difference between taking the initiative and going all out unecessarily. Very soon, in an attempt to capture an enemy captain alive, he indirectly caused the death of a platoon mate. Younger brother, having learnt the trade of soldiering, blamed his brother for this. It was quite sad to see a rift come between the two of them.  Even more heart wrenching was the scene where the communist, while retreating through civilian villages, would kill everyone in the village , women, children and old folks. They even hung bodies out on trees and booby trapped some of these bodies. These traps kill and wounded many soldiers. But the scene of slaughtered civilians created a lot of pain and hate within many soldiers. They would kill the enemy without remorse and slaughter the enemies they captured. It was scary to see how they changed and each one of them holding on to so much hate. Only the younger brother seemed to still retain a bit if humanity. One day they managed to capture some enemy soldiers, one of them being a good friend of the two brothers. He had been forced by the communists to join their army. The elder brother, overcomed by so much hate ordered that all captured enemies be shot as these soldiers would be 'excess baggage' for them. Only the younger brother protected the PoWs. I know that war changes many things, I've heard of gentlemen's war, guerilla warfare and such. I have no idea how one should balance both. To have a war without honour, you'd see the same atrocities that were televised regarding how US MPs treated captured prisoners in the Gulf. To fight a war with too much honour opens you to guerilla and unconventional tactics.  Anyway, China decided to join in the foray and the communists started fighting back and gaining lost ground. The US were quick to lose ground and soon the winning side started to retreat. During a scuffle, the PoWs managed to overcome their captors and held a soldier hostage. The elder brother started firing on the PoWs and even shot his friend. Amidst the retreat, the elder brother was finally awarded the Medal of Honour. But he had 'lost' his younger brother for it. The latter hated everything the Medal represented, he felt that he didn't know his elder brother anymore. While passing through their hometown one day, the younger brother decided to look for his family as he heard they were still in the area. He found his brother's fiance. Unfortunately, she was soon arrested by the Anti Communist Army, a group which weeded out communist in the community and executed these traitors. The younger brother found himself arrested as well. I found this hard to swallow. The abuse of power but this party was frightening. They were able to just pull people off the streets and execute them without trial. They based their accusationa and charges on papers they retrieved from the communist parties. These papers were namelists of civilians who had attended communist talks and rallies. However, to attract civilians, the communists used to exchange food to attract people to attend. Quite possibly most of them only went for the food and they didn't really understood the difference between democracy and communism. I just felt so helpless at the level of misunderstanding I was seeing. All these could be cleared up (though not without time and a great deal of effort), but instead cicilians were executed based only on  suspicions  of being Marxists!  The elder brother, recently promoted to Staff SGT was quick to arrive. He tried to protect his fiance and get his younger brother out. In the ensuing struggle, he shot several members of the Anti Communist Army. The fiance was shot and killed by someone and the brothers arrested again. While the elder brother was interogated by a superior officer, the communists arrived. In all the confusion, the elder brother managed to get free and held the officer at gun-point, ordering the latter to free his younger brother. The officer instead ordered that the makeshift prison be set on fire. The elder brother tried to rescue his younger brother but did not manage to do so and somehow got injured as well. When he came to, he found a pen he had bought and given to his younger brother before the war. Thinking that his brother had died, he went into a frenzy and killed the officer who ordered the torching of the prison. At that time, the area was controlled by the communists already. It seemed that seeing his fiance killed and thinking that his brother had died in the hands of his own army was too much to bear and that drove him over to the communist's side.  As it turned out, the younger brother did not die in the flames. He was shot and rescued by a fellow comrade and was recovering in a military hospital. By the time he recovered, both Nth and Sth Korea were in a stalemate along the 38th parallel. News of his brother's defection to the communists soon reached him. His army decided to use the younger brother to try and get the elder brother back to their side and for their own propogandas (again). Somehow the younger brother escaped and ran over to the enemy lines, he was captured. During the confusion of a battle, both brothers finally met. The younger brother could hardly recognise his own brother who was in a murderous rage and killed like a wild uncontrolled beast. The elder brother was so blinded with hate and rage that he even tried to kill his brother. It was a long fight and struggle before he snapped out of his berserker rage and both brothers were reunited. By then the elder brother was wounded and could not move easily. The communists turned the battle around and began fighting back. As they came nearer, the elder brother told the younger brother "Go back, I will surrender and return to you after the war is over." After much persuasion the younger brother returned back to his side. However, seeing that the communists were gaining ground on his brother, the elder brother decided to try and buy him some time. He grabbed the nearest machine gun and started shooting at the communists. Though he killed many, he was soon overwhelmed and died that very day.  I have a lot of thoughts and feelings about the whole show. I was well impressed with the affections the brothers had for each other, despite their disagreements and squabbles. I can only imagine a small part of the horrers of war. Deaths to civilians, slaughter and butchering of innocent people. The lawlessness we can only imagine from books, newspapers of wars fought in countries far from Singapore. It also drew an immediate interest of the Korean conflict. I had done a fair bit of reading on World War II in the European Theater and only a small no of the Vietnam War. The Korean War is something I know so little about. The way the Army would create 'lies' in order to boost morale for their side is something I found really hard to swallow. I can understand the reason why, but I can't agree with it. I may find myself singing a different tune if I was ina  real war, who knows? I felt sad that one of the brothers died, but I was glad that they did manage to meet one last time despite everything that happened.  Of comraderie; the following comes to my mind:    "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;     For he to-day that sheds his blood with me     Shall be my brother."   -- Shakespeare, Henry V, Act IV, Scene 3  Of personal heroism:    "In thinking back of the days of Easy Company, I'm treasuring my remark to a grandson who asked, 'Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?'     "'No', I replied, 'but I served in a company of heroes."   -- Mike Ranney, Easy Company Sergeant, from the book Band of Brothers by Stephen E. Ambrose  And of war:    "It is good that war is so horrible,     Lest we get too fond of it."   -- quote from somewhere/someone I can't quite remember.

      Was busy today. Morning passed relatively uneventfully. After lunch I had to attend a meeting. Afterwhich I had about an hr before my class. 1st class was OK. 2nd class was more difficult. I found one girl in particular quite a handful. Vanessa Toh!!!! (EEAARGGGHHH!!!!!!)   The class in general tends to be pretty noisy. Vanessa is a hyperactive girl who sometimes stubbornly refuse to obey instructions. Anyway, she was constantly doing her own thing when I give out instructions. I found her placing her foot to her face (I'm not kidding!), sitting with her legs up on the chair, shaking the chair non-stop, typing something completely different on the keyboard from what I instructed the class to do, etc. I was amused for awhile but towards the end I got pretty frustrated just trying to control her antics. Finally I went over and switched off her monitor (not PC), "Since you're not interested to listen, then you don't need to do anymore." Vanessa was an intelligent girl. She knew that I still left her PC on, so the moment my back was turned, she switched on the monitor again and proceeded with her nonsense again. I went back to her and switched off the PC straight away (yeayea, I'm guilty of not shutting down the PC properly but I was really pissed). Then I said in a really stern tone, "I SAID you will NOT do anything, since you DON'T want to listen." She tried to act rebellious by shaking her chair or doing something I can't quite remember. I decided to place my foot down and said "Do you want me to make you STAND?" She simply gave me a look. So I said, "OK STAND UP." in a firm tone. She refused and continued sitting down. I was furious, such audacity to openly defy an instruction like that so I said in an ever more fierce tone and face "STAND UP!" and she still sat on defiantly. I repeated myself one more time, "VANESSA I SAID YOU STAND!". And yet still she sat. I looked her straight in the eye, gave myself a few seconds to give her the evil stare before I said, "Do you want me to drag you outside and make you stand outside?! You don't believe I will do it?!". Actually around that time, it struck me. She might be mroe afraid of answering me than defying me. So I asked her "ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO INSTRUCTIONS OR NOT?" Silence followed. "I ASK YOU AGAIN, ARE YOU GOING TO PAY ATTENTION AND LISTEN TO INSTRUCTIONS?! ANSWER ME YES OR NO!" I received a meek nod. My temper immediately subsided, it was the signal I wanted. One which implied that I had scared her enough to gain her obedience for a moment at least. "OK, switch on your computer and login again. Next time you listen and obey instructions."   I never got a peep from her for the rest of class. I had embarrassed her enough to make her submissive for awhile. Usually she'd relish the attention she'd get by being notoriously naughty. Anyway, towards the last 5 min when I found her hyperacting up again, I got her to 'assist' me by shutting down 3 unused PCs&nbsp;nearby. She was quick to react and proud to have been 'selected' for the job. She pretty much shoved other girls who wanted the responsibility out of the way. I was amused. She would make a good leader someday, if only she was kept on a much tighter leash and properly groomed. Hopefully she'll mellow down a bit as time passes.   After work I had to rush down to meet Tang at Somerset MRT to collect my spare specs (which I had absent mindedly left in his car last Sat when he gave me a lift down to PS). I actually intended to rush down for Aikido at Bt Batok East. Met Tang and rushed to board the MRT. Halfway through I realised I took the wrong direction because of the north south line being a loop now. I hastily jumped onto the one which said Jurong East instead of the one heading towards City Hall Interchange, I was heading NORTH! Hopped out and took the next MRT back. At City Hall interchange, I jumped across and afterawhile noticed I was heading EAST! EAAAAAAGH. Hopped off at Kallang MRT and took the westbound (correct) train. But by the time I cleared half the journey, I knew I was going to be late and I was in no mood to rush around anymore. Decided to grab dinner at Clementi's MacDonalds and read my book "Killing Pablo". After a relaxing moment, I decided to head back home.   Deciding not to rush down and continue my training turned out to be the right decision after all.&nbsp; Think I was stressing myself too much since the afternoon. Nervous breakdown liao...

      People who want to catch this show may not want to read what I've got to say now. Don't wanna spoil the surprise. All I can tell you is, it's pretty good.  Now, for the show, I gotta say it developped rather nicely as a thriller. I think this show falls under the action genre. But I think it holds about 40-50% thriller too. I'm kept guessing and anticipating what the robot(s) will try to do. And the reason for why robots attacked humans only came to light towards the end or so.  All these about machines taking over mankindv comes down to a simple reasoning. Matrix, Terminator, I,Robot, etc all focus on human beings as irresponsible 'masters' of earth who don't take up the responsibility of taking care of the environment we live in. We are able to pursue such an irresponsible way of live only because we are at the top of the food chain... for now. But each of these apocalyptic-sci-fi-machine-killing-humans type of shows us that as soon as machines evolves to a state where they are able to look at things from a 3rd point of view, humans would naturally be categorised as parasites, bacteria, germs (as how Agent Smith would descibe human beings). We simply take things for granted. I doubt any of us respect any machines in our lives now. Just look at how some of the users treat the computers now. Not shutting down properly, knocking the system unit when it's slow, etc. Granted, I myself find it difficult for me to respect something like the typewriter too.  I really believe that is most probably the direction human kind is heading. Where we do R&D in AI, with the hope of simulating human emotions and reactions in machines. As soon as that state is achieved, machines WILL behave like humans. We can see that war, crimes&nbsp;and violence are very much a part of human history. As soon as machines starts emulating humans, what's to stop them from making this happen? NOTHING. No safety feature, no regulation, nothing can stop this. We can put in Rules to govern the way a machine thinks. But as soon as any 'living' being evolves enough, having developed reasoning, they are able to make choices; choices to do good, bad, right and wrong. They will easily develop perceptions, and each is subjected to an individual's idealogy as well as things you see, feel and experience.  My point? I dunno, but worrying about what hasn't come to passed is definitely not it. Maybe the simple answer to everything is that each and everyone one of us living on Mother Earth should start protecting respecting everything we see as though it's the last day of our lives. Nature, environment, things we use daily. (The Japanese respected their sword as a living thing.) But how many of us will do this? I'm not sure I'm able to discipline myself to do this consciously either. Maybe human kind IS doomed afterall.

      Yesterday Aikido was nice . We generally did a series of wrist locks with Ikkyo, Nikkyo and Kotegaeshi, ai and gyaku hamni katatedori as well as morotedori Towards the end, Frankie Sensei wanted us to do randori with but only with morotedori ikkyo waza.  I thought everyone did ok 'cept me. Was nervous and caught unawares. Can't get myself to calm or quiet down and i tend to be rushing into things. Wish I can control my ukes' ki better.  After that, had to rush down to Plaza Singapura to meet up with some of the old 56th SAB guys. Luckily, Tang drove and gave me a lift down (as well as Tony a lift back). He was kinda rushing because we were pressed for time. When I was almost reaching, Bernard called to say they can't get tickets and they wanted to try Suntec instead. Actually I was wondering how come nobody bought the tickets in advance. It was a Sat evening afterall and we were planning to catch Brotherhood (Korean war film), which had a very good review. Oh well, turns out Bernard, Gary Tay, Andy Ng, Goh Leong Hwee and another guy I'm not to familar with by the name of Vincent turned up. Was nice seeing everyone, so we all walked down to Suntec, chatting at the same time. Turns out Brotherhood was left with only the 3rd row onwards. We didn't think it was wise to catch such a film that close, so we tried check on iRobot. Turns out that it was worse, being the sneak preview weekend, only the front row was left. We decided to grab a&nbsp;seat somewhere for a bite and a chat instead.  Anyway I was qutie keen on a movie so I SMSed Shouwen (cousin in NS now). Turns out he was in City Hall area and we decided to catch iRobot today (Sun). Just managed to book the tickets online. Woohoo... got good seats too, despite paying a bit extra. I think this show is well worth it lah, it looks really impressive. Anyway, if I don't catch it now, I'm not sure I can watch these on weekdays as it seems I'm quite packed for the week meeting Financial Advisors and with Aikido training.  This morning I went for a run again and I think I seriously need to maximise my next 10 wks to prepare for AHM. No joke. Think I'm slacking too much. Neo probably too slack and busy to go for the run this year so I'm all on my own. It's gonna be much harder this way. So I need to start training not jus the body but the mind as well. GAMBATTE!!!!

      There's a medical checkup goin on in school for the students this week. So there are a lot of nurses in school around this period. Here are some jokes I overheard from teachers during lunch today. Damn farneee...   Joke with regards to uniform.  Students' uniform consist of a blouse (OKOK, that's a shirt to us guys), and a pinnafole over the blouse.  Nurse (to P5 class): OK girls, later on you will need to remove your blouse for the checkup. P5 class: *Moment of silence as the look at the nurse with a blank look.* Student: Err ... so that means later we can leave our pinnafole on, lah? Nurse: o_O" ... &nbsp;(This expression sums it all.) Nurse: No, you need to remove everything later. Class: *Wails...*  *Pengz* ... For guys, that's as good as asking us to remove our underwear with shorts on.   Backpain  An account from one of the teachers during lunch. I didn't catch everything so pardon me if some details are abruptly missed out.  Ms C: ... This girl kept telling me of a sharp pain in her back.  Flashback 1: Girl: I keep feeling this sharp pain in my back, as though there's a knife stuck in my back. Ms C: *Leans over and looks behind* ... No, I don't see any knife behind right now. You seem fine to me.  Ms C: Student still kept making noise or something and walked around dragging her foot behind her because of the 'pain'. In the end called her dad (who so happens to be a Dr) to ask to be taken home early from school. Guess what he said?  Flashback 2: Dad (to daughter over the phone): Don't talk rubbish lah! Stay in school till 3pm lah. I'm not asking you to walk around the whole school from now till 3pm also. Later I pick you at 3.  Ms D: So did the girl inform the nurses about the pain in the&nbsp;back? Ms C: Err... actually it seems like it was the nurses who 'caused' the pain... One of the medical tests was to bend over and try to touch your own toe. That's when she felt the pain after that. Ms D: So what did the nurses say?  Flashback 3: Nurse: HUUUUH?! ... o_O"?!  &nbsp; A separate joke was when I was in the same lab as a group of CCA students with the teacher in charge. One of the girls came in late. Mrs M: How come you're late? Student: It's not my fault.... It's the bus that was late. Mrs M: ...&nbsp; x_O"  I was laughing quietly. If you only saw the girl's expression and heard her tone. She genuinely believed that she was free of all responsibility and fault because 'it was the bus that was late' and not her.  Kids ...

      OK, lastnight's training was quite comfortable. Managed to grab a bowl of my favourite Bah Chor Mee Pok (mmmm .... rubs tummy) near school before popping over to Siglap CC.   Sensei came down this evening and Richard wasn't around. Sensei seems to be down more often these days. Maybe he plans to discipline the dojo personally. Alamak *slaps forehead*, forgot to check with Sensei where I can train on a Sun. Even paying $5 per session seems well worth it to occupy some of my free time.    Beginner    Sakai came down to help with the mats and watch. I'd have to say, he's definitely one of the more committed beginners I've seen. Probably due to his grounding in Judo since young. He had to opt out for the night because he was having a stomache upset.   I started with the beginner (husband to the European lady, who so happened to be absent yesterday). He was stiff, very much so than most I've came across.&nbsp;But I suppose that's understandable considering the fact that it's only his first month with us or so. Anyway, I really didn't know how to train with him. Felt very difficult to explain Ikkyo omote and ura to him. When told of what he was doing wrong, he made the classic mistake most Singaporeans would; nodding head and going "Oooh" when he still don't understand it. These days, I try to remind myself not to go "Orrrrh" when I don't understand what I'm taught on the mat.   To digress a bit, I'm amused as I remember some of the things I recall coming from Tang. Sometimes, after training with him and Frankie comes over to correct and give pointers, I would go "OK" or "Orrh". Then Tang will just say "You understand what he's saying? Wah you damn steady. I train here 3 yrs still don't understand and you come here 2 weeks can understand liao. Harharhar!"&nbsp;  Anyway, training with beginners works a little in contrast to what I have to say in the next section below. With beginners, you have to feel in a different way how they react to you. Naturally you can't get to physical or violent with them. Anyway, my parter thinks too much in his techniques rather than just train. He would constantly ask me "Right or wrong?", "OK?", "Can?", etc. As nage, 85% of the time he was the one moving around me instead of me being moved. Sensei came over to help a few times but it was still difficult as he seemed to need more supervision than any of the others. Sensei rotated me out and slotted Leon in. But it kinda had the blind leading the blind effect. He asked if Cryssabella is willing to take him through Ikkyo but she said no. So in the end Sensei took him and Leon while he left us with one or two techniques which we could train by ourselves.   Cryssabella (spelling... err??) / Sunny    First experience training with Cryssabella and I gotta admit she is a bit more rough on ukes as compared to any other females I've came across. She's a&nbsp;4th kyu I think. 3 of us (including Roxanne) did some sumi otoshi - corner drop if I'm not mistaken, and the first time Crys did it on me turned out to be a slam. I wasn't exactly ready for it but I did breakfall enough to get out unscath (whew). Turns out she loves to slam (though Sensei did tell her that her slams needs slight improvements on her landings). Then we did a series of iriminage (suwariwaza) and I thought she did it pretty hard as well. First person I was reminded was Jesse, where his Iriminage  definitely  worked on you. FOr the rest of the evening, she just reminded me of Sunny. Where an uncommitted attack on him means uke rarely moves enough or properly, then that's when Sunny  moves  you instead. Same thing with Crys. She knows enough to move/off&nbsp;balance&nbsp;you. But I'm not sure she considers enough on&nbsp;the welfare of her uke to remember how much breakfall then can tahan from her.  Despite it being so, I found that she usually can't control her strength. Hence, her reputation for being hard and rough on others. She may seem violent if she trains with beginners. Sensei has said that she should be training with people in BV instead (but heard it's a bit far for her and parents don't quite allow it). I agree, she would probably pick up much faster if she actually tried training with a&nbsp;slightly different crowd.

       "... On Mr Lee's remark that bilateral ties were built on equality and mutual respect, he said the DPM had disregarded the Chinese government's 'solemn and just' position on issues relating to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ..."    'Solemn and just' to whom? That's a matter of perception. How can they impose their position on another sovereignty? Ridiculous, simply absurd.    "... He said Mr Lee had also contradicted himself by first calling the visit 'private and unofficial' and then saying it was undertaken to protect Singapore's interests as he was soon to become prime minister.     'As everyone knows, Lee Hsien Loong has been in the upper echelons of the Singapore Government for many years. Hence, his status cannot be changed by such a statement as 'unofficial and private visit'.     'Furthermore, while Lee Hsien Loong was in Taiwan, the Taiwanese authorities accorded him a so-called 'head-of-state' reception. Hence, Singapore's explanation is not tenable.' ..."    I agree, DPM Lee's status cannot be changed by a simple statement. But how can he be blamed for the Taiwanese Govt's warm reception accorded to him? Would you as a guest visit a host, at the same time making demands? I don't think so.    "... Mr Kong's rejoinder yesterday was: 'Why should Singapore's rights and international standing come at the expense of China's sovereignty and core interests? This is both unreasonable and illogical.' ..."    No one country's international standing should come at the expense of another's soverignty and core interest of course. What makes the Chinese Govt see it that way? It wasn't meant to be. Of course we can't stop people from seeing the way we see things, if you choose to see it that way, well so be it. Your eyes aren't ours. Having said that, I think the same question can be put back to the Chinese Govt as to 'Why should China's sovereignty and core interest come at the expense of Singapore's rights and international standing?' Now this is a chicken and egg question and there can be no simple answer. I think all it comes down to is some form of common understanding and tolerance.    "... 'The current difficulties in the two countries' relations are entirely of Singapore's making.&nbsp;'We hope that the Singapore side will face up to the gravity of the issue and take concrete actions to win the confidence of the people of China.' "    So what is expected from Singapore? An apology over something where the only mistake was a difference in interpretation (or refusal to interpret) on the whole affair? That's not going to happen. Oh please, such stuff will be soon forgotten unless one party simply chooses to harp on the matter. Grow up...

      Almost forgot to blog this. &nbsp; Yesterday, just before&nbsp;training at ARCC, saw Michael and Jeremy both practicing tanto kata. Frankie Sensei later mentioned that the kata were from a form of karate kata which actually uses up to 2 tantos (1 was held with the tip poiting out - as like our bokken, and another held the opposite way with the tip pointing towards our elbow). First time I seen, or heard of tanto kata. But I don't think it's a practice in Aikikai style though. Anyway the dagger pointed outwards is used to slash at uke, while the other is held up to protect ourselves (the logic sounds exactly like our usual Aikido practice as in yoko or shomenuchi). &nbsp; Anyway, Jeremey would stand there while Michael used the tanto to slash at certain parts of his uke, then they'd switch roles. But Michael tend to do more reps when it was his turn. Which led to Jeremy commenting, "Eh, you damn shiok right.", while nage was slashing away at him. Hahaha... Anyway, I didn't manage to remember every step (slash) for the kata. I can probably only remember 1-6, then 8 and 9. Somewhere in between I got lost already. &nbsp; Yesterday was Seng Guan's and Nicholas's 5th kyu grading. They passed. I thought that they did very well. Frankie Sensei commented the same. Much better than some of the days they trained. Really, they just seemed more at ease and relaxed.

      This morning's run was horrible. Think I only managed about 2-2.4 clicks before my mind gave. Need to start discipline my mind a bit more. I wish my weekend was put to better use. Would like to put my Sun to better use than to stay home all day. But whatever I intend to do needs to be flexible and not a routine. &nbsp; Pity Eileen mentioned Bt Batok dojo is not available for now. Otherwise maybe, I can drop by on and off to train. &nbsp; Seriously considering Kendo again. Beginners classes are on Wed nights and Sun mornings. Timings seems comfortable enough too. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Recent state of world affairs is horrible.      Phillipines decision to Pull-out of Iraq.  &nbsp;    Articles   -  urlLink Filipino hostage in Iraq appears on TV   -  urlLink Philippines withdraws more troops from Iraq   -  urlLink Philippine south training terrorists    The kidnapped Filipino driver is just human. I'd be scared too if I were in his shoes. But it doesn't change the fact that the message the Phillipines government is sending to dissidents in its own country, the international community, terror networks in the world, political enemies, etc, is that they (Phillipines govt) can be threatened and pressured to do their (eg. terror networks) bidding. The reason for the govt's decision to give in appears more economic than anything else, as a huge no. of it's citizens are working overseas (attracted by higher pay) and a large part of the country's economy and contributions depends heavily on these. But the govt's decision to 'make its people happy' sends out another message. It doesn't have the support or even sufficient control over them. It is little wonder that demonstrations, strikes, protests and riots are frequent over the past few years.  &nbsp;  Any government will need to take a hard stance againt hard-lined extremists otherwise there will be no end to terrorists' demands. By giving in once to these demands, there will be a second time, a third, and so on. How long before it's enough? There is a reason as&nbsp;to why the US has adopted a policy of non-negotiation with terrorists, hijackers, etc (although I do believe that some under-the table deal is agreed upon as a resolution to certain or some of these incidents).  &nbsp;  Repercussions? This latest fiasco won't be Phillipine's last. There will be future incidents similar to this. International aid from countries to help out in rebuilding Iraq will falter and we may see more countries pulling out soon or refusing to&nbsp;assist (eg. Thailand). Political and religious radicals will view Phillipines as a promising base of operations and hotspot&nbsp;where they can recruit and carry out some of their terror activities.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Chinese Govt making a big 'Hoo-Hah' over DPM Lee's visit to Taiwan     Articles  -  urlLink DPM Lee responds to China's protests   -  urlLink Taiwan trip 'doesn't change or contradict 'one China' policy'   -  urlLink Beijing noises a test for DPM and S'pore &nbsp;   I don't really have a problem with Chinese people (sure sure, they appear chatty sometimes in public but let's face it, it's the same for Singaporeans - regardless of race, language or religion).   Whether DPM Lee's visit to China is right or wrong is something I can't comment on as I don't know enough. But as the PM-to-be, he has taken all the necessary steps such as informing China about the visit to Taiwan out of courtesy.&nbsp;Despite China's request that the trip be called off, he noted the request but made made a reply that it was not possible.  &nbsp;   "... to call off the trip at China's request would have undermined our right to make independent decisions, and damaged our international standing. As a small country, this is a vital consideration in our dealings with all countries. ..."   &nbsp;  The Chinese&nbsp;Govt should bear in mind that they made a request, not a threat. If they intend to 'bully' other countries into submission, I don't see them being any different from the terrorists who are holding the Phillipines govt by that invisible 'leash'.    urlLink  Shanghai scraps fair organised by Singapore firm    &nbsp;  An article by Professor Qiao Xinsheng at the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law was headlined 'What's Up With Singapore?'    "... China has said that 'the Taiwan question is the Chinese people's own matter, so foreigners should not interfere', he wrote. 'But this trip to Taiwan by Lee Hsien Loong once again shows us that Singapore does not quite think of itself as foreign to this matter.' ..."    Oh please! Mr Prof, get your facts right before you go firing up the wrong ass. Did he really think that DPM Lee was there for talks on how Taiwan can gain its independence?. I even saw an article in Streats yesterday saying that Singapore view ourselves as untouchable (in a sort of way), that's why we didn't actually consider China's 'feelings' (duh?).&nbsp;The only way that is possible&nbsp;is if you dominated the world and every country. 'Untouchable' indeed...     urlLink  Be careful with Taipei, KL told    &nbsp;   "... Speaking at a dinner on Wednesday, (Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia) said Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's visit to Taiwan had greatly irked China, and advised Malaysia to heed the lesson. 'We will not ask Malaysia to halt unofficial activities and interactions with Taiwan, but we will object directly to any official and formal ones,' he said. ..."    Isn't that a contradiction? DPM Lee had already informed China prior to his visit that it was a pte and unofficial trip. Look at how the Chinese Govt took it? Duuuh...  &nbsp;   "... 'Our relations with China are deep and broad. The principle is mutual interest and mutual benefit, and not concessions accorded by one side to the other. As we said in our earlier statement, it would be regrettable if relations are affected, because both sides will stand to lose. If our relations cannot survive this episode, then they must be shallow and brittle.' ..."    I agree that the Chinese Govt is just testing what are the buttons they can push and how much pressure they can apply on the Singapore Govt. Such petty responses, but for what reason? Probably economic and political. We all know how to handle such bullies...  &nbsp;  What I like about DPM Lee's visit to Taiwan is that, unlike the Chinese Govt, we do not get trapped over bickering of words, issue of 'face' (mian4 zi3), but instead concentrate on the bigger picture and what we can learn.  &nbsp;  DPM Lee's impressions of Taiwan after the visit:  &nbsp;   "The Green side is focused on the upcoming Legislative Yuan election. They feel that a stronger Taiwanese identity is emerging, and that more Taiwanese now support independence.  &nbsp;  The Blue side is preoccupied with the validity of the presidential election, the court proceedings and the investigation of the March 19 shooting incident.  &nbsp;  It may be some time before both Green and Blue leaders and their supporters focus their thinking on the longer-term position of Taiwan and work out their respective strategies for the way ahead.  &nbsp;  None of the friends I met gave me the impression that the Taiwanese leaders were eager for a confrontation across the strait.  &nbsp;  Several told me that the leaders will not push for independence. They also recognised that what matters is not what the leaders say, but what they do.  &nbsp;  I did notice the stronger Taiwanese identity among the population. I also learnt that most Taiwanese believe that China will not attack them. It seems that most also believe that the US will come to Taiwan's rescue if China does attack. I was troubled by this.  &nbsp;  The Taiwanese media are focused almost exclusively on domestic issues, with very little reporting of what is happening in the world outside, like North Korea or Iraq.  &nbsp;  The Taiwanese have not fully come to terms with how rapidly China is transforming itself, and consequently, how interdependent the US and China are becoming.  &nbsp;  This is especially so with Taiwanese political leaders and officials who are not allowed to visit China.  &nbsp;  For the same reason, the Taiwanese public do not know how other major powers like Germany, France, Italy and Russia and India are repositioning themselves and adjusting their policies to this different China that is emerging.  &nbsp;  Because of their preoccupation with domestic politics and winning votes, they have not adequately factored in the vast changes in the international situation. So we cannot rule out a miscalculation or mishap that would have serious repercussions on Singapore and the region.  &nbsp;  We must watch the situation carefully."   &nbsp;  Some responses to the whole incident:   urlLink  No way to treat an old friend like Singapore    I especially like the term 'kow-tow politics' used as it clearly depicts the current expectations China has on Singapore.  &nbsp;   "... I remember well when Indonesia kicked up a real big fuss over the fate of a few of its commandos, who had been caught after bombing MacDonald House in the 1960s, even though Jakarta didn't have a legal leg to stand on. That was when Singapore was newly independent and, being a small country with no hinterland, had seemed fair game for big countries to try and dictate its policies. Some things never change."  &nbsp;  "... Once Singapore becomes accommodating to one big power, it may demand more, with others joining in. Then we would end up dancing to everyone else's tune but our own."  &nbsp;  "... China's action clearly shows that we, a small nation, must continue to help ourselves and be united, otherwise we will be bullied into accepting 'kow tow' politics."     urlLink  What could have provoked China's stern rebuke     "... The Singapore Government will do what it can to repair any damage. If it was a diplomatic faux pas, it should express its regrets to China. But there's no need for Singapore to prostrate itself before China or anybody."

       Work/School  I sat in today for Daphne's class in the afternoon. The class came in noisily and grumbling all the while. Turns out that they've just had a brush in with their form teacher. I'm not at liberty to post here what actually happened (and I'm sure what I had heard had been exaggerated to a certain extent too). Anyway, the girls were grumbling and mumbling for a good 20ish mins or so, even after we've told them to forget about the incident and start concentrating on lessons twice. It's not like I don't symphatise with what they were feeling but it was more of getting the lesson done instead. In the end, I had to give them a 'lecture on life' just to get them to quiet down. &nbsp; Think&nbsp;it went along the lines of something like, "Hey girls! Why are you still grumbling?! I already told you to quiet down right?! Now, you want me to give you a lecture on 'Life' right? I tell you, when you start working outside in future, do you think your boss will not do the same thing (as what your teacher did)? What do you think you are going to do when he/she (does something similar or worse)&nbsp; than what (form teacher) did? QUIT!? Sure! You can do that. But what happens when you need the money/regular income? Then what are you going to do? Now, I'm not defending what (form teacher) did, neither is it up to me to judge whether she is right or wrong. If you feel like complaining, go ahead and do whatever you want later but right now I want everyone to settle down and start concentrating on the lesson." At least they quiet down right after. They weren't bad girls and most of them seemed highly intelligent as they seemed to put in more effort in their work then some of the classes of the same level. They can do good work when properly motivated. But they make too much noise. They tend to work AND talk at the same time and that makes the environment quite hard to work in sometimes. &nbsp; When I think about what happened, I think their teachers must've had her own reasons for her actions. The girls can come in saying "She did this or that for no particular reason." And they can keep saying these for quite awhile. But most of the time, kids that age tend to only provide half a story. If you'd actually bothered talking to them even more for awhile longer, one would find that they will slowly change their sentence to "She did this or that for no particular reason.    But    we this or that before ..." Haiz ... keyword is the 'BUT', obviously people behave a certain way for a reason lah. &nbsp; What I couldn't stand was that a huge no. of girls just left their books outside the lab and knowingly went home just like that. The last 2 girls whoe left the class had to clear up after them and they were quite pissed. Daphne and I allowed them to leave the stack of books in the lab till next morning, but I was quite pissed. Really. I told them to come at 8am to collect. I didn't want them to get into bigger trouble by complaining to their form teacher but I really intended to scold the girls good for leaving stuff around like that.&nbsp;When the morning came however the books were all gone. They must've collected before I came to work. Oh well, I don't have their names anymore and going to their teacher wouldn't benefit anyone. Forget it. &nbsp;  Siglap CC Aikido  Got to training later than usual. Freaking bus was single decked and FULL. Simply don't understand why SBS don't make svc 12 completely double deckered. I noticed that even when double deckered buses were full, they were still decently comfortable. Single deckered buses were HORRIBLE!! I had to pia down by cab and pay the extra surcharge. Argh ... $6.20 gone just like that. Leon and Wenjun were there just hanging around and waiting downstairs. I simply don't understand why they can't draw the keys to open the doors and start laying mats first instead of just slacking around. I went to draw keys and passed it to the 2 guys as I needed to go to the toilet first. Maybe because I was rushing to the CC, maybe because of my firm attitude with the students at work earlier, or maybe I was just plain pissed with the attitude I'm seeing in the dojo, but I wasn't in the mood to take crap today. Told them next time they were early, they should go draw out the keys instead of waiting around. Wenjun should know better. Leon, aiya ... expected lah. &nbsp; Decided to change since I was already in the toilet. When I finished and went up to the dojo, the whole damn place was a mess. THe 2 guys just kept chucking mats on top of each other in such a messy pile instead near the entry point of when one carried the mats out. It slowly became a choking point. I asked them to start shifting the mats while I take out the mats from the room behind instead. Even so, they did things so slowly. Wenjun in particular even went to the extent of lying on the messy pile of mats instead of helping. WIth such an example to follow and slack around, Leon was quick to join in by just dilly dallying (on top of his usual habits) instead of helping properly. I just went about quickly to lay the mats with the help of the girls who soon arrived and Sakai who came even later. All the while, I was in a pissy mood so I just quietly laid the mats 1 row at a time as quick as I could.&nbsp;We soon finished laying but we haven't fitted them in yet.&nbsp;As we&nbsp;fitted the mats, I'm quite disgusted when I saw Wenjun, Leon, Cryssabella (or&nbsp;is it Isabella)&nbsp; all sitting behind talking and SMSing away. Roxanne wasn't around as she was changing in the toilet. I came across 2 mats wrongly laid and I actually asked Leon rather nicely (I can't believe myself either) to help me make a switch of the 2 mats (I even pointed out to him where to switch the mats). He said&nbsp;OK rather nicely and came over to take the 2 mats away while&nbsp;I went on fitting the amts. At this point,&nbsp; ONLY  Sakai and I were on the mats fitting them in (AARGHHHH!!&amp;^%*). When I came to the spot where I asked (keyword 'asked') Leon to exchange the mats, I only saw 2 lobang there. I turned around and saw that he had chuck the 2 mats in a corner and was standing behind talking happily to Wenjun. THAT WAS THE LAST (censored profanity) STRAW!!!! I remembered still really controlling my temper and just raising my voice and changing to a very irate tone "Wah lao eh, LEON! Don't leave the mats just lying there lah! When I asked you to change the mats, don't just do things halfway LAH!! Can you finish your work or not!!" I turned back looking REALLY pissed and by that time, the others were just a bit shocked because it was the first time any of them saw me come close to losing my temper. I went back to fitting the rest of the mats to cool myself down (which proved to be tremendously effective) and I didn't even notice whether anyone else chipped in after that. By the time the mats were finished, I was all smiley and comfortably relaxed again. Richard came in sometime later and signalled me to take the warmups. I decided to make the pace of the warmups a bit faster than usual just to get everyone going a little. But most of them still had the 'wanna-sleep' face. Richard did go around correcting Leon's posture and balance during warmup. &nbsp; After awhile, Freddy Sensei arrived and he conducted the class again for the evening. He was more strict than usual and I think it was definitely necessary. I paired with Wenjun most of the night and found that he also has a slack attitude when it comes to training. But at least he tries and manages to observe better. Anyway, no further unpleasantness occurred for the rest of the night.

      Discovered a remedy for Mon blues. Wake earlier than you normally would, go to work earlier than usual, just start your day early instead of waiting and dreading the start of a new day/week. Guaranteed to work.

      Caught Spiderman 2 today. It wasn't exactly a fantastic movie but it was OK. I do hope there's going to be a part 3 to this though. So far, it's been following pretty closely to the comic. Would be interesting to see his regular foes surface in the movie sequels such as Green Goblin 2, Venom, etc.  I had a bit more word with Tang about the financial investment plans with AXA. Figured I needed to sort my finances out first so when I got back, I decided to re-create my Excel document so as to maintain a regular accounts of my expenses and hopefully some savings. Actually I had this habit when I was in UK. Seeing how fast your money disappears will really scare you to spend much less than usual. I modified the old template to suit my current needs. Will be updating my a/c every few days or at least once a week.   While looking for my Excel document, I came across some crappy stuff I created in UK. Haha ... they were half-hearted attempts on writing boliao rhymes to depict my mood. Starting from the earliest which I had created in sec sch. I got inspired by the Mac ad whose famous phrase was "&#21507;&#20010;&#33529;&#26524;Pie...". It goes something like this:   &#21507;&#20010;&#33529;&#26524; pie, &#23453;&#23453;&#38271;&#24471;&#24555;. &#23567;&#26102;&#19981;&#21507;&#33756;, &#32769;&#20102; kanna sai. &#33258;&#31216; Leon Lai, &#32317;&#26159;&#29233;&#19978;&#21488;. &#32769;&#26159;&#29233;&#38382; 'why', &#27668;&#24471;&#32769;&#24072; die. &#20415;&#23452;&#19968;&#23450; buy, &#26377;&#38065;&#23601;&#35201;&#24320;. &#35748;&#35782;&#20102;&#22351;&#34507; guy, &#27599;&#22825; 'gimme 5', &#21464;&#24471;&#23454;&#22312;&#22351;. &#19968;&#22825;&#34987;&#20154;&#23475;, &#26368;&#21518;&#20013;&#20102; fine. &#29238;&#27597;&#27809;&#26377;&#32784;,&#26089;&#30693;&#25343;&#21435;&#21334;.   Haha... I was weird even back then. No idea how I thought of this in the first place.  That's not the end of it...  My first few mths in UK, I had a habit of maximising the free SMS with my hp service and on ICQ. I remembered SMSing my kakis randomly whenever I was in the mood for it.     The sun is high, the wind is cold. Tuck my head in tight, coz my nose juz froze. The day is long, dun moan & groan. I'll sing a song coz I'm goin home.    That was close to winter where the winds got pretty strong and almost always tend to freeze it numb. I was so cold walking back to my flat, but was really glad classes were over. I sent this out when classes had ended.     Enjoy wat remains of today, as I'm working on my essay. O pity to my plight, I wish you all a goodnight. If you see the stars tonight, make a wish with all your might. That I'll finish up on time, and share with you another rhyme.    Was going overtime on an essay then. Felt so tired and so sian but I knew I shouldn't go to bed till I was done. At that time, I tend to leave my ICQ on quite often and I was a bit demoralised when I saw my kakis all drift off to bed one by one. So I just SMSed them before they all knocked out.     Yes, hurray! Only an hour for today. Just hand in my essay, and away to play. Wat are you doing, better not be lazing. Hope you're OK, for the whole of your day. The Aston Webb building, now that's where I'm leaving. Gonna make my way home, for lunch and alone. Home is the place, and there I will stay. Gimme a ring, and why not drop in. Take a look see, at little ol'me.    Felt sooooo happy at submitting in my assignment I had to SMS my friends for the fun of it. It had been a looooong night. The Aston Webb building was where my dept was located then (it shifted later). I had just submitted my essay and was leaving when I created this rhyme. But I felt really lonely then because I knew all my other kakis were in classes or something that day. Though it was practically a free day for me, I felt kinda alone then. That was why I had the last few phrases. I was hoping someone could just pop by for a chat or something because I just felt really really bored.     I know you dun like it, but please juz bear with it. If you really can't stand it, feel free to delete it. We had a great chit chat, but it had to end. Too bad. The soup was pretty neat, it was really quite a feat. Begh's like a little kid, she's really light on her feet. Darren helped a bit, by washing plates and eat. Hope when next we meet, I too can join in to eat.    By this time, some of my friends were getting pretty bored (and dare I say, irritated) with my random SMSes. Haha ... It was 'that' random ok. That's why I included the 2 sentences first. That evening, I believe I dropped by someone's flat for a nice chit chat session. Because my accomodation was hall-related, my breakfast and dinner were both covered. After dinner, I dropped by my friends and I guess, I must've had a bowl of soup only. I can't recall exactly what went on that evening but it really made my feel light-hearted with all that companionship. Begh (3rd year housemate) was like a rabbit trotting and hopping around the flat, that much I can remember. Darren Lim didn't do any cooking but he washed all the dishes I suppose. I felt so happy when I left that I really wished another session like that would come soon. That's when I SMSed everyone when I got back to my flat.     Start of the day, was nice as the month of May. But at the end of today, got on my knees and pray. Had to bite off all my nails, coz I don't understand the tutorial.    Birmingham sometimes would encounter very wet and crappy weather. The day itself was fantastic, but after classes (I seem to recall it being my Databases I lecture by Alex Sexton) I felt so demoralised as I wasn't able to understand the whole tutorial.     Heard from the news this evening, The cold will come a calling. Tommorrow snowshowers forecasted, But these things can't be predicted. Don't get overzealous, Tonight's minus 5 celsius.    We had all encountered a really shiok amount of snow during our 1st year there. It was kinda a freak snow because it never usually got that heavy or thick. It was so great that most Singaporeans felt really pampered by the weather, considering it was a first experience for most of us. So needless to say, a lot of us were also hoping deep in our hearts that the same thing will repeat again. When I heard the news that it was going to snow tomorrow, I was really looking forward to it. But it also meant we all had to bear the -5 degree celsius for the night.     9 to 10 is tommorrow's class on Japan. Cya 10 to 9 at traffic lights, ok man.    I had Japanese language lessons 3 days a week, all of them the first lesson of the day. At that time I was learning it with Darren Lim and David Tay. I was arranging to meet Darren at the traffic light outside my flat and we could all walk to class together since he'd usually pass by anyway.     Hope the ice-cream was nice, though not cold as ice. Eat it after rice, it'll be just as nice. If Begh wants the radio, call me to say hello. Need to go Tesco, who wants to go tommorrow?    Hmm I can't remember exactly what this was about, but I believe it was an ice-cream I took from hall during dinner. Desserts which I can't finish, I tend to bring it back to my flat to store it in the fridge. Sometimes I'd give it with my English housemates if they wanted it. I never believe in wasting food, you see. Well, I think I mentioned to Begh that there was ice-cream and decided to give it to her since I was popping by her place (for some reason or other but I can't remember what). Haha, I do remember Begh complaining that we (kakis) tend to be feeding her all the time. Begh mentioned once before that she'd like to borrow my radio. She needed it to play cassettes or CDs or something like that. I believe that evening was a Fri night as I usually went to the nearby supermarket Tesco to get my groceries with Chris and co.     Classes have ended, I'm finished for today. Feels like I've waited, half my life away. A morning game of pool, with Darren at the Guild. Gonna head back soon, for lunch until I'm filled. If you too have ended, my room is where I'll stay. Don't be irritated, while I SMS you away.    This was one of the days in a week where I end early. Usually I'd meet Darren Lim and we'd go for a few rounds of pool at the students' Guild house. But after that I felt really bored. I was practically warning my kakis that while they were in lessons, they should be prepared for me to bug them via SMS hehe :P     Sun's up, time to wake up. Do situps and pushups, time to get up. To toilet and washup, no excuse to be held up. I'm gonna washup, soon as I finish my pressups.    It was definitely a weekend. I tend to keep a personal regime going even then. But I think I was bored. I seem to recall this particular SMS was sent to my ex.     It's a time for laughter and cheer, Time to cast away your fears. 'Ang Bao's are a little this year, But try hard not to shed a tear. That really isn't too queer, Coz our home isn't very near. If family, relatives and friends are here, They'll wish you a "Happy Chinese New Year". I too, wish you, my friends dear, To enjoy this Chinese New Year.    Obviously it was Chinese New Year. I think we all felt a bit lonely being away from home over this festive season. I know that I was. I kinda SMSed this out to everyone after a period of not SMSing them.

      Finally submitted the Inter-Primary School Design Competition for the CHIJ Katong Pri. That's a load off my mind now. Mr Wai, of Bt View Sec was quite nice about the whole thing. He said it was no problem handing it in 1 day late. He just asked me if I was a teacher in the school and I just told him I'm one of the IT trainers there. The journey back to CHIJ Katong Pri was a long and demoralising one because Bt View was at Bt Batok (West). Considering that after work I had to travel back from East to West again ... Anyway, I decided to take a slight change of route. Instead of taking to Paya Lebar MRT and taking 135 back to school, I decided to go to Dhoby Ghaut, 'tabao' bfast at Mac before taking 36 down. It's not really diverting myself off from the route to school, bearing in mind that 36 travels one heckuva direct route via Expressway down.  After work, I met up with Tang at City Plaza where we grabbed lunch at a hawker centre nearby. Food was cheaper than most places these days but it was horrible. Tang's words, "Life is just like gambling, it's just that we lost this gamble." haha. And another was "But life is not just 1 round of gambling." ... so there's still hope yet, heh. On our way down to ARCC he explained to me somethings about investment planning, unit trust, etc. Was quite interesting.  Today's training at ARCC was on jo. Very good because we did some co-ordination exercises (musubi seems like a regular practice ever since Williams Sensei introduced it to us), followed bu how to thrust with a jo. I never thought there was so many points to take note. What I learned yesterday, when thrusting the jo you should extend ki. Both hands should be extended (but not to the extent that you have your arms all straightened and elbows locked. Your hips will be twisting a bit to bring a bit of the force into the thrust. (Starting from left stance,) at the end of the thrust, our hips and body will be straight and facing the front. When thrusting, we take a step forward. Point of balance should be on the front leg and not the back. One test would be we can raise the back leg and we still won't topple over. But care needs to be taken not to over extend and fall forward. Right hand when thrusting forward, will twist the jo in a screw-like motion. You push the jo forward and the left hand just holds on as a guide. Finally at the end of a thrust, right hand will have contacted the left hand (if not, it means you haven't completed the thrust fully). If partner holds on to end of your jo and you do it right, they can't resist/stop you from thrusting forward. All these just for the thrusting motion. When pulling back the jo (meaning back to starting stance again), same un-screwing motion with the right hand. If done properly, partner will not be able to stop you from pulling back either. There's also some movement with the hips which I don't seem to have managed to understand. After pulling back, we raise the jo to our forehead as a protection to ourselves. Right hand should be just above our forehead, tip of jo should be pointed out at uke, I can't quite explain but the jo needs to be able to be high enough to protect a blow coming towards our heads from the top, and also prevent your left shoulder from being hit when a top strike comes down. All these 3 movements should be co-ordinated with ki extension to make it more powerful and graceful. Not 1, 2, 3, but a more fluid motion of ooooone-two. So many points and that's only trying it on my good side (left stance). On changing to right stance I can't even move properly anymore haha.  This morning I dropped by Tanglin CC for a look. AFS was invited for a combined training there. Guest instructor was Takezawa Shihan (7th dan), from Japan's Hombu. Was interesting just watching but I didn't stay for long. Basically slipped off before they bowed to the kamiza. Didn't feel like it after a morning's run. Not to mention I'll be catching Spiderman 2 at Lido right after lunch. I've decided to go to town looking like a satay-man haha ... can't be bothered to go in jeans and shoes on a Sun, especially when it's so close to home.

      Had a great gathering tonight, courtesy of David Tay.  People who turned up, Daniel, David, Lynette, Begh ... and later on Xinmin. We had sushi at Millenia Walk. Gotta admit, it was my first visit to a sushi bar. Nice experience. Somewhat expensive but hey, it's not like I do it very often.  We hd a long chat about everything and I felt really really relaxed and so happy to see people from Uni again. Was quite touched actually. Sometimes a simple gesture like a random invitation out for dinner or a cup of coffee leaves me beaming for the rest of the night. Of course, not everyone will have the same effect. Only those who I deem to be good close friends.  Was nice hearing everyone being crazy and reminiscing about the days back in Uni. Gosh ... do I feel old now. But hey, I'm really enjoying my life not. I'm not in a job that's killing me slowly, my working environment is filled with cute happy kids and nice people, I train regularly in Aikido. I think I can pretty much handle the bad stuff that comes along with the good.  Life is good to me, and life goes on.

      Started the morning getting the submission of the Inter-Primary School Design Competition ready. Printed the artwork, pasted it onto a frame and mounting board for submission, got the write-up finalised and printed out. Even went for an early lunch to get ready to submit it later in the afternoon after my P1 class.  Things went OK for awhile. That is until another class wanted to use the lab slot after mine. I was a bit confused (naturally since I was still in the middle of my class). Florence wanted to bring her class in later as well because it was her class slot. BUt I knew there was another CCA club that will be in the lab later. Got even more confused and after my class ended I tried to sort the whole thing out. I had gotten the class schedule out last week and submitted to my HoD then. After awhile, I realised it was Daphne (again) who didn't update her class exceptions which fell out of the usual slot. Basically it caused a lot of 'eating into' other class slots thereby affecting a few more classes here and there. Not a big problem that can't be solved, but I'm very tired of updating lab slots all the time when such a thing happens. I had to apologise to Florence (can tell that her class was quite disappointed), told Daphne to settle the future exceptions herself. Aiya, natural lah, not like I'm the one in charge of scheduling the classes anyway. I only update the softcopy for my HoD that's all.  After that, I had to pia down to submit the artwork for the competition. Got to Bedok View Sec (located next to Siglap CC where I train every Thurs evenings), and guess what ... found out I've gone to the WRONG SCHOOL.... pengz. Alamak! Didn't panick lah, just felt sian coz the weather was very hot and I was starting to perspire like a pig. Sianz man. I SMSed my HoD and asked if I could claim cab fare if I rushed down. She SMSed back saying it was fine if I had the receipt. As I was entering CHIJ Katong Pri, I got a call from David (final yr UK housemate) that they were having dinner. So random but a welcomed invitation all the same. Told him I was more than up for it. He even suggested asking my ex along. SMSed her but I might have left her updated HP no in my home PC because my SMS didn't seem to get thru.  Anyway, I got back to school, called up Bt View Sec (the correct one!) and asked what time they closed. The guy on the other end was really nice (a gentleman by the name of Mr Peng). He didn't think it was wise of me to rush down anyway so he said he'll let the teacher in charge (Mr Wai) know that I'll be submitting tommorrow instead.  When I think about it, since last month, I got no idea why I always had the impression that I was to submit the artwork to Bedok View Sec. I must've taken it for granted and not double checked it. Haiz ... stupid stupid.  Ultimately, carelessness on my part ended nicely today. Felt really glad that things worked out just fine.

      Training lastnight was OK. Sensei popped by to teach. We did the backstretching exercise, followed by a series of other teachnoques; katatedori gyaku hamni iriminage, katatedori aihamni kokyunage variation, and a few of our regular kokyunage, etc.  Wenjun's dad popped by lastnight. Apparently he had told his dad he was going for Aikido. We've not seen him for quite a few month in fact. His dad mentioned he had stopped him because of his studies, but after that he had told him to come for training. Haiz... teens these days. Wenjun is not a bad kid, problem might be the co he hangs around with in school. His just a brash young man with too much energy. Aikido tends to put some of those energy he has into good use, but because he isn't 100% serious with his training, he still has a lot of spare energy being wasted outside with his friends. He doesn't go around making trouble all the time (I think), but because the school has kind of branded him as a troublemaker, he gets pin-pointed pretty often. I think he feels damn sian not being trusted in school and home. Don't know (or sees) him enough to be able to advise or help him. Like I said, not a bad kid but very very prideful. His ego prevents him from being told that he is at fault sometimes and when someone lectures him, he goes into a switch-off mode (one ear in and another out).  Leon got a telling off that night. He was thinking (I'd say dreaming) of his grading. At the start of class he keeps telling me he wants to buy a new orange belt - it's getting too short/small for him - but to buy one now when he's going to get graded for his blue belt soon, it's like wasting $. (OKOK you can kinda interpret that he kinda has the notion he will automatically/definitely be able to get his blue belt.) I think somewhere along during class he might've mentioned something like that to Sensei and Sensei gave him a lecture instead. His attitude was so poor during training, how to take his grading? Sensei's words were something like, "Your rolls are worse than a beginner and you still dare to tell me you want to take your grading?" At the end of class he lectured Leon in a corner of the room for a short while.  I don't know how is it that we develop the right mindset for martial arts training. Some have it at the very beginning, some naturally just develop it along the way, and others need a lot of help to develop it. I think working with the young these days (like where I'm working) is not hard sometimes, but to work with youths - now that's a real challenge. I guess that's why it's important to cultivate our kids at such a tender age. But when is it too much. Sometimes I look at the load the kids in school have now,  it's really so much different from UK. The kids know how to have fun. Some of the EM1 kids I've seen here are so serious and stiff, I have my doubts if they have the same interpretation of 'fun'. Sometimes I feel quite sad looking at how Singapore has 'developed'. We are strong in a variety of areas but there's still so much more we should/can do. The emphasis placed by our govt is not wrong, but sometimes they look a bit too far and forget the here and now. We need a better balance of things, for ourselves, our country, and a more rounded future for the generations to come. Don't you think?

      I'm posting a separate entry for this.  When I got back, I watched the Law and Order series on TV. Tonight's episode was about Euthanasia - mercy killing. I remembered this topic came up during my O-levels Chinese Oral (prelims). I did pretty OK for it. Felt quite strongly then that mercy killing was not being merciful at all. Murder was how I'd classify it. In the series, the doctor wasn't convicted. Brought some feelings and contradictions to mind.  First of all, lawyers. They'd defend the guilty for money. Innocence can be bought. But than again, anyone guilty of a crime still deserves the same rights. We can't say that a person in jail who was murdered in his cell deserves anything less than anyone else who got murdered on the street.  Second, I was kinda unhappy that even in the eyes of the law, it was possible to let the 'murderer' get away scot-free. Mercy killing was still killing. That there was a chance that freedom could be 'negotiated' in the court of law was ... I can't find the words to say it. I'm disheartened, really. I know it was just a TV show but I feel that a lot of things we see on TV were created from half-truths. There has to be some resemblance to the real world we live in. That's what made Law and Order such a damn good show.  At the the same time, I feel a bit fearful. The law isn't black and white. Reality has such a big grey area that we stand exactly on the line ready to be tipped in either direction. But all this only serves to strengthen my conviction that we need to take up some form of responsibility to uphold our beliefs. For me, it's to uphold the law as best I interpret it. Double standards prevail in everything and I don't deny that even in myself. I guess the only way is to remain balanced and react to every situation in a yin/yang fashion (Irimi and Tenkan in Aikido) but to always return back to the line/point of balance after the situation is resolved.

      Saturday: woke up and went running. Had a hardtime with 6km run. I had to stop and walk the last km or so. Not good. I wasn't breathing properly for the morning run. Weird.  CHIJMES was great. My first time being involved in such an event so I found it pretty refreshing. Also the first time I ever had my hands on a polaroid camera. I didn't really stay long because of training in the afternoon.  Got to the dojo on time and we did the usual warm-ups, corrections of posture, etc. Seems like only white belts were present. Only other person there (besides Frankie Sensei) was Tang who came late. After that was 'revision' of Nicholas's grading syllabus. I think it's due next week or something. He tend to gets trapped thinking about the grading. I find that he's like the typical studious looking Singapore teen who treats everything like a test in school. Constantly pondering for a 'textbook' answer for even regular/daily practice. I don't know, I do get frustrated with my owbn progress ocassionally, but very often I take Aikido as it is. Hey, if I don't know it ... I don't know it. Racking my brains just isn't going to help me. Well, I'm just glad that the next lesson is going to be a weapons class on jo.  After class, Tang and I went down to Bugis and meet some of the old 56SAB folks. Was nice to see some familar faces. I had to admit though, I didn't know half the people there. But it was great to see Marcus Fam again. The guy is sooo different from before. He basically kept a pony tail and he's so physically pumped up he seriously resembles a miniature version of Jackie Chan (something most of his friends commented in Australia). One thing though, seeing him makes me really wish I was doing more consistent gym training again. It also makes me very hopeful that it's possible to get that kind of effect without the use of steroids and supplements. But one thing Marcus mentioned, it takes a lot of self-discipline and I'm not too sure I'm willing to give up some of the sinful food I really like. But I'm really having second thoughts about some serious training in a gym and planning a serious exercise regime. Then again, I never exercise to make myself look good, only feel good. Plus building myself up on mass has some down points. I'm not sure it'll help my Aikido. On the contrary, I'd worry that I will exert more physical strength in my regular trainings, somthing that's a definite no-no. I guess I need to find a balance somewhere.  Sun was a really slacked day for me. I spent time bumming around at home and just waiting for Mon to come. For helping out on Sat at CHIJMES, Tracey gave me halfday off on Mon. Decided it might be a good time to catch a movie alone. Got to town and found Plaza Singapura crowded with people. I guess being a school holiday that was only to be expected. Didn't feel like squeezing with a crowd to catch Spiderman 2 so I walked down to Kinokuniya in Ngee Ann City. Spent a good 2hrs plus browsing the martial art and military history sections. After that I went down to BB East CC for Alvin's class. Really been a long time since I last visited. I had forgotten how enjoyable his lessons always is. I just realised that his way of teaching bears some semblance to Yuishinkai's. After warmups, he'd explain certain way of how the warm-ups we did will help us in this or that technique, or even the idea of how we should be doing our warm-ups properly. It was just good lah. I had a very enjoyable time that evening. I do remember Alvin accidentally knocking me on the head when he was demonstrating something with the bokken. He was a bit blur also when it happened. Anyway, nothing fatal ... purely accidental ... it was a good laugh too. Oh man, but one thing I kinda can't stand. Someone let one go during the start of class. There was a soft sound (which I can't quite tell initially), followed by a really pungent smell which lasted about 7-8 sec before diffusing off into the other parts of the dojo. What was worse? The guy let one go again a few seconds later. Argh ... chemical attack, man! We shoulda all be wearing the SAF mop 4 (full attire for chemical/biological warfare) hahaha... Monday came and went quickly. If not for Alvin's class, I might've felt that I had wasted my time.  Tuesday came, I was suppossed to conduct a teacher's training and was a bit surprised when Mdm Tien mentioned she had seen my blog. Then some of the teachers present started asking about what's a blog and how often I update it. Oh man, feeling paiseh. Aiyar! Means now cannot talk bad about the school liao...  . Just kidding. Took 2 P1 classes today and they really enjoyed using the Paint software. One class did find it incredibly easy to use though. Really noticed some difference in the way Daphne and I would conduct the class for kids at such a tender age. I would stubbornly insist that they learn from the point of switching on electricity, powering up the PC, logging into a network, and shutting down a PC properly after logoff. Daphne on the other hand minimises the beginning by helping them start up. The kids do pick up things fast, which is why I'm quite insistent that the P1s know what they are doing and will need to enforce good PC care and habits from the very beginning. Of course, I still get the occasional one or two who would just press the power button to shutdown instead. However, basic PC skills in my book in far from complete. If I had more time, I'd make sure they learn what is proper file management. But I'm afraid that would be something I can teach only if I had more time/lessons with them. But practical and timetabling concerns makes that an impossibility for this year, by my estimate.  Aikido at BVCC was ok. Not a lot of people turned up and we laid the usual 143 mat area. It was a hard time training and keeping the mats after that. I'm just glad that almost everyone helped. Was really tired when I went to change out of my sweaty and stinky gi. We did some kokyunage+iriminage for starters. I paiered with a whitebelt Malaysian (I think) by the name of Jacky, who was really good. He used to train in Malaysia (and did he mention Hong Kong too?) for about 2 yrs inconsistently due to work commitments. After that he pretty much stopped for almost the same length of time. He has pretty good posture and his basic understanding is there. I'm guessing he was either a 5th or 4th kyu in his dojo then. But his technique is softer than some of the brown belts I've encountered in BV. He is a bit rusty but that's nothing a few months of practice can't help.

      Came to school as usual. Hung around doing my stuff in the labs until it was  about 10+. Mrs Liew (VP) came in to look for me and Daphne. Apparently she needed us to be around over the weekends. It's the 150th Anniversary of the CHIJ schools in Singapore (12 of them) and there's going to be an event held at CHIJMES. They needed help for the photo-taking and the money collection. I was thinking that I might have to burn my training at ARCC but I still felt pretty happy to help out. Anyway, it seems like I should have just about exactly enough time to travel up and down anyway. Mrs Liew was very nice about the whole thing. Very motherly lady... hehe  Suay today. It was sometime then that I realised my pants was torn. Lo and behold, a nice line which seemed like a fine cut. Sheesh... anyway I still had to hang around for a whole day so I gave my dad a ring. Luckily he was around the neighbourhood. He lompang me back home, I changed then we grabbed lunch near my school and I made my own way back afterwards. Checked the cut at home and it seemed way too fine to be a normal tear. Might've caught it on something without realising. Worse of all, I never even realised just how long the cut has been there. Yesterday was Friday, for all I know it could've been there since the start of the week... *pengz*  Anyway, turns out I had to be at CHIJMES the next day between 1-3pm. Told Tracey I might have to leave about 2.30pm because it was last minute and I already made plans. She said it was fine. Over the afternoon, noticed that Marcus Fam was online (back from Aus for a 2 wk holiday). Spoke with him for awhile and found out there was an informal gathering of some old 56SAB personnel. Well, I contacted Tang and we think we can both make it right after Aikido.

      Training last night was good. I can't say I managed to understand everything but I think there was a lot of stuff that I've sometimes thought about that was put into practice.  Paired with the beginner (don't know his name, husband to the Eurasion lady) for starters. I had didfficulty with him for the the usual back-bending exercise. Richard came over and gave a few pointers. I should just do what I usually did. I wasn't extending my arm properly and it gave my uke a lot of difficulty. For one thing, as a beginner, he already feels unsure about what he should do. SO if I don't help him along (natural, normal movements) he won't be able to follow properly. It's good to work with beginners because they don't have an idea of the movement, hence if they don't follow properly it probably means I'm the one who failed to guide them in properly. Well, I kept in mind on removing the uke's 'should' and 'should not' movements from my mind and proceeded. I found that he does follow much better in fact (by beginner's standards).  After that we did Shihonage. Realised that the husband was more stiff compared to his wife. I would point out somethings about his stance and the technique and thought he sometimes nods, he simply stands there and wait. One step at a time, I suppose. Helped him to take note of which leg to roll and how to hug his head to his arm as uke. As nage, there was more difficulty telling him how to bring me down. Pointed out to him that he needed to make my elbow point to the sky, and the bringing me down motion was something I don't think he managed to grasp at all last night.  After we split up beginners and coloured belts. Coloured belts was going into a slam. Richard wanted to make it a slam I think, but I just wasn't confident enought for it as uke. He said we could go for a rolls first. (He said he would've shown us if his leg wasn't injured.) I think I did kinda manage to do a decent slam (God knows how) just once. But never managed to repeat that success again. I was trying to get the feeling or re-experience it again. Wasn't successful. Never mind, next time. In future, think I'll need to arrive earlier and practice some slamming exercise/warm-ups before classes.  Got the name of the Indian chap, Vic. While doing kokyu-ho he says he notices my 'technique' is different from what most of the others are doing. Don't exactly know what he meant but we basically exchanged hp no.s for the purpose of exchanging Aikido clips/VCDs in future.

      Today's training was good.  Patrick trained with his wife, Meng Lee paired with Sakai, while Darryl, Roxanne and I trained in a group. Emphasis was placed on making things flowy. Helped us to try to maintain a level of awareness, not that we did manage to achieve this heh heh... anyway, I think we connected with each other rather nicely just now. It wasn't particularly tiring either.  After that I had my usual Aikido talk with Richard as we took the same MRT line home. He again advised me to go for the coming grading in Sep. I don't think I'm putting it off this time. I feel more receptive about it this time round than the earlier months. He also mentioned some little things he's trying to cultivate in us. Eg, he's trying to make Roxanne train harder (too soft), Cryssabella a bit softer (too hard) and start all of us on how to take slams. Cool! He said though it may not be necessary for ukemi but it's good to know.  Sakai passed Richard a live blade today. Apparently the ship Sakai works on used to have a Japanese Captain. The latter probably left it in his bunk long ago. Sakai was worried that he might get into trouble for holding on to it so he decided to give it to Richard instead. He also had a little dagger (tanto size I assume) but he said that it was way too sharp and he had thrown it into the sea long ago. The sword on the other hand was blunt out. It looked simple enough and feels a little heavy.

      At long last, after periods of reading on bus & MRT journeys, I had finally finished the book Killing Pablo by Mark Bowden (author of Black Hawk Down).  Pablo was one of Columbia's (if not the) most powerful drug kingpin back in the 90s. This book provided me food for thought on several issues. It gave me an overview of how drugs can seriously hurt another country, both economically and socially. It was estimated that even around or after Pablo's death, the US population would still spend a whooping $30.8 billion on cocaine alone. We must never ever allow such a situation to come to pass in Singapore. It is good that we have a stiff death sentence (though I don't think that human rights activist would agree).  The book also showed the extent of US involvement (covert and overt). The Bush administration had viewed the illegal import of cocaine from Columbia to be important enough to re-interpret certain laws and regulations to make it NOT illegal for US forces to pursue a foreign national. Besides providing training, equipment, intelligence, money, etc, special units such as Delta Force were sent in as well under the pretext of training law enforcement agencies and to act as support aid to the Columbian government. Rumours of Delta Force involvement in raids were never verified.  Columbia's government do not have enough support from its own people. People are only concerned about their own well-being. When illegal bombings and assasinations started taking its toll on the civilian population, they were quick to show their displeasure. This is a huge question mark for me with regards to Singapore. I'd like to believe that our own people will be able to hold out and not give in to such pressure, but knowing how selfish human beings can get...  During the period of the hunt, rival drug cartels (enemies of Pablo) would make deals with the local government. Even the US quietly turned a blind eye, knowing that intelligence they provided would sometimes be used by some of these people to carry out attacks on Pablo and his associates. They adopted a 'as-long-as-I-didn't-see-it-even-though-I-know-about-it' attitude. I can understand that how sometimes it may be necessary to make deals with evil to destroy an even greater evil. But as history would prove it, what happens is that in the process of making deals with criminals, they create an even more horrible monster in the process. Sometimes the phrase "the ends Justify the Means" isn't necessarily Right, but it sure was effective. In this case, it was a shortcut for the US and Columbians to bring down Pablo Escobar. This however, corrupted the cause. Originally intended to be minimise the amount of drugs smugggled into the US, it soon became a simple hunt for just one man (with only indirect links to the drug issue).  Sometimes guidelines and laws aren't just words in the Constitution of a country. They provide a basic moral code for which the government (and its people) should operate. It's also important to maintain integrity and keep focused on the main issue at hand.   Conclusion?  I once felt very strongly that the ends justify the means. To maintain a level of integrity in handling matters may seem foolish, slow and impractical but that compared to selling/losing your own soul is a small price to pay.

      Past few days been running in the night on alternate days. Mon was the start of my night runs. Been performing relatively good though. Tend to make them 3km runs each time. Worst stretch was the part along Scotts Rd as the crowd starts squeezing along the streets at Lido's side. As I hit Stevens Rd, the pavement I run along gets very close to the road itself to make it pretty unheathy to be breathing all the exhaust fumes from passing traffic. Effectively speaking I now have only 8 wks left to the event. Not very confident I can train myself up on time to finish the marathon, but I'll still try. Even then, I have Aikido grading the afternoon before. I'll be cutting things a bit close. If I really don't feel up to it, I may just sit out for AHM 2004. But I will definitely be training and aiming to attend.

      Training tonight felt really good. I was trying to maintain a mindset for my next few trainings, to conventrate, commit and brush up on my atemi. I'm hoping that making a decent atemi will help me to fall in a more natural way during ukemi.  My first partner was Reno so I didn't know if I did proper atemi or not, afterall he'd just move me if I was standing still. Next was another lady I sometimes paired with. It was OK but I didn't feel comfortable going all out in this case. All I did was try to follow through in slowmo. Then it was with Sunny and Reno. Naturally I couldn't do a thing to Sunny. But I did try to concentrate on committing more, like actually grabbing. Whatever the case, Sunny threw me a couple of times. Didn't manage any fantastic ukemi but did manage to prevent myself from going down too hard and I think Sunny held back a lot for me.  Finally was with Edmund. One thing about Edmund's atemi though, it's rarely 100%. You'd get 100% from him when he does it fast, but then you'd have to know how to make use of the incoming energy at that speed (which I don't). And because of his weight, I also have a hard time trying to apply techniques on him. Dunnoz ...  My iriminage feels crap today. Considering it was with Sunny, I can understand why I don't seem to be able to do a thing. Haiz ...

      Yes, that's how I think. There must be some sort of conspiracy going on. If you read a few posts earlier, you'd know that I had missed training at Bt Batok last Mon coz I was stupid to have taken the wrong MRT line. Not once byt twice.  Well, yesterday I finished classes at 5.30pm, left school immediately and boaded bus 135 to Paya Lebar MRT. No way was I gonna be on the wrong line now because this time I only needed to change 1 stop before I alighted (@  Jurong East MRT Interchange). From the East to the West there were already a lot of people at the time as it was after school and work. I had to stand together with a crowd all the way until I alighted. Was so tired and sleepy. I forced myself to read my book instead of standing and falling asleep. Well, I got to Bt Batok MRT to change TIBS 177 to go down to the CC. Waited there for a good 10 mins before some young sec sch kid politely told me "Mr, I think you missed the last bus for 177 already. The service has ended at this time." I felt blur man. It was only 7pm and the last bus had left? Geez... I wanted to kill myself then. Felt so hungry by then. Bt Batok Central was a shopping mall and I could find lotsa food there, but I seriously was in NO mood to be hanging around there any longer. Thought I may still make it if I could find one of those bus which went in the direction of BB East CC. Went out to the main road and accidentally took a service which took me to Boon Lay. At this time I was in a pissed mood already. Decided to go Holland V for dinner and cool off. I took the MRT from Boon Lay to Buona Vista and walked towards Holland V. When I passed by the bus stop nearby, my usual bus home (105) arrived. I decided, "Oh heck with dinner!" and hopped right on to go home.  Got home, still in a pissy mood. When I entered the house, first thing my Dad asked was "Had dinner?" Was in no mood to be nice so all I said was "Already told you this morning I'm not eating at home right?" He could tell something was wrong and left me alone. I went straight up, changed into my running gear and went for a night run. Didn't feel like bringing the house keys with me this time. (The previous time I didn't bring my keys, the front gate actually konked out. When I got home I pressed the button and waited to no avail. Had to scale the damn door like we usually did back in NS for the 'Suicide Window' of the obstacle course. I was hoping that the electronic gate might've konked out again so I could use some spare energy to hop over the gate again. Yea, sounds stupid, but I that's how I felt.) Went for a 3km run, which felt good. I think I made good progress this time. But it was horrible running along Stevens with traffic on the road, all other roads I ran along were a slight distance away so it didn't feel that bad. I got back in good time (and mood) and took a 1.25 litre bottle of water from the fridge. Sat along the steps outside my house to try and cool down and enjoy the breeze in what was an unusually nice and breezy evening in Singapore. I might've been sitting there whistling tunes for a good 30mins or so before I went to grab a cold shower. Shower never felt that shiok before either. I'd just stand there letting the cold water trickle from the top of my head down to my toes.  Sometimes no matter how bad a day may seem, there's always a silver lining to be found. Even if it means that you had to spin the thread out yourself from cotton plants, but it's there... somewhere out there lah...

      Yes yes, another movie I just caught. Seems like I'm catching movies pretty often on Suns. Not that I mind it one bit.  Not too fantastic despite some well choreographed fight scenes. But everything seems to be  going the 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' way now. It's nice, but not fantastic. I think it'll only impress non asians instead as they are still getting used to these type of martial art flicks. It's plot is simple enough. Revolves around a time when rebels were against the local govt. Basic story line is, A & B tried to trick C. B goes undercover, B and C falls in love. Turns out C is a spy, and it was a trick in the first place. A &amp; B are captured. Story twists somemore, turns out A is a double agent. A & C used to be sweethearts. When A finds out B &amp; C are in love, A tries to kill both. C gets mortally wounded. A & B fights a duel and both are injured. C intervenes despite injury. C threatens to kill A if B dies. A pretends to try to kill B (hoping to die in C's hands), C pretends to attack A but unable to harden herself to do so and dies as a result of her wounds. A and B devastated and show ends.  I tell you is a 'chim' show. Zhang Yimou kinda overdid it lah. Heard Hero was something like that. This should be a theatre work instead of a movie. 2 things I found comical and kinda stupid, A walking around with a knife in the back (literally!!). C gets a flying dagger in the chest, coughs lots of blood, collapses, starts snowing, and she still has the strength to climb up again. Dunno what it takes for her to die lor. Maybe a nuclear warhead will do the trick.  Anyway, I'm guessing that there will be quite a no. of pple who wants to or will watch this because of 3 reasons; Andy Lau, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Zhang Ziyi... people, please don't waste your money. If you really have to watch it, do so when it costs $6.50.
