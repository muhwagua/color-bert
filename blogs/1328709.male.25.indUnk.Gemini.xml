      Well today I finished my big ass paper, I hope it turned out good, I didn't really edit it before I handed it in.  It was sort of haphazard...  I've been listening to Celine's new album all day, and decided that I do like it, and I especially love "Reveal" and "Naked" she does stuff to her voice that I haven't heard before and with such each and control, blew my mind!  The title track is awesome, and I like "I drove all night"!  The Britney Spears songs bugs me though, why synthesize her voice?!?  And the word "Ironical" disturbs me severely, mostly because "Ironic" would have sufficed.  Oh well...    I want so badly to get out of this house, but I don't know if I'll have the money for that, and the bloody rip of telephone company charges insane amounts of money for someone who's only ever home between midnight and  8am...  They suck!  Well I don't have anything I feel like typing today here...  so cya later :)  HUGS DAN:)

      It seems that whenever I want to write here something happens and I need to rewrite everything again!  PMO!  Well the super crunch for finals is almost on me, I've been non studious the last few days, feeling a mental breakdown, yesterday I read an entire text book, but I'm not entirely sure how much of that I retained, I have to make notes today YAY, so that's what I'm doing today...  This morning I woke up estatic because Celine's new album is out this morning.  It is good, but there's not much Celine in it, but it is a welcomed change, but I only wish she would do stuff like her last album (A new day has come) it was from the heart, natural feeling, and my most favourite thing is that it felt like she had reached some greater state of enlightenment and spirituality that made me fall in love with her all over again and it made me feel at peace with myself, especially in "I'm Alive" (even though the video was a horrible sell out to the American film industry lacking complete imagination or thought - she was locked up inside a machine claiming to be alive - the remix was good)  "A new day has come" was incredible as well as "Right infront of you", and the slow version of "A new day", "Have you ever been in love" and Etta James' "At last" and the amazing "I surrender" and then there was "Ten days" that the background vocals were comical.  Oh and I can't forget about "Prayer" that was amazing, especially the line "If you can trust just one more time".    This album is very Britney Spear-esque, which is never a good thing, but it's not entirely meaningless like Britney's lack-of-talent vocals drone out.  It still sounds like songs Celine would sing, is singing,  It's sort of Celine chante Avril Lavigne et Britney Spears, but so much more feeling and talent.  It does have 3 previously released songs on it though :(  One is a remix of last year's album.   The is some punk/rock, pop, even R&B and humour that only avid Celine fans can catch.  I love it anyways, because I feel it is a welcomed attempt at sounding different and proving that she is not just an adult contemporary chanteuse.  I love "Coulda Woulda Shoulda" it is catchy and quick, but also one of the songs released on the Team Celine's version of "A New Day has Come".   "One heart" is lively and flowing, I don't understand exactly what's going on in "Love is all we need" I talks about some girl who lives in a house that appears to be happy but is not and she wears lots of make up  and sunglasses to cover up something that happened with the stairs at Macy's department store, so I'm thinking abuse of some sort, but then the chorus says "I don't understand the concept of the power of one is stronger"  WTH?!?  It's a good comment of society only caring about themselves though!  I'll talk about it more later :P  I'm making this one a long one, and one day I may very well figure out what going on with my FTP server and be able to actually post this for someone to read...  Anyways...  pray for peace and the fall of rome (USA) HUGS DAN :)

      This is my first entry into my online journal :)  Yay! It's Saturday night, I'm at home feeling pretty depressed, I feel all alone, but contemplative...  I keep thinking about what my ex told me that I am a bad boyfriend, and that my other exes got the best years out of me... I hope not, but it's pretty depressing thinking that I'm going to be undatable for the rest of time.  Which might be okay for a while... I want to finish my school and I suppose having the least amount of distraction would be the best thing... for the next 6 years...  I don't know.  I hate not having someone here with me at night, and not having someone I feel close enough to tell them how I feel.   I've never felt so completely misunderstood like I am now... I need to find that someone who'll stick by me even when I don't want it, because I get real stupid sometimes...  Whatever... I'll survive I suppose, my academic life seems to be going amazing and so many opertunities for me.  I feel like I'm growing away from my friends, those who I cherish the most.  I hope it's just in my head. Anyways, let's hope that this works... Haven't tested it so it may not.  HUGS DAN:)

      Well today's been fun, I worked my two jobs and had car problems, my mom came to the rescue...  Nazibucks was good, not so stressful tonight.  But I have to be there again in less than 10 hours LOL...   After work Ryan and I went for Veggie Burittos and then to A&P, it was fun, he's so sweet :D  HUGS to him!    I called Colin when I got home and he and Tom were baking a cake and making JELLO, what a strange time of night, but, well Tom is the strange sort anyways.  I've decided that I'm far too much of an intense person and want, perhaps, too much, especially too early in relationships...  I will have to work on this.  At the same time I still wonder if I'm making a good decision... who knows, but hopefully : )  It'll be exciting to know how it ends up, and I have my fingers crossed to be good.  Well, I must go to sleep now, it's late-ish and Miranda and Chad and I are going to the gym in the AM :)    HUGS and LOVE DAN :)

      Well today's been a fantastic day, it's day three of becoming a positive soul again.  I seem to have lost myself somehow in negative thoughts in the past year and it was eating away at me on inner levels.    I went for coffee with Colin yesterday and we are officially going out, that makes me so happy :)  I don't exactly know how to hold back how much I like him, but I shall have to if I don't want to bugger things up.  He clearly does not like me in the same manner and I know from past experiences that that is never a good thing and perhaps all that I can do is hope that he'll like me more than he does now.  Gee that sounds sad, but it shouldn't have.  I am going to try my best to not let my insecurities get the better of me this time, even though they are so easily actualised in my head...  The fact that he lives with Tom who enjoys bad mouthing me and I'm sure Jehny D will be putting her two whole cents in as well and it would completely devestate me to learn that Colin participated in this conversation.  But I must have confidence that he does not.  I really really like him, I hope we work out.    Tom and I have officially reconciled today and I'm going to make a conscious effort to be less bicker-esque with him and as he try with me.  I wrote him a huge letter and did arts and crafts as well as including some useful chemistry aids for him as a token of friendship and my interest to continue our friendship.  I feel strange with him still though, betrayed still is an emotion that I can only pinpoint with his friendship with Jehny D.  The fact that he probably tells her that I say things like "She's Lazy" and "She's selfish" to him as a mode of venting sometimes and that conbined that he's never had anything positive to say about her in our conversations, especially the ones where he vents about her to me, but of course he wouldn't tell her those bits...  Hmmm....  I'm tired of dealing with this topic.   All that matters is that Tom and I are friends and that I hope he approves of Colin and I dating.  I spent the evening with Chad and Miranda last night because Miranda's grandfather passed away Saturday night and also I haven't seem them nearly as much as I would like to.  They are my family : )  We ate much food (A tub of ice cream for each of us, pizza, doritoes and All dressed chips, our Strawberry White Zimfindal wine, well just Miranda and I, Chad was having Vodka and OJ)   I ate over 2000 calories in one sitting LOL.  Meh, It was fun!  We watched Fifth Element and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (it's something different in America because they are Special :) ).  Well That's it that's all tonight  HUGS LOVE DAN :)

      It's raining today:(  The perfect reflection of my soul.  Sad, confused, lonely, all of the above.  I'm listening for my Celine but she's making me more sad.  I went out with some friends last night, it kinda felt good, especially Jamie, she really makes me feel good inside and about myself.  And Heather, she's always there to listen and I love her.  We went an watched "Bullet Proof Monk" which was okay, some horrible humour, no hidden plots, no twists, pretty straight foreward and boring in that aspect...  However that guy that was in it was definite eye candy.  Then we went to Seattle for coffee and Jamie's new b/f and her old one were together and it was very stressful on her, and I really felt horrible for Ryan (her ex) because I know how much he must be hurting inside watching her with the new guy.  It was terribly awkward and tense.  Bryce and I had nachoes, that was exciting, they taste so good, but what you don't know is that every bite is like 200 calories.    I came home to hear that Colin had left a message on my machine.  I don't know what to do with him.  I like him very much and I hate being in this situation, I want to love him and make him feel loved and whole, but it's never reciprocated, too funny...  I should talk to him today, but I haven't a clue what to say with out sounding narotic.  Why should I have deeper feelings for him, sure we cuddled and kissed, but in the gay community you can be sleeping together and it still doesn't mean anything.  I so completely hate feeling like an enigma in life.  I wish I was straight because I can get along with any girl, with the exception of Lisa Fuck-a-lot/luck, and we could fall madly in love with each other and live happily ever after... oh the things I think of...  Well today is yet to unfold and I so sincerely hope it goes well, I made coffee plans with Jamie today, because she's uplifting and wonderful and will take my mind away from things I don't want to think about.  Well till next time! HUGS  DAN :)

      God I'm bored!  I'm sitting in my room, tired of sleeping because of my crappy laryngitis.  Magnificant Maria found someone to cover my shift this afternoon-evening so that I can recoup, but sleeping is just so completely boring that I keep getting up.  I think that I want to go to the gym, Chad and Miranda are gonna go with me this afternoon, but before then I'm thinking I want to swing by Nazibucks for some coffee and just to get out of my house... I detest being sick...  One benefit from being ill, apart from not annoying myself with my own voice LOL, because I do sometimes, I've also been thinking all morning and reappraising situations, trying to decide upon things, and worrying about how I'm going to pay for school next year if my dad's company doesn't hire me on...  I mean I do have Nazibucks, but that's not going to pay for school at all, plus my laptop from the Power Center!  Whatever will I do.  I got to talk to Miranda for a bit last night after I finished writing my last entry and she sort of made me feel better.  I don't know when or why I've become so negative, well I can figure out why, but it's sort of an oxymoron because I'm genuinely happy with most aspects of my life, but the other things, like tolerating selfish ole Tom and Jehny D and simply not letting Tom's quims get the better of me, but for some reason I feel entirely compelled to be confrontational, which is entirely not me at all.  I noticed it yesterday when Colin and I went to Nazibucks for coffee and how happy and cheerful I am when I'm not around Tom, and I hope Colin saw that in me too... and there's the issue, I really like Colin, but it seems all so taboo for us to have a relationship and I've been thinking about it all morning, before I fall anymore for him I should stay away and let my feelings settle.  Things always work themselves out in the end, that's a reality, so perhaps something will realize itself and I suppose I can deal with another heart break if the outcome is to be as such, but I would readily accept a welcoming heart to hold mine and perhaps I will be completed.    Well, I'm going to have a bath now and focus on being more mellow and happy and not let sarcasm and siniscism cloud my eyes.  HUGS and LOVE DAN :)

      Well, It's been a while since I've last entered anything here, so I thought that I would... as teeth pulling as it is.    The major events that have happened in my terribly exciting life as of late are as follows:  School:  It's finished for the year, well at least the primary part, my exams went well I think.  I didn't get much sleep through them, but I completed them and I hope they went better than I felt I did.  I still have to work on my thesis this summer and two additional classes I've picked up for the summer.  Work:  Well, I am currently convinced that I am working for a Nazi Capitalist Corporation Monopolists (AKA Starbucks)  I am very regretful for taking the position of Senior Barista, or Manager on duty, because they want us to be a super human well oiled profit machine that pays it's employees $7.10 ($7.35 after probation) and myself with a billion more duties at $7.90 woo hoo!  Whatever!  We had intensive training for the last two days on how to be part of the Nazi Capitalists and it is sickening, like they need to make more money!  They just bought out Seattle's Best and now I have no refuge from work.  I really don't know what to do, and my Laptop I bought for school that was only supposed to be $30/month is now $103/month because that's even close to $30/month  I love being lied to and deceived.  Love life: ?!?  Am I even allowed to have one?  Every time I'm interested in someone, they are not interested in me... I love it.  My lovely long list of names that I should get used to it by now...  Ryan Hazel, Ryan Cormier, Derek Buttars and now Colin Knight... each of them knew how I felt (strongly) and they all snuffed me.  Yay for me I'm such a great repelent.  He's aparently not ready to commit... which translates into "I'm not interested in you" in laymen's terms.  I'm sure Tom and his pesimistic views and his controling ways has something to do about it, since we are a bit in the off.    All of my life all I ever remember is Tom telling me that he was better than me, because I'm colour blind and grew up in a less fortunate household.  His tastes were always better, his foods, his choice in music, his touchtone, his clothes, his house, his parents, his bedroom, his yard, his dog, he's been to Europe and has European relatives, his parents own 8 houses and a cottage and just absolutely everything was so much better than me and my poor family... and he still does it, however, I now have the upper hand on him because I'm the educated one who's making himself better for going to school, and reading books and learning about other beliefs, cultures, ways of thinking, musics etc.  But he is still better.  Just last month I went crying to Miranda because of something Tom had said to me to be spiteful at no provocation and it really did depress me and I was upset for weeks.  Then the thing he and Jehn did at Chapter's and their shear uncaring nature.  I'm fed up with it, because it's happened in the past, and would continue to happen if I let it.  I don't need to feel like shit at Tom's whim, not anymore and I most certainly do NOT need to second guess myself because of him.  So since the arrival of Colin I've reconciled in not so many words with Tom, and he continued "my way and my life is better" and my most personal urk that he limits himself and doesn't want to expand himself and become more than he is and won't do anything new that he's not familiar with.  It's one of my most serious annoyances with people, I saw it in Ryan Cormier initially and it has been so profoundly acknowledged as a sad thing since.  I've explained this all to Colin but from our small conversation today, or my observation that Tom hates me, he still chooses to stand with Tom and the most hurtful thing he said "And Jehny D" for some reason, even though I've known him longer and have been just less than intimate with him.  How the hell should I take that?  Back off completely?  Perhaps...  It makes me sad because the natural drawn feeling is rare with me and I feel it with Colin...  I wanted to talk with him tonight, but didn't and I have to fucking work at nazibucks tomorrow!    I wish someone would have all the answers I need and I wish that I could ask clear questions unhindered by fear and rejection.  Every time I am rejected I become further jaded and it makes it much more harder for me to connect with someone.   I suppose that I shouldn't have set myself up with a potential bad situation in the first place, but I was definately drawn to him and I really didn't have anything else to lose, because for some reason I think that my heart loves to be sad and I actually enjoy crying myself to sleep.  Thank god for good ole Lara Fabian, she gives me strength to be alone through the power of her sad sad words and Celine Dion because she lives in her make-believe "everyone will be loved" world...   "You don't know me, I won't let you see me, I will hide, I will lie as true as can be, you just don't have what it would take to be a part of me"  -Part of Me  "Passion and truth we were about before these shadows stole the beat of our hearts"  - Giving up on you "After all we have been through, I can only look at you, through these eyes that you lied to, I'm giving up on you"  - Giving up on you "Undo this leach that you said I tied, when only our fears are to blame this time" - Giving up on you "What am I to you, just spit it out, I'm not afraid of the words that you hide" - Giving up on you  "Was I too proud or just too blind, what does it matter, when love was in these hands of mine, I let it shatter, the pieces scatter to the wind, I'll never have them here again, but I will remember how we were for the rest of time" - You are my heart  "Think twice before you try to read me, before you try to lead me into your trap" - I am who I am "You've got no right to play with my emotions, because you should know that I'm much deeper than that" - I am who I am  "I see the rain, in the sky, I see your face, through every tear that I cry" - To Love Again   So many more :(  Well Cheers! HUGS Love Dan :(

      Well yesterday started out kindy shitty with my Food Microbiology exam, I think I did well, but it's not certain, because it was all "in your opinion" would this product be safe...  I had stayed up all night long studying with Tony, we have a hard time to study together, because we always goof off, but we studied steadily from midnight to 8, and we covered everything.  I went home to sleep, needless to say.  Then later when I woke up I had the most amazing surprise, Miranda came over and brought me a gift she made for me :)  It is a glass vase/cylinder that she etched the japanese symbols for "friendship" on the front, and on the bottom of the back she etched the word "Friendship Love Miranda"  It totally made my day, and it made me feel even more special because of all the work they did, I didn't know that she actually etched the glass herself and finding what to put on it, and cutting the letters out in shelf-adhesive as a template for the etching, and then Chad (her boyfriend) helped her and made sure she wasn't making mistakes and they spent so long on making it for me and I was completely speechless, there was more much thought put into it.  So now inside the glass was blue and clear flattened glass beads on the bottom and then water with 6 bamboo shoots that symbolizes "happiness".  It's the most amazing thing anyone has every done for me!  I feel bad because I couldn't express my appreciation in words, but I will most certainly reciprocate it with actions.  I've been having issues with sorting through friends because my school friends are the most amazing people I've ever met, I'm happy to call them my collegues, but over joyous to call them my friends and I love them all so very much!  And then there's Tom and Jehn, who I feel more of a friend of convience to, they only want to do stuff when it's what they want to do...  And they are so selfish and would never think about doing something to make someone else happy... I'm not even sure they understand the concept of selflessness...  I will go out of my way for my friends, and they will hear nothing of the sort, and if by chance they find themselves commiting an act of selflessness they expect to be paid or highly praised and worshipped... I don't understand.  Anyways, to today, Miranda, Chad and I went to the gym and we all did perhaps the most wickedest chest work out ever!  And cardio and abs and we all feel energized and amazed, well maybe not Chad so much, he said he was gonig back to bed because Miranda woke him up at 6:30 this morning.  We're all going to study at my hangout... Seatle on Cumberland lol...  I'm always there, but it's so close to my house, I love it!!!!  Anyways, I simply must go and shower HUGS DAN :)

      Yikes, 1 day before my scarey exams start :(  *TEARS *  I have being tested on things that I know...  Oh well...  I'm supposed to study with Tony today, as long as we don't spend the whole time talking that'll be fine, I have to write my exam 4 hours before he does!  So that means an all nighter again tonight I guess... who knows.  I can't function like that, but he can lol...    I sat with Mun yesterday, she's so fun, there are certain people that I wish we could all be friends, ie.  Tiffany, Lisa, Dave, Mun, and Teagan because they make me feel all smart and professional, because they're all in their Masters, with the exception of Mun, who's doing her PhD.  I never thought that I'd feel so good to be with people who are academics :)  I so want to keep going on with my school career, I would really love to do a PhD as well...  Damn undergrad and smooshed together examination dates, I just get so overwhelmed when it comes to having to study. I hate it!  *TEARS*  I brought Ryan the computer monitor yesterday so that he and Arne can use it...  I hope they enjoy it.  I still feel stupid over that whole thing, but I'll get over it, I always do...    Marc sent me a card in the mail yesterday telling me how much he loves me, I don't know what to say, I have so many reservations with him, it seems that it could either go the way I don't want it to go or maybe the way I want it to go.  He's all caught up in the social aspects of being gay and hanging with his friends and going to the bar and drinking and stuff, and I don't need that at all, I don't want that.  I know I go out sometimes to go dancing with my "Possy" Miche, Luc, Shawn and sometimes others if they are there... I don't know, I never go there to drink or to "pick-up" or any of that shit, and it actually makes me quite sick...  I guess I'm just scared that he'll be another Ryan C.    Anyways, I simply must go now and jump in the bathtub, I trained with Terri at 8 this morning, then I did an hour of cardio and now I'm all sweaty...  Yuck!  Will write more later! HUGS DAN :)

      Well today went well work wise...  on a personal scale I feel that I'm being used again...  oh well that's what I'm good for right?  If I can't be happy why not make others so.  So the guy is still with his ex, my ex, so that blows that out of the water LOL...  Sometimes I crack myself up on how easily caught up I get and excited I get over the prospect of someone decent liking me.  I'm still sad about last night, being the ugly little ducking in a room with beautiful people...  I've never felt so removed from people, like I've been isolated and no one can get to me, and it's getting worse.  I don't cry much about it anymore because I'm getting used to it LOL...  I really hate how ugly I feel and how fat I feel, I will never be a tooth pick and it seems I'll never be buff, but I try so very hard to change these things but my body even hates me and won't comply...  there's not one friend who knows how much I'm hurting inside and how devastated I am inside.  And every relationship I manage to procure I always home in on the one "evil" thing that reminds me too much of the things that have hurt me inside.  When I dated Arne it was smoking and pot and the general sense of insecurity, which I reciprocated, stupidly as stupid as I could have been, by remaining friend with my ex, which in turn hurt him and cause him to hate me too...  Lovely cycle.  Ryan C. was the epidemy of my father in a younger far far more hairy body...  I dated him for only 2 3/4 months and that was enough to change me completely and take me into a world that I didnt' even know anything about.  I just thought that he drank too much and thought nothing of his extremely strange and unrational behavoir or his seedy friends.  I knew he had experimented with drugs, but he told me no longer, instead I find out that he was a frequent user and seller of E, and did cocaine still (and slept with his cocaine dealer while going out with me).  I wish I could take that whole part of my memory out so that I could be naive and happy again...  My scholastic/professional life just keeps getting better, but the better it gets the worse my personal life gets.  I think I'm just made to be as successful as I can be while living humbly in my one roomed apartment with my cat for the rest of my life. Hard to swallow right now, but hopefully it won't taste as nasty when it happens.  I shouldn't take so much offense, it's not really my fault that I am the way that I am.  Having alcoholic parents and grandparents, an extremely abusive alcoholic and drug abusing father, a misogynistic adultering grandfather and having to be all grown up since I can even remember kinda does that to you.  Fond memories of running from the house with my mother away from my father because he was pooring gasoline all over the house going to set it on fire and kill us all because he was messed in the head from all of his cocaine, heroine, hash and pot he did on his days off.  I remember feeling very strange at nights when dad would have his friends over in the kitchen to play D&D while smoking some strange cigarette or out of some contraption.  Other fun memories include when he'd sit on the couch with a broken rum or beer (depending on what it was on this occasion) crying and telling us to watch him slit his wrists and make us beg him not to.  Or loading his riffle and pointing it at his head and the multiple times he packed his bags threatening to leave us and move out to BC with his brother.  Lafter on, and still to this day, I just wish he would.  So I wouldn't have to run to save my mother from him when he, to this day, decides that he's a man and is going to beat his wife.  I think that's why my mom and I are so close, because she wasn't allowed to have friends and she's always told me what's going on because she needed a release.  On one hand I'm thankful that I got to share in that, but in the other hand, I wasn't allowed to be a kid EVER because I was told things that I didn't even understand at the time.  Anyways, I don't know what I'm going on about, but it's great to vent, even if it's just to this online journal that I don't even know how to link it to my page because I can't find an FTP that will work.  Well I'm tired and I still want to go for a jog... hopefully to get rid of some of my fat :P   HUGS and LOVE DAN:)

      Good Morning, for me, yay, it's my 3rd official day as Senior Barista for Starbucks and I've gone and taken a very early shift because poor Sarah is terribly ill with multiple viral infections and I didn't want our poor overworked manager coming in on her day off.  On the other side, I stayed up entirely too late last night, because Ryan, Heather and I were having a study group, but we wound up talking...  not a good thing, I usually don't like to have study groups.  I'm so torn inside, I dunno :(  There's a guy I work with that I've been completely attracted to since I first saw him, way before I started working there, BUT, two things, he's my ex's ex (which I'm fine with) and I don't know how he feels about me...  I feel so inane over such trivial things, I'm off to solve biological problems and mysteries around the world but I can't figure out what to do about someone I like...   But he's everything that I've ever wanted, black hair, deep wondering eyes that I easily fall into and a care free but tender soul that seeks to be understood and cherished...  Just everything about him... but last night we went out with some of Heather's friends we met up with and there's this other guy who, I think, was completely attracted to eachother and i dunno, it made me feel like shit and wanted to cry the whole time...  OMG, I've gotta go, it's quarter after and I need to find a car and be there soon.  TTYL HUGS DAN: )

      Well it's official, I'm so completely fucked up that I'll never have someone EVER!  I seem to be doing a royal job a messing things up with Colin before they even start, but I am forced to analyze the situation...  Today is supposed to be just Colin and Dan day, but It's Colin and Tom day again, which I guess is fine because that's his friend and I suppose in the land of normal people that means that friends come before your significant other... I don't even know what's going on inside my head, all I know is that I think I'm seriously falling inlove, if not already, with Colin and he's not even in the same chapter and all that I'm doing is making him not want to read the book anymore.    I'm so used to being hurt by the person I like that I automatically take issue with the slightest uncertainties.  I will, I suppose, never hold a candle to Tom in Colin's eyes, but I'll have to learn to deal with that if I sincerely want to be with Colin, and I do, but AHAHAHAHAH  I fucking hate feeling this way, that's why I went so long without dating, because I get ridicously stupid and ruin it right off the bat so why should I even bother?!?  I have so much scarring that I didn't even know stuck with me from my past experiences and I'm going to need someone who'll love me unconditionally and who can deal with me and my insecurities and my temper tantrums.  I didn't want to go to Tom's birthday party last night because I felt that Colin would be ignoring me and hanging out with the people who've caused me great harm.  Tom and Jehny D...  I keep having flash back incidences, like when I'd have to schedule my time with Matty Hamilton (my ex) between he and Jehny D time, which was almost never.  And Arne who would rather have a sleep over party at Erin's house than spend the only day that week that we could see each other with me.   I'm sick of feeling not worth it, because I think I am!  I'm just so completely different from other people that I tend to be misunderstood...  and I'm starting to feel as if I'll never be understood :(  I hate it, I'm dying inside.  I want someone to love me for me and not without outside things interfereing with my relationship.  Which always happens.  That's why I hate being associated with gay culture, because they always interfere and are apparently sickened when someone's happy.    Even when I'm with my closest friends (Miranda, Sarah, Kerri) I feel different and completely not understood.  I really want Colin to understand me, but he's so caught up in everything else he doesn't have time to understand me, or to even see me.  I'm just another friend, really, who he can cuddle with, perhaps... I'm not sure, and I'm not sure of this intentions, but I refuse to hurt him, but he doesn't know how much I hurt inside.  I told him that I'm a highly emotional person but is he able to deal with that?  Can he tolerate me?  He's welcomed to rebut that's what makes relationships stronger and helps to open me up, but I don't want him to give up on me.  I have so much love and affection to give him if he'll take.  Well, looks like I'm sitting and waiting for the phone to ring again on the day that was supposed to be just he and I...  Oh well... It's not a patience thing, too many times I spent the whole night waiting for a phone call, all dressed up but with no where to go.    Sadness :(  Well  HUGS DAN : (

      Well last night I had a magical time with Colin, we were supposed to meet after he got off work, so I got all ready, and because my car is broken I had to walk down to his work to "pick him up from work" lol  But somehow we missed eachother.  I wound up telling him that I felt like the third wheel in he and Tom's relationship and the idea wasn't so popular with me.  But we talked and he assured me that he likes me and that I was just being silly...  I'm just so used to being hurt and people doing things purposely to hurt me that I expect no less than him, but he calmed those fears completely last night... but knowing me my insecurities will flare up again SADNESS :(  I really wish I wasn't insecure and I would love to just go along with things, not be afraid to take his hand or snuggle up to him without him making the first move :(  In my life right now this is the only area where I am weak and that sucks royally because I'm so sure of myself in all other areas but this one.  Anyways, I'm looking forward to seeing him again and I am very happy that we are taking things slow and for the first time last night, when I looked into his eyes I felt his emotion and saw inside of him and I what I saw was someone who definitely liked me :D  In other news LOL, Sarah Dean and I have plans for tomorrow, I'm so pumped about it because she's so fun to hang out with and was my only friend for a while.    Well, I must get going, I'm trying to avoid all of these pop-up windows that keep interrupting my typing GRRRR!  HUGS Love DAN :)

      Okay, so my boyfriend is the best guy ever!  We talked about past relationships last night, even though it was the first night since we started seeing eachother the we didn't share together.  The trama of dating the EVIL one is known now... and accepted.   This makes me happy :)  He always says things that make me feel important to him and special and it's much appreciated :)    We're going away this weekend to Grundy National Park outside of Sudbury.  It'll be fun, I've already called ahead and told them that we're coming and everyone is excited!!!  It'll be nice to see the whole crew again.    On another note!!!  Leave Martha alone!!!  She's not even in the slightest bit evil as George Bush or any of his scandulous Enron thing, go after George Bush for his plundering, pointless murdering, his 200 new coal burning plants guaranteed to add at least 10 parts per 100 of CO2 in the atmosphere for us.  Not to mention his "election" campaign and the Florida State "voting" booths where they turned away ALL of the black people?  Where are we 1920's?  I thought we went through this already.  ARHHHH  Well I'm at work, so I should really get down to it!   More later!  HUGS DAN:)  ps.  Dan + Colin :)

      Well, lots has happened since my last journal entry LOL... yikes May 4th was my last entry.  Well as an update, I broke up with Collin because I decided that he needed to grow up some more before commiting to any type of relationship... Currently he is, once again, experimenting with Drugs (ie. Coccaine mostly) and is drunky nightly, so phew! for me avoiding that situation again, like I need to re-live the evil one again!  After that Tom and Collin both sort of avoided me for a peroid of a month or so, onlly recently have Tom and I rekindled our friendship AGAIN LOL always on a cycle, Tom's so fun to be around, I don't know why we get bored of eachother...  Apart from being friends for 16 years now...  I was sort of hard on Tom about school and stuff before, I imagine that annoyed him alot!  My birthday came and went again lol, but what an amazing birthday!  On the day of my bday (May 22) I met some awesome guy named Colin (LOL) who was friends with my friend Rachel.  He was waiting at the bus stop and I immediately had a huge crush on him.  So from that day on... for a couple of weeks, I kept asking Rachel if the cute guy was gonna be around LOL...  Miranda took me out for dinner and we had a good night together, she's so good to me *TEARS*  I only hope I can ever treat her the same :(  My friends, especially Miranda and Chad threw me the most wickedest SURPRISE birthday bash EVER!!!  Miranda, Kerri, Sarah, Chad and I were going to go to the Apollo for a drink on Saturday after my bday, but then it wasn't open for the night yet, so I suggested we go down to have Ice Cream from the Marina, after ice cream we walked around the marina and looked at bugs and plants and stuff, geek biologists we are LOL.  We left the park and Chad had to go visit his friend so he took off.  Then the remainder of us went to wander around downtown PA looking for something to do...  I suggested that we go to Gargoyles, but Sarah wasn't hungry and didn't feel like going there.  Kerri suggested that we go to the Casino, but I didn't really feel like going there so we kept walking and Kerri said "Where should we go, Sarah?  You should know your way around here."  (Considering that she's never been down here, I thought about that but just presumed that she did know her way around here).  So Sarah suggested that we go to RON's virtual world and Kerri screamed "Ya!  And we could all pool our tickets and get Dan a wicked prize!"  So we set off to Ron's but I wanted to stop for a latte before we went there.  Kerri and I went and got coffee from Creed and then we took off to Ron's.  When we got in Kerri took me to the wall of prizes to choose something and then when we turned around all of my friends where there, including Chad, and they all yelled "SURPRISE!"  So wicked!  So we played laser tag, ate pizza and cake in the party room and played games until they closed, then we went to Voodoo to dance.  I saw the cute guy, Colin, there and chatted with him to get ot know him abit.  A couple weeks later, Rachel got me to be in a photo shoot for LU Pride and I got to star opposite to the cute guy, Colin, and that was amazing, because I got to know him and we all started going for lunch.  I sincerely didn't think Colin was interested in me, but then he asked me for my email address... we started talking via email and made plans for a Saturday to hang out.  The saturday turned out to be really fun, we had ice cream at the Marina, walked around downtown, went for dinner at the Calabria and talked all night long.  He was so sweet and interesting not to mention cute :)  We hung out Sunday and Monday, monday we watched abfab and we kept moving closer to each other.  We eventually held hands and then he leaned over to kiss me.  It was magical and amazing!  I asked him if he would go out with me and he said yes.  So now we've spent a week together, and I think that it may be over kill, because I don't get the same feelings from him anymore, however, that may very well be my natural defences not letting me get any closer (as per usual) and pushing me away.  I hope that that's the case, because I know better and get ignore those feelings, but I hope I'm not suffrocating him, I really think he's the one that I've been looking for!  He's tender, halarious, very intelligent, he has beautiful eyes that go forever into his soul, and his smile melts me from within, I feel as though I've been renewed and have found my soul mate and partner.  I hope I don't screw this one up.    This relationship has already started differently, I didn't do my heavy duty screening process that scares away people 99% of the time, but alot of that is because he doesn't have the vices that I've become accustomed to and there is no reason to defend myself against him.  I haven't really hold him any horror stories of past relationships, he knows of the EVIL one, but that's all basically that he knows.  I haven't been overly emotional with him, like I usually am, maybe because I sense that he may actually like me...  which worries me because I don't feel like I have qualities that could interest him, my body is not the best body in the world, I'm not the most interesting or exciting person in the world, there's nothing that I can think of that makes him want to be with me, accept perhaps the intial air of mystery that may have been exposed now and I'm afraid he may not be interested anylonger.  But I promised myself not to let myself make this into a big deal because I don't want to ruin it.   I like him very much, but I'm still holding back, because I don't want to be hurt, I'm used to people pulling out just as I begin to fall for them, I'm actually very braced for him to say "I don't think this is going to work out."  It's way too early to know these things, but this is something that my mind needs to do, it has only been a week and I have so much more to learn about him and understand and get my barrings with.   So anyways, to all who find my life so completely enthrawling to actually be reading through please pray that this will be the one!  He's so amazing, I want him to want me!  As Celine says :)  I want to be the face you see when you close your eyes I want to be the touch you need every single night I want to be your fantasy, and be your reality and all that's in between  I want you to need me, like the air you breathe I want you to feel me, in everything I want you to see me, in your every dream the way that I taste you, feel you, need you I want you to need me, Like I need you  I want to be the eyes that look deep into your soul I want to be the world to you, I just want it all I want to be your deepest kiss, the answer to your every wish and all you'll ever need  Cause I need you, more than you could know and I need you, to never ever let me go and I need, to be deep inside you heart I just want to be everywhere you are!  I'm such a sap LOL  HUGS DAN:)

      Well it's monday again, seems like the only day that I write in here.  Things are working as I had wanted to, I have been going to the gym on a regular basis now, but I like going early and Tom and Jehny D. like going later in the day.  I have things to do with my day and can maximize my day by starting them early, especially since I have to work at SB (during the hours I'm not supposed to) in the evenings.  I had a super fun weekend, on friday night was "An intimate evening for two with Mun and Dan and friends" we all went to Kelsey's then for coffee and dessert then to Mun's where Tom, Mun and I stayed up to 2 in the morning, Mun had to catch a plane to Nova Scotia at 5am lol.    Saturday was Shopping with Tom and Dan, where we just bought things we needed and had several lattes.  I had wanted to go camping because I got the whole weekend off, but I couldn't.  Tom and I went to Miranda's mid-summer festival party bash extravaganza at Silver Islet number 4 at 5, there was a brief thunder storm that flooded everything, then clear skies...  We didn't get the BBQ going until 10pm, by then I had drinken some and was ready for bed, and I did go to bed. LOL for a couple hours, then off to home.  Sunday Tom and I went and looked at the house Tom's parents said we could live in, but now they may be reconsidering because they want to sell it instead...  I don't know, I hope we get to live in it.  Well, here's to another week!  Cheers!  Still heartbroken and wallowing in self pity LOL... oh well, that's how it always seems to be.  HUGS and Love DAN:)

      Good Morning, I'm at work at the Office of Communications taking a break...  Today is the first day that I'll be dining alone for lunch in a LONG time, I think that I'll go visit Miranda, hopefully she's back from Nipigon for today.    This morning was almost unbarable as I wake up innocently, excited about the day, and excited about seeing Colin, then having the crushing weight of the matter hit me head on.  I broke out in tears a couple times while comtemplating calling Sarah (Stanton) because I knew she'd be up and is such a good shoulder to cry on.  I'm so surprise how much both Sarah and Ryan (from work) care about me.    Well, I just thought I'd write here, for lack of better things to do sola otra vez...  HUGS and Love always DAN:)

      Good morning.  He dumped me, aparently he wasn't ready for a relationship, I sort of guessed that.  I feel so crushed inside, something that could have been so perfect gone completely awry.  This is the most horrible feeling in the world, and on top of that I feel used and worthless...  I'm really starting to hate all gay men I think, there's never an honest, open, compasionate, intelligent and humble guy.  It's so stupid, I finally reached out again only to be knocked down again, is there no trait in me that's desirable?  Or am I a push over?  I don't know, something that should be so simple is the most complicated thing in my life.  I'm crying inside as well as outside and I don't know how to stop it.    We were perfect for each other, both smart University students who have dreams and ambitions in life beyond working at a call center, drugs and alcohol.  Much more than that though, we were both out going, enjoyed the outside, went camping, hiking, swimming, coffee, dinner, movies, all my friends loved him, went out for icecream because I love ice cream, I gave too much of myself again and scared him away.  He told me something along the lines that he never meant this as a serious relationship... what the hell is that?!?  Why should I bother to learn about someone, their family, aspirations, personality and they learn about me if we're only fuck buddies?  This is stupid!  I don't understand!  I'm not sure wether I will hate him or not because I am still processing his words and the whole situation.  Do I do this to relationships?  Is it my fault?  Seems that way, or perhaps I only attract and I'm only attracted to the ones that will hurt me more inside.  I can't handle more breaking inside, I wasn't designed to feel such pain.  I remember him flirting at first, before we went out, we went for dinner at the Calabria and he was so nervous he put sugar on his pizza inside of salt, it was cute.  And my contact decided that it wanted to see how far towards the back of the eye it could make it before causing blindness in shear pain...  so pretty at first, and devastating in the end.  I can totally see the irony in the entire situation, but I still do not apprechiate it.  We used to go for lunch everyday because we both work at the University, now what?  There's going to be a noticable void in my life at that juncture.  It'll give me more time to work on my thesis I suppose.  Here's another song that I wrote last year, it seems to fit here   MOMENTS   Have you ever had your heart stolen in a moment Just to have it crushed in a blink of an eye To finally find that someone who'll be forever Then learn that forever won't fly  And in the moments of silence and teardrops I hold on with all of my might I swear to God one day that I'll be Happy with love in my life  They say true love comes once in a lifetime But what if that moment has passed Because of foolish goals that stand in the way Of something so good for your soul  And when looking back at that moment When we turned down that path of goodbyes Knowing that maybe we really could have been Forever, for always, for life  And what if there's no other moment When we feel this good and so right And what if we now live our lifetimes Wondering if there is more to our lives  Thre are times at night when I'll remember How our hearts touched one moment, one time After years of heartache I'll surrender as the lonely forever, for life  So how could we have been ever so foolish To let something interfere with our hearts Instead of living life by it's moments, we were Blindly living life for it's ride  They say love conquers all, but in an instant You either have nothing or you'll have it all It's what we won't say, what we're holding back As if we've died inside  So as we keep living life in that moment As I reach out through all of my tears Doomed to a lifetime of sadness And aging through all of these years  I wonder if you can remember Our very first walk in the rain The very first time that I kissed you and the moment you whispered my name  I wonder if you would still hold me Like a ship that was lost in the storm Searching desparately for my guidance to a place that was safe and warm  And as I sit here remembering those moments A rainbow breaks out in the sky The sunlight returns from the darkness The tears run new in my eyes   LOL, I can't even see through my tears now :(  I have to go, take care  LOVE and Sadness inside DAN:(

      I'm so sad inside, I told Colin how I felt last night; about him not being to open about his feelings and he keeps me in the dark but we are supposedly going to talk about it today after I get home from work.  It feels like every day he drops hints that I'm not going to be part of his future, so that makes me think why should I even bother.   I wonder how I'm supposed to take things when he is not affectionate, doesn't want me to sleep over, purposely tells me that his future plans do not include me in any way.  He non-chalantly announced that he wasn't going to be my date any longer to my friend Linnea's wedding, which might be half my fault because I said it'd be okay if he couldn't go, I'd take Tom instead, but I said that as a shock thing not because I wanted to take Tom.  I'd certainly enjoy attending a formal event with my boyfriend, but he clearly didn't want the same...  especially when it was something I was looking so forward to.  I don't know.    Why are relationships so complicated?  Do I put too much effort into them and expect too high of a return?  I feel like I'm investing 100% of myself to this relationship only to get 10% return... but doesn't seem like a good investment, but then you throw emotions into the heap and it suddendly almost becomes something more.  Perhaps I'm just a hopeless romantic who will just keep dreaming of prince charming coming to sweep me away and actually make me feel special and wonderful inside and to be actually worth something, not just something that can be disgarded with the slightest whim and not just something to come home to whenever, to be worn like an old leather jacket, great for warmth and comfort but not neccessary all the time.  Would he care if I was suddenly to vanish?  I'd decided that I am over comtemplative, but why shouldn't I be, I've been hurt in the past in the same manner of events by others that I subconsiously prepare myself for being crushed again.  I feel defeated and unwanted...  I wrote another song yesterday afternoon, it came quickly but romantically summarizes how I feel inside.   TO BE    I, I want to know your soul I want to know you all I want to be the one your breathin'  And I, I wanna look into your eyes and see you burning for me inside a passion to go unrivalled  How, can I make you understand What it takes to be a man When all I see is leaving  When, can I finally realize that what I want, what's you deny I'm only one drop in the ocean  Tell me What, do you want from me? why do you lead me Around on a leash that's too long  And When, will I actually have the strength to stand up all alone and look life head on?  Who, do you think you are To play with me like this Dark, jaded and depressed  Who, will actually put me first who'll want to be with me no gadgets and no glimmer  All, I have to offer you Is one heart that will be true One soul half dead and stripped naked  So now I, I want to look into your eyes I wanna hear you say to me that I am actually worth it  And that you'll, let me in your life Let me share your world tell me all your dreams, your past and your worries  I, will help you share your burdens Will help you live your life If only you could see  Well I'll inform you of outcomes later.  SADNESS INSIDE :( DAN

      Oh, before I go completely for the day, I wanted to share one of the songs I wrote... well two maybe:  The first one is just a part of the song, not the whole song...  It sort of describes what I feel, funny I wrote it in 1999.  Is there a song that plays in your head? Is there a reason why you're smiling instead, of the sun that shines through your eyes? Are you feelings what I feel inside?  You know baby, there are a thousand things to say When I'm with you, all my fears, they fade away I'd hold onto, you for eternity I would never, I would never leave you baby  How do you know when you're in love Is there a sign from the heavens above Do you just feel like your world is full How'm I to know if I'm feeling your love  How'm I to know what you feel inside Am I to read through what you hide Is it in what you don't say How do you know when you're really in love  The next one is a part of the most recent song I wrote:   INTO THE WIND   Do you feel, what I feel inside? Do you know, what I think about you? And would you care, if I whispered your name Into the wind, baby, Into the Wind  Is it now, the moment in life? When it all comes to one point When all that Ive ever worked for Is hanging by a string  How do you know, what lies in store For the one and lonely heart Is there more than life alone To fill my soul, please fill my soul  Is the world so far away that you feel untouched and misunderstood When all attempts at reaching out are burning in the wind, leave crying in the wind  Is there more than living through your friends Can I live to finally have a face and a voice that can ripple through the world till my dying end, my moment in the end  Do you feel, what I feel for you? Do you know, what I think about you? And would you care, if I whispered your name Into the wind, baby, Into the Wind  Are you there to fulfill the prophecy Would you stand, face to face and would you look at me Would you see through all my faults and impurities Could I ever, be anything to you  Do you feel, what I feel for you? Do you know, do you know what I think about you? And would you care, if I whispered your name And shouted into the winded, Mmmm, And i shout into the wind

      Well... I dunno what's going on with Colin and I, I think things are okay but he's so emotionless... He gets excited over some things, so I know he  does  have expression just doesn't show me many... I suppose that is characteristic text-book Gemini.  It's so funny that I'm completely not like that, I'm just a fountain of emotion spilling out everywhere.  During the winter months my body decided that it would add 10 pounds of fat to my body so I'm slightly self concious about that too, so that makes me apprehensive.  I'm just tired of guessing games, why does every relationship have to be a guessing game?  I know that we are still learning about eachother... perhaps he's learned stuff that he doesn't like...  I've learned some warning flag stuff, just leftovers from the Ryan Cormier era and the non-chalant harshness of the Arne era.  Perhaps I have nothing to worry about.  It's just so wierd being in a gay relationship because I want to be with someone... however I don't like gay people because they are cheating, lying, backstabbing, misleading, two-faced and generally unpleasant to be around for any duration.  Harsh?!?  Oh well.  What else is new?  Well we (Me, Colin, Ryan W. from work and Tiina from work) went tubing down the Kam River, but we got lost trying to find it and wound up taking air and landing in the middle of a potato field!  Too funny!  I never thought that that would ever happen to me LOL... in the middle of a potato field!!    I'm sitting in my office at Office of Communications on a Wednesday LOL... I had to drop down to part-time for the rest of the summer because my thesis advisor strongly ADVISED me to...  BUT I made the mistake of letting Hallie know this so she's scheduled me beyond belief.  I needed the mornings off but she simply ignored that important thing.  I need a new job, that's for sure!  Well, I need to sit and think about things, I haven't meditated for a long time once again, mostly because I work daily!  Well, I'll write more later!  HUGS DAN:)

      Well, many days have elapsed once again... So Colin and I went camping at Grundy last weekend, Friday-Tuesday, it was tonnes of fun, it feels good to be alone with someone and get to know them.  He's such a terrific guy, but he's not very expressive... so I'm gonna have to bite my lip and try not to over worry about things... as I tend to do, apparently his last boyfriend was too insecure for him, so I don't want to be a repeat offense.  So we drove 12 hours to Grundy (One hour south of Sudbury) the Trip there was 1100 KMs (11 hours), and the way back as well.  I just like letting people know that Thunder Bay is FAR FAR AWAY from sudbury and that Sudbury isn't really that far away from Toronto period, especially when compared to Thunder Bay being over 1700 KMs away from Toronto, where Sudbury is like 500 KMs.  So yes, we are north!  I went to the blues festival on Friday evening with Colin, it was fun, I really enjoyed it.  I hope I'm not suffrocating Colin, I try not to see him everyday to avoid such circumstances.  I really feel like we could be together forever.  He enjoys my friends, all of them, which is wicked!  He fits in with them, they like him, it's awesome.  On Saturday night Miranda, Chad, Colin and I went bowling and then went to Miranda's to have some drinks, for those of you who know me, I'm totally not a drinker, 3 drinks and I'm sloshed beyond belief!  It turned out to be a fun night, we played a drinking game, which turned out to be fun.  Last night I had to go to a stupid staff meeting that had it's reasons but was, once again, way too long... I got to use my classroom management skills though... the one important thing that was overlooked once again... attention!  You simply cannot hold someone's attention for 3 1/2 hours!!!  Especially when it's repeat of things already talked about... but I feel that it's completely useless to try and explain that to them.  I kept my part precise, succinct and not overwhelming.  The point came across possitively and effectively and most of all quickly.   My over all impression is that it should have had more planning, and a review and discussion over what each of us (Supervisors) should cover.  I don't know, it seems so childish...  I was supposed to have a BBQ last night, but the weather did not permit it so I prosponed it until tonight, but my Glutanous Voracious pig dog man of a grandfather ATE most of my food throughout the night!  There was food for 12 people, he ATE it all!!!!!!!!!!!  So I'm in a severe bad mood today, they don't understand that I don't have the time or the money to re-create everything all over again.  I spent 4 hours yesterday afternoon preparing food and he ATE it all throughout the night!  The gross part is that he's extremely unhygenic, as in 1 bath every 3-4 months, does not brush his teeth, change his underwear until grandma tells him that the stains are coming through now.  He simply easts right out of the contain and puts the fork right back in with saliva and all.  The most frusterating part though is that he was too drunk yesterday for me to tell him not to eat any of it, and grandma wasn't at home to protect it.  So because he's an alcoholic incoherent beast cave man I have to suffer!  I don't think so. So now I'm seriously considering moving in with Miranda and Chad, rent is $300/mo, that bites!  However I need to be away from these people, it's been far too long now and I'm always frusterated in that house.  The sad thing is that I'll be loosing my car then, because it's not my car, but my grandparents...  Oh well, mental health outweighs the convenience of having a vehicle.  I'm going to talk it over with my mom I think.   So I don't know if I should have the BBQ now or not, I don't have any thing left to offer people.   Nor money and time to make everything again.  I spent most of my money on ingredients yesterday.  Well...  Hmmm... if I don't have a car I will have on $60/mo at least on car things.  That's a good thing.  K, well, I'm at work and I gotta get going!  HUGS and Tears DAN:(

      Well, since last time, LOL, many things have happened again...  the saddest of travesties was the unexpected death of Sarah Whelan's brother Lewis, who had been in a severe accident 2 years before leaving him with only one limb.  He didn't have the ability to sweat because of the electricity that went through his body so he had to remain in a cool temperature.  With the power outage in Southern Ontario, he lived in Sault Ste. Marie, he couldn't remain cool enough and his care worker didn't bother checking on him until the day later when he was found dead.  My heart goes out to Sarah's family and especially Sarah who couldn't have been closer with any sibling as she was with Lewis.  You have love and support in Friends always :) XOXO  It's Monday and my very last day here in the Office of Communications at Lakehead University.  They are taking me out for lunch in celebration of a fantastically productive summer and as a going away.  I'm going to miss them, they are an awesome talented bunch with patience and understanding, something this world is in severe shortage of.  I'm working on one final list for them and printing everything off.   Tom and I did the most ludacris and daring thing ever, we are now roommates, YIKES, someone I swore I'd never live with because he's so incredibly selfish, stubborn, ignorant and set in his ways... he ignores more than half of the things you say to him and has told me "Am I supposed to listen to everything you say as though it's important?".  My answer was yes, out of shear respect for a fellow human being, let alone friend of 16 years.  So this is working it's way through, my grandparents are deeply saddened by my moving out.  It was my grandfather's 70th Birthday yesterday and we had celebrations all night long, long after he had passed out because of too much drink.  It was quite the traditional Italian celebration, 20 courses, non stop food, wines, music, dancing, singing, fun times in general.   At 10pm the entrees had only begun to be served.  Tom and I enjoyed ourselves immensely with my cooky family.  Grandma had a cold so she was inside most of the time helping cook.  The final touch was a planet sized Triffle that took more than one average person to carry.  Tom, being a culunary genious, was quite impressed witht he accomplishment including lines like, "I've never seen something so huge!" and "I thought that that was just the top of the cake, I didn't know it was the entire thing!"  Other fun news on the other side of poor lonely Dan is the knew revelation that both Colin and Colin are now seeing each other compliments of me, HOW TACKY!  Make me puke, of all the things, I absolutely hate the lack of tack and pomp the gay community embodies, makes me double over in sick.  I spoke with Colin Lacey on MSN on Friday and I don't hate him as much for being an asshole to me, but more so for being so decadent and blatant.   After he told be that he and "Colly Bear" had gone for a weekend get-away to Winnipeg last weekend my heart stopped.  My reply was "I need to Puke" because that's the feeling that came over me including a drizzy spell.  I logged out and sulked and soon found an email from Colin asking "What's Up" because he wasn't intuitive enough by his own accord to add the number 2 twice, so I replied with this (In which I am adding here because it sums up the defeated emotion at it's peak when I knew exactly how I felt, Something both Colins know nothing about is Feelings or Emotions).  ------ Nothing, just a sudden reminder that this world is fucked up, for some strange reason I apparently had nothing to offer you, but people with nothing to offer seem to.  I am not a partier, you must have understood that, but I should have known from the beginning that you wouldn't be there for me anyways.  I've moved past the frame of mind/ time of life when you consider your friends to be your only constant, I've entered into the next frame of mind where you realize that friends come and go, but your partner will remain true and constant for the rest of your life.  I offered you that and that's not at all what you wanted.  It was beyond me to be what you wanted because I'm a bit more deeper than that.   It's either an act of shear irony or perhaps a deliberate attempt at being brilliantly ignorant, the fact that I found Colin Knight immature and not ready to commit and then the two are you paired up for weekend holiday extraordinaire.  I simply don't understand the incestuous filth of gay nature and would much rather avoid or ignore it as much as I possibly can because it is irrelevant to the rest of my life.  I really found someone in you who I could see myself with for the rest of my life, loving and supporting each other.  Someone who had the potential to be more, who was intelligent, clever and was honest.  I'm sorry you couldn't see that in me.  All you've done is supported the idea that I'm alone in the world with crazy ideals of happily ever after, prince charming and having someone who could understand me and want to be with me unconditionally.    Anyways, I have to get back to work. -----  So that was more of my "gay trama" for the week.  I can picture myself in ten years happily married to some woman because men have completely turned me off and I am completely out of faith for someone who embodies only goodness, compassion, CONSIDERATION, emotion, honesty, faith, trust.  Well I must go  HUGS and Love With hopes of Faith  DAN:)

      Good Morning  Last night was my good friends Tammy and Jasons wedding.  Weve been friends since grade 9, which is quite some time ago, Jason asked Tammy out in Grade 10, in the cafeteria with roses and chocolates, one of the most romantic things Ive ever borne witness to.  So last night, nine years later, they were finally married.  Sharon came from Ireland with her husband and 2 children (she was married two years ago and now lives in Craigdun Castle with her Husband and children).  Tammy was radiant and as graceful and honest as she has become known for.  Sharon, being the brides Matron, was simply beautiful and eternal, with all the qualities that have always made Sharon herself, strong will, determination, love for all things.  And Caroline and Emilie, also maidens were gorgeous seemed to step into a renewed light.  Such a bittersweet reunion.  As a complete surprise, Collin Graham (Drag queen Collin) decided it would be the wisest thing to bring my ex-Colin#2, the one that should have been but never made it, slowly becoming evil Colin, lol  Where as Colin#1 has lost this Evil Colin title because Ive decided this after spending some time of late talking to him.  His eyes betray his wounded innocence and perhaps Ive was too quick to be hurt by him, rather I could have tried to understand him.  Colin#2 I understand completely, all of my friends went up to him, apparently, throughout the night to tell him to leave, and ask why hes here.  He was angry with this and at the end of the night, while I was having the last dance with Sharon he came to take me from the dance floor to ask Whats going on.  He requested, in sorts, that I flick my emotion switch off so that it would all be as if nothing ever happened, after all it was 2 months ago right? You get over anything then?!?  Well perhaps, if youre like him, who has never had his emotion switch flicked in the on position in the first place, let alone ever!  He went on to say that we had only went out for a month, if that, which is fun because it was more than that, and so sorry that I fell so quickly for someone who romantically embodied most of the qualities I desired in some man.  Romancing quickly turns to fantasy I suppose because he had no quality that I could be interested in now.  He went on to say that, we both are guests, implying that we both had equal rights to be at my friends of almost 10 years wedding WHAT?!?  I beg your pardon? I was guest by invite and he was guest by being Collins date, first off.  Second he has no history, no memories, and cant, even if he was emotionally capable, have the love that we have for each other, that ties us together no matter how much time elapses!  AND THIRD and best of all, He couldn't identify a face in the crowd that he knew, let alone in the wedding party.  He clearly can only see in black and white using only rudimentary logics, we removes emotion from EVERY SINGLE equation he comes to.  Which is fantastic if youre a machine, perhaps hes not so human then.  Ive had my suspicions, from he complete lack of emotion he had while we dated, to his cold, but ever so logical dumping speech complete with the having already had my things for me at the door before I even got there and before he even dumped me with his cold speech.    To him, we barely existed, if ever.  To me, how can use emotion, we very much did exist and I very much did like him.  From the time we laid together for the first night and he mauled me to wake me up because He just couldnt resist , the morning after when he opened his eyes and smiled at me and said This is the best birthday ever!  The few times in the weeks to follow that he told me that I meant a lot to him, then to the crushing weight of his breakup speech.  Anyways, enough for now LOL, I must go get ready for work, Im unsure as to who all is in my house this morning, because Toms brother and 3 of his friends pounded on the door at 3am to be let in because they were piss drunk and the police told them that they were not allowed to drive and if the car moved from in front of my house then there would be charges laid.  HUGS Love DAN:)

      Well it's the middle of the second week of class... I have a pretty light schedule currently.  It's nice for a change.  It gives me time to help Hallie out at SB.  She just lost her boyfriend/fiance/love of her live in a airplane crash on Friday (Sept 12) and is taking time off, but it was so sudden that I took the reigns of SB and keeping it running.  The General manager has congradulated me and empowered me to act as manager, which is neat considering I have zero training apart from what I've learn so far.  Well I was going to write lots, but I'm far too tired to be awake, I'll make a greater effort at some point in the day tomorrow (today) lol.  HUGS DAN:)

      Well today was another great day!  I got alot of sun while I was outside lounging while reading a novel, then I also tried plucking some huge bunches of dandelions out of the lawn.  HOLY!!! They had roots about 30cm long and as thick as a highlighter or heavy duty permanent marker!!!  I finished reading the book... very strange, sort of ludicrous premise and not overly well written, but the concept and ideas were really great and it was definitely well researched.  Kudos to that!!  I visited my mother today at Java Hut, she fed me and gave me money LOL, it's the Italian in her!!  I had iced cream, of course, and went to the gym to burn it off LOL.  Another funny thing I noticed at the gym, and this isn't my only time consciously noticing this, if there is no one on any of the cardio equipment ALL of the televisions are still left on, diligently wasting energy... people's state of mind, I wish people wouldn't be so blatantly ignorant and actually think for themselves for a change.  In addition to this, eventually when the cardio equipment was occupied three consecutive televisions were all tuned to the very same station to watch the very same program... isn't that an odd thing?  When the T.V. exactly half a metre away has the same program on, is it that strenuous to turn your head 15 degrees to either side to watch that one as well?  Is there something against having a communal television?  Here's another pet peeve, people who order disposable things... "Is that for here or to go ma'am or sir?" "Oh, It's for here but I'll have it in a paper cup please" or the inevitable stupid person "Is that for here or to go?"  "Oh, it's for here, thanks"  (one minute later after it's been prepared) "Oh, could I have that in a paper cup?"  People can't seem to add two with two?!?  Very strange.  Anyways, I must be off for bed now. HUGS DAN

      Today is day two of my two days off... sorta, I went in to work last night to help the girls close because Cameron's grandfather passed away yesterday and therefore couldn't be at his shift...  Today's been a much much more productive day than yesterday.  Yesterday I woke up late, played The Sims for hours, watched some hair cutting training video with Tom and Jehny D.  Then came into work... didn't make it to the gym.  Today I woke up early, I've already been to the gym.  Paid some bills, and got other things clarified.  I'm torn with whether or not I even need the internet if I don't really use it... this is the biggest thing I do, and it's not even that often.  No one ever emails me, not that that's a complaint.  The whole reason I changed internet providers was because too many unsolicited email made its way into my email box!!!  Naughty spammers!!!  Like I'd even consider shopping with them when they've added my name to their lists without my consent!!!!!    So I'm supposed to do something with Tiina today, soon too I hope because Mark and I are going to do something tonight.  I need Tom to fix my hair, argh, all I wanted was my normal colour, but it's a gross strawberry blond now.  Washes my face out.  So while I was on the Elliptical treadmill at the gym today I can't help but notice that all of the televisions are left on, even when no one is watching them (make sense of that for me?!?) and that they were mostly women who were watching brainless things like "While you were out", "MTV Flats", "Newly Weds" (A mind-bogglingly stupid television programme staring some blond ditz that makes it apparently clear that some of us haven't developed mental skills beyond the common Ape).  This only goes to reinforce my reason I haven't had television in my home for over five years now.  I don't need brain rot and SUV propaganda.    Speaking of which, today I saw a jeep commercial that showed some lady, all by herself in this large gas consuming vehicle, casually driving through the streets and coming to a road block or something, and so she drove onto the side walk and then down some random forest setting that seemingly appeared in the middle of this urban centre.  Finally she arrives at a pier to give her apparent son a life jacket to go on the boat with.  The slogan was something to the effect "Only Jeep can" or something like that.  Funny enough, every SUV commercial shows that.    Good thing that the average person, owning a vehicle, rarely needs to go to through a forest/mountainous region on their way home from work or the grocery store... I dunno, people don't know how to think for themselves these days.  This makes me sad inside.  This also brings me to another thing I noticed today.  This lady on the left side of me today was watching "The View", which is a show all about being self-centred, centre of the universe Americans, from what I gathered.  It had George Michael on, with his partner and the lady was completely horrified and changed the channel.  Homophobia?!?  What is the difference between homophobia and racism?  It's still a prejudice!    People are hilarious...  Laughing my ass off HUGS DAN

      Well I just got home from work, it was a slow day, but I got a lot of stuff done...  I've gotta go work on the boat tonight with Sarah, yay, I haven't seen her in a lifetime!  Well since Monday, but that was brief.   I've been working on and evolving a story that I've been writing for quite some time and last night I sorted out alot of the crappy writing from the good LOL...  Not too interesting, but I just needed something to talk a about for a moment there.  I went for wine with Mark last night, it was good but he was being a jerk to the waiter for absolutely no reason what-so-ever.  Made me angry and irritated.  He is such a spoiled brat sometimes, it seems to be hard to separate him from how he's learned to grow up to actually being a thinking and compassionate person who does not treat others badly just because he can.   I call this   "Centre of the Universe"   syndrome, it is a condition brought about by mistaking yourself as been the whole entire reason why existence exists...  Many people suffer from this syndrome, especially typical North American mothers of 2.3 children who like to drive around in mini-vans and pretend that they are always in a hurry and more important than anyone else.  It's hard to imagine what women had to go through because the age of the minivan to transport all the useless shit that will most likely wind up in a landfill because that's where the 300 billion tonnes of disposable diapers go per year.  Are people stupid?!?  I just don't know.  We've lost all sense of common sense actually.  Which is the first and last steps in the   "Centre of the Universe"   syndrome.  Anyways, I must get going, I have to get ready for my second job and pick my aunt up from work.   I had intended upon mowing the lawn today, but Tom seems to have the key to the garage on him again, instead of the key dish or on the cork board so that I might get to enter his pot haven when I want to.  We've had this conversation a million times and he still doesn't seem to get it, he's like an old dog that never really bothered to learn any tricks in the first place.  Well, till next entry! HUGS DAN  p.s.  I got accepted into my Masters of Engineering programme!  Tres excited!

      Wowsers, I just decided yesterday at 6pm to make a new website, and I did :D  Funnily enough...  It's not so graphically involved like it's predessor, however, I enjoy it's complex simplicity and the fact that it's all on one page now!!!   urlLink Come and look  (unless you've come from there to here, then that's a bit redundant).   I'm anxiously awaiting my grad photos to arrive... June 23rd. Yikes!!  It didn't even take that long two Christmas ago when Marc and I had our portraits taken.  Oh well.   Yesterday was such a terrific day, it was 26 degrees all day, even when there was overcast.  I went for my classic walk to the Marina to enjoy a delicious Ice Cream cone from the homemade ice cream parlour "The Next Stop Ice Cream Shop" (It is a pun on the fact that the whole building used to be an old passenger train station).  Yesterday I had Peach/Mango and Strawberry Kiwi, they were brilliant!!  Very delicious!!    Well, I must go and enjoy my day, I don't have much of it because I work at 7am tomorrow....  HUGS DAN

      Well it's been a while... I'm graduated with my Honours Bachelors in Science.  FINALLY!! I've been dating a great guy for 6 months as of Grad day.  Fluky.  I'm still living with Tom, it's much better than before.  Miranda and Chad are moving to Orillia in the fall so that Miranda can go to Georgian college to be a vet tech.  I'm hopefully going to start my Masters in Environmental Engineering.  I saw Colin #2 on grad day and wished him good luck, he took the 3 year program instead of the 4 and got out now and is going to U of T in the fall.  Tom is almost done Hair Dressing school, he's working a Tim Hortin's (Tim's) in the mall and at Regis Hair Salon, also in the Mall.  He has made some more crazy friends, Lana is quite a riot, very loud, very blonde and sleeps here on Tuesday and Wednesday night so that her parents can have loud rampant sex without here hearing.  Serious!   Dawn is my favourite by far, she is a gentle spirit with open arms.  I feel peaceful when I hang out with her.  It's the strangest thing, I haven't been depressed or upset since November...  My life really seems to be unfolding now.  My parents are fighting, however, I'm very concerned with my mother, she carries mickeys of rum where ever she goes and is usually drunk within 45 minutes after leaving work.  And yes she drives inpaired.  I don't know what to do here.  I've talked to her about it...  and my father has always been an alcoholic.  OH, another thing, on November 17th, I was promoted to Assistant Manager at Starbucks... nice pay raise, and finally recognition.  Well, must go to bed now, very tired.  Cheers!

      Holy shit, I've been absolutely cranky for the past few days, I don't know why.&nbsp; Perhaps I'm fed up with the people in my life or having to do the same thing all the time.&nbsp; I really just want to go have a terrible amount of fun somewhere else in the world.&nbsp; This city is so absolutely horrible, the people and personalities here.&nbsp; I haven't actually felt great and happy in quite some time.&nbsp; I don't mean I feel foul or anything like that, just I wish life would hurry up and happen before I turn 30.  &nbsp;  I've been horrible to Mark, hopefully he's forgiving, I get very upset with him sometimes, he dallys and contemplates far too much, yet still manages not to think before opening his mouth the majority of the time.&nbsp; He spends half&nbsp;of his time contemplating what he'll do the other half of the time.&nbsp; I desperately want excitement and spontenuity, it's okay not to be so all the time, but sometimes it'd be great.  &nbsp;  It's his birthday on the 3rd, I must find something absolutely amazing to do for it.&nbsp; Although, I'm not entirely sure what, he had the most wonderful surprise for me on my birthday.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Mark and I went to his friend Cystal's engagement party today, it was a very lovely backyard lawn catered celebration.&nbsp; I enjoyed myself.&nbsp; I ate lots of delicious food and actually had interesting and new conversation with people I barely know.&nbsp; Which is always a bonus.&nbsp; It turns out that Mark's friend Cyrstal is marrying my Dr.'s son, wow, very small city.&nbsp; Mixing with the finest of Thunder Bay Aristocracy, make me puke.&nbsp; We did, however, have an entire conversation about colour.&nbsp; Wow, I didn't know there was so much to talk about colour...&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On Friday night, after work, Mark and I went to the "Warp 9" dance club for my friend Bobbi's pre-wedding celebration.&nbsp; We danced lots with a whole slew of peoples, whether or not we knew them, it doesn't really matter.&nbsp; I met the Local Radio Personality, Julie Buckingham, (also known on the Radio as "THE INCREDIBLY SHRINKING ANNOUNCER" because of her public weight loss attempt, I thought she looked pretty good) as I grinded with her on the dance floor.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; Terribly halarious.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we went home and slept in.&nbsp; It was my first time out in a very very long time.&nbsp; LOL.  &nbsp;  Anyways, I'm going to finish writing this now.&nbsp; I need a holiday and I need it to be not in this city.&nbsp; I rarely choose to use the term "Hate" but it's something very close to that I feel for my life in this city.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Caio  HUGS  DAN

      Wowsers, I just tried transferring my Blogspot journal over to LiveJournal, what an ordeal, YA RIGHT!&nbsp; I'm happy here, why the hell not stay here huh?&nbsp; LOL... &nbsp; Well, I'm not sure what the last entry was, or what it was, but I really need to keep on that ball.&nbsp; I'm in my Masters Program, I've been debating well for the better part of a month on whether I actually want to go back or not... I DO!&nbsp; It is was I see myself doing. &nbsp; I've been absolutely terrified about monetary issues...&nbsp; Can I afford to go back?&nbsp; I guess so... Can I stand living under the poverty line eating horrible second rate food that can't help but go to my hips... sure!&nbsp; Tom and I have decided that we're going to find someone who'll do 2-4-1 Emergency lipposuction, it's the only logical solution.&nbsp; &nbsp; Lots going on right now, this Friday Night shall be my first outing to a bar in a very long time... since that time with Mun and Ryan last summer to Armanis where I encountered Teenaged bitch girls with too much attitudes.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I've also decided that Tom and Mark are stunting my creativity and my attempts at becoming a deeper person.&nbsp; Mark is totally superficial and Tom struggles at the best of times. &nbsp; Mark and I never talk about anything other than work, the weather and what we've done today.&nbsp; I want to know what he thinks about things, not what his friends think, not what his dad thinks, not what his professors think, his very own thoughts.&nbsp; He's always worried that his clothes aren't meeting GAP standards of 'lack-of-colour' and 'lack-of-creativity' to have a deep conversation.&nbsp; Does he think for himself?&nbsp; Or is her one of those typical over consuming north american can't think for themselves, let media decide persons? &nbsp; Well, it's gonna be eight months on the 29th, so I better start learning... &nbsp; On a brighter note, Tom and I had a fabulous dinner tonight, on the Hibatchi, it took not too long, infact, just enough time for me to run to meet my aunt and grandma to do "The Cheque Thing" which is (if I haven't mentioned it before online) they write me a cheque, I cash it and the go to BINGO.&nbsp; With the almost expected outcome of them being down $300 and the cheque bouncing out of my account disrupting my bill payments and my own personal life. &nbsp; Oh Well, that's family, and I suppose, in some strange way, I wouldn't have it any other way. &nbsp; Well, I'm going to go visit Tom downstairs, he's watching ABFAB all by his lonesome, before Jehny D comes over.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I've mentioned that either here, but Jehny D's moving back down south, we are having a farewell martini party here next saturday night. &nbsp; TTYL HUGS DAN &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
