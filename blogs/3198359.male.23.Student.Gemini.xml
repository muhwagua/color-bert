      Ladies and gentlemen, when you put your television sets tonight and see those lovely so-called "Christian Families" protesting their anti-abortion message, just read the below a few times. The below post from the newsgroup alt.politics.homosexuality is the type of person you will be supporting if you believe the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) that this ilk intend to spread. Their message isn't pro-life but pro-big government, pro-police state, pro-theocracy. Don't let this ilk take over the US, vote for Kerry, even if you don't like him. At least if you boot GWB out now, hopefully the Republicans will come to their senses and realise that the religious right shouldn't have a monopoly of influence over the party and in fact, should be kicked out in favour of a return to the  TRUE  values of conservatism.

You bastards spit on everything else that is kind and moral and decent and good. Why not?   > If there really were justice, you're children would be gay.  My KIDS were raised with MORALS and STANDARDS. They were taught to hate queers and other inferiors at an early age. So now, there's NO hang-ups in those areas! The problem with people like you is that you were never raised with any solid right-vs-wrong standards. You are a product of your parent's sick generation. The "If it feels good, do it" crowd. That's your problem. Keep on 'doin' it' and maybe AIDS will get ya'. One less mental FREAK to have to deal with.  The one ray of sunshine here is that you won't breed. Not unless you get into the Boy Scouts or something.  IBen G.

      A little coup d’etat has occured in the PC world, Microsoft and Turbo Linux join forces to provide Microsoft Media Services on Linux. Is this the start of a new direction for Microsoft? does it mean the days of "screw the customer out of ever dime plus leave a bill for the next generation", hardly, now that would have been a major change in direction.  What we are seeing now isn't necessarily a change but a realisation that no matter how they improve their product, they'll always find that there will be a significant number of people who will prefer to run Linux or a UNIX of some sort, ahead of using Windows for the servers and/or workstations.  With this realisation, they've (although not openly) conceded that the best way to extract money from these customers is by offering the ability for the competitors to license technologies off them and payment being made back via royalties either via once up payment or a "per-unit" royalty which is generally the case in most business transactions.   What this will allow them to do is allow their recurring revenue increase thus allow them to eventually start paying sizable dividends to their shareholders, however, the other side is this, they're a pragmatic company. No matter how much the fanboys from the anti-Microsoft camp would love to make out, Microsoft isn't stupid. They realise that they can either try and fight Linux/UNIX and waste their energy trying to get the last 60% of the marketplace (server marketplace) or they can simply say, "hey, they've chosen that, lets offer our technologies so they can run them on their chosen platform".  Microsoft benefits either way, whether it be the Linux/UNIX market expanding or the Windows marketing expanding, the fact remains, they'll make money indirectly by providing technologies rather than openly selling software which would give the market the incorrect perception that Microsoft has "thrown in the towel" in regards to competing.

      Well, another day. Skipped the lecture today; UNIX Scripting, having done it since god was a teenager; I'll probably head along next week. I doubt I had missed much.  Just have a quick browser through  urlLink OS News  seems to be populated with the same anti-SUN whiners, whingers, complainers, oh, did I forget to mention, Linux fanboys. Everyone knows these sorts of people, they sit around hyperventilating over their operating system that they started using "exclusively" for 2 months! wow! A whole two months! And here is me, used Linux for 7 years, years before it became the darling of the media, IBM and every other parasitic clingon from the IT industry.  Then there are the so-called "pastors" and "ministers" who are equal to that of a Linux fanboy but instead hang around alt.politics.homosexuality. No study, no credibility but expecting to be taken seriously. The equivalence of them out in the real world would be an architect who has a great idea but doesn't have the necessary skills to make their "vision" possible. Call me old fashioned or elitist, but don't expect me to give you an respect as "minister" or "pastor" until such time you do the hard yards; until the day you do the "hard yards", you're like every other yobo out there with a chip on both sholders and a large soap box to match.  Well, I've got that morning rant out of the way ;-) lets hope the rest of the day works out nicely.  On some positive news,  urlLink Camino  has really stabilised. I've been running the nightlies for over a month and it has gone from strength to strength, however, at the same time, Firefox has made some real movement forward. About the only thing lacking from Firefox would be native widgets for webpages; the standard GTK/XUL looking ones are rather ugly when compared the gorgeous toned down "MacOS 10.3" aqua look 'n feel.

      Ooh, heard on the radio by a religious conservative minister who claimed that the pro-choice/pro-abortionists are all lesbians. There is an interesting spin, what would a lesbian require an abortion for? has there been a revolution where by two women can have a child without the need of a male (at any stage)? well, its news to me!

      Just listening to Ella Fitzgerald - The Very Thought Of You; something has to be said about the music from days gone by, these people knew how to sing, and the music, dare I say it, "it swings" ;-) Having seen the pathetic excuses for talent paraded each night on these "reality TV" shows like Australia Idol/American Idol and Pop Stars, its nice to know that those of us who prefer, hmm, "quality music" are still able to acquire, and some times, at a nice price ;-)  Mind you, nothing pleases me more than seeing Simon off American Idol punch a hole in the contestants egos that are so large, they need their own time zone. Yes, I do take pleasure in someone elses misfortune, sometimes referred to in German as Schadenfreude. If the above makes me a Schadenfreude, well, I'd be more than happy to walk down the road with a T-Shirt saying, "Simon is my hero" and on the back "he punches holes in egos!" ;-)

      Back from classes and more confused that ever about subnet masking, oh well, I guess I'm in for some long nights trying to understand the lingo required to get things working.  Absolute crap is on television at this moment; if it isn't a half-baked "reality tv" programme, its some documentry that tells the obvious to the viewer. Never mind, I've always got more study, testing the latest version of Camino/Thunderbird and of course, posting a few rants on "me old blog" ;-)  Oh, and its been 2 days since my last caffine fix! ahh! giving up is hard, believe me, I had a splitting headache all day :-( oh well, apparently, it gets better after a week. You're probably asking, "why the f**k are you giving up that greatest thing in nature", simple, I'm a crappy sleeper and caffine doesn't make the situation any better. Oh well, lets hope I have a decent sleep tonight, another long day tomorrow.

      Great! Another episode of Queer as Folk (QAF) this week, but here is something cool; lesbian scene! I'm sure there are now screams of happiness in the straight male quarter. Could this be a new direction for QAF?  One thing that has been good is Ted Schmit getting into rehab for his "self medicating"; for a moment then I was expecting an overdose (OD) and possibly a death (gah!), but its good to see that the shows creators are showing that if you have recognised that you're addicted to a substance, there are those who you can turn to for help. Hopefully this show will go down well, and wake a few up.  On the funny front;  "Dr. Robert Spitzer found only 200 long-term ex-gays in all of North America in his 2001 study, despite extensive help from Exodus in searching for "thousands" of ex-gays."* , there are "so many" of these ex-gay people, poor old Exodus "lost track". And for the translation, "200 ex-gays who were actually bi-sexual but assumed that there is only gay and straight; thus they assumed they must be gay because the like men".  * Information Sourced from  urlLink Ex-Gay Watch   I've added the Ex-Ex-Gay link for those who like to keep up to date in the ex-gay hypocrisy. To be completely blunt, these people are like the evangelical preachers who go from town to town with their revivals and false miracles promising salvation but all they really do is make peoples wallets that little bit lighter.  These people may think they're helping, but they're not and parents who actually believe in this mumbo-jumbo simply perpetuate the problem even more. Let me make this perfectly clear, there is no "cure" to homosexuality; your cards have been dealt, deal with it. Have and look at me (for example); 22 years old, well adjusted, great job and studying moving foward.   Do I "feel" a desire to be straight? Heck no, because quite frankly, to wish to become something that is never going to possible is like a person dreaming that if they've always wanted to be a dog instead of a human knowing full well that no matter how much they desire it to be so, they will never be a dog.  Yes, as one is coming out, one wonders whether their feelings are "normal" and whether they can change; I've moved beyond that point in my life. I know who I am, and to be completely honest, I certainly don't need to have an entourage of "supporters" following me, like the ex-gays tend to.  But then again; these ex-gays are like reformed smokers, they claim that since they can do it, everyone else should follow them. Sorry, if us "fags" like who we are, the likes of Haley can run off and suck on a popsicle if all I care. The fact is, not one supposed "study" and "followup" ever defines whether the person is actually gay or just bisexual, but then again, it would ruin their industry if all they can say is that they make bisexual people more heterosexual.

      And so the saga continues on the "Christian Fundamentalist" vs the universe in the soap opera that has now got one sad little man, Randall Terry, justifying his "views" and his "parental skills"; which is more of a "my sons gay, my daughter is a Muslim, it must that evil and immoral liberal media I tell ya! evil!" rant than actually anything sincere. Well, to make it interesting, lets break down the article; that always brings a bit of lively entertainment ;-)  http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A32934-2004Apr21?language=printer (Free registration required (no, as long as you don't select any subscriptions, you won't be spammed))   Family Values - Randall Terry Fights Gay Unions. His Son No Longer Will.   By Michael Powell, Washington Post Staff Writer, Thursday, April 22, 2004; Page C01   His father, Randall Terry, was a wavy-haired charismatic possessed of a mellifluous voice and proudly extreme politics, a Christian warrior from Upstate New York who founded Operation Rescue, appeared regularly on national television and denounced murderous abortionists and demonic homosexual sodomites.   Sounds like a nice chap to invite around for Devonshire teas with the folks to talk the awful liberal media, how ignorance is the greatest weapon against pregnancy and how "rump riding" is destroying America [Please insert here the necessary scream followed by the hands thrown in the area with the traditional "Praise the Lord" as the banjo playing bible thumpers are worked up by our little show man]   Randall Terry adopted Jamiel, and Jamiel became his adoring son. He rose to his father's defence during an unsuccessful congressional race. And he joined his dad in taking up the rhetorical sword to fight against homosexual civil unions in Vermont in 2000.  Theirs was a righteous narrative of father and son. Until Jamiel decided to write a new chapter.   Yes folks, we all know where this is heading. Remember the saying by Chris Rock when he was performing at the Apollo, "Whoever you hate WILL end up in your family. If you're homophobic, you gonna have a gay son." Oops, I've give too much away already ;-)   "It's hard to point to one moment when you begin to come out to yourself," Jamiel begins his essay in the May issue of Out magazine, which appears on newsstands this week, "but if I had to, I'd go back to a night seven years ago when I was 17 . . . in my old bedroom at my parents' house . . . where my friend 'Johnny' and I had just finished fooling around."  This was the moment, Jamiel wrote, when he realized he was gay.   And this is the moment when hell, fire and brimstone was sprayed down on their house by the ever so caring and loving father [insert rolling of eyes]   Jamiel, 24, has close-cropped hair, mocha colouring and a stud under his lower lip. He's handsome and articulate, with the preternatural ease in the spotlight found in celebrity children. He lounges in a white leather chair in a friend's house in suburban Charlotte and talks of his decision to bear public witness to his sexuality.  He wrote his article, he says, to help children of Christian fundamentalists deal with their own sexuality. Maybe he also wrote to help his father understand him. Or maybe he wrote to make him understand something else.   Sounds like a noble cause, but lets remember, the ultimate cornerstone of  every  fundamentalist; be it Christian, Muslim or Jewish, is ignorance followed closely by arrogance, which keeps the ignorance in check (ever notice when you challenge a fundamentalist Christians belief, their first weapon is defence, followed by slander with screaming and yelling coming a close third) and denial.  If people are bought up in this sort of environment, the likelihood of them actually acknowledging their sexuality is very low, and this compounded by the fact that home schooling encourages this insular attitude to the world around them, the chance of them seeking help outside the family unit is even lower.  Its the equivalence of these children living in North Korea where they're taught to praise Kim Jong Il and never question decisions "made by the peoples workers party or our great leader".   A few years back, Randall Terry divorced his wife, Cindy -- who once said her husband was touched by the divine -- and married a much younger woman. (Terry's ex barely speaks to him anymore.) Their four children say they still love their father but the relationship has frayed. Terry recently barred one of his adopted teenage daughters from his house after she got pregnant out of wedlock for the second time. Another adopted daughter also became pregnant as a teenager and later converted to Islam, a religion Terry has described as composed of "murderers" and "terrorists." (The couple's lone biological child, a daughter, is in college.)   Oh, there are the juicy bits. So Randall Terry moves from being "faithful and loyal husband" to "dirty old man looking for better slap 'n tickle in the bedroom".  As for a "religion composed by murders and terrorists", how interesting that his ilk is quite happy to promote criminal activities like  urlLink Army Of God  which approves of the actions of the now convicted murderer Paul Hill.    The night before Jamiel's interview with The Washington Post, Randall Terry drove seven hours from his Florida home to visit Jamiel in Charlotte. Theirs was not a pleasant talk. Why, Randall demanded, didn't you tell me you were thinking of writing this and committing an act of betrayal? I could have helped you with a Christian cure for homosexuality.  Jamiel hikes his eyebrows as he recalls the conversation. "I told him: 'Dad, how was I supposed to tell you? Look at who you are.' "   Oh, goodie a "cure" like "walking classes" to teach one how to walk in a "manly fashion", "voice deepening classes" to curb that campness and let us not forget the hand holding and guitar playing classes where they all sit around talking about their feelings whilst claiming to each other they're receiving the "holy spirit".  Please, the success rate of these "clinics" are so dodgy, I've got a better chance of training my cat how to woof, and even if I did achieve this feet, it would change the fact that it is still a cat. Denial is a wonderful thing, and it is one of the three cornerstones of fundamentalism (as mentioned previously).   'My Prodigal Son'  You pick up the telephone and there's Randall Terry, as folksy and pained as could be.  "I'm distressed, man," he says. "This is absolutely the most gut-wrenching thing I've ever gone through. Man, I'm grieving."  You're a father, he says to the reporter. You know my pain. I tried, Randall says, to talk my son out of going public, but Jamiel paid me no heed. I tried to explain the ramifications, but Jamiel turned a deaf ear.   What ramifications? the fact that it could possibly affect his (Randall's) empire building? the fact that he could possibly have a happy son who is secure with knowing who he truly is rather than being told what he is by his father.   So Randall, 45, did what made sense to him as a father, not to mention to a man who harbours hopes of regaining a leadership role in the Christian evangelical and antiabortion movement. (The pastor of his previous church -- the Landmark Church of Binghamton, N.Y. -- unceremoniously tossed him out when he divorced his wife.) Before Jamiel's article could appear, Randall wrote his own, and titled it "My Prodigal Son, the Homosexual."   So in other words, this was all part of Randall's empire building game; great the model family, have the perfect wife and children; if he plays his cards rights, he gets top job in the local "we hate women having a choice" foundation.   He posted this essay on several Web sites, including his own, RandallTerry.com. He wrote of his love for Jamiel and his son's gifts -- his keen mind, singing voice and cooking skill. But Randall cautions that one must understand this about his son: The Terrys rescued Jamiel from a very dark home. Jamiel was born in jail, a victim of "crimes and treacheries" too terrible to spell out (if not too terrible for a father to hint at). Jamiel is a liar who's led a double life.  "My son's life," Randall wrote, "is a shambles."  As open letters go from father to son, it's quite extraordinary. Did Randall wrestle with doubt before putting such an unsparing document on Web sites and later publishing a version of it in the Washington Times?  "It about tore my heart out to write that column, but Jamiel prostituted my name," Randall says. "The truth is that Jamiel is not trustworthy. The truth is that his life is one long deception. May God have mercy. May Christ have mercy."   When in doubt, slander the gay. You'd think that our old friend Randall would come out with something a little more original, but hey, we live in hope.   Family Affair  Families surely are a most inscrutable product of God's hand. Who should know this better than Randall Terry?  Randall came rambling out of the capacious lands of northern New York. His grandmother was a civil rights activist, his aunts were strong feminists -- one would later serve as spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Rochester. Randall, as this aunt once noted with intentional irony, was raised at the knees of feminists.   Hmm, and using this, he should have turned out to be a genuine, tree hugging, pro-choice, gay friendly and open minded individual. I guess nurture doesn't always have the final say on matters.   Randall, though, was sweetly oblivious. He played a mean guitar and piano, and smoked bodacious amounts of herb. He was going to be a rock-and-roll star. A bright kid, he dropped out of high school a few months short of graduation, stuck out a thumb and disappeared into the West.  A few months and boatloads of dope and magic mushrooms later, he washed ashore in Galveston, Tex. He had his epiphany in a diner and that was that. Randall Terry never had much trouble divining God's will after that -- the transmissions were crystal clear.   Translation; he saw an evangelical one night on television screaming hell, fire and brimstone and thought, "f**k, anyone could do that, and going by the expensive suite and hair styling, he must rake in the cash! oh, and check out that music set, what a show man".   Terry returned to Rochester and began talking of God and hellfire, and selling used cars. Once he fell to his knees by the side of a highway and beseeched the Lord to forgive his sins. He enrolled in a Bible school, where he met his wife, Cindy. They talked of serving as missionaries in Central America. But "God interrupted" and delivered unto Terry a vision of a battle plan to fight abortion.   Translation: There is a new opening in the God reselling business and it appears to be in the anti-abortion screaming section! great, these people are nuts, have money and it'll provide me with a nice little thing to do and won't require me to do any real work apart from appearing at rallies, scream the rant and go home. Not too bad for 4hours work each week.   Terry read civil rights tracts, including Coretta Scott King's memoir, and slowly hatched a plan. In 1986 he founded Operation Rescue. This would become a significant moment in the history of the Christian right, the first time an evangelical general would wield the tools of civil disobedience in the service of the antiabortion cause.   Translation: Randall needed a more formal organisation for his business venture to work, so he formed the Operation Rescue Corporation with its sole aim to suck cash from its supports, scream and rant about topics that 95% quite frankly couldn't give two hoots about and keep bringing in the sheep for more indoctrination.   In 1988, Terry and his legions started standing in front of local abortion clinics, screaming and pleading with pregnant women to turn away. They tossed their bodies against car doors to keep abortion patients from getting out. They waved crucifixes and screamed "Mommy, Mommy" at the women. When Terry commanded, hundreds went jellyfish-limp and blockaded the "death clinics."  In 1989, a "Holy Week of Rescue" shut down a family planning clinic in Los Angeles. More than 40,000 people were arrested in these demonstrations over four years. Subtlety wasn't Terry's thing -- he described Planned Parenthood's founder, Margaret Sanger, as a "whore" and an "adulteress" and arranged to have a dead fetus presented to Bill Clinton at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. (He also opposed birth control and divorce -- "Families," he wrote in his 1995 book "The Judgment of God," "are destroyed as a father vents his mid life crisis by abandoning his wife for a 'younger, prettier model.' ")   The old Christian Fundamentalist Pastors excuse for everything, "the rules don't apply to me because I receive devine revelation!"   A few years earlier came a day that looms large in the Legend of Randall Terry. Terry had stopped a troubled young woman outside an abortion clinic and persuaded her to bring her pregnancy to term. The baby, Tila, was born in 1985.  "After I saved Tila's life, we helped her mother out with baby furniture and clothes," Terry recalls. "We became more and more involved with her family. The children stayed with us for summers, holidays, weekends."  In 1987, Randall and Cindy agreed to take in Tila and her older brother, Jamiel, then 8, and his older sister, Ebony, as foster children. In 1994, they formally adopted Tila and Jamiel. The children are biracial. Their biological mother, who was white, has since died.  Randall circulated a résumé at the time that described his family. "Children: One by birth and three black foster children."  Terry's fame arced high during this time, his days and nights a blur of airports and appearances on "Crossfire" and "Nightline." ("Did you see my sound bites?" he'd inquire when reporters called for interviews in the late 1980s.)   Well, operation, "I have a nice perfect family" is now working, now onto step two of "theocratising the United States".   The family lived in a Victorian home set in the rolling farmland outside Binghamton in south central New York. Randall was the outsize patriarch, his energy inexhaustible, his laughter infectious, his control considerable. He read everything, sang like an angel and played that piano. At night, he'd tuck in the children and pray with them.  "I idolized my dad. He's a very magnetic person and my best friend," Jamiel says. "He was running a major national organization, we'd have all sorts of guests -- Jerry Falwell came by.  "Our life was never boring."  Randall takes pride in saying he shielded his family from the media spotlight. But the membrane between public and private life can be porous for a movement man. When Randall ran for Congress in 1998 and faced charges of racism, Jamiel stepped forward. Identifying himself as a person of colour, Jamiel demanded that his father's opponent apologize.  It's hard to know after talking with Jamiel and his sisters how much of their narrative is reality and how much desire. They insist their childhood was happy even as they say their parents' unyielding moral code allowed for few adolescent stumbles. They were to study the Bible and live its word. They were schooled at home and in fundamentalist schools. R-rated movies were out. So was divorce and any talk of sexuality.  "My parents were very strict and sheltering," recalls Tila, a startling 18-year-old beauty who is unmarried and now pregnant for the second time. "They were very loving but we never talked about anything."   Interesting to note; Tila was almost exclusively bought up by Randall and look at the net result of it; a daughter, 18 years old and pregnant with her second child; it speaks volumes in terms of success, or their lack of, of their "no sex talk" philosophy.  As I said previously, their whole existence is based around the tripod fundamentalism; Ignorance, Arrogance and Denial. Denial and Ignorance play a big factor in a fundamentalist family; they assume if they kids don't know about it, it won't happen. Using that logic, if they don't watch someone getting punched, they won't punch someone, which is crazy as like sex, there are ingrained things people already know, it is the duty of the parent to teach the child acceptable ways to control/use those ingrained things.   Ebony, now 28, left home when she was 16 and became pregnant soon after. "When you get out of a family with very strict rules, you are exposed to so much," she says. "You discover how easy it is to make the wrong choice."   Yeap, and this is the negative spin off of the tripod of fundamentalism.   When his parents divorced, Randall refused to let his children speak with their grandfather for three years. At 16, Jamiel was a summer intern with the American Center for Law and Justice, founded by the Rev. Pat Robertson. Afterward, Jamiel announced that he wanted to become a chef.  His father was not amused.  "He told me I could leave his house at that very moment," Jamiel recalls. "He wanted me to be a lawyer, a judge, in the movement. He told me he'd cut me off cold if I became a chef."   Interesting how this is part of Randall's whole empire building game; "Stuff the kids, screw the the wife, I want my empire god damn it, and I want it now!". Sounds like another money and power hungry individual who is more concerned with control and manuplating those around him for his own "grand plan" than actually listening and being the supposed father figure he makes himself out to be.   Awakening  At the time, Jamiel was beginning to wrestle with a far greater inner conflict -- his own sexuality. Asked if he tried to broach this subject with his parents, Jamiel returns a look that suggests you're on crack. As he noted in Out magazine: "When you grow up in a house where to be the thing you are is an abominable sin, you tend to try and shed those behaviors."  He practiced deepening his voice. He avoided anything hinting of the effeminate. And he dated girls even as he fooled around with male friends in his bedroom. "It was so secret and so hidden, I don't think I even felt the weight of it," Jamiel says.   Haven't we all tried that? Heck, I remember back when I was 14 trying to deny that I was gay; from trying to act tough, to talking with a low voice, heck, even tried to take up "tough" sport to prove I was a "rough 'n tough bloke" when in actual fact I was a "pretty fairy who preferred public speaking and debates".   Sometimes he'd sneak into his father's library late at night and look at his collection of books on gays and gay life (Terry maintained the collection so he could speak with authority on such questions).  "I looked at the pictures of shirtless men," Jamiel wrote. "I even picked up some useful knowledge about safe sex from these volumes."  An air of cognitive dissonance attends to this voyage of discovery, to his navigation between nights of desire and days of self-loathing. A 20-year-old Jamiel did a stint with the short-lived Steve Forbes for President 2000 campaign. Later he repaired to Vermont to help his father campaign against gay civil unions.  It was an awkward reunion. Randall Terry recently had separated from Cindy and taken up with a young former housekeeper and aide. He was shunned by many friends and activists in the antiabortion movement. Randall moved for a while to Nashville and tried his hand at country music. (He recently cut a second album with Ronnie Milsap's band. "It's to die for, man," Randall says.)   About the only thing I can say here is good on those who shunned Randall after the divorce, especially after he screamed about the evils of divorce, abortion and homosexuality.   "My father kept saying, 'It's no one's business that I got divorced,' " Jamiel recalls. "I'd tell him: 'Dad, you sent out 100,000 Christmas cards with pictures of our perfect Christian family. You led Christian workshops on being a good husband. That's why people are disappointed.' "  Randall conceded that Jamiel had a point.   Yes, and maybe you should also recant on your comments regarding homosexuality and abortion as these both can be classified under the "It's no one's business that I got/am [homosexual/abortion]".   Now Randall plunged into his second act, as an anti-gay-rights crusader, heading an organization called Loyal Opposition.  "The Bible," Randall notes, "doesn't condemn divorce, but it does condemn homosexuality."  He opened an office in Montpelier, within sight of Vermont's gold-domed Capitol building. One day he walked outside the capitol during a legislative vote and shook his head as though to dislodge images too horrible for words.  "It's hideous in there, man," he told reporters. "It's unbelievable. It's demonic."   When in doubt, and lost all credibility, move to a new state and start a new hate crusade! Btw Randall, the bible does (according to most in your ilk) condemn divorce, according to the Catholic Church, which for 1500, before the Protestant reformation, claimed that a divorce as immoral and even then, there are still Protestants who believe that divorce is immoral.  Then again, we're talking about a person who makes the rules as he goes along. When they affect him, he'll change/tweak them to suit his agenda. He is like the populist politician who changes with the wind.   Jamiel felt a little queasy about the whole undertaking. But that didn't stop him from staying on in Vermont. Jamiel isn't particularly good at articulating, what, precisely he was thinking.  "I felt very hypocritical," he acknowledges. "I would get these angry phone calls from gays and I wanted to say: 'I know, I know, I'm gay, too!' "  Soon Jamiel quit and headed south. Many months later, he told his family that he was gay. His mother thought he was having a nervous breakdown. His father offered to send Jamiel away for a three-month Christian cure. Jamiel declined the offer.   And I say, good for you. The only thing you would get out of this so-called "Christian cure" is the ability to play the guitar, a few happy-go-lucky songs and possibly some new acclamations one can scream out when at church whilst claiming you're receiving the holy spirit.   "I'm going to be at your funeral," Randall told his son. "You'll be dead by 40."   Don't ya just love good old-fashioned Christian forgiveness and love ;-)   These were months of deep struggle, a time during which Jamiel thought more than once of suicide. Eventually, he came to a point of calm and thought of writing about his struggle. After a fashion, he sees himself acting on his father's teachings.  "We were taught that if you saw pain in the world, you should speak out," he says. "I knew that because of my name I could get published and help young men and women who are gay and struggling because of their religious upbringing.  "I was raised in a family where it's immoral to see a problem and remain silent."   That must be about the only thing one can say that Randall taught that was actually a useful skill.   Randall's Lament  "The only reason you want to talk with me is because his last name is Terry. He's playing you and he's prostituting my name."  So the father talks about the son whom he raised to adulthood. In a long phone conversation, Randall Terry says his son is lost, a drug user and a liar who has written bad checks. Randall says Out magazine paid Jamiel $5,000 to write the article and become its "homosexual poster boy." Randall says the magazine's editors "put words in my son's mouth."  (For the record, Jamiel and the editors of Out say much of this is wrong. Jamiel says he sought out the magazine because he felt an obligation to help those struggling with their own sexual identity. He was paid roughly $2,500. While his account was edited, Jamiel claims ownership of the words.)  In Randall's view, most -- no, make that all -- of Jamiel's problems arise from his formative years in his biological mom's home.  "Tragically," Randall writes in his online essay, "by the time we got him as a foster child, he had already learned a lifestyle of deceit. . . . My hope was that providing a loving safe home, his life would be spared. . . . Unfortunately, my hopes and prayers were not realized."  Randall, by turns, is voluble and pained at what he says is a media intrusion into his privacy and that of his family. Then he puts his mother -- Jamiel's grandmother -- on the phone to talk about Jamiel's problems. Then Randall gets back on the phone and demands to know: Did Jamiel tell you what his biological mother did for a living?  The reporter replies that Jamiel and Tila describe their biological mother as more child than adult, a thoroughly lost woman of the street.  Randall exhales into the phone, disgusted. "Dealing with Jamiel is like dealing with his biological mother -- you never know when he's playing you," he says. "I will tell you for sure: Jamiel's mother was a prostitute."  "God rest her soul," he adds.  Brick by brick, Randall dismantles the House of Terry. He says Jamiel has been bounced from three colleges and tries to suck up to wealthy family friends. Randall had to bar Tila from his house because, he says, "to quote an AA phrase, her life just became more and more unmanageable."  As for Ebony, she left home as a teenager and became pregnant. But their relationship is good. At least, he says, she's honest.  By the way, Terry adds, you do know that I never officially adopted her?  Since leaving the Terry home, Ebony has become a Muslim, a conversion she attributes -- for better and worse -- to her upbringing.  "We learned that, nine times out of 10, if someone is being persecuted for their religion, there's probably some truth to the religion," Ebony says. "And the Christian community is supposed to stand for forgiveness and charity, but my experience hasn't been entirely positive."  The irony is that Jamiel's essay is quite a tender piece. He describes a loving childhood, writes of his love for his father, and concludes with a vision of future reconciliation. Even Randall, who will be in Washington this Sunday protesting a massive abortion rights rally, acknowledges the essay could have been worse.  "Overall, the article isn't unfair to me," he says. "But that isn't the issue. He prostituted my name."  Hours later, Jamiel is told of his father's counterattack. He sighs. Jamiel acknowledges he's had a troubled time these past few years, with a drunken-driving conviction and some bad checks.  "Dad doesn't mess around with Tomahawks, he sends in the nuclear warheads," Jamiel says. "My father's first and foremost aim is to protect himself. He talks about how I prostitute the family's name, but he's used the fact that he saved my sister from abortion and rescued me from hardship in his speeches and interviews. What's the difference?"  Jamiel pauses and adds: "My father talks about how deceitful I am. But I was 11, 12, 13, 14. How was I supposed to make sense, in a family that didn't talk about it, of what I was feeling? How am I deceitful?"  "I still fight the thought that I'm committing a mortal sin." There's a moment of silence and Jamiel continues. "God knows my heart. Randall Terry doesn't know my heart."   So in a nutshell the children saw Randall for what he truely is, a power hungry man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. He'll bend the rules, change the rules, start up new groups to get his own way.

       urlLink FreeBSD: March-April 2004 Status Report    2004 continues on with wonderful progress. Work continues on locking down the network stack, ACPI made more great strides, an ARM port appeared in the tree, and the FreeBSD 4.10 release cycle wrapped up. Once 4.10 is released, the next big focus will be FreeBSD 5.3. We expect this is be the start of the 5-STABLE branch, meaning that not only will it be stable for production use, it will also be largely feature complete and stable from an internal API standpoint. We expect to release 5.3 in mid-summer, and we encourage everyone to download the latest snapshots from for a preview.  Thanks,  Scott Long   It seems that FreeBSD is making much progress, however, I still have my doubts on whether they can deliver on their promise considering what DragonflyBSD have to offer in regards to their alternative way of scaling *BSD.

      Rather quiet today, however, I thought I might as well post some information on the progress of  urlLink dragonflybsd.org :  Sun 2 May 2004 - NEWTOKENs replace old tokens. The new token abstraction provides a serialization mechanism that persists across blocking conditions. This is not a lock, but more like an MP-capable SPL, in that if you block you will lose serialization but then regain it when you wakeup again. This means that newtokens can be used for serialization without having to make lower level subsystems aware of tokens held by higher level subsystems in the call stack. This represents a huge simplification over the FreeBSD-5 mutex model.  - Support added for the Silicon Image SATA controller.  - DragonFly now supports 16 partitions per slice (up from 8).  - Wildcarded sockets have been split from the TCP/UDP connection hash table, and the listen table is now replicated across cpus for lockless access.  - UDP sendto() without a connect no longer needs to make a temporary connect inside the kernel, greatly improving UDP performance in this case.  - NFS performance has been greatly improved.  - Fix some major bugs in the USB/SIM code, greatly improving the reliability of USB disk keys and related devices.  - NEWCARD has been brought in from FreeBSD-5.  - A bunch of userland scheduler performance issues have been fixed.  - Major syscall procedural separation has been completed, separating the user interfacing portion of a syscall from the in-kernel core support, allowing the core support functions to be directly called from emulation code instead of using the stackgap junk.  - An optimized MMX and XMM kernel bcopy has been implemented and tested. Most of i386/i386/support.s has been rewritten and a number of FP races in that and npxdna() have been closed.  - Brought in the SFBUF facility from FreeBSD-5, including all of Alan Cox's (the FBsd Alan Cox) improvements, plus additional improvements for cpu-localized invlpg calls (and the ability to avoid such calls when they aren't needed).  - A major PIPE code revamp has occured, augmenting the SFBUF direct-copy feature with a linear map. Peak standard pipe throughput with 32KB buffers on an AMD64 3200+ now exceeds 4GBytes/sec.  - Implement XIO, which is a multi-page buffer wrapper for SFBUFs and will eventually replace linear buffer management in the buffer cache as well as provide linear buffer mappings for other parts of the system.  - Added a localized cpu pmap_qenter() called pmap_qenter2() which is capable of maintaining a cpumask, to avoid unnecessary invlpg's on target-side linear maps. It is currently used by the PIPE code and the CAPS code.  - Joerg has brought in most of the KOBJ extensions from FreeBSD-5.  - Major continuing work by Jeff on the threading and partitioningl of the network stack. Nearly the whole stack is now theoretically MP safe, with only a few niggling issues before we can actually start turning off the MP lock.  - The last major element of the LWKT messaging system, lwkt_abortmsg() support, is now in place. Also it is now possible to wait on a port with PCATCH.  - Hiten has revamped the TCP protocol statistics, making them per-cpu along the same lines that we have made vmstats per-cpu.  propolice has been turned on by default in GCC3.  - CAPS (DragonFly userland IPC messaging) has been revamped to use SFBUFs.  acpica5 now compiles, still needs testing.  - SYSTIMERS added, replacing the original hardclock(), statclock(), and other clocks, and is now used as a basis for timing in the system. SYSTIMERS provide a fine-grained, MP-capable, cpu-localizable and distributable timer interrupt abstraction.  - Fix RTC write-back issues that were preventing 'ntpdate' changes from being written to the RTC in certain cases.  - Finish most of the namecache topology work. We no longer need the v_dd and v_ddid junk. The namecache topology is almost ready for the next major step, which will be namespace locking via namecache rather then via vnode locks.  - Add ENOENT caching for NFS, greatly reducing the network overhead (by a factor of 5x!!!) required to support things like buildworld's using an NFS-mounted /usr/src.  - Jeff has added predicate messaging requests to the network subsystem, which allows us to convert situations which normally block, like connect(), to use LWKT messages.  - Lots of style cleanups, primarily by Chris Pressey.   From the progress made so far, it looks like dragonflybsd will pull itself ahead of FreeBSD in terms of reaching that mecca of having a fine grained kernel. Lets hope that by the end of this year we'll have a "complete" DragonflyBSD in 1.0 form for the great unwashed to use ;-)

       urlLink http://www.vanderbilthustler.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2004/02/10/402847d83ea3e   "Haley admitted that reparative therapy has not worked for everyone and that he is still tempted by homosexuality."  What the body is saying, "Haley you f*cking idiot, you're gay, get over it, get out of that sham marriage and for Christ sake, act normal for once!". He is homosexual, always been homosexual and will remain homosexual for the rest of his life. He can continue banging his wife whilst claiming that he is "satisfied" because he has a couple of offspring, but he knows he is living a lie.  I'll bet my bottom dollar that they've had sex probably 3 times in their whole "marriage" with Haley running off to have a cold shower after every experience.  The humorous part:  "Reparative therapy can include exploring masculine and feminine identities, uncovering childhood trauma and abuse, attempting cognitive reframing, medication and exploiting fears of sexually transmitted diseases or eternal damnation, said Daniel Helminiak, professor of psychology at the University of West Georgia."  Great, when all else fails, and they can't ram roles down the victims throats, claim someone has touched their penis, or blamed a lack of a father, why not simply scream at them for hours on end about a fictional damnation?! great, people wanted that treatment they would tune into the 700 Club.

      Here is another fine example of that Christian "love" posted via the feedback link on  05.10.04 - 11:47 pm:  "You are very rude, Kaiwai! In the first place, "redneck" is a racist, classist, and inflammatory term. You're every bit as fascistic as you claim True Christians are. And how DARE you make fun of the Holy Bible! Most editions have over 1,200 pages - and very little of it was written by sheep herders. Moses was reared as an Egyptian prince, Joshua was a military general, David and Solomon were kings, Isaiah and Jeremiah were prophets, and Luke was a healer. One day you'll wish you'd taken the time to get to know the Lord and His Holy Book a bit better. Unfortunately for you, you'll be stewing in a crater of bubbling lava in the darkest depths of homo hell by then. I urge you in the Name of Christ Jesus to repent now and put your evil ways behind you forever. Pray that God will take the bitterness and scorn out of your filthy black heart and make you clean. Only then can you know the Truth - never before.  Sister Lurlean Tucker Who used to pray for you!"  This poor delusioned little lady now would like to rant and rave over her nice little book. The problem is, I don't actually care and most of the world doesn't care either. Maybe if she went to a private shool, that fire and individuality would have been crushed out of her with in the first few years.

      Just on the internet and reading the newsgroups; here is another fine example of the Bible Belt proving that it is a bunch of loonies:  "So, the current debate among local churches here is whether or not they should challenge the "non-biblical theory" (their words) that the earth is round. Several local bible scholars are insisting that the earth is flat -- because -- when "Jesus" was "tempted by Satan," Satan took Jesus up in a high tower where, according to the bible, Jesus could see "all the kingdoms of the earth."  Now, if the earth is round, how could Jesus have seen to the other side?  Therefore, the earth is flat because that's the only way he could have seen all the kingdoms of the earth."

        urlLink Intel stops clock-speed chip names    "Members of the new processor family, originally expected earlier this year, will be named according to a system that de-emphasizes clock speed. Plus, it releases a new notebook chip, Dothan."   Have Intel finally realised that having a pipeline that stretches from the moon and back could possibly causing problems in the performance department. Maybe what Intel should do is something revolutionary; how about getting their processors to work more efficiently, yes, I know, that would be a miracle. The fact that they'll actually have to push something more tangible than the "well, this CPU is 5Ghz!".

       urlLink Linux: 2.6.6 Released   Linux creator Linus Torvalds announced the release of the 2.6.6 stable kernel. A number of notable additions found their way into the mainline 2.6 kernel during this development cycle, including Jens Axboe's laptop mode [story] and the completely fair queueing (CFQ) I/O scheduler [story], support for a non-executable stack on a number of architectures, several patches laying the groundwork for object-based reverse mapping, and 4KB kernel stacks for the i386 architecture reducing the kernel's per process overhead. Since 2.6.6-rc3 [story], Linus highlights the following changes:      "NTFS, XFS, FAT and CIFS updates. IDE cache-flush at shutdown fixes. ppc, sparc, s390 and ARM updates (and a few x86-64 fixes)."

      MacNN: Freescale announces 3GHz+ G4 replacements  "Freescale Semiconductor, Motorola's wholly-owned semiconductor subsidiary, today announced its new e600 and e700 PowerPC cores. The 32-bit e600 platform is intended as a replacement for the G4 and will scale beyond 2GHz. Like the G4, the e600 is designed to issue for instructions per clock cycle into eleven independent execution units and will feature Freescale's 128-bit AltiVec vector processing technology. The e700 is a next-generation 32/64-bit PowerPC platform that will be able to scale beyond 3GHz. No additional details regarding the e700 or timeframes for the e600 or e700 were disclosed, although an updated PowerPC roadmap is available (PDF). Curiously, the 1.5GHz PowerPC 7447A processor Apple is using in its latest PowerBooks is missing. It's also unknown whether Apple will seek to use e600/e700 processors in its future products." -  urlLink Motorola Documentation   Could this mean that finally we'll see faster eMac's/iMacs around the corner?

After watching the footage, its little wonder why the many in the middle east don't trust the US; oh, and if the administration think that a bit of smoozing on television will help their propaganda wars, then they must be really out to lunch. It make work for Joe Block head, the US Joe Average, but believe me, all the actions have done is re-enforced the negative views already held by the vast majority of those living in the middle east.

      Study, study, study and more bloody study! ;-) oh well, can't get any worse. Got Project Management Classes tonight, submitting the risk analysis, lets hope that the project leader has been able to print the document out or otherwise we'll be in deep excriment ;-)  Just gradually checking through the posts from alt.politics.homosexuality on groups.google.com and it is funny to see the number of, well, "confused" persons out there who still think being gay is a choice.  Then, what do I expect when a post spans accross the religious nut groups which brings in every crucifix waving, bible thumping, "praise the lard!" screaming persons to throw their 5cents worth into the discussion.

Sorting between the one-hit-wonder trolls, the Christian Fundamentalists with IQ's that would make an Irish Setter look intelligent and then there are those of us who hang around, add a some-what valid contribution and see juvinile some behave when they have a poster who is mature enough not to sound like a 14 year old.

      Some great news; I don't make great comments about banks, especially those located in Australia, but believe me, after moving from ANZ in disgust in there service, more precisely, there lack of, I've had nothing but great customer support from the Bendigo Bank.  Now, I'm in now way affiliated, associated or own any shares in this bank, but what I can say is you're Australia and pissed off to the max for paying fees for "service" that you never actually see being delivered, I suggest one of two things, check out your local credit union or join up to Bendigo Bank.  If I decide to move back to New Zealand at the end of this year, ordinarily I would have gone back to National, however, since Lloyds Bank of England sold it off to some Australian jokers, their service has gone from great to average then to, "If they were running an emergency department in a hospital, every patient would die".  Well, if worse comes to worse, I'll have either go to either HSBC or Kiwi Bank; which is the old "Post Bank" from days gone by; lets hope the Tories are voted back in under the title of "lets sell every bloody thing we have".

My take: great improvements to the browser, however, what I am looking forward to is the completion of the nslTheme so that widgets used in forms are native, in otherwords, when I'm on MacOS, the widgets are Aqua, *NIX they're GTK2 etc. etc.

More than 20 years old, the BIOS (Basic Input-Output System) is the oldest software technology in PC platforms. Intel says its firmware Foundation code, a result of a project codenamed Tiano, 'provides that the successor to the BIOS will be based on up-to-date software technology.' The Foundation code is designed to be extended with new features and services, such as improved platform manageability, serviceability, and administrative interfaces which are too complex to implement in the old BIOS environment, according to Intel."

      SUN Microsystems is about to release a new version of their JDS Desktop;  What is holding JDS back isn't necessarily Linux but the fact that SUN has done nothing about dire shortage of third party software vendors for the desktop.  There are a HUGE number of companies out there who would jump ship in a minute for a JDS solution IF they could get their "mission critical" applications on JDS. I'm sorry, but if SUN want the customers, the customers require the software, no software, no customers, its just that simple.  Want to solve the problem? go to the vendors and ask, "how much to port this application natively to JDS", find out the price, and the cut the software vendor a cheque! Once you get a handful of vendors producing, more vendors will come on board volunteerily because they don't want to feel like they've missed out on the "next big thing".  Its about creating momentum, but unfortunately SUN just doesn't get it, and never has, and never will.

One thing I would suggest, don't use up2date, it is, quite frankly, a buggy POS should never have seen the light of day; who ever wrote it needs a public flogging due to the time wasted on my behalf trying to download patches only to find the bloody thing stops working halfway through a download.  What is the alternative? edit /etc/yum.conf and change the mirror to something close, in mycase I used planetmirror.com, drop down to command line, log in as root, and run yum update, that will update the list of available packages and start downloading those files that can be updated.

      Yeah, back again, nice to see that Microsoft is finally going to give back their profits via dividends. I would purchase some shares if they weren't so over valued. Yeap, you've heard it, Microsofts shares are over valued, how can a business justify a share price of $30+ when the profits just don't add up?     Maybe its just me, but I subscribe to the old fashioned purchasing shares for long term investment rather than this modern day gambling like stock exchange situation where there is rapid swings of $5.

      Ok, just a little bored right now and thinking "what would I do if I ran SUN Microsystems", here it is:    First of all, the cost of maintaining SPARC makes little or no-sense considering how the competition are able to spread the costs via partnerships and shear volume. The best move for SUN would be for all SPARC vendors to stop working on their own interation of the SPARC chip, and instead create a joint SPARC development corporation with SUN and Fujitsu holding the majority share.    What this will allow is for one centre of development of SPARC rather than the current situation now where there is a duplication of development; SUN working on UltraSPARC, Fujistu working on SPARC64 etc. etc. It makes no-sense, and the problem is compounded by the fact that SUN is unwilling to unhitch itself from Texas Instruments.    Wake up SUN, there is NOTHING special about Texas Instruments; its just another foundry that is bleeding your dry. Send them a message, and get other vendors into the competition. With the joint development centre, coupled with a large array of foundaries; from TSMC, UMC, IBM, Texas Instruments and the numerous ones that pop up in the last few years esp in China, the competition will be fierce and you as a hardware vendor will be able to source your CPU's at around the same costs at Dell and IBM does from AMD/Intel.    As for the assembly of the machines, all that should be moved to China; no exceptions. America is still one of the most expensive places to conduct business, along with the UK, so why on gods green earth would any sane human setup mundane production plants in those countries? Assembling a server or workstation is like a lego kit, put the pieces together, test it, then ship it, hardly rocket science material.    As for the product line up, I would focus on making Opteron for the low end and SPARC64 for the high end. From 1x up to 8x CPU, Opteron, for both workstation and servers; all pre-loaded with Solaris (enhancements to Solaris mentioned in a later paragraph) and the complete Java Enterprise System Stack; free for one year - hook the customers in, get them addicted to SUN solutions and start raking in the cash. It is like a drug dealer, give the first hit for free and watch them come back for more.    For the high end, that is >8, SPARC64 will be the dominating product, along with Solaris and the Java Enterprise Software stack, and possibly throwing a database ontop of it; I have a personal bias towards Sybase, mainly because Oracle makes  ANY  system seem crap on the benchmarks. I don't know what Oracle does but it appears they attach a 2 tonne weight to the code behind Oracle because Sybase flies on both Opteron and SPARC when running Solaris.    Solaris needs to be improved, bought kicking and screaming into 2004. It is no longer acceptable having to read 4 pages, edit 15 files and reboot a couple of services just to get a damn non-postscript printer working. The GNU/Linux community understand that, why haven't SUN? why have SUN insisted on sticking with their up-turned-nosed, snobby elitist attitude of "only those who accept unbarable pain are worthy of using Solaris!"?    The fact is, Solaris is a great operating system and would work great both on Opteron workstations and servers, but what is holding it back is the polish that admins come to expect from operating systems. The ability to setup and install things without needing to be a rocket scientist, the ability to simply install hardware without fearing to whether the hardware is supported or if it is supported, you have to stuff around with setting up device nodes; believe me, I simply gave up when I wanted to add a hard disk, reinstalled the whole Solaris environment because quite frankly I couldn't be bothered dicking around with setting up xyz, modified zyx etc. etc. It should just work, detect, notify and suggest a course of action.    All these problems  CAN  be corrected by first of all removing that ugly, bloated, slow and user-unfriendly SDM and replace it with a nice, heavily integrated GTK/GNOME based desktop. From the X-Server up, the end user should NEVER need to touch the CLI unless they want to. CLI usage should  NOT  be a requirement to get things done, it should be an option, just like the GUI.    The end user should able to ask, "should I setup via GUI or CLI" rather than "well, I'll  HAVE TO  use the CLI because there are no GUI tools", the current situation with Solaris is that it isn't the case. The fact is, people are still forced to use the CLI, still forced to dick around with many things to get a simple thing to work; read and repeat; too much dicking around with files equals higher likely hood of error.    I hardly see it as untoward for SUN to sit down and make GTK/GNOME tools that will enable Joe or Jane Administrator setup a server without fuss; want to setup a firewall? then double click on the connection configuration and attach a firewall plugin to the particular connection. Want to use OpenLDAP for NFS, then install OpenLDAP, open up NFS configuration, plugin the LDAP module to NFS and configure.    That is how it  SHOULD  work, not this over the top, convoluted journey into the mythical realms into the spooky part of the UNIX system.    Ok, so we've covered the Solaris and hardware, how about third party software? easy, Mc Nealy, wake up, you have $7billion in cash, get off your ass massager, head down the road, may Mr Adobe, Mr Macromedia, Mr Real Networks, Mr Sybase, Mr 4D, Mr Mainsoft, Mr Corel, Mr Maya, and ask, "how much will it cost to port your applications to Solaris/Opteron", find out the price, and cut them a blasted cheque! is it really that hard to comprehend.    More software plus better hardware plus improved operating system will result in more converts. More converts equal more customers which equal profit. Even for a MBA challenged CEO like McNealy, the numbers are easy to crunch.    The biggest weakness for SUN Microsystems has always been marketing; as I've said previous, SUN is like Digital, a company run by engineers. Bless their cotton socks, engineers are great when it comes to their field of expertise but when it comes to the sales/marketing side, that is, the touchy-touchy feely-feely side of the business, engineers are the last folk you'd call on to hype a product or service.    I personally would run the department myself, knowing what should be done, however, advice to SUN, get rid of who ever is in charge, and someone better. Hype, market, promote and pander. That is what is required. You not only need to tell the local IS/IT geeks that SUN is good but also pander to the technology challenged PHB's. Hype, and it requires using buzz words etc. use them.    Microsofts main key strength is this; they promote, but they promote in the right way. The customers who make decisions aren't looking at IT magazines or sites like slashdot.org or linuxworld, what they're looking at are things like Business Week, Economist or the local newspaper. That is where you aim the advertising. There is no use advertising in things which will benefit you in no way.    Also, when you  DO  win a contract, hype it! document the situation, how much money the customer saved, use that information in future advertising, create promotions around that particular customers experience when targeting that particular market when marketing the solutions.    Customers will be able to relate their business to the achievement of another, and thus, if they see "that customer took a risk, and it paid off", they'll be less hesitant in taking up the challenge to employ SUN Microsystems to improve the companies infrastructure.    So in summary, SUN Microsystems, for as much as its detractors would love to make out, isn't up shit creek with a teaspoon. Sure, they have some management problems, and the problems are fixable, what  IS  the problem are institutional investors in the "old boys club", the corrupt you scratch my back if I scratch yours, nothing more than incestious inbreading which result in incompetant CEO's taking change, running a business into the ground then running off into the sun set with a golden handshake.    That is the problem with SUN, but it is unfortunate that me (no, I'm not joking) could not be given the opportunity. In a true Ameritocracy, the best CEO would make it to the top, not the one with connections, it seems that the one with connections is not only running SUN but running it into the ground faster than lemming off a cliff.

      Oh well, just reading some news today, it seems that SUN is doing yet another "opensource" pre-release claiming that it will one day opensource J2EE. Lets put it this way, Cuba will become a free and democratic country before SUN stops stuffing around and finally walks the talk.    Mind you, funny news, some MOSAF spies were found to have been trying to purchase a New Zealand passport; 6 months in the slammer and Israel completely washing their hands of the situation.    Oh, from what I've heard, the senate has passed the freetrade agreement with the United States; before you yanks get all excited, the amount of access to the US market is so pittifully pathetic, it clearly sits in the US favour, but then again, we're talking about little Johnny Howard and the Liberal party; the official "conga line of suck holes" to the US.    Anyway, looking forward to that laptop arriving on Monday/Tuesday next week, and getting back to study the week after; hopefully everything will go alright and there will be a job available when I get back to New Zealand.

      Yeah! Just finished restoring my Mac and PC to a nice clean state, if you were wondering, here is the story.    I started fiddling around with system files (big no-no) along with the pre_binding and other things, big mistake, the net result was a computer that made my hobbling around the house look fast. On the PC front, I as muddling around with Solaris for a while, but due to its, well, "sluggishness" (thats the nicest I can be with it), I moved to FreeBSD, but that was just as bad, DRI doesn't work so the net result was a rather slow PC.    So I did a big back up/clean up, re-installed MacOS 10.3 along with all the necessary grab bag of updates - thank goodness I saved them on a CD. On the PC I re-installed Windows 2000. Sure, it doesn't set the world alight in regards to performance, however, it still more responsive than FreeBSD on the same machine.    Oh, and with that, I moved to Firebird for both the PC and Mac; 0.9.2 on the PC and 0.9.1 on the Mac, apparently the changes made for 0.9.2 are only valid for Windows users; then again, maybe they've still got to build it?    Anyway, the cool part about moving from Safari to Firefox is now there isn't this weird problem I was having with blogger.com; I assume it has something to do with features unsupported by Safari, and with that being said, there are some cool features in the article editing window like changing the font type, bullet and number lists, paragraph styles. It is now like using a wordprocessor, which is a lot more user friendly.

      Hi, sorry about the big delay since my last post; some good and bad things happened:     Bad things:        Failed three subjects, UNIX, Network Admin and Hardware; Hardware I failed due to a *really* stupid mistake during the practical examination - I kept my anti-static strapped hooked up to the computer whilst it was turned on; apparently that is a big no no, UNIX I failed because it is now official, I suck a programming.         As for Network Admin, I admit, I really suck at how things are done in Windows. I am a UNIX man through and through, and the terms are so wacky and weird, it kinda confusing, however, I now, after reading and translating into UNIX language ;-) I now understand what some of the stuff means.         btw, ever notice that Active Directory is more complicated than it needs to be? is it really necessary to have all those buzzwords? why not make it nice 'n easy(tm) like NDS or OpenLDAP?         On Friday last week, on the way to the gym I was hit by a car, head on, massive cut in my leg, very sore all over. It seems bad luck for me has an irotic twist; I had just finished fixing the breaks on my bike, I was on the way to the gym, the driver of the car is doctor and the accident occured 50 metres outside a hospital, oh, and interesting enough, the breaks failed on my bike which didn't exactly help me in the accident.       Good things:        Bought a nice  urlLink Apple iBook Laptop  second hand/refubished along with extra memory to bring it up to 320MB RAM. It should run MacOS X quite nicely, however, if not, I can always wait till NetBSD 2.0 is released, which IIRC has a really awsome new threading model based on schedule activations (which is what KSE from FreeBSD is based on). About the only downside, however, is that NetBSD doesn't support the internal modem, which doesn't really matter considering I'll throw it onto my little network.

      Ok, here are some intereting links for today:  Information Technology - Mac   urlLink Apple releases Xcode 1.5   Apple has released Xcode 1.5, an update to its set of developer tools for Mac OS X. According to the release notes, the update includes "an enhanced version of the Xcode IDE with enhanced features and improvements to the user experience, speed, and the build system," including: Dead-code stripping; remote debugging; gcc 3.3 improvments for speed and -fast robustness; code completion for Java and AppleScript; subversion source-code control system support; native build system support for AppleScript; an enhanced debugger with memory and global browsers, as well as the ability to display file static variables; and faster editor performance. Apple said it can be used to upgrade any existing installation of Xcode 1.x. Version 1.5 is a full CD disk image available from the  urlLink ADC Download site     urlLink Development continues on 10.3.5 Client & Server    As news regarding Mac OS X 10.3.5 continues to accumulate at the rate Apple releases newer builds to developers (see our notes regarding 7M30, posted this week, below), little about Mac OS X 10.3.5 Server has trickled out.

      Just a little five cents on the whole Kerry thing, great speech, however, one must remember, his whole, "I'm John Kerry, and I'm ready for duty" could only happen in the US, any other country there would have been fits of laughter from every corner of the room, just as there is when GWB speaks and mangles his words which would make a drunk irish man half understandable.  Anyway, I'd love to see GWB taken to the cleaners, but if there is a win, it will be by a slim margin; too bad, nothing would please me more than seeing GWB and his right wing cronies get taken to the cleaners and see a decent centre left block emerge in the US which has the balls to crush the voice of the extreme religious right by ensuring that there is a decent education system which would stave the religious right of blind ignorant followers who drool over GWB like straight men looking at a porno with Jemma Jameson.
