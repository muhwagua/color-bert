        note:      A)  So we should have two hard copies, 1) to give to them to match the color and to make the screen, and 2) to show them exactly where and size that we want it.  and digital files just for fun.    B)  We should also separate the item into piles ahead of time so we're not doing it at the store.    C)  Inventory, we should also keep track of what shirts we're printing into what graphics.

        Rules & Regulations:   one item per person per color without graphics.  If the item you want is of graphic, then you get to pick one per graphic.  regardless of color.    so this case of my 2 asphalt shirt, I need to put one "back in" for the graphic.  that sounds okay right?  and makes sense?  so everyone gets one without graphic, and one with.  I gave my sister one of the pink, since she funded the first purchase.  that should also be a rule, who ever funds the purchase besides us, should be able to get their pick of the items, like the same rules apply for them for that order...  on a side note, I really like the L/S sheer shirts, it's really comfy, and the sleeve length is long how I like it.

       orginally we thought of using the asphalt for the CMG, but if you think that it won't go well on that, then perhaps we should use it on the organic tanks that we're going to purchase on wednesday.  what color for the asphalt then?  would white work?  would it be hard for the graphic people to turn it white and back ground asphalt?  the psd files transfered into tiff files when i save them on my computer it should be okay right?  I really want to just buy the screen printer now, perhaps we should call it and ask about its financing...I've got about $1000 credit that I can charge...ergh!  where's all my money??

       *total for 2nd merch order $477.60 *Half of that is $238.80.  Mary pays half, Vicky pays half.   I'm also thinking that since I have the money right now, i should get the web service, and not just the domain...but...I need to survive the month of March, and we haven't even started March yet, and I'm poor again...if I had no debt, then I wouldn't have to pay for that...I could just spend more freely...kinda...i hate money.

       i was about to write this on the vickyhsu blog, but its a business thing so im writing here. last night mary asked me some questions then i got all ambitious and stayed up too late (since i had to work at 7 today) finally doing our business office stuff. this is what i did: -itemized the expenses so far. so far is just the shirts, the website fee, and office supplies for me and mary -minutes/a timeline for our business. i only got thru january but ill finish today. its a good thing we have blogs and diaries and planners otherwise we'd never remember anything. -made files for everything 1. expenses (office supplies and AA) 2. suppliers (so far just AA)  today i will complete the minutes/timeline and email them to u to look over

       look at what i found through blog advertisments...   urlLink woven label and hang tags.   I know you probably won't see this until after the meeting, but i thought I'd put it here right now.  I think i'll go with them for right now, cuz well it's "local" and well...yeah like that.  i know there are more, but i just like this one...what do you guys think?

       my brother's explanation of the difference between palm os and miscrosoft (pocket pc): palm os is more like a pda, for notes, schedule info, like a day planner. pocket pc has more pc functions, like a mini laptop, hence its name pocket pc.   so it depends on what you want. but at their most basic levels/quality is the same. another factor: more functions=more expensive. pocket pc's generally cost more. so decide what you want to use it for and then you'll know which one to get.  "how to buy a pda" http://www.pcworld.com/howto/bguide/0,guid,11,page,1,00.asp  "buying guide : handhelds" more comprehensive.. http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,4134,00.asp

       okay i know I said that I didn't want to be front woman of our operations, like with the name, but you know that store B.Luu, that's her name, and that's her store...so maybe it'll be okay...  Okay so until the next time, I'm fine with MLee...  shall look through the phone book, the chinese phone book for the hang tag and woven labels...

        let's have a meeting all 3 of us soon...  heres the skinny on palms:  the main thing is the operatiing system 1. microsoft or 2. palm os  the only important thing is that all 3 of us agree on the software. then we can choose whichever palm we want for ourselves. i kinda want to go with the palm os but it doesn do Word or Excel or Outlook. but is that important?? i dont know

        urlLink okay these are cute, but selling for $37.00?? I'm not sure that I'd pay this much for it, but I suppose if I wanted this shirt I'd pay this much for it...    urlLink I also like the gray and the pink together.  Maybe not the design, but I like the colors together...like how Vicks likes the Asphalt and that blue...    urlLink I really like the lime/pink polo...am i lame or what?...oh! OUTKAST won album of the year, I suppose since they performed twice that means they are going to win...anyway I want to make polos...   OKay I see these people as competition, but not really, everyone's got enough money to spend, and the girls we're targeting will still buy the items even if they've got no money...let's send in our stuff to Girlshop when we get the merch made.

       I saw the apparel label as well, but I wasn't sure where they were located, and their forms were TOO technical for me.  I mean, I'm not really sure what I want on the woven label, perhaps we should talk about that.    I thought we'd have the lamb logo, and the Mlee, inc.  and what else?  what colors?  Asphalt color for the lamb logo, and the Mlee, inc.  Simple in colors!  and about how big do we want it?  I suppose for the underwear it should just be Mlee, Inc.  Would that be too weird?  Or, should we just have the logo in a tiny form.  We should just have the logo on then on the side, it would say Mlee, Inc.?  But then bigger lable we could have a bigger logo, and the Mlee, Inc under.  what do you guys think?  I like the namesake one, only cuz it was easier to navigate around.  and i kinda like that it's iron on, but the logo custome made ones aren't iron on, we'd have to get someone to sew it...another step.  argh.  Maybe the embrodiery place will just have that, and they can sew it on as well...perhaps we should design some, by we i just mean esther, and then go to the places around our casas and ask if they can design and sew it on at the same time...that would be less time.  damn, this project is turning into a bigger and bigger.  Like I never knew there was so much I needed to think about.  and I didn't know there was so much additional than the shirts and what not...this is hard...argh.  Hang tags, woven labels...what else is there??  what else am i missing?  I'm tempted to say we should just forget the labels, but it's like a mark.  i just never thought about it that way that's all.  I want someone else to research and developing...and someone supply me with some money...my head hurts from all the thinking.  yay you're on!!!

       yay. i'm on.   ne way, did you call any other label places?   http://www.namemaker.com/customwoven.asp  http://www.clothing-label.com/index.htm  http://www.clothinglabels.com/index.asp if we wanted high quality, this place seems good. they seem to know how to work with text as images rather than just word processor text.. but they've got names like oscar de la renta, and hangtags for calvin klein, nordtsroms.  p.s. i was thinking that i saw the classic girl labels before and i figured out where. the pajamas pants that thuy got me for christmas are the classic girl brand, with embroidered letters.

       The shop that I went to said any form is okay.  so i'm guessing most likely you should have a digital copy for the sake of the records, but then drawn...only if you've got a scanner or you work on the computer.  I'm not sure how you output your graphics.   Vicks and I also decided to purchase more shirts.    also i think we should ask the people if they test printed so then we can see them...perhaps we should all go as to convey what we wanted...i should find a place that's open on the weekend, or at least saturday...right?  this is a lot harder then i thought...

       I've made "handmade/homemade" hang tags.  I think they are super cute, although not in color...I'm a genius! hehe.   anyway, I think we should use them for at least the first couple of batches, and I guess if this company becomes more busy, then we'll get them printed...sounds good huh?    Vicks picked up the merch today...all we're waiting for is the graphics.  I really wanted to just drop them off at the printers, but I had no designs to drop off...oops.  Vicks, perhaps this Sat. we should go to that embroider that is on gale to see if you like any of their fonts, and figure out how much embroidering would be, if you're up to. Only cuz you had that idea of the font in your head.  Es...would you be able to design by this weekend?  I wonder what format I need to give to the printers?  Like paper format, or Digital okay??  I suppose I should ask huh?  I wish it was closer to my house, that way I can just drop by...but it's not.  anyway those are my business thoughts today.

       Our order will be ready for pick up in three hours...from right now...it's 1:30pm.  But if not today, then anytime tomorrow.  We are so in business now.  the total is $402.00 and here's what I ordered.    3308 red  3308 asphalt 8301 white 8301 red 5300 red 5300 powder pink  all in dozen quantity and M/OS size.  we now also have an customer number with them, and so next time we order, we just give them the customer number.  I sounded dumb when i said that we didn't have a company name, but then later said oh yeah we do...hehe.  Such a retard.    I think my next step is establishing the website, whereyougetthat.com...i shall go browse the internet about that now.    So Vicks you just need to pick up the envelope with the money, which i will get later, and the directions and the order, just so you know what you're getting.  that is all...i think...i'll write later if I find more stuff that's work related.    We've got Merch!

       Yay me!  the first post for Mlee, Inc.  I researched today for business cards.  I figure those I can just go anywhere really, cuz they aren't that expensive.  While I was researching for that, I also found these promotional printing that companies can do, and I thought of other ideas.  as in catalogues...but perhaps we should just do a online catalogue.  do you think we should set up another website fully devoted to it, instead of just using my emdotlee?  we'd call it, whereyougetthat.com?  what do you think?  So as soon as Esther gives me the logo, then we can go ahead and get the business cards printed.  I also looked into Hang tags as well...look at me being productive.    something else i thought of is that perhaps Vicks, i'll just give you the cash, and you go down to their warehouse and pick up the items, because I don't trust the colors that we have, i'd rather go down in person, but I can't cuz they're operating hours are 8-5:30pm.  what do you think?  You'd be up for that, operations??  On Thursday or Wednesday, which ever day you're off.  I'll give you all the info... anyway, if not, then I'll come up with a new plan.  Yep, so away we go!!!

       to vicks: a few question regarding homework...  1...you were actually the one that wanted to pretty/cute shirt, so perhaps you should think of the design...I just wanted letters, they could be arial font, infact they are arial font in my head. 2...why do i have to give esther the bunny sheet? just so she can put in the computer?  but i thought tsw likes hard copies...well i suppose we're supplying both formats.  i'll just bring it along so we can talk about it again...  meeting at wahoos, they let  you just sit there and chat forever or esther's house, or vicks house...my house is out of the question.  meeting whenever is fine...i don't have much to do, esther's got this whole list of things...wednesday? our usual time.

       I'm an "impressive girl?"  awwwww...  like a press kit...??  I don't get the concept oriented design...but I suppose I don't need to, I don't design.    how important of a person?  within the circle of the young hollywood, we're actually closer then it actually seems, we might be able to impress an young hollywood!!  I mean we live near enough to all the hubbub we CAN do it...  i've said this before but I'm going to say it again, Perhaps this first batch of clothing should be used as promotional pieces, not all,  but some, and at the next meeting we'll come up with a mission statement and stuff, and then we'll be in production for impressing very important ONE person.    hehe...I'm an impressive girl...I never thought so...hehe...

       i think we need a mission statement. like what type of clothing we want to sell... what we're all about. and for the name, we should go with somewhat high impact, something people will remember. i always have trouble remembering fallout's name. i guess i'm trying to say that we need a corporate identity... it can shift and evolve over time, but we should start with at least one thing that we want to stand out for.  also, i think the next shirts we make, should be concept oriented, because in terms of sales, if someone is forced to make an intellectual connection in a concept, they will probably remember a design more. (that statement is directed towards me, i suppose). i think once we actually have an audience, the shirts/pants we have will sell just because people will want things from our company, but we have to be somewhat established first. so in order to stand out and to get our name out there, we need at least one  product that is memorable. so that other companies/clients associate our name with a concept/design/identity.   WE JUST NEED TO IMPRESS AT LEAST ONE VERY IMPORTANT PERSON. and i KNOW we can do that, because we're very impressive girls.   the nametags are very nice. very professional and clean. i like a lot. i guess we just need to add a logo. but otherwise they make us look like we know what we are doing.

       guy shirts...but currently we're doing girl shirts.  we need famous girl people.. is boy shirts the way to go?!  I like girl shirts though, cuz I like to be able to wear them...  Isabella works for a magazine, maybe we can give her the two shirts and ask her to wear it for work and "advertise" for us?  She works for Sphere magazine...  were you thinking Giant robot editors?  Cute ideas for shirts...now we just need to learn to silkscreen...i know I know that's always how it is...

       maybe we should send the shirts to magazine editors. u know how they have their free stuff to review... or we can give the shirts to famous people to wear, but there's no guarantee that they'd wear them.  anita started by making shirts for the guys in the band. she would give one out along with her business card, and do a little shpeel and if they wanted to get more, she would start charging. she sells for pretty cheap tho, and so far she has a lot of her shirts going to the phantom planet guys.   WE NEED TO ADVERTISE!   the only other thing is selling to stores. nordstroms? we just take samples to stores and try to sell to them. its less profit, but its more sales, and its fewer people we need to make personal contact with.

       should we open up an ebay store?  we can set our prices at where we're selling them??  or just still do the auctions and just set the price at where we would be willing to part with?  to sell some?  i think it's hard to sell on ebay when you're doing the cheap way...so maybe we should nix that idea, but but but, we're not selling...how do we get the word out???

       eye!   good job on the website... i  do  know how much time it takes to build a website, and that every little thing takes forever. so the hours you slaved over it are definitely appreciated.  and i know you said you didnt want to hear it but there has to be some constructive criticism in order for the best possible product... and i know htis is just a first draft, so i'm gonna point out things that i think need changes from this initial point: i think later on there needs to be a homepage that's seperate from the merchandise page where we have all our stuff. just so that we can add whats new, post updates, links to about the company, contact, distribution, etc. and then from the homepage there could be a link to the main merchandise page that shows all our stuff, like how it is on the homepage right now. but thats a navigational issue.  i like that theres different colors for tanks, pants, and shirts, the only downside being that it might not always complement the color of the clothes that are being posted. we can figure that out later tho. i think the periwinkle blue for the tanks background doesn't work for the shirt colors, but i just dont like that color to begin with, so maybe its just me.  and i think the font needs to be changed. its alright for the headlines, but it doesn't function well for smaller text. just in terms of versitility, courier doesn't work because there are not enough variations for the same font. for example, futura comes in like 10 different varieties of thickness... light, book, medium, bold, heavy, and extra bold. plus italics, expanded and condensed versions of each thickness. which means that you can mix n match any of them, in order to emphasis different things, and you're still allowed uniformity. courier just doesn't have that luxury. i like the typewriter look of courier, in which case american typewriter might be a good second choice. its similar to the look it conveys, but it has those different variations. if you don't have that font, i could probably get you a copy.  otherwise, its great. i'm glad we have a website, and it works and you can buy things from it! which is what we need. so thanks.

        urlLink Before you dismiss my ghetto sample website, i would like everyone to know that I spent forever on this.  i know the pictures are not uniform, nor is the website uniform with the size of the picture, it was hard work.  It's not easy taking the picture, editing & putting it all together with the links...if you've done a website before you'll know that a simple website is not as simple as it seems...that's all...   I know that my websites pretty much look a like, but there doesn't seem to be anyone else volunteering to do it, & we don't have the budget for a paid website..we barely have the money...you know each page takes about half an hour starting from editing and making sure all the links work...argh.  I guess I just don't want to hear criticisms for this because of the hours that I put in.  I already know that it's not professional looking, I'm not a professional web designer, i never claimed to be, and as for my photography, it's hard to have a professional one when all I have to work with is my room & bad lighting, and no equipment.  I don't even have people to work with...I'd like to have a "professional" photo shoot, but it just seems like we don't have the time for that this weekend.  and well I've got no vision for it yet?  Are we possibly doing it in Vick's backyard again?  I guess what I'm trying to say while beating around the bush about it is that I worked hard to me on that "graph" of inventory that I wanted to show people, but then you were like, well your way of doing things are crap & it doesn't matter anyway there's no need for that, and we don't need to see it, you don't keep good records anyway.  Hurt my feelings why don't you...Sorry to hash out at you here...but it just popped up while I was thinking about the website. because you often say blunt truthful things that hurt...sometimes the truth hurts...examples are 1. the website thing which I just talked about.  2. the let's leave the designing to esther...I mean I know I'm not a graphic designer, but you don't have to sit there and bash my good intentions.  I was just excited about making shirts, and I wanted to try them out...argh, basically you're saying that I sucked at picking out letter and placing them...you know I've got not  a lot of selections at Michaels when trying to pick out stick-ons.. I know I'm not a graphic designer, but the shirts that I was fooling around with had nothing to do with the shirts that we were making, I was just having fun, you don't have to squash it.  should I go on with the whole truthful thing...I'll write it on my blog cuz the rest doesn't have anything to do with the company.

       I'm going to make the business cards and hang them with my clothes, since we're going ghetto style with this first batch, i'm just going to go ahead and do it...and I also think we should change our name from mlee, inc. to Bunny bunny...cuz bunny now means love.  and we can use the bunny bunny shirts as our logo shirt as well as a easter shirt...everyone agree say "eye"  "eye"  i like that a lot better then mlee, inc.  to me mlee, inc was a bit lame.  and we can keep the website the same as whereyougetthat.com, but now we can change the logo to the bunny you know THE bunny.  It's cute, i like it.  you like it, you like it, we're all in agreement right?  bunny bunny...yes, no?  answer me damn it!  so here i go making my lame hangtag & holepunching them with my 1/16" hole puncher...if you want lame hangtags for your pile of clothes let me know...if you want to make your own, that's cool...

       So i've sat this for the entire morning & thought about how much we should charge, and I've come up with a formula based on how much it cost for us to produce it, and honestly, I'm not sure that it works that well.  I mean  this formula makes the shirts cost less than the tanks to produce, because the tanks were a bit more than the shirts, it's the material that's why...and so i want to charge like $25.00 a shirt & charge like $20 for the tanks.  but...i'm not sure about that.  I've come up with two numbers.  $22.75-tank $42.25-pants $20.75-shirt  $29.00-tank $54.00-pants $26.00-shirt  the bottom set of number sans tax, the top with tax.

        *logo  - the sheep??  *woven label  - i'm thinking this is just the logo & MLee, Inc.?  *hang tag  - this will be like the tags from Paul Frank, cuz he's my idol, where it says "thanks for buying me," and "logo on the other side."  not necessarily the price tag...so this one we should mass produce professionally. *personality price tag - this is where we put what it means and/or why we made the shirt & the price tag maybe. *business card?? - is esther designing this, & we're also mass producing these?  500 each was Vicky's idea. *Website - WYSIWYG, that means what you see is what you get.  we should work with someone on this...everyone it seems like dabbles a little, no one really does it really good on a regular basis & we're friends with and would spare their time for this...ergh  I bought a 1/16 inch hole puncher & tried it out on the previouslly made cards that I was going to use for the hang tags...I like it, it punches the small holes, but I need to figure out a way to punch it so that it does "injure" the other parts of the paper.    are we doing the hangtags  & Woven labels professional?  i guess that's the question.  I guess if we had the money then we can...I guess it's all up to me then to ask for the money...I need to tell her about my car anyway...it's making the put put put noise.  If we don't get the money I guess we're doing it homemade...If I was artsy I'd homemake everything...  oh for future to think about.  When we set up the website store, we should think of what boxes we're going to buy, or are we just using the prioriety boxes, you get those for free but you have to use their service, and if we sell like out the back of our cars, what bags are we giving people & tissue paper?  i have a catalogue that we can skim through at our next casual meeting.  Guess what?!  We can actually wear a CMG tank to a EBE show!!! OMG! Are we all wearing one??  Technically we can all wear one in a different color, it would make more of an impact...  I feel kinda bad now for making money off of someone's name...I suppose that's the whole point of stardom...I mean I'm sure all those people  that make the money from the tshirts that says i heart so and  so isn't paying residuals to the so and so...right??    Speaking of money, I'm going to sit here & think about how much to charge people.  Hehe, we're like selling shirts in the back of Vicky's car! Haha!!!  Hilarious!    We get the merch tomorrow!!!!!

       hi busy esther...can we have the company logo?  So i can get started on the rubber stamping & the woven label for our shirts?? Pretty please!  and another thing not directed at Esther at all, we need a website...and someone to design it.  I want a brilliant one...anyone know someone brilliant??  Some pay might be involved...since none of us are getting paid...  aisheee...such hard work, and no money...it's a good thing I really want this to fly off the ground, or else I wouldn't work this hard...lets think about  the next printing already...  when did you say you'd be more free est?? Mid march?  aiy busy esther...our company relies on you...there are pros & Cons to that...::hungry::  * time line chronicall...Vicks called the printer, they said samples tomorrow...apparently they print all the shirts in one day, and it takes forever for the screen print making part...but I think if it required changes in the sample, then the due date will be pushed back to next week...I guess this is what we get for perfection...the whites shouldn't be an issue really, I think POST might be the one we really need to look at...colorwise that is...position well that's another issue huh???  I guess we'll see it when we get there...  so to sum it up, 1)esther, company logo, por favor, 2)everybody-let's all think about color & graphics at a meeting something soon, and 3.) brilliant website soon.    thank you everybody!!!  over & out!

It's my personal inventory so I'm not going to report it as business expense.  the t-shirt warehouse was jumping for 9:30am, there was at least 4 people in there that was customers and 2 workers...eh eh, jumping huh?  Who knew this is where people goes to buy cheap shirts?

       Reply to: canisapien@sbcglobal.net Date: 2004-04-01, 12:06PM PST  I'm a professional web designer with my own company. Versed in HTML, flash animation, dreamweaver, photoshop, media editing, logo design, photo enhancement/retouching, etc...   Are you a hairstylist or hip boutique shop that wants a website? I'll design and maintain updates to your site for haircuts, highlights, free or discounted clothing, accessories, shoes, et cetera, voice lessons, or.... what else? Throw me an offer. Of course, I also work for cash.   I specialize in sites for actors, comics, photographers, filmmakers, artists, musicians - basically all creative types - I even have a few corporate clients as well. Preferably seeking someone who wants frequent updates to the site so we can continue to take out services/merchandise in equal exchange, but a one-time site design is okay too.   Email me with terms for your trade, and I'll send you a list of links to sites I have designed and/or maintain, so you can get an idea of my abilities.   This is also a great idea for a gift, if you have something to trade in exchange for a site for a friend, let me know!   Thanks!  Patricia

       okay call me 949 716 4192 tomorrow i just read your email and then i read all of it lol so call me i'm gary and i'll fill you in thanks  "M."   wrote:   Hi,  you've probably gotten many responses regarding your request for help on setting up screen print shop, but I thought I'd throw my 2 cents into the mix.  a little about me, My name is Mary, and I'd love to help out and learn first hand how to set up shop. I work a 9-6 job located in the city of Alhambra, and planning on moving out there to be closer to my work. You might be thinking that is too far, but you're not paying for gas so why does that matter to you. Or else you might be thinking that with these hours, when will I have time to help out? Weekends and Evenings work for me...but if they don't work for you, then should i suggest my friends. One of my friend in particular does not work at a 9-6 job, so she can most likely help out. I also have another friend who is just graduating from school, so she'll probably have free time in the summer to help out. Please consider us, although I'm being quite bold in including them in this letter as I have not really discussed it with them, but I think it should be okay, since we're eager to learn really how to screen print.  Our individuality is as different as night and day and noon time, but as a team, we're really great together. We're fast learners and are quick at flexible in life, yes sometimes we get into weird moods with each other, but we snap out of it.  if you would like to consider me or us as a team please email me as that's the easiest way to contact me.  thanks, and I hope I haven't given you too much information.  Mary

       snacks: special k cereal. i've recently been buying food and then not wanting to eat it later. i bought a baby ruth bar at the yum (haven't had one in a while), but i got to work and didn't want to eat it anymore. thus, it sits in the GSP fridgomatic, beckoning to be eaten. it sits next to its friend the milky way bar.   * i am soooooooo~ bloated. i looked at my boobs today and thought, OMG, these things are way too big. its frightening.  food for thought: what would you do if you married a hottie, and then after a few years he gained a TON of weight? would you be mean and hound him about it or would it be "for better or worse, til death do us part"? lesson to be had: the usual...beauty fades, marry a person for their inside.

       after watching a couple kiss in a movie, mary is quite reliable for saying, in longingwhining voice: "I wanna be kissed~" ...  after which esther proceeds to think in her head "I wanna be kissed~"  sigh.

       any thoughts on boys?   true love = hard to find . vicky would agree with this. she's going through a why is it so hard phase.. her and lan both. recently learned of new information regarding the status of certain unmentionable relationships. interesting to say the least, and quite disconcerting. its only easier for me because i'm practically a veteran, as far as singletons go. 20 years strong, going on 21. i can hear 'em on the sidelines cheering me on.  the other day a guy in my art 300 writing class gave me a kiss (hershey that is) and said this kiss is for you. lame. whats even more lame is that it was actually a hug. =P. and then he proceeded to ask me what was the worst pick up line ever used on me. to which i had no response. i thought real hard and still came up empty. i concluded that guys don't really hit on me. i guess i'm one of those unapproachable asian types. or maybe guys can see that i can see right through them. of course it doesn't help that i ignore stupid come-ons completely.   hahahaha~ here goes (from the junior high days) the crush inspector: who: raphael da silva real quick bio: coworker at graphic services, soon to be a graduate of cal state univ. fullerton, a smile that makes me smile back, and eyes that make me melt. (can you say: esther has a crush?) not dashingly good looking or even tall. but really there is something about him. oh and did i mention he's brazilian? status: he must know that i think he is the most divinely gorgeous thing this side of the country. or not. i'm not such an obvious flirt. but as they say, looks aren't everything. sigh.  so y with the new tid bits about random guys? well in the absence of a love life, i need something to keep myself preoccupied. the rules r simple: look but don't touch. yes thats right the ridiculous ways a pathetic single girl seeks to feed that part of her that needs to be loved by the OTHER gender. better this than dysfunctional dating, i say.

       apparently getting into the viper room when ur one month shy of 21 is not so hard to do.  experienced wonderlove for the first time. no tobey sitings to report. *shrug*  however, i went to the beach with vicks and crystal on friday. huntington. it was perfect beach weather. i must learn to surf. but not this summer too busy traveling. hit list:  for sure: *las vegas  yet to be confirmed: *new york *korea  if i scrape together enough money i can go. maybe my mom'll pitch in. doubtful.

(saw jane from yaim again)  tonight we'll be going to the viper room, apparently its tobey maguire's birthday, and we're gonna try to get in but we doubt we will (21 and over folks)  yesterday we had a very refreshing pr meeting. we learned about setting your mind to things and discussed issues about why pr is not going well.  guess what? BIG NEWS: i won 2nd place in the student art exhibition. i won $125. good deal how should i celebrate? i already bought myself ice cream. i think i'll go to knott's on sat. maybe. we'll see.  on cloud nine,

       accounts of the day a random girl turned twenty one. ok, so my 21st birthday officially blew.. but i figure i have all year to do the stuff i wanna do. and it'll probably be better after everyone else is twenty one as well.  the day started alright, my mom gave me a hundred dollar bill (first birthday present in years) i went to work and vicky stopped by with krispy kreme (thanks vicks!) and then later with lani with presents ("oh my gosh, i love it!") after work, we went to the mall and ate CPK (ate yummy birthday dessert) and met up with cyn (she actually bought clothes) and i bought fun paul frank underwear (not splurging still). we left the mall and went to church (super short service) and we ended at 8 to watch lakers (right). left church and stopped by home (my mom still refuses to trust me) and we met up at vicky's (this is where the night began). i tried on cyn's compact (which i loved and decided to buy later). we took two cars (had a nice long talk with lani). me vicks, cyn, lani and crystal went to the troubadoure ("don't get ur hopes up"), but got stuck outside cuz the show was sold out. ("are you a tourist?") waited around for vicky's adam (she was "hyperventilating") watched lani walk around the back of the troubadoure (through a scary alley) cuz she got mad at vicky (who wouldn't admit she was mad at lani). but lani came back (and i will love her forever for doing so). we left and drove down sunset looking for someplace to eat and drink (shin shin? was closed). vicky kept telling me, "we'll go where YOU wanna go" (but i was trying to find a place that was 18 and over, instead of 21 and over, and still inexpensive, because not everyone had money). but we couldn't just go where i wanted to go, but most of the stuff was either really ritzy, or closed, or looked pretty selective as to who they would let in. it took almost an hour just to get off of sunset (there was mad traffic) and some ambulance was picking up someone from the standard (good thing we didn't go there). so we went to pink's and ate hotdogs and sipped on peach sodas and cokes and diet cokes, and ate chili cheese fries (weird guys were supposedly "stalking" us). vicky talked through her rumply guy confusions with crystal (who really needs to become a shrink). we drove home dead tired (i sang escapar to keep lani from falling asleep).  by the end of the night, non one got hammered, but i was kind of relieved. i'd rather get drunk when everyone else is drunk with me. not that i really even care to get drunk. i like that i got to enjoy being a "young and innocent" for my birthday, cuz even though i said i didn't feel different, i feel older and see my life begining to change. and change is a good thing, but i'm not sure i want to give up my youth so easily. i do, but why rush it.. like i said, i have the whole rest of the year to be 21.  so where am i now? i'm sitting in my brother's apt. in berkeley. i packed a backpack and i left orange county. it was about time for a road trip anyway. i came to pick up my brother, but came early, cuz all i really wanted to do was go snowboarding. so i did. and i'm totally and completely satisfied. it was the last day of the season at alpine and it was perfect. not too many other riders (more mountain for me). it was mostly just the locals and a nice "get your last runs in until next thanksgiving, we're all so happy to be here" kind of atmosphere. we got to know some of them on the lifts, and everyone was very friendly. around lunchtime, people who are done for the day are wearing shorts and drinking beer. my brother was riding on his healing broken leg, so we took it easy down the mountain. on the last run we built a small snowman while chilling  , and we waited for it to get knocked down. and it did and i cheered. then we built a couple more snowmen.. just to leave our mark on the mountain. it was nice just playing on the mountain. we had a couple snowball fights.   we took a nap in a rest area, drove home and relaxed. we bought ingredients for a recipe we found online for tuscan chicken and we made dinner at home. it was very expensive and took lots of time, even though it was under the "30 minute meal" category and the recipe said "difficulty: easy". but it was fun.  its 2 in the aftenoon and my brother is still sleeping. we're gonna get lunch in little while. what i learned this weekend: things don't turn out how you expect them to, and do wut you want, not what you should. it was a good birthday weekend.

       i worked 8 hours today...  anthony wanted to hook me up with richard and/or chad. haha. he said he would hook me up with any of his friends. um... yeah. so, i'm wondering here.. why in the world would he want to hook me up with any guy when i'm all mean to him and frequently pretend not to see him/ignore him in the art department? i dont know. maybe he's got a bunch of friends who're graduating and they need girlfriends before they get out of college? who knows. so like jenk.. i'm sitting here.. wishing there was a little more to life. something a little more than ordinary. and wishing that there was a guy i could just pick and have it turn out that he actually is  the one  after all. but, alas, life is not so simple.    one liners:  "...you are the furriest man alive" - peter writing goodbye to rafael in his graduation poster/card

       ok i just wrote an entire entry about nothing in particular and it got erased cuz i accidentally hit the "blogger" button instead of the post and publish button. great. so here i go again:  i'm sitting here in lab, and we're bout 45 min. into class and theres' no instructor to site. this is so~ the art department. we're supposed to be working on an inclass project, but since i wasn't here last week when everyone else started it, how am i supposed to know wut to do? especially with the instructor m.i.a.? my sentiments exactly.  i came to school today and i completely forgot my purse. but i got hungry and i was like crapolas where can i get free food?... but then i remembered stashing food, so i went down to GSP and beside the trusty fridgomatic, i opened the cabinets and there for me was waiting, a box of kix and a bag of famous amos cookies.  so i'm still not doing ne of the work i'm supposed to be doing.  assignments needing to be worked on: 1. research career or company (3 pages) 2. artwork analysis (1.5 pages) time to revisit old art history papers 3. final comps for 223a 4. speech for art 300 5. life drawing portfolio 6. test in 223c (mon)  i feel sorry for all the people around me who r actually doing this junk. bleh. no ongoings lately.   2 weeks shy of the big 2-1. again i pose the question: what shall we do? eeeh.

       its interesting watching urself growing up... i must say i feel much older than i did this time last year. this past weekend was seriously the Weekend-O-Drama. or actually just realizing stuff that you didn't wanna realize, and confronting things you didn't wanna confront, and even ignoring things that shouldn't be ignored. and i promise you, i did not ask for any of it. maybe i need to un-ask for the drama i had requested previously. maybe this is Part deuce. i love the resolution part of conflict (which unfotunately you can't have sans drama)... things r always better than they were when it all first started.  so i'm still bloated, but now i'm much happier with life. always a plus. school is too easy, not enuf challenge. i've decided to take a double major in advertising. only 24 more units (or minor: 21 units). but it wouldn't add any more years to my plans so why not. maybe i could study abroad somewhere if i can find a good program. i've also decided that grants and scholarships are the way to go. i don't wanna work. but i will ne way becuz i need the experience. after this semester i'll cut the number of hours/week. i can't wait for summer.   motto for this week (same one as every year for the last 15 years of my academic life): i will not burn out... i will not burn out... i will not burn out...  birthday countdown: 16 days to go~ what fun shall we concoct this year? must find a happier place on earth  i talked to tim online.. i haven't talked to that guy in a loooong time. same stuff as usual. he eats lunch with sam on tues and thurs. hehehe. both doing well.  i ran with vicks today. 1.5  how am i gonna spend my summer? school, work, surf, travel? i need to start my research paper...

       i'm still in a state of PMS, but i ran today.. i felt really gross not doing something active, so i drove to the track at FJC. there was a group of about 20 people there. and some of them were in wheelchairs. and some of them had downsyndrome. i talked to one of the adults and she said they were just doing something for the special olympics. they were running relays and cheering each other on and smiling and laughing and being happy for each other. and i thought to myself, if these people can be so happy, whats wrong with me? i don't even have a fraction of the problems they go through. its kind of sad that it takes that kind of scene to help me realize how much i have to be thankful for. i felt like i was guilty running past a couple of guys in wheelchairs. but as i ran the next lap i passed this girl with downsyndrome, sitting on the curb. i looked at her and smiled. and she just smiled back. it was so much more genuine than what you get from the rest of the world. maybe i just need to love other people more to be happier on the inside.

        GLOW = God Loves Our World   the revival sermon was about broken hearts and joyful hearts. lately i've been more broken than joyful. so its good that i went.  some mental sermon notes: when God is your source, how you act and feel isn't dictated by people or circumstances. you don't let a bf or work or other "idols" in life determine how you will feel. even when the world says you should be angry, you choose not to be. instead you choose to stop thinking about yourself for just a sec and bless someone else. a joyful heart is a compassionate heart; a sacrificial heart;  and i don't remember the rest.  the glow video was good. it was refreshing seeing a bunch of hs students doing good things for other people. hyun mentioned that their christian club is actually growing. which is rare, because usually christian clubs start off with a big membership at the beginning of the semester and it dwindle towards april. hyun is very bold. its quite admirable.

       it was christine's last day at work today... i was more sad than i thought i would be. i didn't really know her that well. she got me a mini oragami kit. that was very nice of her. for her going away party they went to b.j.'s for dinner, but i didn't think that'd be much fun since i'm not really friends with my coworkers and i don't drink.  the lunch topic of the day was about drinking. rafael was saying how it doesn't really make sense... its fattening, its taste bad.. blah blah. ray and greg get defensive.. how dare he make us feel bad about drinking? bastardo. (they didn't really say any of that)  i've concluded that greg is way dorky and i can't believe he gets to be a boss of anyone.   seriously. but on the flip side i've decided to give my other coworkers more credit. i'll try to be nicer.   dude, i'm way~ bloated today and all irrated. what is with this torment...30 more  years  of this. sucks. but on the flip side, i guess i should be glad i can have my own babies someday. trying to look on the bright side while i'm PMSing. hm hard to do.

        exerpt from jenk's livejournal ...at the edge of indecision... read on...   subject:  im a loser  mood:  scared.  just now i wrote an e-mail. an e-mail that i know i shouldn't send. so it still sits there waiting for me to push the send button. but there are so many things that could happen with the click of a button. and so now im sitting here pondering whether or not to send it. im scared of what might happen but im also scared of what might NOT happen if i don't. in the end i'll probably end up not sending it. im not ready for anything too dramatic. either way i know that im going to end up feeling yucky inside.. so why take the risk right? seems like a lose/lose situation here. yes definitely. what to do what to do? okay yah.. im not ready for this. maybe in another month. things will never work out. emails can be so dramatic sometimes. okay so im just NOT going to send it.  WHeW okay i cancelled it. geeeez.. wut's wrong with me? that was a close one.. okay time to get ready for my stinky class. i always wake up so early for class but i love it cuz it gives me a chance to relax and wake up before i go. uhhh i have the hugest pimple thingy? no good. okay..

       anthony asked me  what i like in a guy:   1. christian   they have to share not just my beliefs, but my morals and values.  2. ambitious  (direct influence of vicky's)  3. nice , but let me make this perfectly clear: there are two kinds of nice people. those who are nice cuz they're considerate. and those who are pushovers and too wussy to be anything else. obviously, i prefer the former.  4. not repulsive ... i think this is a reasonable quality. he asked me if i would go for someone i thought was repulsive. i said no. my reasoning being that if he had the personality, then i probably wouldn't think he was repulsive because even if he wasn't too good looking he would be more attractive because of that. to be repulsive in my book, would require being not just ugly, but having a terrible personality as well.  5. adroit  new vocabulary word. it means the opposite of being socially inept.  so this is my list so far, in case you were wondering or wanted to apply even. haha. additional "qualifications" to be updated as they come to me.

       another  crush inspector  siting to report  who: "tex" in my art 300 writing class.  real quick bio: wears a cowboy hat *shrug*, hence the nickname. i don't know his real name. maybe michael. he's tall and lean. daily outfit: always wears a leather jacket and jeans and the hat.  status: just another chap to look at. things in commom?: i was born in texas... well i really have nothing in common with him at all. he's only appealing cuz he's so different, but you learn from talking to him that he's quite sweet and more normal than his outfit would suggest. well, that and he has these beautiful blue eyes.   lesson to be learned: don't judge a book by its cover.  i wonder if mary knows who i'm talking about. that hat is pretty hard to miss.

       i had work today... it was interesting.. richard kept telling me that he was my best friend.. and i kept denying him the honor.. i kept telling greg that richard was his best friend. maybe i'll take him up on the offer and make him do things for me. he said he would buy me a mini cooper but somehow i doubt it.  ne whoo, i think i shall resume exercising again. its a good habit, yesterday i went running and i think i got sunburned, except it didn't seem like it .. and i was wearing sunblock too, but i kept peeling.  and i really want to take a trip this summer.. but i don't know where. i'll probably go somewhere with my brother. he's fun to hang out with.  today we were supposed to be a car, but we're putting it off until tmrw or something. i think my dad wanted to buy one soon, cuz he wants me to come home early.. i guess he assumes that i get stuck places? i dunno.. he's weird like that. he's pretty bent on getting another honda it seems. which is fine by me, but i still think the corolla is a better deal. and i would much rather have a mini cooper.  ok thats all.. hope ur doing well in formosa, vicks.. luv ya!

       if i think i used to be a better person than i am now, doesn't that mean i've somehow grown backwards? or shrunk? i dunno. ok so some life skills to work on:  1. be a better listener. make eye contact. don't be distracted while other people are talking 2. take the initiative, don't wait for things to come to you 3. don't be afraid to negotiate for things you deserve (don't really know about this one) 4. be more tolerant 5. learn self-discipline (not the physical kind) 6. stop whining/complaining/blaming others 7. spread positive energy, try to let other people be the best they can be 8. be more patient with short term things 9. be a more clear writer, speaker. don't try so hard to be concise that you miss the main point  i think i used to be all of these at some point, but now i'm not. i don't know wut happened to change these things about me.  just some reminders for me to work on.. its so self helpish.  agh. i need to shleep. where is the sandman?  oh did i mention to anyone yet my dream about raphael? i forgot alot of wut it was about since i first woke up, but basically it was him trying to get my phone number, but instead of just asking me, he had all these elaborate plans of getting it through our coworkers and stuff. or at least thats wut i think it was about. i should've written it down earlier. ok well the important thing is that i had a dream about him. better him than richard. although i've established that richard is a very good listener. not that it really matters. maybe i can babble to him at work about junk that no one else is willing to hear. ok i'm finally tired. time to snooze. yay

       i'm soo~ supposed to be asleep right now but i'm an insomniac and i've been lying in bed for about 3 hours trying to fall asleep.. and since that isn't working for me, i just decided to go online and write in my blogger that i've been ignoring for the last million years or so.   i have to get up early tmrw to go to the DMV to make a new driver's license and get my new paycheck and make a new school id and all that since i freaking LOST my purse. and i should do it early in the morning because things at the DMV and at school seem to run a lot more efficiently when its early. where are my sleeping pills? i tried drinking some wine, but it tasted like rotting feet so i took one sip and poured the rest of the glass down the drain. i don't even want to write about wuts been going on lately cuz everyone else was there with me when things happened so theres really no new news. ..... so i'll just jot those thoughts that keep running through my head whilst i fail to drift into dreamland (fun random thoughts):  summers are always quite reflective, so i've been thinking about where i've been and how far i've come or haven't come since high school and all that junk.. in most of my memories, i was the most naive, clueless girl on the face of the planet.. in other ones i really liked who i was and could have ne thing i wanted. or so i believed. i think i was in general a better person when i was younger.. meaning i used to be nicer and a better listener and a better talker, i wasn't so scared of things, but maybe thats just how everyone is. maybe everyone loses that innocence and eagerness to surrender to other people you trust so much. where does it all go, that trust and purity? does life just keep sucking all of that goodness out of you? i hate locking doors and watching over my shoulder. i hate having to build trust with a new friend or a new guy or even knew coworkers. but i guess on the flip side of the coin, the truth is you just aren't very aware of the reality around you when ur younger. like u should always look both ways before crossing the street. so part of it is because i was sheltered. we all were so some extent. but vicky seems to have been aware of things. i guess when i talk about trust i refer to peers. when your young, you don't really get offended by other people, you just are friends with everyone, and you don't have problems with annoying people. or at least thats how i was. i never cared what ne one looked like or what nationality they were, if they had some disability, or how smart they were, or what clothes they wore. either that or i just never noticed. when did i start caring so much? when did i start judging?  maybe i'll read this later and be really confused. like wut the heck was i talking about? is this how i think late at night when no one is around? right so that was my rambling for the night..i hope everyone is skipping this paragraph, cuz it doesn't make ne sense, even to me...it does actually, but its irrelevant to the blogger world so now ...onto more cohesive thoughts...  since i believe you don't truly know a person unless you know where they've come from, i want people to know who i am, and i probably wont tell you these things cuz they wont come up or i'm too busy talking about, you know, the present day. and i dont think ne one knows that much about where i've come from because you either weren't there or you weren't aware of what i was doing with my life. geez now that i've typed that explanation as to why i'm writing old stories, i don't care to write about them ne more. i'm just gonn start writing nonsense again. whatever.. we'll see where it goes...   so lets talk about esther's non-existent love life. which is more non-existent by choice of GaBdom than anything. and now that i've given my resignation as v.prez of GaB, i'm basically free to mingle among boys that i shunned for the past 4 years. yes it has been that long. if you don't already know wut GaB is, its a super elite club for the broken hearted. (ie: single) only i wasn't really broken hearted when i joined .. just discouraged. and the acronym G.A.B.?  "well, i could tell you, but then i'd have to kill you" and we don't want that. so jen called me up and she was all sad about kenny and i was trying to be supportive and she said her and erica started a club, and would i like to join. i said sure and even though i didn't have a good reason then, looking back there were plenty of reasons to swear off guys: 1. the potential guy pool was dwindling in my life, so it seemed like a good idea to just stop trying before i settled from some lame dorky guy. 2. all my friends had boyfriends or something, and they would call me only when they wanted to hash out their issues with those guys or the guys were hurting their feelings. to me guys had stolen my friends, thus, it made me hate guys even more. 3. that was right before tomo and then after tomo, i was sure i didn't want ne more sadness 4. my parents were way overprotective and i was the girl who couldn't stay out late or go out with boys, so why do it behind their backs and make life more hellish? there was no one worth the trouble, anyway. 5. being the good girl i was, i was sure that any serious relationship with a boy would eventually lead to sex, and i didnt want ne of that, so i made sure to eliminate the gateway. 6. it was fun making up our own club with my friends and making shirts that said GAB. hehe. 7. everyone else was supposed to be as loyal a member of GAB as i was. and were they? i think not!

       hehe yesterday after church we went to red robin and celebrated lani's "birthday" hahahha.. we told the waitress it was her birthday and if they could please do something for her. it was hilarious. she was sooo shocked. haha. after that, there was a laker game party at jdsn's house and it was soooo intense! good game. then we watched ocean's 11. i finally got to see it and its soooo good. its one of those movies that are hard to promote cuz if u show clips or say too much u give away the plot. but it was great.

       i just finished making a homepage like the etranger one that jdsn has.. i hope it works.. it'll be super convenient. i paid all my bills and i feel real good...yay.  today at work, anthony stopped by to say hi and chill. he updated all who were present [me, greg and ray] on how his dating life is. (i think most of us didnt really care)... things didn't work out with lydia, they're still friends, she's too good for him, yada yada.. and then he mentioned how he went clubbing and tried to pick up some girl but then she turned out to be weird. and i'm just thinking.. okay ur exactly the kind of guy that i would AVOID at a club and ur making judgments about other people's weirdness? no. he so needs to feel cool. i wish he would just become convinced that the place he's currently working at is much better and quit graphics services and just leave us all alone. i'm so mean. but he's seriously annoying. i try to be nice, but i still can't stand him much. oh well. maybe i can convince greg to work my schedule around his. so we never have to work together. that'd be great. hehehe .. ok still working on building that tolerance level. hey at least i didnt tear him down today. i was tempted but i'm okay.

       so i went surfing yesterday .. or rather attempted it. it was fun tho. i can see why it would be a good hobby to pursue. i'm glad i have a brother who takes me along on his little excursions and things. vicky didn't touch the water but she still seemed to enjoy the few hours on the sand. my arms are insanely sour right now. i've been stretching the whole stinking day.

        i had a long talk with lani today at lunch   i'll admit it was sudden and unexpected, but i'm really glad that we had the talk. it came about cuz she read my blog on the friends thing. i just explained what i meant by it and why i don't think we connect that well. we're not exactly the kind of friend that the other needs. but things are betterafter the talk. i told her that i would talk to her more about it later, but i think i pretty much laid out most of the issues that were there. in the end we just agreed to be more upfront to each other. we'll see how it goes from there.  i think its interesting how cyn mentions all the stuff that happens to her in her day and how she was feeling when it happened, vicky tends to highlight the important things and adds her commentary, and i just lay out my thoughts, usually without tying it to what i did.

       okay so i was thinking that when i want to make friends with people, or i want to get to know someone better, i usually reveal something personal about me that other people don't know. or i'll tell them a secret. or tell them about the current guy issues... but i realized.. i seriously just don't have any of that stuff. so while it might seem like i'm not telling people  things or that i don't want to tell people things, its just that i don't have THOSE things to talk about. and really most girls just talk about boys and gossip.. which is sad, but its pretty true for the most part. but yea i just dont have either of those things to talk about and most of my friends are around when everything happens so theres no point in retelling stories that they were already a part of.  so all those people that i don't tell things to, its not cuz i don't want to .. thats probably why i need friends who can talk about other things.

        Our Greatest Fear   "Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate.  Our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. it is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. we ask ourselves, 'who am i to be brilliant, talented, fabulous?'  actually, who are you not to be? you are a child of God.  your playing small doesn't serve the world.  there's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.  we were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.  it's not just in some of us, it's in ALL of us.  as we let our own light shine, we unconsiously give other people permission to do the same.  as we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."  - Mary Williamson.

        thoughts on friends:  so i've figured that i'm pretty similar to jane byun in some ways and so i've adopted her as a new friend, cuz i think she could relate to me in ways a lot of girls can't.  i've also decided to drop lani as a friend.. which sounds harsh, but i just can't cope with her and her ways sometimes, and its probably me being intolerant, but i'd just rather not deal with it. i'll be nice to her, but i really don't want to initiate things with her. ie, phone calls, plans, conversations. but i will be nice to her. besides i really don't think she needs me as a friend. i was meaner to her as a "friend" than i will be from now on. so it all works out for everyone.  cynthia is cool. i just don't think we have that much in common. maybe its cuz she has a boyfriend? but i like her the way she is. i want to get to know HER. but we still just don't have that much to talk about, i don't think she likes telling me things.. like about wuts going on. i'm okay with that, cuz i don't really tell her that much stuff either. but nothings really going on.  as for the whole  thinking about guys all the time  thing... its not like i  don't  think about them, its just not as constant and obsessive as it used to be. if girls think about guys all the time, isn't that the same as guys thinking about sex 24/7? and from a christian perspective, aren't you supposed to think about God all the time? thats how i used to be for a long time, i just "talked to God".. the whole pray without ceasing concept. and i think now that i don't pray as much and stuff, i have less to think about. guys add a lot of drama to life. but i don't want drama. sometimes i wish i could just meet the guy i'm supposed to marry, and hurry up and get on with it. cuz really i just want to be married. i really don't wanna shop around, and i'm definitely not about cookies. and i hate the whole dating thing. so i guess i'll start compiling my list. a real list. cuz i think i know wut i want in him now.

       i wanna go surfing tmrw. in the morning...  ok so vicky asked me wut i think about if i don't think about boys. and i remember the days when i used to think about nothing but boys and be completely infatuated for like the whole day, but now its just not like that. i just think about other stuff. normal stuff. that means i've either gone back to the way of thinking before i was preoccupied with boys, or i've just moved on to thinking about life in general. i remember making a conscious decision that i don't want my life to revolve around boys. and it is true, when life isn't consumed by some guy, there's just a lot more feeling and thinking and doing things that doesn't have to do with guys. i just want to be my own person. i think i just have to find a guy that i believe is truly worth all that time and energy and emotion. becuz honestly, i don't believe a lot of guys are.

       right.. so while vicky is off in taiwan, being hot and playing with 18 year old boys, i'm at work, with nothing much to do becuz greg didn't leave me ne projects.. he must've forgotten that i come in. =P wutever.. i don't really care. i'm way tired... this last week i've been sleeping at like 3-4 am ish.. so i'm off my sleep pattern and its way early so i feel all sleep deprived. bleh. ne way, after the pr meeting yesterday me, stacs, janebyun, and lan sat around bonding for like 2 hours. its was quite interesting... it was actually just jane byun that i got to know better, since i never get to hear her intimate secrets about boys she's liked. and we talked about her "i don't wanna get married and have kids" issue. its true wut she says, but i still think people need kids to get them thru stuff, and in the end, it really is the only thing there is.   so lately i've been incredibly bloated and PMSy, so absolutely EVERYTHING irritates me. i felt bad for lani and cyn cuz we went to the beach and it wasn't much fun cuz i didn't feel like talking.. so i was walking in front of them the whole time. or wandering off on the beach. i think next time i'll just take them out seperately. and lani is easier to handle when my brother is there cuz she's more ... normal (?)   so right, everything irratates me and i wish i could just get over it.. =P but i felt better after i ate yesterday, so maybe i just need more food? oooh.. maybe i'm cranky cuz i don't get enough carbs. that makes sense. the PR meeting was good. everything is progressive. and we're actually being in charge of things. *exciting* JDSN seems like he wants to hang out more with us. which is fine by me cuz i have lots of free time. its so funny how he thinks we're all losers. he wants to take us to LA to "show us the town" haha. weird guy. i guess he thinks he's all cool...and we're not. ne way, next saturday we're all going down to SD to hang out. i've never been so thats cool. and jane byun doesn't really go out in SD.   so i've got a bunch of gym partners lined up. jenkim has a membership to 24 hour fitness and i told her i would call her up to work out with her. and jane byun wants to do taibo .. don't know bout that one... but she sounds like she wants to get a membership for a couple of months. sounds good.   oh i've decided i need to do some of my own volunteering. so i'm gonna pick a day, probably tuesday, to go volunteer somewhere once a week. cuz i need to be fulfilled in that way... helping other people. so that i don't feel so selfish all the time.   and my running is going well.. i've increased my jogging distances and i feel really good. i started using those weights and its actually hard for me for the first time in my life. remember vicks when i was all buffed out? no more of that~ its soooo weird. i'm like a little weakling. my brother is working out.. he's been lifting weight and being sore for the past two weeks. he doesn't run ne more.  so i really want to go surfing, especially now that i have so much time on my hands, but i can't really go in the water cuz i sliced my thumb, and it would be really gross to have an infected thumb, so i guess that will just have to wait. theres a girls camp for surfing in SD that guarentees that you'll stand on the board. sounds good, but i hope its not just a bunch of white girls. not that thats so terrible.   ne way i should go find something to do. take some initiative! yay...   i miss vicky!!! there's no cookies w/o complications. there's always some baggage so make sure the guy is worth it! wut am i saying.. i'm supposed to be convincing you that all guys are dogs and that they suck, which most do to a large extent. stay away from casanovas. alright thats all i have to say.

       today, i read thru an old box of letters from jenk. i think life was more interesting when there was a whole school full of appropriately aged guys you knew and had things in common with... i still can't believe how guy obsessive i used to be. i can't even imagine being like that anymore. now, i'm such a singleton. gross. i need a love interest to keep me preoccupied while vicky is away. only for a month. and then whoever he is, he can go away after that... any takers?

       ok so the other day i mentioned that i wished that anthony would just decided that he liked the other job better and quit graphics.. and today he came in and quit. haha. on the outside i was mourning, but on hte inside i was doing the happy dance. not that he wont be missed. he's certainly interesting.. but i think i've had enuf of that guy for an entire lifetime. and he still is bringing up stuff about that lydia girl that he liked. and i left before he got too into it cuz i really didnt want to hear it. i think its weird that he's actually not gonna be working there ne more. its like a wish come true. sounds much worse that i mean it too (things always do when i'm talking about anthony).  on to other news. i'm supposed to be doing my QT right now, but i'll just post my stuff since i'm on.  during our sharing time i mentioned that i'm ready to get married. like i dont know wut it is but for the first time in my life i know that i am. its kind of weird. so i was praying and stuff and theres some other stuff involved. but God asked me this (or maybe i was just asking myself): if i gave u an s.o., what would u do if i took him away? and of course immediately i want to say that i'll just be faithful to God.. but really i dont know how i would react. so i'm like how terrible would that be if i got married and then became widowed. and wut if i was still young when i lost the guy? like how it happened to sherri yi.. so that made me all sad. so currently i'm asking God that i could have the right heart before i get into ne thing. so thats where i'm at with that. also, i had another dream about jennifer so. we were all at knotts berry farm (coincidence?) but we went there to attend some class. and everyone of my friends, past and present, were there. we were all standing in a large circle, and i was standing right next to her and i couldnt stand it so i moved across the middle of the circle. i saw kay lee and i hugged her and we were okay. and i was able to be okay with other people. jennifer was the only person i coudln't be okay with. so i realized that: a. this is kind of weird cuz i never ever remember my dreams and to have two with her in them is very odd. and b. i think i'm trying to be told something. whether its my heart or its God, i think i'm supposed to call her and make amends with her or something. cuz nothing has ever bothered me to the point of manifesting itself in my dreams. not that it actually botheres me when i'm not asleep, but something about the whole matter must, to be showing up in my dreams this way. so i decided that the next dream i have with her in it, that i would call and apologize for being such a crappy friend to her. cuz u know that verse about if you have issues with your fellow brothers then u should make amends and then come back to church..  it sort of relates in that way. i guess we're on bad terms. but yea thats the other thing that i'm dealing with. currently those are my only unresolved issues.  other wise, school was good, and work is good. i'll post my schedule tmrw.

       my favorite part of the conference was sharing time. i know that probably sounds cheesey, but i'm really glad we all got to share the things we did. there r things that i never knew about the girls that i learned. and then pastor oh was truly amazing. its like the most subtle change in my life that i'm experiencing, but i feel like i changed. my life and my perceptions changed. i know that through me the world will change. however insignificant i am. and somethings happening this year that will forever change my life. i dont even know wut it is yet. and not just for me but for all of us. from here on out, nothing will ever be the same. its like when you first believe in God and everythings different. nothing around you really changed. its just that you've changed. ne way, i just grateful that i get to be a part of this.  and something else that was confirmed. part of my personal vision is to change the way the world perceives christians and asian americans. i'm so sick of christians and their hyprocracy. and for those bad seeds who ruin it for all of us. and i'm sure i was like that too. so i want to change it.   can u see the wave coming? are you ready to ride it? cuz i'm so ready. i feel like i've been waiting my whole life for wuts coming.

       at work... didn't go to class all day. my mom's still sick.. she had kidney stones, and they passed, but now she's just sick cuz she didn't eat ne thing. so i didn't go to class cuz i didn't feel like cutting glass today, so i went to the mall to exchange a sweater at the limited instead. and then i had to buy some pants cuz i spilled something on the pair i was wearing .. so i bought two new pairs... i got one for really cheap at forever 21.. i forgot that i wasn't supposed to shop impulsively there, since they have the no return policy.. so hopefully i'll still like the pants when i get home. so i feel satisifed as far as pants shopping goes..  i feel like i'm suposed to be doing something.. like working on a project? i dunno.. it feels like i have nothing to do.. but i do have stuff to do.. i just dont feel like doing it. and i slept for like 10 hours last night. dang. thats a long time. i'm well rested. thats all. i wish i didnt have work today, so i could just not be at school at all on tuesdays and thursdays. that would be great

       dude my mom has this weird urinary thing going on.. she keeps going to the bathroom, and right now she's says she's really really cold. it sounds exactly like those things on the commercials where the people say: "i thought it was just a part of getting older"  so ne way, my dad is telling me to go her work, cuz she's sick, but i really dont want to.. not that i dont care about my mom, but my dad is being a real jerk about it.. he could at least ask nicely, and why can't HE go? he acts like i have nothing to do.. like i'm just sitting on my butt crapping around. grrr. and i suppose in the end i'll just end up going cuz who else will, right? so now i'm like annoyed and pissed... and she refuses to go to a doctor... cuz my parents are idiots and i guess they'd just rather wait and let things like this get really bad and then go to the doctor when things get near fatal. who knows wut they're thinking.. and i'm just like dude if u went to the doctor like a week ago when u first had symptoms, u would've gotten a small pill and it would just make everything better, but noooo u refuse to listen to me and just suffer. and then u expect me to go and take care of stuff. stupid~ wut is wrong with these people??

       i called jennifer so on sunday.  so i had that third dream about her, so i called her after church. she still lives in the same house, so it wasn't hard to get a hold of her. she was a lot more calm than i expected her to be. she wasn't mad or ne thing. i told her how i was, and she told me how she is... we caught up on stuff... she's seems to have grown a lot since the last time i talked to her (on the inside). kind of like me. and we're in the same place as far as the whole finding a new church thing goes. kind of strange. she was saying how if i had called her like a month ago, she wouldn't have recieved it as well. interesting. so some other stuff we touched on: 1. she transferred to biola, majoring in radio, tv, film. 2. when i talked to her online that one day, she had just realized that our friendship up until that point was completely one sided. meaning she did all the talking and opening up and i did all the listening. so she realized this before i told her, but by the time she figured it out, it was too late.  3. she tried to find out how i was doing by talking to daniel no, and vicks and lan... she told all of you guys not to tell me about ur encounters, but of course u all did tell me, so i knew. and so just wanted to see how i was, and she thought she was discreetly getting info out of u guys w/o me knowing. but since we ALL knew wut she was doing it looked kind of stalkeresque. 4. she saw me at the movies when i went to go watch serendipity. (i saw her at knott's) 5. she told me she realized how unhealthy our friendship was before, and just her whole outlook on life, the way she treated her friends, etc. 6. i told her how i came to call her up, and how if u had asked me if i was going to call her a month ago, i would've thought i'd probably never call her.  7. i mentioned how there was that one verse in the bible about if u are in dispute with a fellow brother or sister, u should go make amends first and then come to church. 8. we basically realized that in this whole thing, God totally had a hand in it. that because i left when she needed me most she totally needed to rely on only God. the weird thing is when i cut the friendship, i thought she was actually stronger than when i first met her, so i thought she would be okay. so we both did a lot of growing on our parts.  so by the end of the conversation, we didn't set ne label on our relationship now. it was more of a we'll see how it goes from here. we exchanged email and phone numbers, and made each other available to call whenever we wanted. we're both pretty busy with school though so i don't think we'll be that close. all in all it turned out very well. and i'm glad i called her. i think we both had a big weight lifted off our shoulders. so that was my conversation with jenn. its a good thing.

       ok so my 4-7pm class was cancelled today.. when i saw the note on the door i was ecstatic cuz i didnt do my 60 TN for the class. whew. so i go to work to do my hw, and i'm chillin for like 3 hours, and then i go to my 7 o'clock class and lo and behold, its cancelled as well. ok so i'm here back at work, but the sad thing is, this other guy who's in all three of my classes, he actually did all of his homework for all three classes, so that really sucks for him. when i saw him again for the 7 o'clock class, he said he just went to the bar and wasted money. so thats kind of a bummer.. he so could've just gone home. ne way, i was stressing out cuz i didnt do my homework, but i still have like 5 more days to do it now. yay~ i think if i was that guy i would feel really jipped of a good education. anyway, thats all.. going home now.

       ok so i'm at work.. i was late again. i think i'm just more tired these days.. its not even the amount of hours i sleep cuz yesterday i was trying to be responsible and i slept like at 1am which is plenty of time for work at 10am, right? but i was way more tired this morning than i usually am when i sleep like 4 or 5 hours. so i think its just the whether or i dont have enuf iron or i need to exercise.. one of those things.   so ne way, my blogs don't post.. so i do write.. very occasionally, its just that this stupid publishing thing doesn't work.   so i'm feeling better about school... i like it a little more. its weird vicky that u mentioned that you were doing homework and going to class, cuz i was gonna tell you that it seems like you used to be more goal oriented. and i was more goal oriented too. lately it feels like i dont know why i'm doing wut i'm doing. but i'm better now. i'm more dedicated? ommitted? and i figure if the job markets gonna keep sucking like this, i'm just gonna stay in school longer. as in seriously considering taking another minor or concentration or maybe even both. but i still want to do advertising, cuz thats always been wut i wanted to do.  ok onto other things.. church still seems kind of blah. but wut can you do? ordinarily i think i would take up a position on staff, and try to make some changes, but right now i just dont have the time or resources.. sucks.. i guess thats y people need high paying jobs in order to dedicate some time in wuts it.. like good causes n things. ok so ne way, io'm thinking that i should be trying to change things, after all thats wut i've been taught to do. if i dont like something, don't complain, just take some action. but i think right now i don't really want to be a leader, i kinda want to let other people do some of that for now. so even though everything around me is broken, i dont have the time to try and fix things.   on to other things: trip abroad, my mom said she'd pay for half of it. so like $600. i have almost that much in the bank. but theres still spending money that i need to come up with. and then i figure if i go on the trip, i wont have ne money for the rest of the break, to go like snowboarding n stuff. and i would still need money to pay bills n stuff. so still weighing all of that.. i guess its mostly dependent on the actual plane ticket. i said if its under 700 then i'll go, but i really hope its still under 600. thats all. we'll see how much money i have when i get my paycheck and how much the ticket is. and go from there.

       after a very loooong process of thinking and deduction.. i've come to a rough conclusion: i feel like i'm putting so much effort and work into school and work, and its just all in vain.. like it doesn't make much difference. and its starting to get to me.  i think i do need to be doing something that affects people. here i sit.. thinking of ways that i can change people's lives. and yet i can't escape the reality that i don't reflect my idealogies on a daily basis as it is. but howard said: God uses idiots. and i'm not really much of ne thing but i'm willing to give my life to something. and i've started to devote it to wut i happen to be currently involved with, which is art and working in art. and thats not wut i want to do with my life really (not that i dont want to do it, just.. its not the main character), so its causing an inner conflict of sorts. well at least i've defined a problem.. thats the first step, right? right.   some of my middle of the year resolutions include:  no more drinking escapades,  more reading,  more prayer,  more active approach to getting to know people and their problems,  more helping other people,  more helping where i can,  more learning to accept things i can't change,  more forgiving people who dont now wut they've done wrong,  more uplifting people,  more not feeling guilty for things,  more laughing,  more smiling,  more being open to letting people know me,  more ice cream,  less processed foods,  more planning ahead,  more following plans,  more setting goals,  more discipline,  more keeping time,  more enjoying the things i have to do,  more encouraging others,  more believing in people,  more accepting responsibility,  more owning up to things,  more offering suggestions,  more demonstrating graciousness,  more appreciating the things people do,  more telling them thank you,  more apologies,  less pride,  more serving,  more humility,  more goodness,  more faithfulness,  more hope,  more faith,  more being a leader,  more demonstrating good character,  more integrity,  more joy,  more fruits,  more love,  more vulnerability,  more stepping outside my comfort zone,  more embracing loved ones,  more showing gratitude,  more giving, more recieving, more learning,  more understanding,  less complaining,  more taking chances,  more living.  wow thats a lot more than i had planned to resolve to. but theres plenty to do, so i better get cracking. theres a lot of this journal that didn't get published because it got erased, but thats okay, cuz it was a good renewing and cleaning out my closet. so i'm feeling better now than i was about 3 hours ago. =) happiness starts today.

       how do you want me to color the image? and...how I should I do the one page paper for it.  perhaps we should get together and do the project?  like at the library...so while you draw the thing, I can look up information for the paper...that sounds good.  when are you free...or it doesn't have to be at the library...arg...let me look at your schedule.  brb.......I'm going to guess weekends are better for you cuz you've got night classes on wednesdays...and you work on thursdays.  i can meet you after work on thursday if you're up to it, or friday, but friday the library is closed earlier on fridays i think...we can meet at my house, i've got a lot of art stuff...and a computer that we can look up info on the internet cuz that's where the info's at.  anyway you probably won't read this until tomorrow anyway...i'll just talk to you then.  sorry i babble

       if someone asks you if they are an a-hole, what are you supposed to say? does that fall into the does-this-make-me-look-fat category, for which all automatic responses should be no? peter asked me if he was, and i told him he had the potential to be, even though he had never been one to me directly. so i think after that he felt kind of crappy. =P so then i felt kind of bad for making him feel crappy, but my philosophy is always: don't ask a question you aren't prepared to hear the answer to. so i never said sorry.  so much to do, so little time. sigh.

       i hope the rain brough snow =) that would make me happy. i need a vacation right about now. its weird. it doesn't seem like very much is happening, but at the same time, so much is going on around me.  current events in my life: *the church thing.. update: jdsn said he would be going to the new church, light house or wutever regardless of whether or not new life gets started. so i guess we're just members of good shepherd til then? and then wut if it never gets started? well i'm coping with things okay, but it just seems ironic that church is such a major source of distress. i mean these kinds of things could be traumatic to some people. *my mom's swapmeet place is getting threatened to close down by the city cuz they want to build something nicer there or something. and we're suspecting that they're not really allowed to do that. but some committee voted on it like last week and decided they could close it down. so its gonna go to some other committee now but its predominantly hispanic so a lawyer on my mom's side said they have a better chance of voting to not close it down. so and its a big deal, but my mom downplays it so much it almost doesn't seem like a big deal. but it would mean my mom losing her job, and i dont know wut else she would do. so yea. i'm not really worried, but at the same time, it could get pretty bad.  how do these things happen?

       the waiting is sooo driving me crazy... the whole thing... so this is life.. everything takes forever becuz so many people are involved, and you have to talk to  everybody ...   so cynthia is still talking through the breakup, and i still can't believe how mad sang is about it. i mean i expected him to be mad, but dude, he's like raging bull mad. and i feel sorry for daniel, cuz he's kind of the middleman of everything, even though he has his own life to worry about. i'm glad at least that daniel is somewhat wise and understanding, otherwise things could be much much uglier.    now onto last nights dream/nightmare:  in the past two weeks, i've been having these nightmares that someone is trying to kill me, or that i'm running away from something. and last night was another one... i was in my room and my parents threw a party, u know like the kind in the movies. but i was banished to my room and this neighbor guy comes in, and its someone that my family doesn't know very well, so i dont really trust him at first, and he is in my room, and i'm acting all "ew get away from me" towards him, and he's all trying to sweet talk me, so i get more defensive, but he eventually wins my trust and i even start to like the attention he's giving me. anyway, i don't remember what happens, he like robs our house or is evil towards our family, so i tell the authorities about him, and he's forced to flee his home, so i'm all scared that he's gonna come after me, and i'm outside and i get a phone call on a payphone from sissy spacek telling me "don't stay outside, go and hide RIGHT NOW" and i'm all paranoid, but i dont wanna hide at my house, cuz he knows where i live, so i end up in the lobby of this dingy, loud public youth pool hall/movie theatre but theres so many people that i'm always watching my back, and i see this guy and i think its him, and we make eye contact, but i'm not sure if it is, and then i get scared so i'm trying to get away, but he's not really coming after me. and its totally like in the movies when you suspect the person its not, and real danger is just around the corner. oh and jeannie and staci are with me, and they're totally slowing me down and jeannie goes to the info desk and counter guy asks for her info. and she naively tells him her car description, and i'm thinking, "omg wut are you doing?? the evil guy could be hearing this right now" so i ditch jeannie, and i tell staci lets go, so we go outside cuz i'm trying to get away from the guy i saw inside, but then i see the evil guy walking towards our direction so i hide by standing next to the wall of the walkway. instead of walking into the building, he turns and follows the sidewalk down the grassy knoll, and i'm almost positive its him, but not completely sure, so i start following him from behind, and while i'm following him with my eyes,  i notice this figure in a black trench coat lying down, hiding next to the sidewalk and some bushes in the grass and i realize he's on our side. so he stands up and its my beg. glass teacher and he says to me, in a purposefully projected voice so the evil guy can hear, "hey esther!" the evil guy immediately turns around and starts charging at us, and i'm suddenly so terrified, but my glass teacher tackles him, and they start wrestling on the floor. then another dude is there, and its the same glass teacher again (glass teacher #1 just turns into some other random guy), so he starts beating up evil guy's friend that he was walking with. after some fighting i'm convinced enough that my guys are stronger than the evil guys, so i'm relieved, but they take evil guy to jail, instead of just doing away with him, and so even though there's no more danger for me, i'm still scared cuz he could eventually get out of jail and threaten my life later. and that was when i woke up. its weird cuz i can kind of picture wut the evil guys looks like. he had dark hair and eyes and a really crooked nose, in my dream it was actually some actor, but i don't remember his name. I don't think it looked like the actual famous person tho. ne way i'm somewhat concerned becuz i dont think its good to be dreaming about your life being in danger so much. maybe it means something.

       about the trip...I know you're worried about the amount of money you're spending, but this might be the only time that you might get to go on the three places of fun while you're a kid, and "carefree." what if you don't get a chance later?  and even if you get a chance later, you won't be in the same stage you are now, and who will be the one that goes, hey esther you wanna go to NY, Paris, and Zurich with us...just think about it will you...you don't have to go to all three, but...it would be fun!  We're thinking of putting Wales, that's in england, into the trip as well, my cousin's boss opened up a BB ( bed and breakfast) and he's like the manager of that place, so we're  thinking of going to Wales....that's all.

       hi esther park.  I just thought I'd post this here.  I was thinking that I was going to take my brother to Mt. High the weekend when school gets out.  It's only about an hour from where he's at...that's my plan.  If you want to join us...that would be okay as well.  I'm just telling you because we had said we might make plans to go after school's out.  I still would like to go to Mammoth with your church, so...let me know when things are due okay.  if you don't get this, I'll just tell you on sunday. byebye

       wuts with people and xanga? its so blah.. its only capable of containing your boring ongoings, but i don't think you can really write your thoughts and stuff. i still like livejournal, and blogger has technicality issues. wutever good ol' pen and paper what would i do without it. i like spilling my brain on paper, but thats hard to do online. i just thought i should write something since i haven't in a while.. i dont like how when i'm not in school, life kind of slows to a crawl.. and when i am in school, things go by so fast i hardly have time for upkeep and maintenance. i'm definitely taking fewer classes next semester. dang my major.. y so many hours?? why? eck. people are graduating. and starting careers.. yikes.   ok so i saw raphael the other day at work. it was funny he walked in and held out his hand for me to shake it and i said, "don't touch me!" and i'm sure it sounded extremely rude, but i didnt mean it in a bad way, i was saying that the whole day cuz i was sick and i didn't want anyone else to get sick. oh well. he shaved his goatee thingamajig.. and he's going back to brazil finally to start seminary. he's not that cute. hehehe. the end.

       things i have absolved to do:  1. pay off my credit card debts. i refuse to be enslaved by corporate america.  2. pursue a minor in advertising. it adds a semester. instead of 1 year left, i will have 1.5 years left. wuts the rush, there are no jobs. its a productive way to spread my design classes apart, so i have more time having a life while i'm in school.  3. marry. there's no avoiding the inevitable. well not at this second tho. we all know that esther wants to be married. previous plan of action: stand around looking lost. new plan of action: be available and advertise. vickyhsu, axe the silly grins! step one (not a twelve step system): talking to boys helps. i don't want to be debi, but i don't want to be lani. a happy medium would be nice. (note to lani: no offense, yea?)  4. journal. its a therapeutic way to make yourself think about wut you r doing with life. it keeps you from following a blind routine.  5. workout. self explanitory.  6. read. i miss getting lost in books, and having it make you keep odd hours.  7. listen. i want to know about the lives of the people i say i love.  8. pray.   9. pursue.  10. stop committing to more things than i have time for. it inevitably forces one to neglect the basics. in the end, it is detrimental to ones well-being, sanity and happiness.

       dediced i can't handle summer school.  yesterday, i went to the first day of class.. and vicky was right, he's a total dick. (i chose that word only because vicky loves it so much).. so today, i was tired and wanted to sleep.. i suppose i could have just went to class and slept there, i'm sure nothing particularly important would have progressed, but no, it would have been a waste of time. no more junior colleges. ever. he was one of those old cynical opinonated guys, who make u feel like u want to hate the world. how can u learn like that? i also realized that 4 out of 5 of the teachers i had at fjc were also dicks. the only one who wasn't was an art teacher. sometimes, u get wut u pay for. it would have been a waste of another $150 (it adds up to that with taxes and fees and books).. i'd rather just pay the $500 to take it at my school. bleh. no more school. i hate school. i like learning, but i really hate school...

       quote of the day: "cuz guys you like never hit on you anyway, it's always the creepy guys." -m  so sitting at home on a friday after work, feel kinda crappy cuz: 1) the rag has arrived, 2) the weather is all gloomy and awful, 3) talking to richard online, who reads way too much into things and makes me feel like i need therapy. everytime i talk to him, i regret it. but i dont even im him, he ims me.. he reminds me of back in the day jennifer so. y doesnt he just leave me alone? he said he "just wanted to get to the root of esther". why? i dont understand. stop it! ur making me feel worse than i already do. can he just never talk to me? that would be fine. please go away.   its raining in my world today. blah.

       i spent my day working on the booklet.. its progressing nicely. made a date with jen8.. and listend to jess tell me the most hilarious thing i heard all week: she went to a club on friday and gave her number to some guy and she can't remember his face. dude jess. i think u need to chill on the alchy.  wondering where my friend vicky hsu has gone... i'm assuming she's just flying to the moon or something. but if i was the type of person who was really worrisome, i'd be going crazy cuz i would think she was abducted. i probably think nothing of it because i do it all the time too. maybe its not the best of habits to fall off the planet without leaving a note.   waiting to watch the third season of sex.  i just ate half a canteloupe MELON.  i dont know why i still write in here. i think its because i feel like i have nothing substantial to contribute to the world with these particular bloggings.. if they were really important, they would be reserved on paper. still antixanga. still insomniatic. and still feeling blah. perhaps in anticipation of the rag. y do i suspect the rag? yesterday i gained 5 lbs. and then this morning i lost it. water retention i suppose.  jen was talking about the beach. and now i miss it. have absolved to go next week.  wuts with strangers wanting to be my friendster? a friendster is not a real friend. they are lost elementary schoolmates, friends of friends of friends of friends, etc. people who ask "do you remember me?" to which i wish i could be rude and respond, "if i wasn't here, would u even notice?"

       During World War I, the US government jailed those who were distributing anti-draft pamphlets like this one. Schenck, the publisher of the pamphlet, was convicted, and his conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1919. (This decision was the source of the well-known "fire in a theatre" quote.)     Schenck v. U.S.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Schenck's pamphlet:  Assert Your Rights    The Socialist Party says that any individual or officers of the law intrusted with the administration of conscription regulations violate the provisions of the United States Constitution, the supreme law of the land, when they refuse to recognize your right to assert your opposition to the draft.  In exempting clergymen and members of the Society of Friends (popularly called Quakers) from active military service the examination boards have discriminated against you.  If you do not assert and support your rights you are helping to "deny or disparage rights" which it is the solemn duty of all citizens and residents of the United States to retain.  In lending tacit or silent consent to the conscription law, in neglecting to assert your rights, you are (whether knowingly or not) helping to condone and support a most infamous and insidious conspiracy to abridge and destroy the sacred and cherished rights of a free people. You are a citizen: not a subject! You delegate your power to the officers of the law to be used for your good and welfare, not against you.  They are your servants; not your masters. Their wages come from the expenses of government which you pay. Will you allow them to unjustly rule you?  No power was delegated to send our citizens away to foreign shores to shoot up the people of other lands, no matter what may be their internal or international disputes.  To draw this country into the horrors of the present war in Europe, to force the youth of our land into the shambles and bloody trenches of war crazy nations, would be a crime the magnitude of which defies description. Words could not express the condemnation such cold-blooded ruthlessness deserves.  Will you stand idly by and see the Moloch of Militarism reach forth across the sea and fasten its tentacles upon this continent? Are you willing to submit to the degradation of having the Constitution of the United States treated as a "mere scrap of paper"?  No specious or plausible pleas about a "war for democracy" can becloud the issue. Democracy can not be shot into a nation. It must come spontaneously and purely from within.  Democracy must come through liberal education. Upholders of military ideas are unfit teachers.  To advocate the persecution of other peoples through the prosecution of war is an insult to every good and wholesome American tradition.  You are responsible. You must do your share to maintain, support, and uphold the rights of the people of this country.  In this world crisis where do you stand? Are you with the forces of liberty and light or war and darkness?

       ay, stop it. yes, you.. stopit. stop. it. dont read this. dont take things out of context. theres a name for words taken out of context. its called misunderstanding. or in dramaland its called he said/she said. i need to stop posting pissblogs. thats how the whole "are we friends" convo was initiated. ugh. the truth is ugly. and guess what, it has a big ugly bat and swings really hard, and it hurts like hell..  so get out the way.   you should never take the obvious blog seriously. translation = i should cease the postage of incriminating evidence on the obvious blog.

       its tomorrow already... today was so short.  do you ever wonder what random people read your blog? i mean, how hard would it be for someone who knows my sn to figure out my blog addy? i clicked on one of those "most recent blogs" posted on the blogger homepage, and the http was aprilmaejune. my brothers friend dated a girl who i referred to as aprilmayjune. and i was wondering how many people are out there named aprilmayjune? and if its that same girl, then thats just a bizarre coincidence. but most likely, not. anyhow, that was what made me wonder that.  my brother thinks i have the worlds most wasteful thoughts. why? because i wonder stupid things like that. at the same time, he's jealous because he thinks i'm smarter than him. and i'm not jealous even though i know he's smarter than me. its actually not a matter of smarter, more than thinking differently. i think spatially and he thinks however other way i dont think. we think so differently, we often amaze each other because we could never have thought of some things on our own. the things that are impressive to each other are not particularly special to self because, well it was easy to think of. most of the time, it makes for amusing conversations, because we are insightful in different ways.   blah blah blah. its 12am and i can't sleep. my brother bought a book called "no more sleepless nights" i will commence with reading it, when he's had his fill. i skimmed thru some of it. there are people who naturally need to sleep only three hours a night... thomas edison regularly slept three hours a night. maybe thats what provoked his inventing electricity. so he wouldn't have to be awake and unproductive in darkness.    conference in six days. i'm supposed to recruit people. hm.

       can you successfully market reality? like lauren hill unplugged? i mean who really wants to hear someone think out loud anyway? i certainly dont. unless its exceptionally wise or insightful. don't most people just go through the same basic growing pains of life? ordinary people's thoughts seem relatively banal. its hard to make your specific intuitions appealing to people who dont know the memories and life history you know. they just dont have the same references to view your perspective through.  is real art merely the expression of true self? or is art the ability to make the ordinary extraordinary? is it art simply to describe your life? ur pain, joy, revelations? or is it art if you can do it in a way that is remarkably beautiful, eloquent? like poetry that describes a raindrop in a way that makes you see it differently than u did before? and if so, how do u measure that? is it even measureable? whats the continuum? is it art if its so different that no one can relate to it? is it art simply if its intent is art? is it art if its intent is to not be art? why is calder's toy fish on wheels considered art and not a toy? is it the engineering of it? the inventive aspect of it? is it because he was an artist? how many people need to consider it art in order for it to be art? and how competent does he/she need to be? does it just need to grab the attention of a few head art people? are you an artist if you only produce one good piece of work, like a one hit wonder? and after a certain point, is everything that an established artist produces considered art? is it art if something simply looks "pretty"? if i take the fork that i am not eating my tomato with and put it on a podium in a museum, is that art only because i distinguished it as found object art and put it in a museum? is art defined only by context and not by content? or is it only by content and never by context? or it is both? and if its both, then isn't it everything? and if its everything? then wuts the point of distinguishing art from nonart? is it not art if its produced for non art purposes? but everything needs to be manifested in a design. all words need to be arranged in a certain intentional order. is it all encompassing? but everything cannot be art, because if everything is art, then what the hell am i rambling on for? maybe art has nothing to do with subject, but more with discussion. hm. ok but if "art" exists merely to be discussed, and it would be absent without discussion, then nothing is art. and nothing cannot be art if everything is art. or maybe it can.  art is the theory of relativity.

       so.. after three weeks of school... here is my schedule. i thought i posted it, but apparently not..   M    2pm-8pm   work (x1539)  T  11:30-12pm Modern Art           1-4pm   Jewelry           4-7pm   Computer Assisted           7-10pm Sp. St. Graphic D.  W  11pm-6pm   work   R    8am-11pm work      classes same as T  F  no school fridays = three day weekends  M and W, 7pm-1am-ish i will probably be working on hw in the comp labs. u can hunt me down if you real want to find me.  as for whistler.. I WANT TO BE CANADIAN! i'm a freak.. but as i am still in much debt. i dont know if this winter will be good for me. my brother offered to bail me out of debt, but i turned it down. for two reasons. a) i figure if i have to pay my own way out, it will be a life lesson never to be forgotten, and b) even tho it will take me forever, if i took that much money from him, i would feel like i owed him big time. i hate feeling like that. in the grand scheme of things, i suppose owing my brother is far better than owing the big bad credit companies. however, that was the first response that came to me... i could always change my mind. either way, the offer is nice, but i still highly doubt the money will ever actually show up.   so back to the winter plans, decided against the season pass. you guys can bank on mt high, but i'm gonna explore bear mtn a bit this year. as long as i can find someone to help out with the mtn driving. my brothers around and hes always game. and i have a feeling a lot more other people will be into heading up to big bear this year.   as for aspen, i would love to go again. maybe by some miraculous intervention, i will no longer find myself in debt. i agree.. airtrip. my uncle said the mtn range is the death of the roadtrip to get into denver in the wintertime. a plane would mean access to any mtn. aspeno is expensivo. oh and i looked up the grand junction and i think its just the name of the city, thats my best guess ne way.   as for the other roadtrip up the coast, i was planning it over the weekend. sort of. what i want: of the million times driving up, i've always taken the 5, so we must take the 1 the entire way up, stopping at all the major beaches, because i've been beach deprived this whole summer, and i can't be a californian without having played/surfed/swam in them. taking the 1 however, would mean at least double the drivetime around 15 hours. add on all the rest points i've decided we need to visit along the way and it could be a whole week. i wouldnt mind stending a night or two in a hotel. so this is my MUSTSEE list driving NORTH on the 1 that i've compiled:  starting in:  SaMo malibu (never been) SB (take the 246) Solvang (this is optional, i feel like i will never again be anywhere remotely near this place, so i might as well stop for a danish roll) pismo beach SLO San Simeon (home of hearst castle and the otter reserves) Big Sur  Carmel Pebble Beach Monterey as we round out monterey bay: hit up the aquarium, grub at bubba gump~  and finally we reach our destination:  Santa Cruz and FAYE the treehugger.   and if we're not so sick of driving that we want to abandon the cars and take a plane home, we can keep heading north to Half moon bay, and into SF to visit Frank. but he hasn't invited us over to play and we dont all know him, so i'll leave it at that.

       It's really sweet what you wrote to thuy.  I'd call you up to tell you, but we're not really that type of friends.    if you wanted to change your hair style, maybe you should go to a famous salon.  and pay the money...sometimes it worth it, they change your style, and you won't have to repeat going back to them for touch up...   Sept. 30th @ the roxy: EBE. Sometime in Nov. @ HOB in Vegas: M5.  you don't mind that i intrude right?  oh we're thinking whistler sometime in the winter...we should all go...air-trip, as opposed to road trip, cuz we're not going to drive, and maybe back to Aspen, but flying this time...since we didn't use the car at all when we were there.  Are you up for it?

       and another weekend has passed... ran into jane j. while i was getting a trim. cut my hair for the second time this year. looks basically the same. i was hoping maybe i would get bangs, but i couldnt communicate with the korean speaking hairdresser what i really wanted, and i was hoping she might have some suggestions, but the translations being so poor i decided just to go with the same til the next cut. so jane was in the process of having her hair straightened (she got a perm in spain) and after we were both finished we chatted a bit. her hair looked really really good. its magic i say. i will eventually cave and have my hair turned pin straight...   called jane byun. i promised her i would study with her. she's feeling lazy with her lsats. i miss the odd hours spent at church with her.  the realization that i will probably rarely see the college graduated on a regular basis has made me miss them already. sans church, sans school, the only friends who stick around are the ones you make stick. also at some point, people will begin to move away. and i will miss them even more. odd. because i rarely miss people. i've really only missed my brother. i've never been homesick. well before i type myself into a state of depression, i should go finish my book.   btw, if my phone goes to voicemail, it means i'm in class or at work, so i've turned off my phone.. translation i dont get the missed calls, so leave a message.  takemeto: the LA FAIR, the Switchfoot concert @ the avalon 9/26, the relient k show @ the whisky, a la playa!   andiwill: buy you any ice cream of your choice. =D, whadadeal!

       "And of course Miles knew that in the twisted, grotesque way of many true things, Jimmy Minty was speaking straight from the heart. It was what he wanted. And he was genuinely mystified as to why he couldn't seem to have it. Which did not--Miles had to admit as he got out of the car and crossed Empire Avenue--make him stupid. After all, what was the whole wide world but a place for people to yearn for their hearts' impossible desires, for those desires to become entrenched in defiance of logic, plausibility, and even the passage of time, as eternal as the polished marble?" r. russo

It's a war between boys and girls, and it's never going to change.

       Come on come on I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself is life worth living should I blast myself? I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black my stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch Cops give a damn about a negro pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero Give crack to the kids who the hell cares one less ugly mouth on the welfare First ship 'em dope & let 'em deal the brothers give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other It's time to fight back that's what Huey said 2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other We gotta start makin' changes learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers and that's how it's supposed to be How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? I'd love to go back to when we played as kids but things changed, and that's the way it is  [Bridge w/ changing ad libs] Come on come on That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is aww yeah [Repeat]  I see no changes all I see is racist faces misplaced hate makes disgrace to races We under I wonder what it takes to make this one better place, let's erase the wasted Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right 'cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonight and only time we chill is when we kill each other it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other And although it seems heaven sent We ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks But some things will never change try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game Now tell me what's a mother to do bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you You gotta operate the easy way "I made a G today" But you made it in a sleazy way sellin' crack to the kid. " I gotta get paid," Well hey, well that's the way it is [Bridge][Talking:]  We gotta make a change... It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes. Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live and let's change the way we treat each other. You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do what we gotta do, to survive. And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace It's war on the streets & the war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do But now I'm back with the blacks givin' it back to you Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up, crack you up and pimp slap you up You gotta learn to hold ya own they get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone But tell the cops they can't touch this I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool my mama didn't raise no fool And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped & I never get to lay back 'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs some buck that I roughed up way back comin' back after all these years rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is uhh

       God is looking out for me.  listening to: forrest gump suite  lina's church was happy. i dont know if its where i am in my life, or if its the church itself... i felt blessed after the service. which is good, because that is how you should feel, no? that doesn't mean that i feel at home, but i could, if i needed to. ne way, i'm gonna test out some bigger churches for a bit. cottonwood and newsong. julie said newsong is huge... which i'm not too fond of. and i think cottonwood is known for its youth. not sure.   so have decided to be small group leader. yay! and for the right reasons too. which is important i think.   oh my brother offered to give me $1000 in advance to buy a computer if i will design 3 webpages for him and he's going to teach me dreamweaver. the rest of the money (appx. $700) i will have to come up with. this way, i have a computer to design/build his webpages on and learn dreamweaver on ... and then i wont have to use computers at school and work. and i can hook up my lovely printer FINALLY... how happy am i? and u know wuts nice is that last i emailed jp, i had mentioned that i was lacking 1. a computer to work on and 2. web skills.. both of which i will be acquiring in the near future* so i will probably be building his website as well. see what i mean about God looking out for me?

       Who have I left to please?  Take what you've yet to seize.  No more questioning  'Cause love is what love should be.  Unveil to me all that you want me to do.  But why should I stop bearing allegiance to you?  See, I don't believe in  The sorcerers or the preachers.  I just believe in you.  And I don't believe in  the scholars or the wise men.  I just believe in you.    What have I left to prove?  I speak all the words you choose.  Confine me in walls of truth  'Cause love does what love should do.  No more sentence.  All of my pain has been freed.  Why should this end when your  mercy's all I need?  See, I don't believe in  The sorcerers or the preachers.  I just believe in you.  And I don't believe in  The scholars or the wise men.  I just believe in you.

       so i've lost my phone somewhere between here and santa cruz. and che keeps bringing it up. and i just dont care. i suppose i need to leave some part of me behind everywhere i visit, whether its personal or possessive or wutever. anyway, i dont know ne one's fone#'s so i can't call ne one. at least jane has the sense to realize that i dont know her number by heart and leaves it on the message. ne way, thats the end of that. no more fone for a while.

       sunday: went to lina's church and i was the most tired i have ever been in a long time. dont know why. monday: worked at school tuesday: worked on bro's website wed: jury duty, lunch @ hero's with vicky and che, put together a puzzle at jury duty, mom's car refused to start. thurs: thanksgivng. sat around at home, being really hungry, watching my brother cook dinner, called thuy and caught up with her, ate grips of food, and later enjoyed the company of che, vicks and ster. fri: worked at my mom's store, got to the NLC dinner just before it started. went to boba delight, ordered tea, went bowling at midnight, watched and ate sunflowers seeds as spectator rather than participant to a great bowling battle, went to denny's got some more tea. ordered breakfast cuz it was like 3am by then.   ever wonder what i am doing with my life? reallly not much of anything becuz i'm too busy trying to do everything... i go to school, i work and have classes, but dont get much done for my classes. i'm working on creating my brother's website, and brochures, working on the designs for freedom for mountain movers, training for small groups for retreat, spending time with my small group, looking for a church, trying to spend more quality time with my family and friends, trying to put together my portfolio, which is almost none existant, trying to find an internship, trying to figure out what i want to do when i get out of school, trying to save up for a new computer, trying not to burn out, trying to shave off the unimportant things in my life, so i can actually follow through on my committments.

       my chia pet is growing fine on one side, but not so fine on the other. hehehe. my brother and i each spread seeds on one side. its my brother's side that is retarded. so my chia pet is baldish on one side.  doing nothing and enjoying myself very much. well actually i'm just stranded at home, cuz my brother took the car to go running. yes, my life is laced with irony.  resting my way to health from the cold... which i've spread to at least two other people. i should stay quarentined in my house. rescheduled my appointment with the maxillofacialalsidvoiologist.. the dentist who takes out the wisdom teeth. so i could quite possibly be quite drugged up during the ski trip, in which case, i dont know about snowboarding while there is still residual anesthesia clouding my mind and impairing my motor reflexes. we'll see how i feel.   my brother wants to go look at the aussie shepherd tmrw at noon, but i told teresa that i'd go to nlc tmrw. i was reluctant to say that i would be there because i had a feeling i would be busy at that time. u know when u just intuitively feel like you've got an appointment or plans and you just can't remember what they are, but u know ur busy anyway? yea. but i couldn't think of a good reason to say no, other than it seems like i will be busy. not in a brushing off sort of way; i actually would like to visit nlc, but in the i dont want to make the committment if i can't follow through kind of way.

       i should be sleeping soon...   a slice in a day of my life.   i went to the los angeles temple today. me, my dad and my mom went to say hi and bye to my cousin from korea. she's here for her one year of mission and she's leaving wednesday. apparently i met her once when i went to korea when i was younger, but i have no recollection. she doesn't even look familiar. so it was really my first time meeting her. she learned to speak english really well in utah. they call her sister park. so anyway, it was a lot easier to talk to her because she spoke english, and it was so relieving being able to comunicate with some of my kin. really when my three cousins came to visit two years ago, it was frustrating. i dont even like explaining myself to my mom in konglish.   we parked in the visitor's center. there is an exhibit of the dead sea scrolls in the room to the left. and a gigantic statue of Jesus in the lobby. every one is wearing a name tag, the most prominent words below their names is Jesus Christ as in: church of ... of latter day saints.   we only had 30 minutes to talk to her. we go into this little room with 6 chairs, a tv and a bookshelf with no books inside. my mom starts talking "we didnt even get to take you out" (aside from her not having a car, they dont allow missionaries to leave they're local area, which is the LA temple area for her) "dont you think its weird that they dont even let u see your family?" (my mom swears theres a conspiracy going on. she doesn't understand that the congregation of the mormon church is just as, if not more naive than she is. this may or may not be true of the leadership) "some mormons came to our house, maybe they came because of you..." (my mom is suggesting more evidence for her conspiracy theory. they must have come to scope out the family, to check if we were suitable to visit. they must have decided we were not suitable, that must be why they wouldn't let her visit. she cannot fathom why anyone would not be allowed to leave the greater los angeles area to visit her relatives) "your mom and dad are..." (my parents went to korea within the past year for my grandmother's passing and they had interventions with her parents. not in relation to her, but just in general. i guess she doesn't really get that kind of info) "what are you gonna do when you go back to korea? are you going to finish school? finish school. you could teach english!..." (they warn her of the lack of employment opportunities, and suggest she tutor english, since she has learned so much of it during the past year. i'm sure she's pretty well aware of how hard its going to be when she goes back. she has a year of school left. but she can't afford to finish. so she will have to work while going to school. her major is korean literature, but there is no money in creative writing. why she spent her money on a mission to LA when there are plenty of mormons here already, is beyond me really. especially considering that her family can't afford it) "you dont have to be mormon to have a relationship with God..." (i suppose my parent's underlying purpose was to subtly de-convert her) cautiously: "do you know what they think of mormons in this country, dear? are you aware?..." (my mom suggests she visit some other churches when she got back to korea. sister park patiently responds: why would i have taken a year out of my life to learn english and come to this country and do all of this, if i wasn't satisfied with the church i was attending? my mother shares her testimony, emphasizing that she had an encounter with God when clearly she isn't a part of this mormon religion) "how could they not let you see your family?..." (she is still angry about not being allowed to see her own niece. at one point sister park draws a diagram of california and how there are regional temples and the missionaries are only allowed to stay within those confines. had she been assigned to the anaheim temple she would have been able to visit, to witness i presume) we carry on like this for thirty minutes. its mostly my parents talking.  another sister has to interrupt. there is a family here to see sister park. they have been waiting for 30 minutes. the girl leaves to let us say goodbye to my cousin. my parents give her some money, she is gracious about accepting it. extremely grateful. she hugs my mom. she hugs me. i'm sad that i don't know her. my dad is still sitting in his chair, expecting us to be allowed more time to talk with her. but the family outside is waiting. they too have come to say goodbye before she leaves. we walk to the lobby. i recognize that this was the family walking in before us when we arrived. they were waiting the entire time. we say goodbye, my mom gives her some additional advice.  we walk outside. we say good bye. we start to leave. i wave goodbye.

       Disturb us, Lord, when we are too well pleased with ourselves, when our dreams have come true because we have dreamed too little, when we arrive safely because we have sailed too close to shore.  Disturb us, Lord, when with the abundance of things we possess, we have lost our thirst for the waters of life; having fallen in love with life, we have ceased to dream of eternity; and in our efforts to build a new earth, we have allowed our vision of the new Heaven to dim.   Disturb us, Lord, to dare more boldy, to venture on wider seas where storms will show your mastery; where losing sight of land, we shall find the stars. We ask you to push back the horizons of our hopes; and to push into the future in strength, courage, hope and love.   - Sir Francis Drake, pirate.

       anyone wanna watch adaptation? my brother rented it, i feel like i should get one viewing in whilest i have it.  i will never watch a commercial in the same way ever again, after the video editing class. its like with the film music. how you always notice movie music now... i totally disect and critique tv commercials (in my head). am i not a nerd of the nerds? not really. but its dorky nonetheless.

       so i'm reading the hermux totowhatever.. it does get better as you get more into it. he's waiting for a letter from the aviatress.  also reading cs lewis. the four loves.  thats what i read after d&b yesterday. i was tired, but not tired enough for sleep.   now i'm gonna go run errands: bank, carwash?, food, school, work. that is my day.  i called the portfolio people, they said it got sent out yesterday. i swear they said they would send it out last monday, and i'd get it by the end of LAST week. but what can you do? so i should get it by like mondayish. whichs means i will be working on the guts of my portfolio this entire weekend.  also, i had a dream that i was employee of the month. haha. like spongebob. that was just a fragment of the sleeping.  there were other dreams involved, none of which i remember anymore.   i wanna go to charthouse. greg said they have good steak. theres the one in malibu, from the roadtrip and he said theres one in newport or somewhere around there. maybe i could convince thuy to go for her bday. ya hear me, thuy? CHARTHOUSE!

        in response to the question of how giving things up betters a person.  Gandhi was asked to describe in twenty-five words or less what his life mission was.  He said, I could do it in three:  Renounce and enjoy. You renounce all worldly attachment to everything and enjoy what God gives you.  You give away what you have inside yourself, your love.  Youre not concerned with whether it worked or didnt work, Whether it was right or wrong, whether you won or lost.  You just constantly flow through your life without getting attached to the results.  The irony is that the less attached you are, the more you get.  The more you keep circulating, the more keeps coming back to you.  Its a flowing system.     giving up material things, and worldly pleasures and being content without them is an affirmation that you only really need the spiritual. i don't necessarily agree that this is true. in western culture i think its used to allow for a more acute consciousness in one's spiritual life.  the extreme version of this is defined as asceticism:   asceticism     ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (-st-szm) n.  The principles and practices of an ascetic; extreme self-denial and austerity.  The doctrine that the ascetic life releases the soul from bondage to the body and permits union with the divine.  asceticism     Related: Philosophy   (es&#277;t&#300;s&#300;zem) , rejection of bodily pleasures through sustained self-denial and self-mortification, with the objective of strengthening spiritual life. Asceticism has been common in most major world religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity: all of these have special ascetic cults or ascetic ideals. The most common ascetic practice is fasting , which is used for many purposesto produce visions, as among the Crow; to mourn the dead, as among various African peoples; and to sharpen spiritual awareness, as among the early Christian saints. More extreme forms have been flagellation (see flagellants ) and self-mutilation, usually intended to propitiate or reach accord with a god. Asceticism has been associated with taboo in many non-Western societies and in such well-developed religions as Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism.

       yes i can see how the ambiguous rantblogs can be received that way.. becuz i tend to address a universal and generic "YOU" rather than specific people. AND usually when i refer to "YOU" most of the other times, i am referring to either you or vicky. so i can see where the confusion would occur. maybe i ought not do that anymore.  nay on the easter service. the closest i got to church this week was that weird and spooky break-of-dawn gathering of children draped in white robes we passed by on the way back from mary's.

       blog fame.  everybody wants to be famous. evidence: BLOGS. well, not me. but i was thinking, the point of capitalism is to sell sell sell! and everything exists for that purpose: tv, radio, internet, magazines are environments for articles, shows, music, even the news exist for advertisers. all OWNed by the advertisers. they're all ways for advertisers to maintain the highest amount of people interested in between more ads. remember we were in the taxi in vegas, and inside there were little tv's.. not really tv's, but ads... the taxi cab company could make a decent profit not because we paid a lot for the taxi, rather the advertiser did. all venues exist for the purpose of promoting and selling ad space. even people are for sale. celebrities are people who have gladly given up their privacy so that they can sell their faces and their lives to the public at large. how much is a life for hire? celebrities can make millions if they can sell their fame in just the right way.   how do you get people to link to your site?  write interesting blog entries, and they will come. how do you become a  blog of note ? write something someone wants to read, and you get clicks galore. its like a store. for yourself. that you can sell and market to whatever you want people to believe you are. and thats what people do. they keep poser journals that make them sound more interesting than they really are, emphasizing nothing substantial, really, just entertaining. because thats what keeps people coming back. its the fame quotient. people will waste they're time documenting unimportant events for other people to be entertained. or maybe its just human nature to crave acceptance and make it known that we have lives, even if you're not there to be a part of it.

DUH.  plus, if i don't have work to do on the weekends, i could do silkscreening. sometimes the brilliant ideas are so simple.

        i get a diploma signed by arhnuld schwartzenagger   i put together my new drawer thingy from ikea. i'm going to go to home depot to do some more do-it-yourself projects. its weird being graduated. i still feel like i've have more school next year. weird.  anyway, i'm just lounging, playing with the dog. when i figure out how to upload photos, i'll put em up.

       oh ok. well i think the graduation is supposed to start at 9:30am. but thats probably the earliest it'll start.  oh the seattle, WA. flight is for canada. if you fly to canada its international. so instead you fly to seattle and take a boat across the strait to vancouver. and then you can rent a car to drive around, and play. i think it costs around the same amount. i guess it would be the equivalent of flying to San Diego and then driving to TJ, instead of flying to mexico. but then again, i dont really want to go to TJ. I'd rather fly to southern and coastal parts of mexico. but yea, its kind of like that.

I possibly can.  she wants to call out, she doesn't care.  i think she would do it anyway, i just don't think they want her to think that she's involved in the strike that the 18 year olds started...that's how I feel anyway.

       i have an interview with deutsch, los angeles. wed., june 9th 8:30am...   after becoming frustrated with no one calling me back from the other companies, i decided to change my approach. here's the email i sent out.  Dear Sara Rosenthal:  I found this listing through the Cal State Fullerton Internship Center.  I am looking to do some free work. Apparently in the past few months, even that is becoming a hard sell. I want to work my tail off for a worthy mentor and do an incredible job, and absorb all that I possibly can from the greatness that is Deutsch. Just throw a few cookies my way during my work hours and I will be satisfied. I possess an ever critical eye. I learn quickly. I'm organized. I'm neat. Did I mention how hard I work? Did I mention I want to work for free? Did I mention I'm incredibly good at getting things done and done well? Yes, I am aware of the absurdity of this email and its lack of professionalism. I've tried being professional and it hasn't worked. So its going out the window and I'm going to ask that even if you already have an art buying intern, please let me be the intern's intern.  I will be waiting in eager anticipation for a phone call. I will thank you then.  You're future intern, Esther Park  __________________________ www.creativehotlist.com/e-park3

       esthernews:   We have a dog.  We went to the pound in Orange, there was a little gray dog that was really cute. but there were two other people in line for him. he's on hold until friday, the 28th. then we went to the irvine animal care center and found junior (cute little long haired dog) who is available for adoption on sunday, the 30th and a little white dog who is available on june 2nd.  We came home, expecting to go back to the pound when they're available to see if we can adopt them. when we got home, my mom was on the phone telling the lady who works near her store that we couldn't take care of it. take care of what? a dog... i knew she was talking about a dog. i pressed her, and she said the lady is bringing the dog over. its a purebred, very expensive, still young. i think the dad doesn't want to keep it. so the dog and the lady are coming over in thirty minutes. yay!  so, we have a dog.. and her name is annie. its a bichon frise. 8 months old. its adorable.   interview on friday, the 28th. with  urlLink yvonnedurandesign.com   they do magazine design. some of their stuff includes bop magazine. haha. but hey i've applied EVERYWHERE and no one is calling me. although i did call this place in hollywood, vox, adv. and they said they are always looking for interns and that their best ones have come from Cal State Fullerton. go titans. thats an edge for me. so i sent a resume and the link and the boss wont be back til monday. they already an intern for mon. tues. & thurs. so they need someone available on wed. & fri., which i can do except from june 21 - aug. 1 which is the special studies class. mwf 1-4pm. i would do the internship in the morning, but its too far.   other places i've applied: look-look magazine dGWB deutsch inc. warner bros. sony pictures entertainment posterchild.ws tokyopop pt graphic designer post on craigslist engle & murphy art asylum  apparently, people don't even want free work anymore. jeez.

        urlLink http://www.creativehotlist.com/e-park3   so this is a temporary portfolio i guess. i still need to add some more stuff that hasn't been scanned.  i think its funny how your personality comes out in your portfolio. like how my brother, daniel noh, jp and hyun are in it. the anti-mcdonalds-ness, the japanese woodblock. its just what you like or dislike that you end up including in your work, or who you end up doing work for. hehe. no girls tho. hm. maybe i should do a section on the screen printing. i get three collections for like $35.  give me work! any work!

       well i guess since vicky is working at 8am tmrw, it wouldnt be such a good idea to take her to watch a movie at midnight. so unless you really wanna go, i'm just gonna assume its a scratch. i think i shall watch "in america" on dvd. goodnight.

       so i was cleaning out my email box, cuz i just have a bunch of old emails that i haven't thrown out, and there was one that vicks sent me and it contained links to old blogs... so i clicked on them, and well, they were still active. weird.  urlLink vickyness1.blogspot.com   and  urlLink iheartalex.blogspot.com   so anyway, it just led me to wonder how many random thoughts and posts are lost out in the cyber world, just floating around on servers, being ignored and unacknowledged by their owners and creators, waiting for an update or just waiting to die by way of deletion. the moral of this ponderance: please don't litter. de-clutter the internet!

       since you said i took it down... here's new ideas.  established1981.com estarconcepts.com estherdesigns.com euniversaldesign.com edesigns.cc, dot bz, dot vg, dot gs, dot ms egraphics.tv, dot bz, dot vg, dot tc, dot ms  out of all these I like estarconcepts, or estherdesigns...unless you do not like to put your name out there.  estar is similar to esther. and well esther designs is just out there.  I'm not sure though if you would design, cuz design sound kinda like you interior decorate, and not graphics.  But i didn't think esther graphics was cool either...but I do like edesigns and egraphics, but none of the dot coms are available... on that one...and established1981 comes from est. and I just thought est. means established so why not established, and well with established you need a year, and why not the year you're born.  so those my ideas that are not too out there with your name.  thank you for making me see things in a different light.

       whoa... different... totally threw me off. i like the old settings better.  so the dance thing starts at 6 pm. starts with the tap classes and such, going from the most beginning level moving up to int/advanced. my ballet class probably won't go on until about 6:30 or so and the jazz class supposedly somewhere around 7-7:30 (according to the teacher). it's ok if you guys can't make it. i wanted to let you know though. miss you guys. hopefully i'll be able to see you guys soon. i'm out trying to look for jobs and frantically trying to finish my school work (last week of classes). situation isn't so great right now but i'll tell you guys later. so yeah. i have a stack of papers, literally, waiting to be written so that'll be all. i'll talk to you guys later~ *muah*

       so i went to newsong this past sunday, and the last time i went i went to their 11:30am service. this time i wanted to go to the 10am service. so i get there, and theres surprisingly little traffic in the parking lot, even tho there are a lot of cars. i walk in the main service room and they're in the middle of prayer and it seems like i'm late, but no, according to my phone i'm at least 5 minutes early. weird. so then they have a short worship, and its weird cuz everyone is sitting, but then for the second song, they have offering, so then the sitting makes sense. and then they do another song after the offering song, and then we stand, but then after the ONE song, we sit back down. odd. and so then i'm sitting there for like 30 minutes. and the pastor is talking about being filled with love, and then overflowing with it, so he's doing his intro to his sermon, i think. and then he prays again, and its short, and when he finishes, everyone starts leaving, and then i'm REALLY confused. seriously, the whole time i was like what the heck is going on? and i quickly realized that they must have changed the service time, cuz this other came in like a little after i did and she sat down in front of me, and when everyone started getting up, she didnt get up either.. instead she checked the time on her phone as well. so then i just decided to leave. and apparently they have the wrong service time posted on the website, because i checked it before i left in the morning. anyway, it was just a really bizarre thing to be confused about it, i even considered maybe there was daylight savings and i didnt know or something. anyway the moral of the story is, if you are in an unfamiliar setting, where the schedule and customs of things are completely new to you, you can go to the last thirty minutes of a service and have worship and offering and sermon summary and it wont be until everyone gets up to leave that you will realize that you CAME AT THE WRONG TIME.

       so i went to ikea AGAIN. so i tried returning mary's stuff, but they asked for a receipt.. i have no reciept.. just give me store credit! no, you must have a receipt. especially cuz the item is BROKEN. so after waiting in the long return/exchange line, i got nothing. i couldn't very well take these items into the store to do the rest of my shopping, since i was lacking that very essential RECEIPT. so i had to leave the bag with the info lady.  so then i went to get the items i needed: mackis paper trays, husar shelf, linnan closet hanging shelf thingamajig. i grabbed the paper trays, and looked for the closet thingy. i see the plastic ones that mary mentioned, and then i see the canvas ones, and there are only TWO left. i picked one up to inspect it, sometimes when there are only two of anything left, there is a very high probability that something is wrong with those two. hm, it looks okay... i picked up the other. a plastic piece is bracketed on slighly off center, causing it to not fit onto the fabric underneath, the other one does not have this problem. store is closing is 10 minutes. i take the LAST good piece. SCORE! i find my shelf and bum some extra pegs from the return/exchange lady. i leave with my purchases and unreturned returns.  now i'm at home, i've installed my shelf and put out my paper tray. after pondering other methods of organizing my closet, i decided that the new closet accessory will have to do. i examined the merchandise and alas i discovered the defect: a big scratch on the plastic piece that is so perfectly centered atop the fabric. damn that ikea.

        the end  i'm going to go visit thuy tonight. she came over with resty and her dog yesterday, so that our dogs could play. annie wasn't havin' it though. she's a scared-y cat. and tweedle is too high energy for her. the complete opposite of my dog, the mellow, dumb blonde... its ok i still love her. (is there an 'e' at the end of blonde?).   so i'm going to visit thuy, because she'll be leaving for chicago tmrw. after a week at her brother's, she'll be heading to sunnyville. or is it sunnyvale? which is in northern california? once vicky moves out, it will conclude the great migration out of the OC. its the end of the beginning.  every friend who steps boldly into her future, brings me closer to knowing that this is my life, and "i'll do what i want".

       i think my internship lady is great. i always feel like i can do anything i want to after i come back from working there. completely unstifled. she bought me a chair to sit in from ikea. not that i didnt have one, but the one before was small and uncomfortable and hard and made fingernails-on-chalkboard-ish sounds against the floor. so i help her be organized, because she doesn't have time, and she tells me her stories about working at weider and being an art director. we complement each other well. its great. level of internee satisfaction: very high.  as for the other people, well the lady at maddocks said call her anytime i need anything, maybe i could do freelance for her down the line. deutsch said no via postcard. look-look didn't call me back, but i didn't really want to work there anyway. and i have one more interview with warner bros. records, but its in BURBANK, kinda far... and i never got in contact with tokyopop. the chick called me and told me to come in, and i did, but her voicemail said that she went on vacation for a week. i haven't called back. maybe i should.  i dont know what i was thinking trying to do two unpaid internships; i wouldn't survive. but theres no harm in trying. the interviewing is good practice. i was thinking i should get an internship at a pre-press house where they pay like $13/hr. which would just be easy, and it wouldn't hurt to have pre-press experience, but i guess that should be a last resort.

       we (by we, i mean me and my brother) went to costco and bought 2 boxes of rice krispies treats. that may not sound like much, but costco boxes are about 5 times larger than regular grocery sized boxes. so we now have 80 rice krispies treats squares. the logic behind buying TWO boxes was that we'd have so many that we'd get sick of them. we figured after 80 of them we would definitely have had our fill for a lifetime. so how did an insatiable craving for rice krispies treats begin? well i was at walmart and waiting in line, and the impulse item buyer that i am, i picked up a cup of graham cracker sticks, a cup of cheez-its and a gigantic bar of rice krispies treats (just one!)... it was all very cheap. so i get home and i'm unloading my purchases and as i'm taking my last load into the house, here is my brother halfway done with MY rice krispies treat, saying "where's your's?" so i took it and finished it. later, when he went to go run errands, he bought another box and he gave me three and took five. he ate all of his at once, but i wanted to save some for later so i just ate one. then he saw me eating it the next day and asked "where'd you get that"... "you gave it to me, yesterday." so he ate my other one that i was saving. and it still wasn't enough. so we went to costco... JUST to buy rice krispies treats. and now we're working our way through 80. yesterday my brother ate five.

       why is it easier to clean in the morning? i dont ever wanna do it later in the day.  anyway, my back has been hurting.. u know the bone part not the muscle part and i told my brother and he said thats normal. he had that problem, and then he said just keep running, it'll go away. so yesterday after recuperating for a few days and not running, my back felt better so i went to the park and we ran with the dog and it didnt hurt anymore. the moral of the story: exercise is good for you.

       its amazing how much maintenance one can get done without projects and homework due.  this week: 1. rearranged some furniture 2. put up a shelf 3. cleaned out my closet 4. ran consistenty 5. finally watched a movie 6. got some minimal things done on my bro's website   so, what else is going on in rabbitwood?   i hear that jane byun is moving to sacramento. hm. sounds like a good excuse to get out of this town if you ask me. good fer you, jane. and if my calculations are correct, EVERYONE is moving out or away. vicky & mary, cyn, jane, thuy. and i will no longer have a reason to stay here myself. new york, here i come.  i guess there is no roadtrip to canada happening, ay? i'm working at school and at the internship, and well its june now.  the interview at deutsch was interesting. i love the building. if you saw it, you would smile at it and then head to the beach like i did.   all the places that i interviewed with, i think would be great places to work.  i have an interview with  urlLink maddocks  tmrw, they're a design agency.  one other odd thing, EVERYONE that i've interviewed with has been female. and here i am, a graduate of a design program overrun with older white male professors thinking that there are more men than women in this field, seeing how wrong i am. almost everyone at deutsch that i saw were women, the art directors at look-look and yvonne duran design are women, and the art director at maddocks is a woman. and they've got kids. thank betty friedman.  i'm so glad school is over. so glad. cal state fullerton can kiss my sweet yellow arse.

        my dog had diarrhea. eww.  first, she was constipated... i new something was wrong with her last night, because her stomach was twice as full as it normally is and she kept drinking a ton of water because she was dehyrdated. i took her out to pee and poo, but she only peed. and then last night before my brother fell asleep at like 3 am, he took her out to poo, and he said she made the biggest dookie he ever, AND she made those wincing noises, like it hurt coming out. hahahahaha. and then in the middle of the night, she went diarrhea all over my brothers computer cables. hahahah. she couldn't hold it, and i think she was trying to avoid the carpet by going on the cables, but it made it even worse to clean up. and since then she has gone diarrhea twice today. i slept through the whole incident. poor annie.

       So I emailed my motion graphics teacher telling him how i was doing with my life and i commented on my thoughts on advertising:     Right now I'm interning with a design studio specializing in publication> design. I'm not too sure if the advertising industry would suit me so well> anymore, the whole brainwashing the masses aspect of it has been nagging me> for a while. But who knows, maybe I'll be swallowed up by corporate america> after all, and start producing all commercial work for the money thats it> in. Doubtful, but you never know.  &nbsp;   To which he replied:   "There's a strong tendency among advertising folks to become cynical and tomock consumers.&nbsp; I always thought it's too bad.&nbsp; People need stuff, buystuff, and advertisers basically tell people that products exist and abouttheir distinctions.&nbsp; Advertising is a service and a useful one.&nbsp; Someproducts aren't that exciting, sure!&nbsp; But if they fulfill a need, if theyhave some worth (a good price, good quality, or whatever), then it's a goodservice.&nbsp; So if you can shield yourself from those negative attitudes andtruly see the worthwhile aspect of advertising, AND the exciting artisticaspect of it, then you may enjoy it!&nbsp; BTW, cynicism always ruins things --so stay positive, do what you care for, and have faith in your decisions andin your passions -- don't let superficial, elitist, silly, misguided peopleget to you!!!&nbsp; ;-D"     which is always the flip side of the argument that i wrestle with. it seems to require some self-convincing to see advertising as a service. I don't know when I became such a cynic. I didn't even realize that I was being cynical. but&nbsp;I suppose I am. why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things? its always&nbsp;good to have an objective perspective tell you otherwise. so i'm glad he took the time to write what he did.

       so i've almost finished my bro's website design. now i just need to make a few buttons and some small graphics, create some templates for the info pages&nbsp;and then make it work technically. i wish i new flash. i'm going to learn it if it kills me. can you still buy programs at discounted rates from school if you are registered for 3 units? i should call the bookstore.  i think that i will be holed up in my room for the next four days or so, making the website work and then creating my own and making my promo stuff. my portfolio review is aug. 5 and i think i'm going to be busy at the internship for that whole week, so i wont have time next week. i don't need to be there til the 29th but after that i'll probably be spending more time there.  and then after that i guess i should plan the camping trip. i've got my $5 road atlas from target that i shall peruse. i should take inventory of what people have and who want to actually commit to going, ay?  i think ideally i would just want to do freelance work. no guarantee of work, but hey, when did i ever need a guarantee? no security is fine with me. but i think i still need more experience. at least in the other aspects of work, like admin, billing, etc.  my dad is 62. he was 37 when my brother was born. what was he doing for 37 years?  the guy that did my taxes didnt return any of the other papers i gave him. AND he didnt include one of my W-2s. that would be at least another $100 return. so now i don't even have the papers to do it myself. AND he's had these papers since april and he JUST finished them in July.&nbsp;wtf, man,&nbsp;I have the easiest possible taxes that can be filed. next time i'm just gonna&nbsp;file them myself. why would i pay you to screw them up when i can screw them up on my own for free? jerky.

       i've decided that i don't like mondays anymore. i know there's a general consensus of not liking mondays, but i never have previously.   anyway, its unbearably hot today. i fed the dog some ice. she likes crushed ice.  so plans for the week:   T  beverly hills to pick up products  W  cerrick spins at the standard dt  Th  photoshoot in LB  F  Dad's birthday &nbsp;  it was a long weekend. props to chae for being the master car magician, thanks to vicks for giving&nbsp;me, chae,&nbsp;n&nbsp;cyn&nbsp;2&nbsp;great&nbsp;hours at disneyland and sleepy mexican food, thanks to m. for the outing to silverbake, and shaking her booty with me at lina's party, and thanks cyn. for spending sunday with me and making yourself friendly at sisi's bbq.  &nbsp;   weird news of the week : aaron and candice are together. i thought it odd. but i guess there have been stranger couples to hook up in the past.

        no cavities  i brush aggressively. don't like flossing much.  i've fitted my new nightguard that my brother bought from rite-aid. you can heat it and then custom fit it to your teeth. its to prevent teeth grinding, but i'm using it to keep from clenching my jaw when i sleep.  PLANS for a friday night:  the ballet . giselle, by the royal ballet. ten bucks, rush.  kill bill 2 . at the dollar theatre. one buck. i think this movie has definitely lost its novelty by now.  cerrick @ spaceland . hm. too far.  see teresa  off at the airport.

       so after the funeral the girls went shopping, because jeannie wanted to go shopping, and her dad having just died, who among us is going to object to what she wants to do to keep her mind off of the matter?  so we went to brea, and then we took NINE girls to rennaissance cafe. it was a bit of a squeeze, but it was fun. i also recruited more people for roadtripping. i was sitting next to marisha n cyn n crystal, and they all have the travel bug. crystal was asking about where she could go on roadtrips, so i gave her a few ideas. and everyone is very up for camping (roughin it) and taking ONLY the younger guys, definitely NO jy   i bought: the count of monte cristo, several raving recommendations, and short stories by john updike.  so esther oh is going to india for missions, james paek went to turkey today, teresa among others is leaving for ukraine on friday. i think gina is also going somewhere but i dont know where.

       and now i'm sitting here, and should be building my bro's website.  i slept 8 hours last night, woke up, payed bills, balanced checkbook in money, went to eat wahoo's at 3 and then i took a nap from like 5 to 8 and i dont know why i slept so much. probably catching up from the previous days of not enough sleep. so here i am, 9pm and i've done nothing much today. chae asked if i wanted to watch kill bill 2, but i was planning on working on stuff, so i stayed home, and then cyn called after her show from LA and if i didnt have my internship tmrw i would have gone out to play, but i thought i should stay in. i was gonna run, but then i would be sore tmrw cuz i haven't run in like 1-2 weeks. so i'm gonna start on the site, cuz starting is the hardest part. but first i'm gonna eat.

        happy fifth of july  so yesterday, like many other fourths of july past i figured we would be spending a lot of time trying to find something to do, like places to watch fireworks, and then not really end up doing much of anything, like how it usually is. hehe. so cyn called me after church cuz she wanted to hang out and then i called chae, so they started heading down, and i called jane to see what she was up to. "starting dvd with bro" so i went over there, and we watched bad boys II (because its james' fav. movie, but he was passed out on the couch in the living room not watching it) and waited for cyn. our options were: a. watch kill bill 2 at the dollar theatre, b. watch fireworks from malibu, c. throw together a last minute bbq, d. go to the fullerton hs where they have the little fair thing. and jane of course just wanted to e. stay in and watch movies.   then serra called and invited us all over to have a bbq at her house. last minute. so gina cooked her world famous duk buk gee, and the guys bbq'd some galbi, and me n cyn made that old bethel staple: ice cream soda float (except this time we used key lime ice cream w/ pineapple juice n 7up). but there wasn't enough food cuz serra originally planned on inviting like 4 people. so gina cooked some dumplings. and marisha and janem came by, and then jeannie and stacs with her new puppy sammy, and then we watched 50 first dates while the guys went on a starbucks run. i didnt expect the movie to be good, but it was sweet like wedding singer. we paused it in the middle to go outside and watch fireworks and from up on that hill, we could watch 20 different fireworks shows. and then serra busted out her 100 sparklers that she bought, which hyun made fun of. and after expiring all of them we wanted s'mores, so people went to the market. we watched the rest the movie and ate s'mores while hyun, mike and james paek sang and played guitar outside. and then we had the bright idea to play texas hold'em. one dollar to play. its hard with 10 players. people started leaving as they lost out of the game. and eventually we all lost our money to stephen and then we wanted a chance to win it back so we played blackjack against him as the house/dealer. and of course we lost more money, mostly petty change. so we finally went home at 2am, i drove cyn back to jane's and james was hanging out with his little friends outside. we said hi and bye. it was nice way to spend a fourth of july.

       no really, there were NO funerals and weddings when i was little. not until college. i've never been to any with my parents. these are all people i know personally. the circle continues...   anyway, it was the saddest thing in the world when jeannie shoveled the first pile of dirt. burying your own dad. sink my heart. i think everyone just tried really hard to make it not sad, and help her not think about it. i'm sure it must be exhausting to be in and out of the hospital everyday for as long as she did it. so i'm glad we made some happy memories around the two days. the nice thing about the weekend was seeing everyone again, jane byun came down, YAY. and having meals together and catching up. we invaded that buffet twice in one weekend. but the sadness of everything for me can be summed up by what i told jane byun: when i went to staci's dad's funeral, it was like, oh how sad, he died so young, and then when i went to thuy's dad's funeral it was, she's my age, and her dad is around the same age as my dad, and it could just as easily be my dad. and then with jeannie's dad's funeral, now i feel like this is how its going to be. we're ALL going to have to say goodbye to our parents. you always know so, but it feels so far away. now it no longer does. and isn't that the saddest thing?

       maybe it's more apparent when your twenty to notice weddings and funerals, cuz i'm sure they are happening when you're younger, you just don't pay THAT much attention to them...but yes it does seem like everyone is dying and everyone is getting married...circle of life i suppose...
