      last night was insane. brian and i went to a bbq at has's house early in the day. has wasn't even there yet - so we hung out with his family & drank beer. they made so much food. i swear - i had never seen anyone deep fry a turkey before - but it was unbelievable! mmm. so tasty. haha anyway, after a long day of drinking - of course it ended in a night full of drama. brian and i ended up in some dumb fight because he got mad at some of his friends because he thinks they want to "bang" me. then, i got mad because i didn't feel like anyone did or said anything offensive - and i felt like i wasn't being given a chance to fend for myself. anyway - we're not mad anymore. the whole thing was dumb. and i think we both blew it out of proportion. lesigh. drinking is the devil.

      last night the dinner plans i mentioned earler came through. frank made a kick ass dinner & we got to catch up a bit. it had been a long time since i'd seen him last, so of course armed with a few glasses of wine in me i asked a lot of questions that i'd been waiting a long time to hear the answers to. unfortunately they weren't ecactly the ones i was hoping to hear, but it was nice just the same. i'm glad we got that over with. closure is sweet.. anyhow, afterwards i met up with chris who was just getting off work. we went back to his house and watched some "fifth wheel" dating show. it was rediculous. it did make me realize how lucky i am though. no matter how bored i get with being alone, at least i can take comfort in knowing that i'm not as pathetic as the people i saw on that show. lol. ok, back to work.

      i have a headache. work was long as usual. i got a huge account today, which was good - but my stress level is pretty insane. i think i need to have some fun or something. all work and no play is making jenna a very dull girl. hmm. i've been thinking too much. i should be used to being alone all the time by now, but i'm not. it's making me insane. i should call desiree tomorrow & see if she want to hang out this weekend. that would be fun. hopefully some dinner plans will come through too. they've een discussed, but certain people are hand to come by these days. it's unfortunate that these people always seem to be the ones i want to see the most. this entry probably makes no sense - but it's after 11 (way past my bedtime), and i've already had three glasses of wine. forgive me or something.

      i feel so liberated. i finally deleted my bme page and bought an air conditioner in the same day! this is lovely. not only can i update my site in a comfortable climate - but now i can say ANYTHING about ANYTHING in my updates! i really don't know why it took me so long to do this. I should have deleted it in september, when i really started having bad feelings about the site - but shit, closure is closure and it's always better later than never. SO anyway, i'm at work right now. i had a new assistant start yesterday, and she's working out well. Her name is Pam, and she really is a sweet girl. Work has been crazy lately - and i really haven't had as much time to update as i'd like.. but that's definately going to change soon. i do believe i have some neew hate-mails and fan art to add.. which i'm going to do now. also, my show section is suffering like whoa - so that will be my project for tonight. lesigh. if an idle mind is the devils playground, than i must be an angel.

      alrighty, so - yesterday was my birthday. i'm twenty fucking three. and i feel old as hell. i worked all day - and it was a nightmare. my dad's partner claimed that he had given me an eighty eight thousand dollar check to send to an insurance company. i knew he didn't give it to me, but when we called the bank it turned out that the check had cleared. i had no idea where it could have gone, and the client who's policy it was supposed to pay for - was being cancelled for non receipt of premium. needless to say- both my boss and my client were ready to kill me. i was about two seconds from a nervous breakdown when julien called my office for the ten thousanth time that day, so i finally picked up. i explained quickly that i couldn't talk (both of the men were sitting right in front of me at the time) - and instead of a quick ok - he starts interrogating me about when i will be able to talk (in a pretty nasty tone i might add). i had no choice but to hang up on him. my boss was already five seconds from ringing my neck and i was five seconds from jumping out a window. well, anyway after a few more hours of hysteria - we found the money. it turned out that my new boss's wife had deposited it into my new company premium account - and had just forgot to pay the company. we overnighted a check to them - and the problem was solved. by then it was six and all i wanted to do was go home, so i did. at around nine thirty - desiree met up with me for some birthday drinks. we ran into some of my old college friends - and then took a drive over to AJ's house to visit. it was pretty fun, and it totally made my day seeing her. lesigh. i am really pissed off at julien, even though it isn't his fault because he didn't know what i was up against - but then again, with him there & me here - he never will know. and i'm fucking tired of the rude emails and one sided bullshit. i feel like i'm being penalized because i don't have time to sit around analyzing other people's actions and writing long winded emails about myself. i hate to say this - but only the word pretensious comes to mind when i think of him lately. he thinks that everything applies to him. everything. and it just doesn't. ughh. i suck. and luckily i'm too busy to care. anyway, i'm at work now - and i'm tired as hell. i hope today goes quickly. i really do. i need some time out like whoa.

      the last few days have been beyond entertaining. saturday desiree and i went into the village to see a comedy show at gotham comedy club. her brother's roomate was performing.. and he was hysterical. we drank a ton there - and talked to just about every comedian in the place. afterwards we took a cab uptown & ate at this really nice steak house that her brother works at. we racked up over a $120. bill there - and desiree got so shit faced that she fell off of the bar stool and landed smack on her face! it was pretty scray at the time.. because her eyes were rolling around - but now the whole thing is pretty funny. needless to say, her brother was pretty pissed off. haha. i grabbed the keys to his apartment & we walked over there. desiree must have puked on every block in manhattan by the time we got there. hehehe. anyway, we went to bed & took the train back to jersey sunday morning. armed with severe hangovers, we made it to her families brunch by 12. we were both looking a mess - but at least we showed up, lol. after brunch she came with me to my mom's house & we drank a few beers... haha. she was so tired - so i finally dropped her off at her place. after that i headed over to Olives to meet up with Kevin & Brian. it was a benefit. and yeah, i drank again. haha. i got home around 9pm sunday - and i don't remember much between then & now besides work & sleep. lesigh. ya think i should stop drinking? nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

      wow. i never really write in here anymore. that's not a good thing now, is it? hmm. well, things are finally changing (for the better). work, although still hectic, is becoming a little less stressful. thankfully, david hired this guy to work with me a few weeks ago. his name is frank, and i'm starting to think that he's my guardian angel. (you think i'm kidding, but ever since he joined us, good things have happened) it's really nice having a partner around here. i was getting so used to dpoing everything on my own, and it's such a relief just to have someone to discuss things with. i can't even begin to tell you..

      finally. something nice to talk about.   first thing being, today is friday. know what that means? i get to sleep late tomorrow. that's got to be one of my favorite things to do.  as for last night, i had a really great time. after work i took my mom out for dinner at Caruso's, and had a few apple martini's and a delicious filet mignon with galrlic mashed potatos. mmmmm. it was so very good.  afte dinner, i went to visit a new friend i hadn't seen in a while. we watched lord of the rings and stuff. i ended up getting so sleepy, that i stayed over - which i probably shouldn't have done. miraculously, i made it to work on time, and even had time to stop home to change & clean up. i thought for sure i was going to be late, but i wasn't.   it's nice when things go right for a change.  anyway, as for the weekend - i have no idea what i'm going to do. i guess someone will ask me to do something, and i'll do that. the only thing i really have on my agenda it to hit up the book store, because i'm fresh out of new material.  oh yeah, i heard this song on the radio on the way into the office this morning. i know i never heard it before and i have no idea who sang it, but the chorus went something like this:   "i don't know you, but im with you"  i don't know, for some reason i just found the whole thing very ironic.  anyway, it's time to make some money.

      another day, another dollar. meh. yesterday was eventful. my mom had to go to the hospital for some tests, because she's hemmoraiging. it's probably pollips that ruptured or something, and she's going to need surgery. she's going back to the doctor tomorrow for more tests and to make a date. obviously, my dad is really worried, and that's not the best thing for him to be doing in his condition. such is life, i suppose. in any event, my partner stopped by for a while last night to talk. he's not having such a great week. while he was there i ended up unpacking about 10 boxes of books, then did some laundry, cleaned out my closet, and made my bed all prety with new sheets. after he left, i just couldn't fall sleep, so i watched hbo until i had work this morning. now it turns out i have to run home on my lunchbreak & change so that i can go to a meeting in the bronx after work. after that, my attorney and i are grabbing some dinner & then i guess i'll be heading back to glorious new jersey. i wish this week was over already, i'm wiped.

      Welcome to the rest of my life. I'm alive again. I feel like I just lifted my head out of a cloud of dust... I perceive everything more clearly. People, music, emotions, subtleties.... My eyes are different. I'm just at peace with things right now. They're not hard. And that was what I wanted. I'm making sense of it all.  For the first time in a really long time, I am not attached to any person, or to the idea of any person. And now I get to exist and think and make decisions entirely on the basis of me. And I think that is really important to do, particularly when I am trying to figure out the direction I want my life to head in. This is healthy. And if I spend time in this place and find out I'm heading in the same direction I always thought i wanted to be in, then all the better. Because then I would be at peace with it, knowing I made the choices that were best for me, not just for someone else.   Life is starting to get real and I am putting my head on straight. I am not afraid. Que sera sera.

      The dangly tinsel of life no longer feels in any way important to me. Do stupid, superficial things like clothes and image and status really matter? No. I always would've said no, but some part of me would think, yeah, but... what would people think if I did X... or if I didn't do X... And now I truly, deep down, don't care. Few things are more meaningless to me than shallow appraisals and there are few things I have come to resent more. So if I don't close the goddamn shade once or twice, what does it really matter?  I wouldn't have done very well at all back in the day when women were expected to be something I'm not. That would have sucked. And at the same time, I think I would've been far better off if I lived in a culture were people courted each other for a while, got to figure out what they wanted and got to know each other, and then got married. Even serial monogamy is a little upsetting to me at times. I know very few people who see things the way I do in terms of relationships and emotions, but I think I'm just not suited to the have-a-relationship/have-sex/break-up sequence that everyone else seems to be A-OK with. I'm not A-OK with that. I don't find it appealing. And I don't need to date dozens of people in order to figure out what I want. I know what is good and what I want. Even if I'd never had chocolate before in my life, I could eat it for the first time and say, "hey, that's really yummy." I wouldn't need to sample several dozen different kinds to make that assessment. And when we're talking people, the concept of "sampling" is abhorrent to me. I'm not saying that other people can't do it or that I'd judge them for it, it's just not right for me and I'm realizing that.   i am what i am...   (a girl who despises lonely nights thinking)  p.s. if you'r reading this (which, i hope you're not because i'm drunk and rambling) i hope your day has improved and you're feeling much better now. oh yeah, and i really miss you.

      tuesday it is. hmph.  i have not been a very good girl this week, so far. i almost missed work entirely on monday, and was late again today.   i don't know. sometimes i just can't keep my shit together, you know. i need to find something to look forward to. i'm starting to feel very trapped in my current situation. When i wake up in the morning, all i can think about is how i don't even want to get out of bed. but i do. i do it every day. (admittedly, some days later than others)  i think i am starting to learn how to handle these feeling more maturely, but i still have a lot of work to do on this. i need to feel better about myself. i need to something for me.   in any event, i just registered for summer classes. I am going for an accounting degree. I have always been good with numbers, and it's something that i can easily apply to my insurance background. i think that just knowing that i am qualified to do something else in the future, will make me feel a lot better about where i am and what i'm doing now. plus, i think some extra knowledge in the money management field never hurt anyone....  more than that, it's something that will make me feel good about myself, make my father proud, and hopefully provide me with something to fall back on, just in case my world continues to crumble around me.   I realize now that i never got to choose my career. I started working in this business when i was 13 years old. My father got sick not too long after, and no matter how much i disliked the pressure and people i had to deal with, it just didn't feel like leaving was the right thing to do.  Now, i find myself in a similar situation, but without all of the *perks* that came along with working for my father. I dn't see myself going anywhere. I don't see any opportunity here. All i see is me - doing exactly what i'm doing now - every day - for eternity. And hating evety second of it.  i don't know why i am so excited about going back to school, but i am. it's been such a long time since i have been able to do something for myself, and it feels so good to have something to look forward to again. something i actually want.   All of this was around before of course, but it was different. I used to feel good about what i did. I took pride in certain things, things that i no longer have the luxury of doing.  I wish i could write more, but you never know who's going to be reading this.   The bottom line is that i know what i want to do now. I know what i have to do to get there. And i'm starting the process right now. before it's too late.  And I'll get it done this time. I really will.

      I woke up this morning, as I have woken up so many mornings recently, into the world I wanted. I believed it would happen, and it did.   We do what we need to do to survive, and in those moments there is no right or wrong, there is no propriety. There is only instinct. There is only what we have to do to get ourselves to the next breath. Only later do we turn to the matter of understanding what these choices have made us.   I have learned what happens when I feel the wall against my back. I become efficient, minimal, brutal. Cut the lines and take down the sails and get below deck. Life becomes a matter of risk assessment, of contingency plans and how far I am willing to go. My father always taught me that the greatest strength is in perseverance. I will win not because I am quicker, or more powerful, or more skilled. I will win simply because I can endure more. Because I will outlast you.   The challenge is knowing when the battle is over. When you do not need those instincts anymore, when you should not react to every touch like a blow.   I guess the real question is: will we ever learn?

      somthimes things happen. often, they aren't what we'd like them to be. i don't know. i guess i'm a little frightened right now. (the reason i'd prefer not to discuss) but, i know that as long as things are ok today, then chances are they will be ok tomorrow. at least, this is what i'm trying to convince myself of.  it's hard to know what to expect from people sometimes. it's even harder to expect nothing at all.   that's what i'm trying to learn how to do. this may sound silly, but the smallest things can be such a pleasant suprise when you dont expect/want/thinktheyshouldhappen.

       "As long as you are alive and aware.... your obligation is to experience as much of the world as possible as vividly as possible... The tragedy, from an existential perspective, is that many people never do this. They lead the unexamined life, they never realize how lucky they are to be alive and aware, and they eventually lose their awareness never having realized what a special gift it was."  - David Funder, The Personality Puzzle   Things I know to be true about myself:  (you and I are one and the same) I am a very intense person. I experience life in a very vivid way. My mind is my greatest tool, but I live by my heart. I make most decisions with a combination of the two, but if you ask me to choose, my heart will always win.   I need to understand life. I've been doing some pretty heavy reading lately, and i'm realizing that it's all about trying to understand what happens to you in the context of the way you see life. You have this perception of why things happen, and what they mean, and who you are. And then things happens, and you make mistakes. And you don't know why, you don't know what that means, and you don't know who it makes you.   (and maybe you find a way to reconcile that, to understand it, or maybe you lie and bury it in yourself and destroy everything around you trying to do penance. Maybe you hate your life so much you decide to break it irrevocably into pieces. )   you don't understand, at that moment, how irrevocable life can be. How an action, or a choice can change your life so permanently and significantly. When you're younger, nothing seems permanent. You don't understand how not everything can be fixed, how a single choice can enter your life with an impact so catastrophic it changes every moment that follows. You act carelessly, and you pay for it.   Kierkegaard spoke of two armies, and a knight invited to fight for both. "He chose one side, was defeated and taken prisoner. As prisoner he was brought before the conqueror and was foolish enough to offer him his services on the the conditions originally offered. I wonder if the conqueror would not say to him: My dear fellow... at one time you could have chosen differently, but now everything is changed." So it is, and so it must be, if our choices are to mean anything.   To understand me, and what has happened, you need to understand where I come from. You need to understand my world, the way I love, the unity I seek, the weaknesses in my wall and the way I have built it. You need to understand my bottom lines, my absolutes, and the desperate ruthlessness I am willing to employ to hold fast to them. You need to speak my language. I have not spoken it for so long. And to live in silence is to never fully grasp the way life intersects with you.   words are the way we take what happens within and make it external. The way we know.   I am beginning to understand.

      We need to live to completion. All of us. I do. and so do you.   Looking back upon my life, the moments, the eras of my life I am happiest with are the ones I appreciated- the ones I was completely conscious of, the ones I swallowed completely, the instants I used to their fullest. We waste so much time complaining, taking things for granted, refusing to accept this moment or that feeling.   I would rather eat food and taste it for as long as I can, to feel the texture and temperature and every ingredient that was added... this is not to say I never swallow anything whole. It is simply that I do not remember it when I do. We lose so much of life to lack of recollection, lack of imprint. When we don't write things down, when we rush through them so we don't have to feel too much, trying to get to the next place and the next place and....   When was the last time I was here, and nowhere else? It was the he other day, actually. Every second full of sensation, and there is nothing I would have said or done differently, no other way I would have moved. I was deliberate, I was aware, I was present. And i was thinking: this is what I want every day, every morning, every second.   This is what I want.

      "I started to accept the mess I'm in. I know that mess spelled backwards is ssem and I felt much better armed with that information. " -Tori Amos  Life's just full of uncertainty, isn't it? Some people are far more OK with the uncertainty than others. I can live with many aspects of my life scattered to winds, but there are other things I'd just rather have set in concrete. This, of course, will never happen, because all things in live are subject to failure and unforeseeable collapse. I would prefer not to worry about this, I would prefer to take it in stride or even with hopeful anticipation.   I would rather smile than reach for a cigarette when life throws a curve ball my way.  It's all about finding peace.   I feel like I've been waiting and waiting and waiting for something to settle out, but then there's always the next thing and the next thing, and soon X years of your life have gone by and there's no sign of level ground. Because there is no level ground.   Lesson of the century: I need to take things as they come, each day, and not waste the time "in between" by wishing it away or wishing it different. I need to be thankful for what i have, and less distracted by what i don't.  the end.

      hmm. where to begin.  last night? ok. fine. i went to manhattan to meet up with my sister. she was supposed to meet me at 9:30 at Seen's Tattoo, but never showed. Many hours later she finally arrived with about 10 corn fed michigan kids. don't get me wrong, they were all very nice - but not exactly what i had in mind for the evening.  I was SUPPOSED to go to brooklyn, to hang out with this guy jimmy and his roomate. Of course, he had no cell phone, and i couldn't get in touch with him to tell him what happened.  So, we all ended up going to this crappy bar across the street from the shop. I was so upset, i was slamming shots and cran & absolutes until i finally threw a hissy fit, and broke down into tears.   It was fucking pathetic.  Seriously, i think i was just looking forward to hanging out Jimmy all day, and i was so scared he was going to get mad at me, that i was overly pissed off at everyone in a ten foot radius of me.  ugh. anyway, i finally got home at 5 am. tired. upset. and drunk as shit.....  I woke up at 4:00, and called him. Thankfully, he didn't sound very mad. That made me feel a lot better, but still, i am really upset that i fucked up. The messages i got this morning revealed that he was waiting for us at a bar until 1 in the friggin morning. i feel like such a shit head.  ugh. my name is jenna. and i am queen of all fuck ups. thankfully i got a rain check for sunday, so hopefully i'll have better news to report then.  i think tonight i'm going to AC tonight with some friends, if they actually call me back. Right now, i'm getting ready to go visit my mom and pick up some money, then over to my friends house to pick up some trees. . .   bah. i'm still grumpy. someone shoot me please.

      Yesterday was Typical Typhoon Tuesday with its crazy back to back calls and astronomically long hold times, and it's continued into this morning. *shrug* . maybe this afternoon it will get better. Who knows...who cares. Yesterday i wanted to blow up my entire office, really.   After work, i ended up out in south jersey and had dinner and some drinks with Traci. It was a great time as always. And ther was even an added perk.. an unexpected message which truly made my night.  In any event, fortunately one of my girls showed up to work today, so instead of having a heart attack, my mental energies are being poured into deep consideration of who I am right now and where I thought I would be at this time in my life.   Conclusion: Even the best laid plans do not always succeed.   I really do live life day by day without any serious '5 Year Plan' in the back of my mind. but, a certain spiritual unrest has presented itself and I am at a loss on how to pacify this need. I mean, it's not a real surprise since I have never found the answer before, but such is the ever turning wheel of life.   I think I shall slam the last gulp of this coffee and grab some lunch, and contemplate the meaning of humanity.   Have a nice day.

      I hate Mondays! bah. You ever see that movie office space? well, mondays make me want to take all of my fax machines to a field and kick the shit out of them while NWA songs blast in the background. did i mention that BOTH of my assistants called in sick? haha. just my luck.  Anyway, onto nicer things...  This weekend was pretty cool. Saturday night Traci came over to visit. We took Michael to NYC to go to Manitobas for drinks. First we went to Seen's Tattoo and met up with Shamrock and *The Dark Lord* haha. Then we all headed over to Boxers for dinner. After that, we took a cab to manitobas, and man, the place was PACKED. I drank entirely too much while i was there, and proceeded to get my ass kicked at pool. Traci, on the other hand KICKED ass. she is a hustler in the making, i'm telling you!  Ok, so we made it home around 5 in the morning. I was so drunk, i couldn't sleep. I think i watched a few episodes of Six Feet Under on DVD, and eventually passed out.  As for sunday, i was basically a waste of air most of the day. At 6 i FINALLy got off my ass, and made dinner for my friends. I made Baked Ziti, Garlic Bread, and an Onion/Tomato Salad. mmmm. it came out really good, if i don't say so myself. Now I'm just waiting for Chris to call... *grin*

      oh yes. it is saturday, finally. last night i ended up drinking a bottle of white wine to the head, watching the last century of sex on the history channel, and passing out by 10:00. i woke up about an hour ago, and now i'm at the office. working on staurday is by far the most productive, because we are free from client's phone calls. i am very happy about that, because i have a lot of catching up to do. i must have bound 20 accounts yesterday, and i got ZERO paperwork done. i really hope i get some of that accomplished today. In any event, after work Traci is coming over to chill! i am still excited. She is my favorite drinking partner, by far. Plus it helps that we have EVERYTHING in common, so there is never anything lacking in the conversation department. The other day Frank (not my partner, my old school friend) and i decided to start up a new business, which we will cleverly refer to as "a modeling agency". I can see already that it will be successful. In addition to already reserving the company name and beginning the incorporation process, I've done hours worth of research and already found quite a few willing females to kick things off. I can't wait to tell Traci about it, because i'm sure she'll have some involvement too, in the future. I'm glad all of this is going on, because there are a few things going on in my personal life that i desperately need distraction from. The newest problem being, that i'm starting to catch feelings for a certain guy, who in return shows little to no interest (ouch), and the less suprising problem being that now BOTH of my parents are currently ill, instead of just my father. ugh. anyway. guess who came home the other night? that's right, my sister. i haven't gotten a chance to see her yet, because apparently she brought a bunch of freinds home from school, but i am looking forward to that too.  (don't you just love how whenever i start to think of something that makes me sad, i quickly switch into thoughts that make me happy?) well, i do.

      I am so exhausted.  last night traci, julie, michael, and i drove out to maryland for a bme bbq. It was nearly three hours away from here, so we left around two - and made it up there a little before five. man, maryland is awful! there is nothing to do, nowhere to go, and nothing to eat! i would kill myself if i lived there, haha.    luckily the state was no reflection of the bbq. we got to see a lot of people. old friends and new. there was suspensions, pullings, and fire play. oh what a night!     i don't know. i guess it was good for me to get out of town for the day. this weekend i was feeling really sad and alone (for no good reason, other than that i'm too sensitive). all i can say, is that i am so lucky to have such great friends. just when i was feeling completely down, they pulled me up again.

I have always said it is about figuring out where the next foot is going to fall, and not thinking about anything beyond that. I can do that at least. for today.  *waits for the sadness to evaoprate*

       welcome to my boredom post. I suppose I could read some more, and probably will before I go to sleep, but I thought I'd opt for a little web self-expression before I go in that direction. Today was pretty productive and enjoyable... I finished off "the ethical slut" after work, took a nice bubble bath, and made a snack.  things are starting to slide into perspective for me. That's why the passage of time is so essential. If you wait long enough you can generally get objectivity and clarity. I am beginning to think that choices need to be made. I believe in being patient and understanding of where people are. But as a matter of respect to myself, there have to be limits. I'm not a toy, I'm not a piece of ass and I'm not anyone's doormat. I have been treated like all of those things at various points in my life, and I sure as hell won't let it happen again. The trick is not to do that to anyone else either, ever again. It is my responsibility to draw lines. It's just hard to know where to draw them, when so many things are so very vague.   I don't know what i'm talking about. and i'm babbling again.  this book i just finished reading touched me in a strange way. i can't exactly explain it now, because i'm working on an article that might put it all into perspective for me. we all know that i can't possibly make sense of all of these new found thoughts to you, when i haven't truly even begin to understand them myself - yet. i've gotten through a two page outline so far. one page dedicated to things that i cannot accept, and another dedicated to things that i desire.  by the way, i'm proudly learning the difference between wants and needs. that may seem rediculous to you, but i'm beginning to realize that most people are completely incapable of drawing that line. i'm making it my business to do this, because i'm tired of feeling empty and insecure, when - i really don't have any reason to feel that way.  i want to learn how to verbalize my feelings, instead of dropping hints and expecting people to read my fucking mind. this is number one on my priorities this week.  and i think i may have done that yesterday, for the first time.   instead of allowing my juvenile feelings and insecurity issues to take over, and saying something like "you make me feel like shit because you haven't: blah blah blah", i went with, what felt like, a much more accurate thing to say "it would make me feel much better if you could: blah blah blah"  small statement. big change. and god damnit, it made me feel good to speak like that, and really mean it. (even if it doesn't happen - and that i truly mean)  obviously, i don't want to feel like i'm not good enough, or not important enough, for anything or anyone. i don't think anyone does. if there's one thing i got out of this book (much elaboration to follow after a few friends read too, and i have time to discuss this further) it's that no one has control over my feelings besides me. the blame game got old a long time ago, and that's the truth. but actually accepting the fact that i am in total and complete control of the way that i allow myself to feel, well - that's a new concept for your girl jenna. and she's taking that ball and running with it.  people can't read minds. (another new concept)  so how do you know if i want more or less? softer or harder? that you're doing an amazing job? that you're making me happy? that i'm making myself crazy wondering? you don't know. and me looking out the window while you drive instead of looking in your eyes and saying what i feel ain't fucking helping. can you believe it took me nearly 24 years and several failed relationships to figure that one out. hah!  all those teachers must have been dead wrong when they said i was smart.  and i wonder why no one ever told me that growing up felt so liberating. had i known, i might have stopped running from this adulthood thing ages ago.  *sigh*  ok, ok. so i have to continue working on my outline now. then i'm going to read a little poetry, and get some sleep.

      things i want to remember to talk about (in no particular order)  1. my headache 2. chris and his good omens 3. poetry in the bath tub 4. wreak's mom's accident 5. sunday with willy 6. madball at cbgb's 7. monday with jimmy 8. discontent  ** e n d o f r e p o r t ** (don't you hate that?) don't worry, i'm not done yet.  ok. so. i have an awful headache tonight (1). i can't seem to make it go away. i probably shouldn't be typing, as staring at a monitor surely won't help - but fuck it. you all already know that i'm a computer addict.  (i had an action packed week, hence the lack of constant updates)  omitting my misery within the work place through out the week, my weekend was fairly fun.  unforunately i can't really remember what order everything happened in, because i was drunk a good portion of the time, but i surely remember having fun.  i honestly can't remember what i did friday night (oh the woes of a pot head) i think it involved cooking dinner for seth, and chris coming over, but i'm not exactly sure that wasn't the night before. but i do remember that, on satuday, julie came over to hang out. we drank, went out for pizza, and watched lots of lame movies on TV. it may not sound overly exciting to you, but i had a great time. she fucking rocks. i think she left pretty late, because i know i fell asleep within two minutes of her walking out the door.  sunday, i woke up really early. i was bored as shit, so i decided to take a trip to the freehold mall. when i got there the stores hadn't even opened up yet, but i was too focused on not going home, so i walked around for a while. then willie called me, and it turned out he was at the jersey gardens mall at that very moment, and all of their stores were closed too. we found the thing pretty funny, since we both knew that the only reason we were at a mall sunday morning was so that we could make it to the madball show later on, in clean clothes, without doing any laundry. seriously. who does that? (us).  anyway, after the whole plan-making-ceremony, chris called me. he agreed to meet me at the book store again, so i headed to borders, and went inside. he eventually found me sitting on the floor of the "speculation" section, browsing a book called the "new girl order". (how very embarrassing). ok, so - we made it over to the sci fi section, and as i bitched and moaned about my inability to choose more than one book, chris decided to reccomend GOOD OMENS, by Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. (2) Then, of course, he proceeded to lift his pant leg, and revealed a tattoo of the characters on the (angeldemon) cover of the book. I'd be blaintently lying if i didn't say that that i was more than intrigued, so (ofcourse) i bought it.  OH MY GOD! (that line would be much funnier if you picked up a copy) THIS BOOK IS INCREDIBLE! (seriously, so far - this is one of the best books i've ever read! no shit.) alright, so the point is - a new found respect for chris's ability to recommend books has been born. i don't think i ever want to go book shopping without him again.  Alright, so i also picked up some other books while we were there: Another E.E.Cummings, R. Kostelanetz Betting on The Muse, C Bukowski Bone Palace Ballet, C Bukowski  which brings me to poetry in the bath tub. (3) when i got home from borders, i stripped down and took a nice bubble bath, with a glass of merlot in one hand, and my brand new copy of betting on the muse in the other. mmm. it was so wonderful. i felt like i was (literally) washing my cares away. there's something about bukowski's work that makes me feel like i'm not doing so bad (or maybe i am, but i'm just not alone in it). haha. shit. i can't explain it. i guess i shouldn't have to.  "the pleasures of the damned are limited to brief moments of happiness; like the eyes in the look of a dog, like a square of wax, like a fire taking the city hall, the county, the continenet, like fire taking hair of maidens and monsters; and hawks buzzing in peach trees, the sea running between their claws, Time drunk and damn, everything burning, everything wet, everything fine." Betting on The Muse, C Bukowski (page 29)   words like that relax me. i guess words in general tend to relax me. *sigh*  alright so, i guess you're wondering why i was so in need of relaxion. well, at some point during my wonderful day, i received another phone call from willy, telling me that wreak's mom had been in an auto accident. (4) at that point, willy was still under the impression that she may have even broken her neck, so of course i was very concerned. i must have called wreak five hundred times, but i didn't get in touch with him until willy and i got into the city, but it all ended up ok, and she was fine. thankfully she's already home. which reminds me, i need to send her flowers in the morning.  man, my mind does not work in chronological order at all.   i picked willy up after my fantastic bubble bath, and we drove into the city.(5) we parked somewhere (nearly 12 blocks from CBGB's), and decided to walk. It was beautiful outside. we stopped at some mexican place for dinner, and had a margarita. upon leaving - we decided to (literally) take a tour of the village bar scene. we decided that we would stop at every bar we passed, and have a shot of tequila. needless to say, that by the time we reached CB's we were completely shit faced. Wreak eventually met us there, and we proceeded to have a great time.  I made my way into the dressingpotsmokingroom and had a seat. we smoked, and drank, and laughed, and caught up with some old friends. it was really nice. then, pretendyouresuprised, i ran off to the gallery with some beautiful punk girl - and got kisses. i felt somewhat bad about that, for no real reason. i have no spoken arrangement with anyone, but i'll admit it - it just didn't feel right. iobviouslyihavecaughtsomefeelings. in any event, the show was great and i had a fun time. i love my madball. (6)  alright, so i went home late sunday night, went to work monday, felt like shit, and then went home at 6:45. took a shower, and then....drove to brooklyn to hang out with jimmy. (7) he'd been on vacation all week, so when i heard he was home - i decided to ditch the nap idea, and take a ride. i had a really nice night too, as always. we watched TV with his roomate and drank a bottle of some great australian merlot. it was well worth the trip. this morning he woke me up mad early, and i made it to work by 9. and that, i never saw coming.   ahh. finally. the discontent. (8) actually, i changed my mind about talking about this now. i have no right to piss and moan after all of the fun i just spoke about having. i suppose i'll save this part for another day.  godi'mgladthat'sfinallydone.  *** e n d o f r e p o r t ***

      i got a lot done at work this week. i've really been concentrating on getting things done, that i've been pushing to the side for far too long. i've decided that rather than focusing on making money for other people, it's better to focus on less lucritive projects that tend to pile up and stress me out. so far, so good. i have prepare our nj quartely taxes next week, and that will be a hell of a lot easier to concentrate on when there aren't five thousand files surrounding me. you can actually see the surface of my desk right now. it's a rare occurence, but welcomed just the same. *sigh* time for a glass of wine and some reading.

      i think I'm at that place i've been trying to get to for so long. (i always say this, yes i know) but, i just don't feel like I want to hurt myself anymore. i'm not willing to allow it. i think a lot of that was the aftermath of the stuff I've gone through. i don't know what psychological mechanisms cause those feelings, but there's a desire for damage, for emotional self-mutilation. when I got very ill from my ulcers this past summer, there was a part of me that liked it. when I woke up with cigarette burns this summer (which are still a mystery) part of me liked that. and that's just freakin' sick. i don't want that anymore. i am ready to be healthy, emotionally and physically. And no one could do that for me, no one can make me choose upward movement instead of a downward spiral. i have to forgive myself. and it's not that i don't have regrets. i have great big giant ugly regrets. there are things I would give anything to go back and change. but I am standing here right now and I am going to stop digging the hole. yes, i still have the scars. and yes, there are still burn marks on my legs. but that's it. no more. i am strong now, and i'm not seeing the world through a lens of pain and self-loathing anymore. maybe that means that things can get better again. maybe that means that I can help someone else on his path to self-forgiveness. i don't know. i can only work with what I am given, with the doors that are opened to me. i can only do the best I can. maybe that's finally enough.

      traci and i had some well deserved fun last night! we met up with enrique and willie and we all went to the 640 for dinner. we ate all kinds of good stuff, like garlic shrimp, calamari, italian sausage, brocolli rabe, and filet mignon. mmmm. eddie is such an amazing chef. after all that, we went to cheeks (ooh, the tittie bar) and got trashed. there was this one girl in a yellow outfit that was so god damn hot. traci and i practically fell in love with her. then she walked over to us and said "how can i get up in there". we were like "haha we wish". we hung out there for a few hours, had a lot of laughs, and then everyone came over my house afterwards for more drinking and playing on the internet. it's 11:41 and half of us are still asleep. i hate daylight savings time, but i love my traci. we are going to barnes & nobles soon to buy books. i think we're going to start the atkins diet this week and get all sexy so we can make boys cry this summer. watch out new jersey. haha. thisgirlishappy.

      i laid in bed this morning torturing myself mentally for about a half and hour. that needs to stop. it needs to be summer and i need to clear my head and tuck certain things into the background. not purge them, not ignore them, just tuck them aside so that I can be alive. i need to live because the alternative is not what i want. i don't choose that.  i wrote a song late last night. it is about maps and love. i think it is pretty good.

      ack. tense. must decompress. why does my family stress me out so much? my mother really got under my skin today. she got in a car accident. all i wanted to do was help her, but she kept picking on me and ordering me around and taking out her control issues on me. i just can't handle that right now.   i'm in my room right now, and that at least feels peaceful and cool and good. i only have a few minutes left though, as julie and traci are on their way here. i'm glad they are coming, but i can't stop thinking about how i need some space in my life. i want to write and play music and breathe. i don't want silence, per se... i have plenty of silence in my life. i have deafening silence from the corners in my life that most desperately need words.   shit. am I a bad person? i never used to think so. i know a lot of good people care about me... i have always liked myself and been basically proud of my life and my beliefs and my choices. i just do not feel proud of myself now and feel like such a fuck-up. goddamn it. i finally feel strong enough to fight now, but the things in my life that i really should take a stand against would.. well... i just can't... yet.   i keep hearing these second hand reports about how much pain my father is in and it is incredibly upsetting to me. i wish I could talk to him. no, i just wish i could understand him when he spoke. i wish I could hug him and listen to him talk for hours and help him sort things out and make sense of things, which god knows I haven't been able to do alone. but I can't do that. i am pain to him. which is the most terrible thing I can imagine being. he resents me. he resents that i have the responsibility of taking care of everyone, and that i struggle with it - because there's nothing in the world he wants more than to be able to provide for all of us again. i don't want to hurt him so i don't speak. i never mention how hard it is, or how all of the responsibility is taking a toll on me. i just shut up and wish that i could bandage his wounds. i wish I could love this life he's givin to me, knowing how much blood sweat and tears he put into getting me here. i can't forgive myself for feeling like this. and i don't know if I ever will.   but still, at the root of things, i am not in the same kind of despair he is. i have this confidence that things are somehow going to be all right, that they will get better, that it will all work out. that everyone will be ok. allison will graduate college. get married. be happy. my dad will find peace. my mom will not always have to do so much care taking. i'll be able to provide more for all of them than i do now. it feels like a promise. i don't know why i believe it... shouldn't I be cynical and jaded and bitter? i'm not really. not yet, at least. if i'm strong enough to stand on my feet and face all of this now, it has to improve eventually. right?

      she was cuffed to the truth like the truth was a chair bright interrogation light in her eyes her conscience lit a cigarette and just stood there waiting for her to crack waiting for her to cry his face scampered through her mind like a roach across a wall it made her heart soar it made her skin crawl they said, we got this confession we just need for you to sign why don't you just cooperate and make this easier on us all  there was light and then there was darkness but there was no line in between and asking her heart for guidance was like pleading with a machine cuz joy, it has its own justice and dreams are languid and lawless and everything bows to beauty when it is fierce and when it is flawless  on the table were two ziploc baggies containing her eyes and her smile they said, we're keeping these as evidence 'til this thing goes to trial meanwhile anguish was fingering solace in another room down the hall both were love's accomplices but solace took the fall  now look at her book of days it's the same on every page and she's got a little tin cup with her heart in it to bang along the bars of her rib cage

      rotting. (again)  you think that on my day off, i'd do something productive. (wouldn't you?). i'm not.  not even close.  i'm running out of phrases for my thoughts. i'm tired of saying the same thing over, and over, and over again.  things are less complicated than ever, in a way. and more than ever, in another. i've given up on a lot, but i'm not tired of waiting for things to get better. i'm becoming comfortable with this. maybe it will never happen, but if i keep waiting - that means i have hope. and hope accompanies change on occasion, i hear.   this weekend was nice. i spent a lot of time with willy. he's having girlfriend troubles, and it's good that i'm around to keep him company. i guess, in a way, i miss having someone to want to say goodnight to every night, but i'd be lying if i didn't admit that right now, where i am is the best place i could possibly be right now.  alone .  i was watching casablanca for the millionth time the other day, and i noticed something. it was strange that it never occured to me before. i was watching the last scene, and found myself starting to think to myself (like i usually do), "what the hell is he doing!?! why is he letting her go!?!". and then it came to me.    feelings do not dictate everything.    some things are more important.   and you were right.   all along.  currently playing: AFI, morningstar

      so, what do i do now? do i just resign you to the title of "the great tragedy of my life"? cry quietly when I stumble across a photo of us, when I'm 40 and married with children?  i would get down on my knees and beg but i don't have the strength.  i have broken myself in half.  i have nothing left to offer except myself.  If that isn't enough, what can I say?  go lose yourself in someone else, in a haze of pot and alcohol and someone else's skin.  i have nothing left to give you but everything.   i'm very, very drained.  i'm sort of broken.  i have pulled myself up on the bootstraps of optimism for a very long time, and i guess i just need some sort of sign that things are going to work out.  some would say I've just been given one, but i... just feel so tired and so very inadequate.   i don't know what i want to do. go to bed? keep on typing? call you? give up?   will someone just please  urlLink tell  me what to do? i'm so tired of deciding. i always make the wrong decisions anyway.

      um... i don't know that I have anything terribly new to say right now.  i think i just want to keep talking.           i am pretty terrified right now.  want to know why?  because this is my life.  this is real.  this is a big fucking deal.  i know that 90-95% of life is the little stuff, and i pretty much shrug my shoulders at it and step away from it and continue on my merry way of attempted equilibrium.  but this is my life.  every once in a while these past couple days i've slipped into normal mode and the way i'm accustomed to dealing with things.  and then I remember everything that has gone on and everything that is going on.  And i realize that this is one of the focal points of light I used to talk about, the moments in your life where things converge and things are decided and...           i'm scared.  still... some part of me has a peace about it.  because I think that whatever is right will happen.  What I want, what I think is right does not necessarily dictate this, and I understand that.  But I can hope.  For a while there I was beginning to lose hope... in more than this, in everything.  But right now there is hope in my heart.  I have waited a very long time and I know how to wait.  So I will do that.    p.s. my  urlLink webcam  is up and running, finally.

      things to talk about are plentiful. i've been so very busy - and my mind is acting like one of those phone booth shaped glass cages that money blows around in, and the contestant gets to keep whatever they catch. well, except it's filled with thoughts, not money. (obviously) anyway i have hardly updated at all in the last week or so, so it's catch up time. i know i wont be able to write about it all now, since i have a ton if shit to do, but im leaving myself a reminder so that hopefully i fill in the rest when i find a few minutes.  note to self: (don't forget) rain on my parade the t-shirt riot the stolen bedroom crying drunk people the bme bbq the stolen bedroom (yes, again) the tattoo convention cbgb's the stranded pennsylvanian the 3 hours of sleep that cost me $150   :::[deep breath]:::  friday night one of my business associates from CT came to jersey to see the races at englishtown. he got to my office kind of early,  and helped me out with some pointers on applications and stuff.  anyway, we left my office around 4 and headed over to the  urlLink track . we weren't there long before it started raining, but we managed to catch a t shirt riot and witness two records being broken, (not too bad if you ask me). after that we left, since it was obvious the thing was being called, and we grabbed dinner & shot some pool. i got home around nine, because traci was supposed to sleep over, but i ended up falling asleep on the couch and traci ended up staying in maryland. when i woke up there were two people sleeping in my room (that i didn't know) and the entrance was so blocked i could hardly go in.   way to start the weekend from hell.  anyway, luckily i had some clothes in the dryer - so i was able to take a shower without disturbind the strangers in my bedroom. cough. cough.  then, one bad thing happened after another, none of which i care to discuss right now, because i need to stop being so pissed off before i go trying to make some sense out of all of it. let's just say that i am stressed out, and my body is ACHING. and no, you pervert, not that kind of sore. i played kickball, and sprained muscles i didn't even know i had. sigh. and, yes, of course there's  urlLink pictures .  time to do more work. more later.

      i just want to cry. (and i did) because this is how I feel sometimes.    like the most beautiful parts of me have been taken away, and nothing can bring them back.      tonight i was talking with a couple of other kids, and watching us interact, I realized the fundamental difference between them and me. They're normal. In the best possible sense of the word. I'm not. everything is so heavy for me, like I'm pulling a hundred pound weight behind me everywhere I go. nothing is light, nothing is safe or easy.      and we were talking and laughing... but it just didn't roll off me the way it was supposed to. I can't explain it. one of my frineds was telling me about what happens to organisms in the water when they come in contact with soap. They're lighter than the water, but the soap bonds to them and-- BLUB BLUB BLUB -- they sink to the bottom like stones. I feel like everything I touch or think or do just... sinks.      i want to run away. But what am running away from? Myself. And wherever I go, I'm still there. I'm trapped in this body but it's too wounded and I want out.      this page will make a really interesting psychological study someday. do any of you see it that way? those of you who know? this is how someone reacts, when...      i'm sure I'll fascinate me someday.

      i am just hungover, tired, and fed up today. i hate when i drink TOO much. i especially hate when i drink TOO much, and consequently don't remember conversations &/or things that i've done. that is NEVER a good thing.   In any event, last night was still good in a sense. Traci and i ended up meeting an old "friend" (and i use the term friend losely) in new york. we went to this bar, and right off the bat he was acting like a total asshole. i can't understand people sometimes. i mean, why bother hanging out with people if you don't want to. does it make you feel good about yourself to sit around people you obviously don't like, and put them down and/or ignore them the whole night? hah. if he looked a his watch one more time i was going to rip his arm off. i swear. haha so, i drank too much, and i got angry, and we left..     we ended up going to some other bar up the road, where these really nice irish guys must have bought us a dozen shots of soco. hah. yeah that was what we needed. shots! after we went to a diner and tried to sober up for the drive home. looking back, we shouldn't have driven anywhere. but that's hind sight for you. too little, too late as always..     i don't know. sometimes i let myself hurt for no good reason. i'm really very tired of being like that. maybe it's time for another introspective week, who knows..     well, anyway - we made it home alive. it was very late, but i was trashed - so i made chris come over and hang out for a while. he is so nice. who the fuck drives over to a drunk person's house just because they say so, when the both of you have work at 9 am. hah. well, he did it. thanks chris..     mmm. so as for today - i'm pooped. i'm very much looking forward to going home and chillin out on the couch while i smoke massive amounts of pot. traci will hopefully come back over, and we'll probably end up drunk again, haha - but that's always fun. and i love my traci..     as for this weekend, we have ton's of plans. tomorrow we're going shopping for outfits to wear for the performace we're doing on sunday at the NYC EVENT. after that we're going to her dad's house for a cinco de mayo party, and after that we're heading to jean's house for another bbq. hah. i'm sure we'll be trashed then too..     sunday morning i'm sure we'll have the obligatory sunday omlettes and bagels.. we'll wait for lori to come over, and then we're all off to brooklyn for the event. It should be really interesting, and we're going to get to see a lot of friends, which is always nice. i doubt i'll have time to update this thing again until monday, so i hope all of you have a great weekend..

      drunk again. can't sleep.  in the past, when I came to the point of total catastrophe, i would imagine a reprieve.  i would imagine that through the force of sheer belief i could make it a mistake.  and I would be wrong, over and over, until I realized that grief is a disease, that it ravages and relapses, sleeps in the body waiting to be awakened.  and when it struck me down last week in all its recognizable agony, i stopped imagining. i put an IV directly into the vein and swallowed the slow drip of despair again and finally and again  and I felt myself spill over and i wondered if it had finally gone too far if I was finally gone if there would be anything left when it was done or whether it was time to move on from faith from who I was  but i would like to raise a glass now to the first unbreaking of my heart.  i would like to thank the hand that pulled me back from  the first white flag I ever contemplated waving.  you are the first man who has not profoundly disappointed me, who has given me something besides irresponsibility and apologies, and you are the only one who has ever unbroken me who has ever restored some kind of hope to me who has ever received what I offered with thankfulness, the only one who has ever tried to know what i was

      aggrivation.   i have a tendency to write about things that happen a few days or a few months after they occur, just to make sure that i'm being as completely rational as possible while i express my emotions.  with that being said, i'd like to let you know about my sunday night.  as those of you who read this on a regular basis know, sunday night i came home from my business trip in london. it was nearly an eight hour flight, prior to which i has spent three hours in Heathrow airport checking in and waiting on line. I was really looking forward to a late birthday dinner with Traci (my best freind), and Willy (someone i  thought  was one of my close friends). this had all been planned out before i left, for the record. Traci and Willy were to meet at my house before two. They were to go to JFK together, and arrive by 4 (when my flight let out) - and meet me at the gate. Traci and I then, figured, that we would all go out together for drinks and dinner, since i would need to stay awake until at least 12 - so that i could get back to the US time zone, and hopefully make it into work on time monday.  Of course none of this did actaully happen. Willy never called Traci. He blew her off, and instead of bringing her to get me, he decided to bring Wreak. (not that i didn't want to see wreak, it's just i know that those two are a timb bomb waiting to happen, when it comes to keeping to a schedule). Anyway, sice traci could not call them, she IM'd Wreak at around 4:30 - and wreak then explained to her that Willy did not have "time" to meet her - so he was on the way to Wreak's house. This was at 4:30. Traci did not see Wreak sign off until 5, which is when i assume Willy got to his house - since they arrived at JFK together).  As always, sunday's on the Belt parkway are a traffic disaster waiting to happen. They must have been in bumper to bumper traffic for at least 2 and a half hours, sice they did not arrive at the airport to get me, until nearly 8PM.  I feel the need to mention that the plane ride hoem has a lot of turbulance, i had PMS, and i had not had a moments rest the entire time i was in England)  Anyway, when they got there (without my best friend who i was dying to see), FOUR hours after I had gotten off the plane, i was in tears. I was also angry, dissapointed, and rude - without a doubt. In any event, Willy did much less than apologize. He didnt say one word all the way back to my house, and then he left.   All this would not bother me a bit, if i did not lay myself on the line and get him a job at my office. Now i have to go there every day and be ignored by a person that completely fucked me over and doesn't even have the decency to apologize.  The part that bothers me the most is, I wasn't even mad the next day. I figured it wasn't intentional, I was over sensitive, and that was that. I never expected him to be such a baby. really.  well, anyway - while initially i was all about letting bye-gones be bye-gones - now i'm not so sure. All the times that i sat there  and listened to him complain and yell about how badly certain people had fucked him over. Letting him stay at my house for days on end, so that he would not feel alone. getting him a job at my office, because i knew he needed one. All that, and he fucks me over. And on top of that, I let it go - and he continues to be a complete asshole, without even offering an apology.  You know - the only thing worse than being alone is having fake ass friends.  The sad part that is even if he was to realize what a dick he has been., he's already terminated our friendship. Well at least my being friends with him, because now it's obvious that he was never being freinds with me.   oh well...at least i know now, before i put myself on the line anymore for this one...

      life never ceases to amaze me.  today it's been brought to light that,  possibly , one of my good friends is afraid to date someone that i used to see, in fear that i would be mad. usually i'd appreciate that sort of thing, but in this case it makes little to no sense. for once in my life (and i think that it may actually be the first time), i am so completely "in like" with someone, that neither the past or  future emotions are interesting me in the least.  i'd like for my friends to be happy. i know that a lot of people say things like that, but i actually mean it. if one of my friends likes someone that i was involved with at one time, i would not have any problem with them seeing each other. i mean, shit doesn't work out sometimes. that doesn't mean that the other party involved isn't deserving of happiness!   the idea of "jealousy" has always offended me to a degree. no one owns anyone. if one is oh-so-concerned with the happiness and well being of those they care about, why would they let selfishness come between themselves, their lover, their ex lover, or their friends? i can't answer that really, because i think it's completely rediculous.  that's not to say that i don't appreciate that other people have those feelings, because i do. i would never hook up with someone if i knew that it would upset one of my friends, but at the same time - i kind of expect the people that i consider to be my friends to just  know  better than to expect that sort of behavior from me.  ugh. hopefully i've cleared all of this up for them tonight. kids, i'm all for it. and i hope that when you kiss each other, and look into each others eyes that you have the very same feeling i do when i'm with my.. well, whatever he is. let's just call him "that guy that makes jenna's knees buckle".  right now i'm thinking about this *thing* that happened not too long ago. actually, it was the night after the i was cured event in brooklyn. Traci and i met up with this guy Jimmy, who i was seeing (i think) at the time. i didn't know him all that well, but i liked him. well, maybe i just respected him, and was slightly intrigued by his intelligence and conversational skills - but in any event - we ended up at his place towards the end of the night. I drank way too much, and was confused. We fell asleep, and woke up to find that there was a small accident, and traci got a dime sized spot of blood (from a piercing) on his bed. He really made a huge deal out of it, and Traci felt absolutely awful. The whole thing brought me into tears, and after the whole crazy night - it just didn't "click" inside of my head, as to what was really upsetting me. initially i blamed the tears on the fear that he was "mad" at me, or something to that effect. for the next few days i felt awful (once again, not really understanding why). It all ended in a conversation, in which he (more or less) told me that we'd be better off going our seperate ways. during that conversation, i tried to fight it - and lost. but deep down in my heart i knew something was wrong, and i never did call him again. (in fact i deleted his number out of my phone, and burned the paper i had with his number on it, haha)  it took some time, but i realized something that changed me. first of all, i realized that he was right - it was better off that we didn't see each other any more. but, more importantly, i realized why i was so upset that night, to begin with. what made me cry like that. It wasn't so much that i was afraid that he was "mad" at me - it was the fact that he treated my friend like that, and made her feel that awful in front of me. It was, that because something "grossed him out", he let two girls (who he  knew  had drank entirely too much) drive home in the middle of the night, because he couldn't "emotionally handle" an accident. Had this never happened, and had he not made the suggestion that we were not to hang out "for a while", i know that i would have came to that same conclusion on my own - once the shock wore off. It's funny how things like that happen, really.   Incidentally, the very next day, I met Chris at a bookstore - and Chris is the one who is teaching me about  the way a man is  supposed  to treat a woman (and her friends, hehe) - which sadly enough, i never knew a thing about (needless to say, i've been swept off my feet - and we haven't been apart for more than a few days, since the moment we met - minus the two trips to europe we've taken this month, lol)  I guess some would call this fate...  (when one door shuts, another one opens - and sometimes it takes you to a much more wonderful place!)  the best part of this whole experience is that if somehow things were not to work out between us, i'd be ok with that, and i'd still (and always) want to be his friend. i mean, of course i'd be sad and dissapointed - because this all feels so good - but he has taught me so much about what i want and how i want to be treated. i am  so  greatful for that. i will always want him to be happy, even if it's not with me. shit, even if it's with one of my friends! he has taught me that i'd rather live alone in casa blanca, than with or without someone in a state discomfort, fear, or jealousy.   (note: i really should have learned this before Will passed away, but maybe i was just too young to understand, or even appreciate the comfort level and mutual respect in our relationship)  the not-so-point of all this is that my friends and their happiness come first. mine will always follow. although sometimes it takes a little while to realize this and act upon it, it always holds true. I want both of the "friends" i spoke of before to be happy. I want Jimmy to be happy. I want Traci to be happy. Shit, and the same goes for all of you. REALLY. you deserve it.  just follow your heart. at the end of the day i did, and i've never felt so complete.   Love You All -Jenna (the rambling queen)

      i got home last night.  the plane ride was long, and i got stuck at the airport for an extra three hours, waiting for willy & wreak to show up. needless to say i was in a shitty mood.  traci and julie came over, and went out with me for drinks. they saved me from killing people.  work wasn't all that bad today. i had a lot of catching up to do, but other than that no major dilemmas.  lalala. i miss chris. plop.

      tonight is my last night in london. and although i can't wait to get back home, i am slightly sad i didn't have time for a little more fun. yesterday i slept late, got a fancy hair cutt by a famous person, and then penny and dranna took me out around london for drinks. we got trashed with an 84 year old man (and yes, i have tons of pictures)  today i spent the day wandering around camden high street. I hit up some tattoo shops and made a few new friends. It was great, but it made me realize what I'm missing by leaving so soon.  I feel sort of depressed right now, but that's mostly because the phones at my hotel went to shit for most of the day, and i got an email from chris that he couldn't get through to me...  man, i miss him so much. If he was home I'd actually be looking forward to the seven hour flight I will have to endure tomorrow. unfortunately he's not there and i'm dreading it.  sigh.  sigh.  sigh.

      So, yesterday was my twenty fourth birthday. I am old. Sigh.  Yesterday consisted of several meetings, a business lunch, another meeting.. and ended with a wonderful birthday dinner at an amazing italian restaurant. Roger, David, Their wives, and Roger's daughter all came along. We had a really nice time, i think. I must admit though, i really miss my friends - especially chris. I called him last night hoping i'd get to hear his voice, but of course he was out to eat - and it was so late here i couldn't stay awake.  By the time i get used to this 5 hour time difference, I'm going to be on my way home - and waking up for work at 3AM. haha. maybe i'll just jump out of the plane on the way home instead...   xo

      London is beautiful!!  The flight sucked, but other than that the whole thing has been incredible. I made it through 5 meetings already, and they all went very well. Tonight Roger & David are taking me out to dinner at a great restaurant (happy birthday to me).  Last night, two of the guys that work for |Roger took me out for a night on the town. It was amazing! I got to go on the London Eye, eat at an amazing restaurant on the water, and drink tons of good wine. It was so great. I can't believe that these guys are so much fun!  Well, Im off.... time to do some more work!   xoxox

      life is pretty some days. today is my last "official" day of work, until 6/22. This will be, by far, the longest time i've been out of the office since i'm thirteen years old.  I got my passport in the mail today, from  amerian passport .  I was starting to get sacred that it wasn't coming, because i sent them all of the information / requirements last friday, and they claim that there is a 24 hour turn around. Although it took over four business days, I'm still pleased with their service - because I have my passport in hand, and i didn't have to go into the city to get it. Last night was kick ass. Julie and Traci took me out to dinner at Nonna's. It's a beautiful Italian restaurant next to my office. We had an incredible bottle of wine, a delicious dinner, and a hot waiter. haha. there was even a guy with a guitar there that sang happy birthday to me. In return I asked him to sing a song for Julie, so she wouldn't feel left out. haha so he changed the song "Hey Jude" into "Hey Julie".. and sang the whole thing. It was fucking hilarious. After that, we went back to my place and watched Casa Blanca. Then, Chris came over =). He stayed for a few hours, which (as always) made me a very happy girl. He is so good to me! Ugh, i am so lucky to have met this one. I really like him a lot.  And I realize it more and more every day. I know i keep saying that, but it's true. And of course i can't tell him all this, so I'll tell you! Ok, so three days until London. I still haven't packed, or even bought most of the shit I'll need -  but I figure after work traci will go shopping with me and i'll get a lot of that accomplished. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll get to see Chris while I'm in London, since he'll be around there doing his thing at the same time. I'm not counting on it though, since we only have a two day overlap - and then I leave for home. We'll see though. A girl can hope, can't she... Other amazing things happened yesterday as well at work, but I'm not going to go into it here. Let's just say that for the first time, in a really long time, i feel appreciated. Oh yeah, and today when i came into the office, my desk was covered in hello kitty gear, balloons, and birthday cards!! It was so sweet! My colleagues are the absolute best! alright, enough of my happy-babbles. time to do some work! xo

       GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You're in a phase when you may be tempted to start food fights at fancy dinner parties, wrap toilet paper around the trees in front of your adversaries' houses, and regard the juvenile delinquents of cable TV's South Park as worthy role models. I hate to discourage you from indulging this instinct for uproar, since so much of it could be fun and liberating. Therefore, I'm going to authorize you to go right ahead. But keep a fraction of your adult brain working in the background, ready to step in and halt the proceedings if you're ever about to, say, imitate the South Park kids' "How to eat with your butt" routine for your boss.   hehe!

      ugh. what a weekend.  i am so exhausted, it's not even funny.  friday night rahim, shamrock, and i went to NYC to hang out. we landed at Manitoba's, and didn't get home until like 5 in the morning. the den of degridation. awh yeah.  i couldn't go to sleep, because i had to get rahim home by 11, so that he could babysit his neice. we basically made it there on time, and then i dropped shamrock off at home, and went home to sleep. i slept the whole damn day, and night. willy and wreak came over at some point, but i was basically passed out the whole night. they crashed at my house, and sunday we went to the flea market and stuff.  then, brian decided to show up at my house, without calling first. i was so mad, not at him really - just at the situation in general, since i had to leave right after he got there. i hate when people just "show up" at my house, without calling. it's a pet peeve. anyway. the night ended up all crazy, and willy and i didn't get back to my house until 3 in the morning. it's a good thing he slept over, because i NEVER would have made it to work this morning if he didn't wake my ass up.  now i'm rotting at my desk, thinking about all the things i didn't get done this weekend. i leave for London in 6 days, and i haven't even done my shopping yet. ugh! i am such a lazy bastard sometimes.  anyway, i guess i'm going to try to get some work done. i hope that i get to see chris tonight. i wanted to visit him last night, but didn't get home until too late. no fun at all.  you know what i'm realizing? i like this boy.  i really do.   it's wierd. my usual trend is to start off liking someone a lot, and then as i get to know them, i become less and less interested. this is such a twist for me, because i like him so much more now, than i did when i met him. initially i was completely terrified of liking him, and now i feel so comfortable with all this. it's really cute.  heh, ok - i'm being a dork. just deal with it.

      alright.  so what if i could have things my way. what would i want then?  i'd want to move back home. i know that must sound stupid, because i grew up only an hour and a half from here. but, that's where i'd go. i miss my friends. i miss knowing where the best grocery store is. i miss knowing what shelf the sci fi books are on, at the local book store. i miss running into my old teachers at the coffee shop. i...  i'd want to go back to school. yes, i know i AM going back to school soon - but that's not my school. i'd want to go back to FDU. everyone that goes there hates it, i know. but, i didn't. i grew there. and when my dad got sick, and i had to leave, i left a part of myself there - that i really want back. i...  i'd want to go into a business where i felt utilized. i'm not saying that i'd want to leave the industry, because i know it, and some even say that i was born to be in it. i'd just want to be somewhere that what i did was accredited to me. not that i'd help my parents any less, but there's something degrading about working to take care of people, and getting no real credit. and even worse, it hurts to work so hard and have it written off to the people around you as something you should be doing to pay off your parents debt. i...  i'd want to not care so much about the people around me. i'd want to NOT worry about things and people's well being, especially when they, themselves, are not worried about it. i ....  i'd want to feel wanted,  but not out of necessity.   i'd want to stop being so emotional. to stop hurting like this over things i have no control over. i'd want to stop day dreaming about the life i know damn well i'll never have.  less realistically, i'd want my dad to be healthy again. i'd want my mom to live the life she used to have. i'd want my sister to be happy, at any and all costs. i'd want us to not have to struggle so much, for things that we never had to blink an eye over.   i'd want well.. everything i used to have.... except,  this time i'd actually appreciate it.

(alcohol is not included, of course)  as i told rahim last night, my goal is spiritual clarity. my motivation, is the fact that i look like a fat cow.  ugh, i'm not even hungry anymore. and it takes a hell of a lot less wine for me to catch a buzz.  i'm eventually going to slide into an actual diet, but i figure a few days of fasting will make it a lot easier for me to do the small portion thing.   god, i hate being female sometimes...

      this morning, my mom and dad came over for brunch. i made omlettes ( one vegetarian and one with canadian bacon), taylor ham, and we had bagels and stuff. willy and michael ate with us, and then they left. they brought over tons of roses and this really pretty sculpted cat statue thingy, as early birthday presents. (since i'll be in london on my birthday). also, last night i got a giant care bear. man, it's silly, but shit like that makes me so happy. i'm in a lovely mood today. i might not even mind doing some laundry.  hopefully chris will come over later too. i know willy has to go see his girl around three, so after that i'm going to be on my own for the rest of the day. i have a feeling he'll show up though,. he always seems to come through when i want to see him the most.  anyhow, i'm off to atempt doing some laundry. i'm fresh out of clean clothes. haha.

      *yawn*   i have a hangover and i was late to work again. yay. yesterday was a really tough day. i got reallly sad and cried a lot. it was pathetic. thankfully,  julie and traci rescued me from depression and went with me to nyc to see justin & chris. when we got there i was still feeling all puffy eyed, but that went away after a few hours of drinking (and a few kisses from my alpha male). apparently the bartender really liked me, since he only charged me for half of what i ordered and continuously gave traci and i free shots. needless to say i was really drunk by nights end. i don't really think that was such a good idea in hindsight. my brain feels like a pile of poop. the news: (+)tonight traci and i are going to the gym for our first "date" with a personal trainer. this should be interesting. heh.  maybe he'll help me sweat all of this alcohol out of my system. (-)chris left for boston last night and won't be back until after friday. i miss him already.  i can't believe i'm falling in love. this is insane....  *sniffle*

      *yawn* well, it's 3:05 and i'm still in my pajamas. i think that i officially qualify as a lazy bastard. traci and julie just went to visit the  urlLink moon motel  in howell, to make some reservations for friends coming to visit from canada. they say it has water beds and cable. sounds classy, haha. so, of course i had to investigate. i started off by read a little  urlLink story  about the place when i woke up, and let me say this: i'm glad i'm not staying there with them! haha. although, i must admit - the place has a great  urlLink  sign  (is that phallic enough for you?). and the more i look into it, the more interesting it gets. apparently the place even went    urlLink up in flames  at some point - but i can't find any more information regarding that picture yet.   *insert ten minute internet search break here* alright, this is getting annoying. i'm going to assume that the fire happened prior to the mass use of the internet, because i cannot find even one fucking detail about it. i have half a mind to go to the library and search for information. hmmm. does that make me crazy? oh well, i think i'm going to add a  urlLink search engine  to my site - and then go join a gym with traci. we're going to go get all skinny and stuff. *grins* update: julie just got back from the infamous moon motel. that shit hole costs $80 - $85 a night! haha! I guess no one will be staying there now. well, at least i got an hour's worth of brain candy out of the idea... update #2: search engine mission: complete. atomz is the shiznit.

      sometimes things are different than they seem. tonight, i spent the evening with my mother. i took her out to dinner at this really nice cafe, in freehold. it was one of those byob places, so of course, i did. after we finished a bottle of 97 ruffino, she started talking. i really don't feel comfortable talking about what was said, but let's just say that i have a very different view ablout life (in general) after tonight. there are so many different emotions bouncing around inside me like erratic quarks.  i'm lost, i'm hopeful, i'm sad, i'm happy, i'm safe, and i'm scared and i'm angry... i can see how possible it would be for things to turn around but i almost don't expect them to.  i don't expect things to go right.  but haven't i paid my dues by now?  i know i had debts and pain and guilt to own up to... but when does the self-crucifixion end?  i need to forgive myself but i don't think i can do that until i forgive him and he forgives me. and he's dying. slowly, painfuly, and currently. with the time frame, none of this might never happen. and that makes me sick. g-d, i love my mom. but, sometimes, her presence makes me feel like less than a person. it feels like it's about to rain.  it feels cool and wet, not humid.  there's a breeze coming through the screen of the open window.  this is the first time i've opened it in ages.

      something needs to change.  at the same time as i continue to possess an intense optimism about life in general and its multifarious possibilities, and more clarity and confidence and happiness and trust than... ever, really, things are starting to tangle. so often i try to be an island, to do it alone and keep it to myself and never take the smile off my face, but there are days when it's hard... sometimes you want to break down but the muscle won't release.  while i pride myself on being able to keep it together in even the most insane of circumstances, i'm almost secretly hoping that destabilization will come for me like some 2 AM knock on the door and i will answer with a smile.  there is this physical tension building in me that i keep swallowing and swallowing... it's silting layer by layer and I can keep it to a low boil and never change my expression instance by instance but if I don't release it somehow i'm either going to explode or start doing weird, sublimated things.  if i'm not already.

      ahh, yes. eventually i managed to fall back asleep, and i woke up again at 1:30 to find that traci had left to go see her mom without me. i don't think she tried to wake me up. but then again i'm famous for not remembering conversations i have while i'm half asleep.  so- instead of the day trip with traci,  i just started working on a  urlLink new layout  for  urlLink not-so-soft  this afternoon. i'm not exactly sure if i like it or not, and it still needs a lot of tweaking - but i guess i'll figure out if i want to use it or not another day. right now i'm going to try to finish off schrodinger's cat trilogy (by, robert anton wilson). I picked it up the other day when traci, julie and i met chris at barnes & nobles. the book is fucking incredible. shockingly, it's written just as well as the illuminatus! trilogy (and i sure didn't see that coming). you should pick up a copy, really. later tonight, it looks like i will get to hang out with chris again. le sigh. i am such a happy girl.

(maybe that's a side effect of sitting in an emotional coma for a year.)  i'm edgy.  i'm jumpy.  i'm crouched at the starting line, trying not to jump the gun, but desperate to have that first foot hit the ground.  i'm also afraid.  i know what I want but- it almost doesn't seem real that I might actually get  it.  i  have no doubts but- i'm afraid to hope or believe too much.  i have a lot of guilt and sometimes it warps my optimism. is this all stupid? if it wasn't so hard to figure out where i stood, would i even care? i think that i would - but then again, i think a lot of things... i don't deserve this anyway. i never gave anyone what they wanted. why would i... blech.   so be it.

      i didn't sleep very well last night, and it's taking a toll on me today. I had this really wierd nightmare that kept waking me up. It had something to do with math and jumping off of a cliff. I can't even explain it. Somehow i had to jump from one ledge to another, in order to complete some calculation - but i was too terrified to jump. i was hanging from this little rock, trying to figure out how badly i wanted to figure out the mathematical equation. it felt like the most important decision in the world. lord knows where my brain comes up woth these things.. anyway, i was scared to death, and woke up about ten times, hardly able to breathe.  man, i really want some undisturbed sleep.

      you know what I really have a very low threshold of tolerance for?  judgmental people. with self-righteous people coming in at a close second.  and people who are both?  forget it.  (i'm intolerant of intolerance.  ooh, the irony.)  not that I'm advocating moral plasticity.  on the contrary, i believe in absolute right and wrong.  but I also believe that the world is a complex proposition with a thousand shades and gradations in between black and white.   take any controversial issue today.  people divide themselves down these lines, into these polarized little factions, and then expect you to have a cut and dry opinion on the matter on the tip of your tongue.  well, i don't always.  not every ideological position can (or should) be summed up in less than 5 words.  sometimes the issue, and reasoning behind the position is just a little more complex.  similarly, it is not accurate or right to think you can infer very much about anyone on the basis of a few second-hand facts.  in a personality psychology class i took a few years ago, i think we call that "L-data," information about a person such as their marital status, their health history, their income.  the problem with L Data is that "they are sometimes not even slightly informative about psychological attributes" and "are affected by too many other things to tell us much." (Funder)   i think most people would consider themselves basically "good" people, and i'm no different.  but i'm making it a point in my life to be very conscious of the choices i make, and to take responsibility for them.  i have no problem owning up to my mistakes and faults and calling them what they are.  but when someone steps in and decides to start judging, labelling and condemning me on the basis of a very limited number of facts and almost no context, i get a little pissed off.  i don't appreciate being dismissed, particularly  in my capacity as an intelligent, moral, and responsible person.  i believe that guilt is not often a very useful emotion, and that regret is utterly so.  so I have no apologies to make for myself or the way i approach my life.    i feel better having said that.

      i am not feeling entirely coherent this evening, because i have a lot going on in my world. i'm going to try to blog anyway, simply because sometimes it's impossible for me to organize my thoughts without seeing them written down.  yesterday was a little complicated. i don't really feel like getting into detail, but let's just say that once again i have assumed responsibility for something that has absolutely nothing to do with me. towards the end of the night, after a lot of thinking and crying, i got a chance to speak with chris on the phone. as usual, hearing his voice made all of my problems feel tiny. he really has a knack for doing that. it amazes me every time.  this morning i didn't want to get out of bed, but i did. i made it into the office a few minutes after nine, and tried to get some work done. unfortunately, the majority of my morning was actually spent in conversations with my lawyer and my mother. once again, some debt that my parents had from when my father became ill had resurfaced. thankfully, i managed to make a reasonable deal with the attorney handling the collections end of things. i left the office and brought him a certified check for $2000., which will supposedly end the proceedings against my family. the bad news is that the total amount i'm going to have to pay for them is over $18,000.  the good news is that the lawyer helped me get a very reasonable payment schedule - and it should all be taken care of fairly quickly.  after i took care of that whole mess, i asked my mother to meet me at my place for lunch. i picked up some bagels and we had a talk about the meeting i had been to earler. she must have apologized over a hundred times. i don't know what in the world would make her think she has to apologize to me for my father getting sick, but she does.  constantly. in my opinion my father's illness has nothing to do with the fact that my family expects  me to take on the roll he once played in our family, but i guess i'll save that part for another day. in any event, the whole situation sucks, but the part that bothers me most is that sometimes i let myself feel awful about it.  sometimes i wish that i wasn't smart enough to know that nothing can make a person feel sad. if anything, we merely allow ourselves to focus on negative things, and ignore or neglect the good ones. lately when i start to feel sad, i try to remember that. i try to remind myself that whatever problem is at hand - is nothing compared to all of the good things in my life. i'm not great at convincing myself at times, but admittedly - i'm getting much better. and that makes me feel more in control of my life. this, obviously, can not be a bad thing.  anyhow, back to my day. after all of the jewish guilt layed on me by good old mom, i went back to the office to pick up some sex pistols tickets for the show tonight at jones beach. (a gift from a business associate/friend of my partners). i worked for a little while, and then headed out to jersey city to pick up rick - who was kind enough to come with me to the show. the ride was fucking tedious, and all i could think about is starting a massive forest fire. (yes i know, i'm going to hell)  anyhow, we eventually made it there - and as soon as we got out of my car we realized that i was the third to yougest person in the whole fucking place! the parking lot and venue were both filled with the scum of the earth. ordinarily, this might have made me feel slightly uncomfortable, but watching rick ridecule every single washed up dirt bag that passed by us sure eased the situation. haha.  we got to catch most of the dropkick murphys performance (which was alright, considering neither of us knew more than one song they played during the entire set).  of course watching the sex pistols afterwards was a total fucking riot. Johnny Rotten was wearing bright pink jams and a flourescent yellow tank top. As far as i was concerned, seeing him in that outfit was well worth the drive! haha. in all honesty, they sounded decent for a bunch of old guys that have no desire, other than financial, to be performing. In my opinion, the most upsetting thing about the entire show, was the people there to watch! i mean, REALLY. half of them bought out hot topic last night just so they'd look "cool". The other half had on freshly purchased tank tops over their button down shirts. nausiating, i tell you! i swear, if rick didn't have such a fucking amazing sense of humor, and managed to make fun of (loudly), every single person that came within a ten foot radius of us, i think i would have been completely depressed by the entire scene. i swear to you - there were fifteen year old girls dancing like they were trying out for the movie FAME in the aisles, beavis and butthead looking characters making "metal" signs in the stands, old guys that probably couldn't even hear the music because they had their hearing aids on mute, and ladies that looked like they just stepped out  of the filming of footloose. (not to mention the prince-on-crack look alike and his disgusting wife that danced like a bunch of violently ill retards through the entiire show). ugh i could go on and on... but for your sake i won't. haha. anyway, being as PUNK as possible, the sex pistols ended their set at 10PM. haha can you believe that???? for me, that was the punchline.  so anyhow, rick and i headed back to jersey. while we were on the way i spoke to thealphamale. sadly, it turns out he won't be back home until tuesday. for some reason i had been thinking it was monday all week long, so now i have to add another 1440 minutes onto my stop watch. *sniffle* i am so pathetic sometimes. when he told me i swear i almost started to cry! haha. i mean, i need to teach my emotions about logic. it's one day for christ sake! apparently, my heart has never wanted so badly to be with someone! all in all, it's a good thing though. the fact that 24 more hours of no chris bummed me out so badly, only goes to show how much i miss him. the whole situation will be easily fixed anyhow. i just have to stop into the office tomorrow and let everyone know i will be in on monday, just not tuesday... christ. i really am so excited. there's nothing in the entire world i want, more than to wrap my arms around this man again and give him a giant kiss. nothing, i tell you. nothing!  anyway, now that i'm half way through with writing a fucking novel, i think i'll shut the hell up. tomorrow traci and i are heading out to washington DC for the tattoo convention, and i haven't even begun to pack! have no worries though, i'm bringing the good old laptop, as usual - so you'll have plenty of pictures to gawk at soon.  lesigh.  the sad part about stopping this entry now, is that i could go on and on....  haha. $20 says this will not be my only post tonight.    three more days   four more days

      today was one of those days in which nothing went the right way.  last night an extremely disturbing dream. in it, chris invited traci and i to meet him at some venue. we drove for, what seemed to be, an eternity.  finally we arived at a huge warehouse type building. we parked the car, and then walked in. everywhere we went, i found groups of friends. everyone had seen him, and pointed to where i could find him. we walked and walked - from room to room. always to find more friends that just saw him - bit we never found him. it felt as though i had looked in five hundred rooms and fifty hallways. always finding more friends, but never finding him. this dream must have lasted five hours. finally my alarm went off, and i woke up. bummed as ever. all i wanted to do was go back to sleep, just so i could see him. but, i had to go to work - so after a half hour of deliberation -  i got in the shower.  i arrived at work about a half hour late. i worked as hard as i possibly could. i got some bad news that i don't feel like getting into - but the result is that, once again, i am taking responsibility for my parents debt. this time it will cost me nearly $18,000. i'll be paying it off in september - and since it will more or less clean me out - it looks like i won't be able to continue my masters  degree for a while..  when i got home, my mom must have called me five times apologizing to me and crying. as always, i told her not to worry. (that's my job anyway, right?) sigh. aftr the fifth call i managed to convince her everything was ok, and i needed some sleep, so i'd call her tomorrow.  so, she didnt call me again tonight. which resulted in me finding out that my dad went into the hospital again tonight, from someone else. i can't get any answer on the phone, and i don't know where he is or what happened...   i don't know what else to say. i'm not thinking clearly right now. traci and julie are here with me, trying to keep me sane as always. i'm really lucky to have friends like this, that's for sure.  i hope these next few days pass quickly. i know once chris wraps those arms of his around me again, my problems will seem so small. i guess that's the beauty in being in love. or part of it at least. even with him being so far away, just knowing that he cares, and having him in my heart makes everything bearable.  so even after my sob story, i still recognize that i am the luckiest girl in the world. and for that, i'm greatful as can be...   5 more days .

      i wake up this morning, and reach this terrible realization:  i am addicted to the internet  i miss blogging. how very strange. do not take this as some sort of a sign that i will return to blogging like... a normal person with a blog? i do not know. you must never forget that i am lazy and uninspired at the best of times. maybe this is just due to PMS and thus the evilty of hormones are the blame for this moment of enlightenment.   incidentally, I hate PMS. why, for a period lasting what, four days? is there a two-week suffering period before it? cramps, hating everyone, and the general desire to kill rank among some of the more pleasant symptoms.   and to make it worse, I had to return work today. i have come to the realization that there is nothing positive about the insurance industry. the work sucks, the carriers suck, the clients suck, the people who dont suck youd probably rather see somewhere else, anyway. and what is the point of all this misery, over-working, stress, etc, etc? to get another promotion and work your ass off there as well. so that you can get a  big house and more bills, so that you have to work even harder the following year just to keep up? what's the fucking point?!   theres my rant of the month. Come back next month, same time, same negativity!  ugh.  7 more days . and counting... i miss him so fucking much. *sniffle*

      i just wrote this long post and then realized how utterly mushy I have become, so i deleted it. i am thinking of taking a hiatus for awhile. i always say this but it never lasts. this time may be the same. then again, it may not. i am considering starting a new, anonymous web-site. i feel like i started censoring my writing here and as a result, when I read over my posts, they really dont seem a reflection at all of what im feeling or who i am. this of course leads me to question the whole point of this blog thing anyway. what do I want to get out of it? do my friends (the people i hoped would read this when it started as a means of keeping up with me as i moved away) actually read this? probably not seeing as how i feel i keep most of them fairly abreast of whats up via phone and email. do random cyberspace people read this? the answer to that would be, yes, a few at least, and mainly ones i would rather not have. but what do i want this site to be??? a reflection of my life in simple terms, my inner most yearnings, random thoughts, a specific topic??? why, there are just so many choices and right now Im not sure which one to choose.   hmph. see what happens when i'm left with too much time to think. it's fucking dangerous. i wonder where traci is.. and if chris's plane has landed yet... and what my sister's doing....  darci called me tonight, but i don't really feel up to a night of drinking in the city.   i just don't know what to do with myself! *sniffle*

      catch up v.138  thursday: went to the terror show at krome with wreak. raan into some old friends at the chinese restaurant across the sreet. drank WAY too much. got rescued by chris, who gave his car to a friend to take home, and then took me to his house in my car and let me sleep over. he had a great midnight bbq, and i had an amazzing night. i even (verbally) owned up to my feelings for the first tme..  friday: went out to breakfast with chris. then we stoped by his mom's house to say hi, went to comp USA, home depot, and then  petco. chris bought rocks, i ought a condo for my cats. then he rearanged his yard and i went home to suprise the kitties with their new toy. then i got traci, and went back to his house around 10, for a bqq. once again, i drank way too much (and so did traci). she got sick and i ended up sleping over again...  saturday: woke up at 8:30 n the morning went out for breakfast with chris and sam. went into the tub for a while, and then convinced sam to get hs girlfriend over so that we all could go out to dinner. eventually she showed up, and we all went to dinner. we were all gong to go to she shore, but after our steak induced coma's - we ended up drinking AGAIN. rick and i were probably the most drunk - but i think i was the worst. at some point i dozed off, and at around two traci woke me up to go home. i guess because of all the alcohol i was completely off track, and i ended up crying for absolutely no reason. once again, chris took care of me.. nd let me seep over.. AGAIN.  i think that i lost it because  1. i drank too much. 2. i am not proud of how much i have been drinking lately. 3. i'm terrified of chris becmg sick of me 4. i opened up to someone for the firrst time ever. and i am a little scared, because i don't wat to fuck this up, ever. and being that drunk opened a door for all of that to fall out of.  lesigh. i feel fine now, thank god. but - i really want to lay off the heavy drinking for a while. i have way too many good things going on right now, and i refuse to fuck thngs up over somthing as insignificant as a few drinks.  anyway, today chris and rick took traci and i to see a show. it was realy crowded, but still a really nice time. he dropped us off a while ago, and i cooked traci some dinner. i'm going to head over to chris's again in a little while to grab my book (which  forgot there, only 40 pages from finihing). then tonight i have to come home somewhat early, so i can get to work in the morning.

       urlLink Tisha B'Av: I've got some good news and some bad news... .    "The good news: You've just escaped with your lives and My help from Egypt.   The bad news: I'm not going to let you into Canaan, the promised land, the land of milk and honey. Instead you're going to wander in the desert for forty years, dying until you are all gone. Dead. Sleeping with the fishes. No Canaan for you.     The good news: I'll let your children in. But not you."    Today is Tisha b'Av (the 9th day of Av), the anniversary of the day God broke this news to the Jews.    a lot of other stuff happened to us on this day too : -the holy temples in Jerusalem were destroyed   (the western wall, "wailing wall" to some, is the last part standing) -Betar, the last fortress to hold out against the Romans during the Bar Kochba revolt in the year 135, fell, sealing the fate of the Jewish people.  -the children of israel who left egypt were told by hashem that they would not be permitted to enter the land of Israel .  -the jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, part of the Spanish Inquisition.   (not to mention that Wold War I, which began the downward slide toward the holocaust, is also said to have begun on Tisha b'av as well)  so, today is the Jewish fast day of Tisha B'av AKA the "black fast day", and to sum it up, this day represents pretty much every bad event in Jewish history. it is a universal day of mourning. (and fasting, which admittedly, i never do)  i understand that Tisha B'av is an integral part of the Jewish calendar--and it's of enormous importance to most of us. i have been taught that judaism is in unique in that mourning is honorable, and not something to shy away from. everything in our lives is often positive (from a religious aspect), and we rarely set aside time to mourn, to lament, and to ponder the bad that is in the world. we rarely do so, and i encourage everyone to take a few moments, regardless of your religion, and contemplate what it means to mourn. mourning is both positive and negative.  think about it.   -this public service announcement has been provided by everyone's favorite tattood jew AKA girl138.

      tonight was so much fun. hehe!  after work i met up with the alpha male at his house, and we went to the outback to have dinner with his mom. she is so cool! i only got to meet her once before (over the weekend) - but the more i hear her speak, the more i like her. she is so well spoken and funny! plus, you can just see how much she loves him (and what a great relationship they have) when they converse. it made the little hairs on the back of my neck stand up! also, i just think it's so kind of her to let me tag-along with them. it was such a great dinner!   god, i love listening to him talk....  eep. anyhow, after dinner, i decided to stop at the hospital to see my dad. usually that place really upsets me, but i couldn't do anything but smile after the dinner i had just had. my father and i discussed the family, the hospital, and the usual work issues - but then he said something, well, out of the ordinary.  it would be impossibe to repeat the entire conversation, because he's so sick and hard to understand, so i'll just write about the parts i fully understood: (obviously omitting the things i didn't understand and the "what daddy, please say that again" 's ...)   dad : so how's the boy  me : he's amazing dad  dad : i can tell          ...your sparkle is back  me : what? hehe!  dad : your sparkle!  me : i didn't know i lost it to begin with  dad : you used to have it when you were little  me : gee thanks dad  dad : i mean you look happy like you used to be before i got like this  me : dad you don't make me sad!  dad : so, you're in love, huh  me : what? (i'm thinking, he's accused me of a lot of things in my day, but never this one, i must be hearing wrong)  dad : i said you're in love princess  old black dude in neighboring hospital bed : she sure does look like a lady in love (he smiles at me)  me : oh my god. dad, youre making me want to climb under your bed! stop it!  dad : you won't fit under all this metal shit (he laughs)  me : (blushing) dad, you're crazy! cmonnnnnnnnnnn! stop youre making me blush!  dad : (looks at the old black dude) tell me i'm crazy  old black dude : no sir, i think i agree. she is glowing. and blushing! (he laughs)  me : what's all this shit about my eyes? are you guys are on drugs? (i realize this was a dumb question)  dad : DUH jennifer. i still think you're in fucking love! (he laughs at me)  me : (blushes again) that's it. i'm getting out of here. you old farts are making me insane!  dad : i love you - princess. and i'm happy to see your eyes sparkling again. i like him already.         oh, and tell your mom to bring me some real food tomorrow. it sucks here. bye. i love you....  me : i'll tell her daddy. and thanks. and i love you too...  old black dude : goodnight beautiful! (i give them both a kiss, and then leave)   i've been looking in a morror for the last half hour. and honestly, my eyes are looking a little brighter than usual.  hmm....

       La Vita Nuova   "in that book which is my memory . . . on the first page (that is the chapter when i first met you) appear the words . . . 'here begins a new life'"  i discovered this quote thanks to an episode of star trek voyager (which might have misquoted it). according to voyager, the book opens like this: in that book which is my memory, on the first page of the chapter that is the day when I first met you appear the words: here begins a new life. those words are, admittedly, quite beautiful. it was on their merit alone that I went out to find the book. it's a description of how meeting someone can turn you into someone new and make everything that came before seem meaningless. unfortunately the true opening of the book (according to a 1969 translation by Barbara Reynolds) is not even remotely about beatrice, or even love. she translates it as: "in the book of my memory, after the first pages, which are almost blank, there is a section headed 'Incipit vita nova'. beneath this heading i find the words which it is my intention to copy into this smaller book, or if not all, at least their meaning." it's still a lovely group of words, but a little disappointing in comparison.  anyway, i prefer the voyager version over barbara's translation of  urlLink dante 's - so i'm leaving it above, as is.  because that's just how i feel right now.

      i think i almost died in the gym this morning .. this is fucking hard! okay, seriously, i'm not trying to lose a lot of weight, but I did tell them that i want to be "less mushy".. then today they're like - "well, you need to do MORE cardio I tell you - MOOOOOOOOOORRRRREEEEEEEEEEE!!" so, being the person who will at least try something once before she shuns it away from society, i tried it. it honestly felt like fire was ripping through my lungs and escaping into the air everytime i breathed. it went like this .. warmup consisting of a three miles on the bike thingy, stretching for fifteen minutes, lifting weights for a half hour or so, then another 45 minutes doing a cardio of my choice (which happens to be a stairmaster thing), followed by a cooldown of WAY too many crunches. Uhhhhh .. seriously, are they trying to kill me?????? they racked up how many cals i burned in that one setting and it totaled over 700 .. I was like DAMN! then came back home. honestly, there's no way in hell i'm going to do that one again. i don't see how those meat heads do it, i just don't. i mean, i'm still fucking sore from the appointment on thursday! i don't mind easing into this slowly, and sticking with it, but someone needs to teach personal trainers about humanity.  somebody pass me a bacon cheeseburger, i deserve it.

      I wonder if Chris would like  urlLink any   urlLink of   urlLink this   urlLink stuff ..  I'm coming to terms with the fact that none of my furniture is going to match any of his. this leaves us with two options. we can have a lof of stuff that looks awful together or we can pick out some new furniture together that blends in with what he already has. of course, i'm voting for option #2. It's not that he has awful furniture or anything, but i think i'll just feel a little more comfortable if we had just a few things that were ours. not just his, ya know? God, this is a really dumb thing to be consumed with during the work day. haha.  I just don't know how to say what I am feeling right now. Of course, this is nothing new to me. Maybe I shouldn't even be typing this, but I don't know what else to do. I need to make sense of things to myself, I think.  I have some beautiful things that I love. A lot of them I am willing to part with. He is worth it and I would give up anything, without hesitation, to be with him. Unfortunately, that doesn't make certain things any easier.   I have to find new homes for my cats.  Avery and Persia aren't going to be nearly as difficult to part with as Lily. For the last month or so, I have been going to my apartment to visit them on my lunch breaks. Lily knows I am gone, and she is mad at me. I can tell. She used to be SO affectionate towards me before all of this. Now she looks at me and thinks "you're a bad mommy. you left me". She's just a cat. I love her like she's my baby, but the reality of it is that I can't bring her with me. It's not an option. And even though I want to tear my hair out when I think about it, I know giving her away is the right thing to do, for all of us.  sigh.  Last november I bought a dining room table. This doesn't sound very exciting, does it? Well, for me - It was a landmark. I think It was the first "adult purchase" I ever made. And I was so proud of myself. It's not that it's the most expensive or beautiful thing in the world, but it made me feel at home. Shortly after, my mom gave me a china cabinet that I had been dying to get my hands on since I was a child. We had it in our home since I was born. I loved it so much that I decorated my house around the idea of getting it. I found matching persian rugs, sofas, and everything. I love that room. I really do.  This is so dumb! I am about to cry over a china cabinet!  Okay. I guess the point of all this is, that I want to be able to do it again. To feel connected. I am accepting the fact that the home I created is not my home anymore. And I wouldn't want it to be. Not without Chris. Nothing I have matches his house at all, or would even so much as function in it. (with all the traffic and three giant dogs). I just want to make it feel like my home too, with him. I want to look around and feel like I am a part of something there. Even if it's something as silly as a coffee table. or a dresser.   I don't want to change anything that Chris is happy with. In fact, I want to do the opposite. I want us both to love this house and everything in it. And each other. Forever.   I am not sure that any of this made sense. I hate being female some days.

      so it's saturday. awh yeah.  chris left this morning at the ass crack of dawn, for the weekend. *sniffle* today i am going to crash his family's Rosh Hahana dinner. They rock for allowing me to join them. Ever since my dad has gotten sick (and my sister went away to college) all holidays have been oficially cancelled in the Baron household. This will be the first "family holiday dinner" i will have attended in over three years. I'm very excited, honestly.   I just did my nails. I really should get in the shower, but I know that if i get ready too soon I'll be covered in dog hair by the time Dan and his girlfriend pick me up. Decisions. Decisions....  Other news.. Chris and I hired a painter and picked out new carpet. His mom is having the roof replaced. We also hired someone to cut down the apple tree in the back yard. He wants to be here when it's removed in hopes that they use dynomite and it falls on his neighbors house. That would be funny. Oh yeah. We also bought a hot tub. It's fucking sick. Chris is going to be one happy camper when it's ready to use.  That's all. I'm still madly in love and happy as can be.  Happy New Year to all my brothers & sisters. Best wishes fron girl138.

      Rosh Hashanah literally means "head of the year".  Just as the head leads the body, our actions on Rosh Hashanah set the tone for the New Year, embodying the potential for life, blessing and sustenance for the  coming year.  For this reason we are especially mindful of all we think, say and do during  these two special days.  Our wish for you in this coming year is reflected in the words of the first night of Rosh Hashanah,  L'shanah tovah tikatiev v'techatem:  "May you be written and inscribed for a good and bountiful year."  For the first time in ages, i actually think i'll have one.

      As of last week, about 1,600 Americans have been trapped in the labyrinth of the U.S. legal system by a body that, though it has no public accountability, has established itself as a quasi-governmental authority. Torn away from their lives, they face massive fines, court costs, and even imprisonment. Were these people terrorists? Pedophiles? Hapless under-employed twenty-somethings who had defaulted on their student loans? Nope: They were ordinary computer users charged by the Recording Industry of America with violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  While it was  urlLink originally instituted in 1998 as part of the hardly publicly-minded World Trade Organization's mandates for member countries , the DMCA is one step closer to actually handing the country over to corporate rule. (Lest we forget, the government is currently the sole property of  urlLink Halliburton .) For instance, the Act gives the recording industry, which is a trade group and not something that anyone actually voted on, essentially Gestapo-like powers. Rather than the subpoena being given by an actual judge, it can be issued by the clerk of a United States District Court upon reasonable suspicion that you're hooked up to a peer-to-peer network such as WinMX or KaZaA. Bamyour ISP has to provide all your information, including your name, address, telephone number, shoe size, and whether or not you wank to the girls jumping on trampolines during the "Man Show" credits. And, if they find any music files after they confiscate your hard drive, you'll most likely be their indentured servant for the rest of your natural life, with a large chunk of your wages garnished to pay off the "damages." For a trade group to wield that kind of influence is ridiculous. Hell, Ralph Nader wishes he had that kind of pull.  Moreover, the entire argument that the recording industry uses to defend its actionsthat it protects artists' rightsis patently ridiculous. Music today is an industry; songs and "artists" are manufactured the way Andy Warhol manufactured silkscreens and the Velvet Underground. To suggest that Creed or Avril Lavigne or Justin Timberlake or some other assembly-line device for branding sound is having the fruits of their labors ripped off by file-swapping script kiddies is like suggesting that Milli Vanilli is getting ripped off every time someone fires up a karaoke machine. Through the magic of marketing, the recording industry has made something otherwise worthless into a precious commodity, restricted public access to it by making the prices ridiculously high (have you seen what they're charging for CDs these days?!), and then screaming bloody murder when a black market develops.  What the RIAA is really afraid of is that file sharing is destroying this little racket they've got going. Historically, the recording industry got huge at the same time that people moved from the shoulder-to-shoulder crowding cities to the bland anonymity of the suburbslimiting their access to live music venues and other sources of authentic culture, but opening the door for the culture-manufacturing industry to step in and provide us with an amazing simulation thereof, just the same way that Wonder Bread and Spam are amazing simulations of actual food. What the Internet has done is digitally reconnect us into communities, short-circuiting the means of marketing, manufacture, and distribution that the powers that be have invested so much in.  The RIAA, a dinosaur if there ever was one, knows it's fighting a losing battle against the forces of evolution. Sure, CD sales have declined, but when you consider the lawyers' fees and work hours necessary to indict, convict, and fine even a tiny portion of the people who are swapping files, they're just throwing good money after bad. Like the vicious dog in your neighbor's fenced-in yard, the RIAA is dangerous, but sufficiently remote not to be worrisome to the vast majority of people. And they know it: Take, for example, their recent motions towards  urlLink persuading Congress that P2P networks are a one-stop source for computer viruses and kiddie porn . Next thing they'll do is require you to pay royalties if you get a song stuck in your head or you sing "Happy Birthday" at someone's party. (Someone actually owns the rights to "Happy Birthday," you know.)  What's even more wrong is for a private entity to hijack the courts and ruin the lives of a small portion of the people who are threatening its imagined hegemony. The way to stop it is by the power of the purse. I, for one,  urlLink will not buy another freaking CD put out by a major label  until the charges against every one of the people indicted under the DCMA are dropped. Maybe then they'll finally shut the fuck up and die.  (Incidentally, I, personally, don't use peer-to-peer networks, simply because what's out there is crap. Do a search for some of the people who've authored half the mp3s on my hard drive, and you're going to get zilch. People made music for millennia before Thomas Edison ever made a wax cylinder, and the survivors huddled in the ruins of our current civilization will continue doing it, at least until the toxic zombies eat their brains. And if I ever meet Lou Reed or Jello Biafra, I'll be sure to slip them a twenty for whatever transgressions the Internet community at large has committed.)  Disco sucks.

      home is wherever chris is, and that's all i have to say about sunday. (ok, i'm lying.  apparently i have a lot to say about sunday)  today was slightly rediculous, but decent all the same. chris left pretty early today with the guys. *sniffle* i waited around most of the day for terror to pick me up, and when he arrived (around 5:00) - i had just realized that my keys were locked in my house. so much for thai food. i also had just realized that traci wasn't home and i had given my spare key to julie - so unless i got in touch with one of them, there was no way i was getting my car and/or making it to work tomorrow.  thankfully, around 5:30 i got in touch with the ever-so-lovely julie, and she met us at my house so i could get my keys/car. i took a quick shower and came back to chris's house to doggy-sit. during the day while i was waiting for terror, i cleaned the laundry room again, scrubbed the bathroom from soap scum, did some laundry, and a lot of vacuming, so there wasn't much left to do. the cleaning was kind of enlightening though. (don't laugh). it didn't feel like i was  cleaning someone else's house at all. i know that's slightly wierd - but i've been spending so much time here lately... and in addition i'm coming to realize that anywhere i might find my man and his doggies, i'd gladly call home.  the remainder of the evening consisted of watching casa blanca and amelie with the dogs, which was LOVELY. hehe. then, i took a little nap and then woke up to chris's unhappy-as-usual roomate coming home. he didn't seem all too interested in saying hello to me. (which doesn't bother me at all since he's the misery-poster-boy).  the event did have a punch line though, since when he attemped to call his dog upstairs - the dog refused to leave my side - and started whimpering. heh. he had to drag him up the stairs by his collar to get him in his room. i didn't find the dragging part funny at all, just the dogs ability to judge character. lol.  anyway, i guess it's time to pop in monty python and try to go to sleep. the sooner eyes close, the sooner my brain will realize chris is home. it turns out the alpha male won't be home until the ass crack of dawn, and i have work tomorrow (unfotunately).   thank you terror. and thank you juilie. you saved my butt once again. xoxo.

      pshaw. my blogger is finally updating again. i cannot tell you how annoyed i was this week. every single time i attempted to update i got an error message saying that i had no disk space left. ordinarily, that would have resulted in me deleting a ton of old entries, but i KNEW that it was incorrect because i haven't used even half of the disk space i purchased from directdomain. my blogger was just being an asshole, so i waited it out. anyhow, horray for labor day because it's finally working again.  in any event, this weekend has been a lot of fun. i've been at chris's house for the last few days, and have been loving every last second of it. we did a lot of shopping, cleaning, and eating. all of which were a lot more fun than they probably sound. also, last night we went to sleaze-side heights with jen and sam, which was a ton of fun. sam went on my favorite ride with me, jen and i did shots and made some guy get us drinks at a bar that was impossible to get service at, i pushed some drunk white trash girl into a pile of glass in the women's bathroom, chris won stuffed animals for me, and we had some bangin' ice cream. all in all, another fantastic night.  this morning i was even blessed with coffee & newspaper in bed and yummy breakfast that i didn't even have to cook! *grin*  so, yes. i am the luckiest girl EVER and you should all be completely jealous.   nuff said.

      Sometimes I say things just so that no one else can say anything during that brief moment while I'm speaking. I'll say something outrageous about myself or something strange that I heard just to get the people I'm with to stop and think and loose track of what they were going on about before I changed the subject. What I say isn't any less true or meaningful than what they were talking about because all anyone talks about is other people or things they heard that are probably not true either. It's not as if I enjoy hearing myself talk or think that what I say is important, because having people listen to me usually embarrasses me like crazy. It's just that I get sick of hearing other people go on and on. I like people who say little, but what they say means a lot.  People who can't stop talking tire my ears and I begin to block them out, then feel like I'd do anything for a second silence while they stopped and pondered, but they don't, they just keep going without even breathing and their rate accelerates and their pitch gets slowly but steadily more exited, and I begin to get tense, I realize I'm tense so consciously relax but they are still going on and on, and what they are talking about (when I can concentrate on the actual words this long) is about how much other people suck or the world sucks or how much better they are than something and I can not bear to hear such bullshit so try to say something with out being rude and finally there is a breath of silence so I say the first thing that comes to mind.  I don't say weird things on purpose and I never lie, but sometimes I say things that I don't know are true, because I've only heard them. That, I usually feel bad about later, especially if I find out it is not true. I think of that as spam. Passing false information is like forwarding an email message that is a hoax, but worse actually, because it is passed from brain to brain. An email message has less of a chance of actually being read and entered into the brain. Me saying something is probably more likely to be heard and believed and passed on, well maybe not with my reputation for saying strange things. Maybe I'm just imagining that though, everyone says shit they heard, and I often know they are repeating bullshit, but when I make a little mistake like that I'm probably just too sensitive about it. I guess I don't much like making mistakes or being wrong. That's probably a problem. Well, what ever, I'm a perfectionist, and one who fucking likes people to shut up sometimes and stop talking shit. Sue me.  Sigh. That just about sums up the first half of my day. Eight hours of aggrivation followed by great sex and a yummy "family" dinner.  =)  pooooooooooooooooooooor me . hehehehhe.

      the RIAA is now  urlLink raiding independent record stores without warrants , looking to confiscate DJ mix CDs. who loves ya? quick, the ship is sinking! turn the cannons on the lifeboats!  the must-read article of the day is  urlLink this essay  by George Ziemann at MP3 Newswire. Ziemann outlines how the music industry is repeating all of Thomas Edison's monopolistic mistakes from the early days of the film industry. This particular line jumps out at me:  Step 6 -- Alienate the public  Edison did his best to squash his competitors, but he never stooped so low as to try suing moviegoers for attending "unlicensed" movies. Step 6 is an RIAA original, I believe.  And:  Considering that the government has a) been trying to diffuse the voice of the music industry for a half century, if not silence it altogether and b) four of the five major labels are foreign-owned, sooner or later someone at the top end of government is going to possess the lucidity to wonder why the government should even care what happens to the record industry.  Or why anyone else would care, either.   urlLink The problem with music  is obvious. Recording arists all over the place are  urlLink up in arms  over this shit and you should be too. Do something for crist sake.  urlLink make sure the music you buy is RIAA safe  for starters. Or how about  urlLink donate money directly to your favorite musicians . Or more importantly, make a donation to  urlLink the victims . Shit, I know I did.  P.S. If you have any interest, check out  urlLink weed  (no, not that kind silly). It  share an artist's files freely, you can listen to them 3 times for free, then pay $1 to unlock them.  Artists get half and filesharers even get a cut. Uses Microsoft DRM (Digital Rights Management) , but it's still clever enough to deserve a chance.

      It's sort of interesting to see the outcome of getting a life. Take on a few home improvement projects, form some friendships "offline", and just breathe in the fresh air from outdoors.. and suddenly you forget that you own a computer.. let alone a website. There are so many people out there who are blogging daily, changing layouts like they do their panties.. and well.. I just don't see how i used to find the time to do it. I lead a pretty calm life, yet I still cannot fathom using so much time and energy for something as silly as this anymore.  Classic Jenna Syndrome . If anything becomes 'popular', I bail.. rebel.. run for the hills. Maybe that's the problem?? I've been doing this whole blog thing for years and years.. and now that it's mainstream, eck.. it's suddenly a giant bore. But sadly I'll keep on doing it I imagine.  I have one major gripe on my mind today .. cell phones. Why on earth do you people (meaning like 90% of the American population) insist on carting those damn things everywhere??? Must you really talk to your best friend, your aunty, your boyfriend, grandma, cousin Jose.. whatever on a constant basis?? So much that you cannot perform basic functions.. ohh.. like taking a crap without it in your ear, let alone drive a huge lethal weapon such as a motor vehicle. The whole thing makes me want to break shit!!! It's so bad that I have to deal with you people mindlessly running into me at Quick Checkl because you can't be bothered to pay attention while walking. Focus people.. F O C U S!! Do I have a cell?? Yes. Do i use it or even answer it? NO! When I leave the house, it's because I want to get out and interract with people in person, or that I have stuff to do.. I don't need every damn person on the planet calling me. That's what home telephones are for, and voice mail.. answering machines, etc. Call me old fashioned, but sometimes technology really goes overboard. I'd love to be able to drive down the street and not have to be watching every other idiot around me for fear that their phone call will be more important than paying attention to their driving. I'm constantly almost being ran into, run off the street, etc because the moron in the other car is too damn busy talking on the phone. It's disgusting.  As for other things, the whole painting thing seems to be turing out well. Not without drama of course, as my painter is a complete wierdo and has a tendency to forget to do what I ask him to do. The bastard painted the ceiling of the living room (which i specifically asked him  not  to do because a certain stain there has some sentimental value to Rick).  Of course the fucker didn't listen and I feel awful about it.  Now I'm trying to redecorate and driving the boyfriend crazy because I'm a spoiled brat who likes to look around the hosue and think "gee, that looks nice". crazy, huh? *sighs* Some would call it worrying, obsessing.. whatever.. I call it being smart and knowing what you like. I'm very proud of the fact that we've been working together on this. He has been making every effort possible to make me feel at home and the house looks damn good. I hope he knows how much i appreciate this.  After October we'll have one less roomate, a hot tub, wall to wall carpet, and a pretty bed set. Maybe even new sofas. Then I'll feel all at home and comfy.  That is, if he doesn't kill me first.

      Sitting down to play, your arms encircle me, your leg nuzzling soft against mine, as I begin to cautiously stroke these keys.   Yet not with the caution of fear or concern. A caution that is in awe of the beauty of a moment, a feeling that somehow can't be explained. Something within, that remains so beautiful, so unblemished by the stains of sadness  that mark so many. A moment so virginal in it's innocence, yet so raw in it's passion too ... So giving, by it's very existence, so real, you Are,  My Love.  Unleashing passions long since locked away, and casting caution aside as I let myself feel with you, be with you, all that I am. All that I must be ...  A freedom felt so deeply that it can't be released alone my love. A sense of self, that comes into being through this love I hold so deep, so safe. Submissive, yet not selfless, Gentle, yet never bland.   This sense of self within me only heightened, by your touch, your smile, your gentle loving eyes ... your deep and Loving heart.    Gently pulling the hair away from my face, soft kisses you plant there. Each kiss you place so lovingly leaving deep and primal traces of the man who fires that love so deep, upon this soul that burns for you ... That craves within, this soul, that flies, so far and free, with you   Closing my eyes, you are there, as the music we create as one, begins to fill us both with the sounds of the deep, soft music, that only lovers feel. The tune that plays upon my heart with you. Bringing a tear to my eye with it's beauty.  You kiss that falling tear. Allowing it to fall, yet not carelessly so. Embracing the tear that falls from the heart of love that beats inside of me, for you My Love.  Lips that long to feel and taste the depths of such a love ... A heart that beats in time with yours, and out of love alone. It slowly finds it's space to Be ... A love that knows no bounds, a depth, beyond profound.   Worry not my love, these tears that fill me now... They are as deep and as precious, as free flowing, as your loving heart.   Soft and steady ...  ever present. In each sound that is heard, in every breath taken, in each and every sight seen, you Are,  My Love...

      Fall has finally arrived, and I love it. It was so cold this morning that I had to put socks on because my toes were so frozen I could barely move them. And I dont mean this happened in the early morning hours before i left for work, nope, on the way from my car to the door of my office! and it was frigid! Even now, as Im sitting at my computer, I have my favorite sweater on. My hands could use some good mittens, or one of Chris's hands, but in the mean time Ill just have to enjoy the crispness in the air. Its the perfect day to find myself addicted to Frank Sinatra again. Todays play list consists of High Hopes, Softly As I Leave You, The Girl Next Door, Come Rain or Come Shine, The Way You Look Tonight, and my new favorite, One For My Baby. Ive been crooning with Ole Blue Eyes ever since I found them on my hard drive this morning.   Right now I'm thinking about how I want to go back to London when its chilly, when I can snuggle by the electric fire, bedecked in my fleece pajamas. Ill be able to see my breath as Im walking through the streets.  Yeah, I want to go back to London. Especially when it's not 110 degrees and my week isn't packed with business meetings.  But now Im convinced that there are other places Id like to go to soon as well. I want to see my breath in Paris, Berlin, Venice, and lots of other lovely places. Im going on a short trip to Puerto Rico with Chris in November, so maybe that will hold up the dam against this urge to travel for a while.  As for right now, I think Ill travel across the room to my car. I am hungry. I have skipped lunch almost every day this week so far, so I think I'll force myself to go to now. Wish me luck, Ill need it. If the phone rings again I may never make it...  p.s. my assistant is  urlLink pretty funny ..  p.s.s. Chris approved the bed set. I'm so excited about getting it for *our* room. =)

       Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!!!   that being said, it's time for the big news....   We are engaged!   Yup, it's officially official. Chris and I are going to tie the knot. We'd been taking about it for some time, but nothing really serious - day dreams perhaps. Then, last night (after another one of my stupid hormonal crying fits) he asked me. And of course I said YES!   And how could I not? We're talking my best friend here people. The father of the little bean inside my tummy. Some one whose life is more dear to me than my very own. My playmate. My love. My Chris.  So sorry ladies, it looks like the perfect man count is down by one now. My bad, but he's mine, so deal with it. I do wish you other girls the best in finding your true love. Just remember: for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part. I'm gonna cheat a little on the last part though as I plan on loving him long after we leave this world.   Sigh. Cleatus and I are the luckiest aliens in the galaxy.      So there's the symbol. It's something very special to Chris because it belonged to his aunt. From what I know, she wore it around her neck until just before she passed away. She gave it to Chris and told him that he should use it when he wanted to get married, so that she would be a part of his future. his happiness. He was  very  close to her, and this is something he holds very dear to his heart. He said that he didn't want to have it set without me because he was afraid I wouldn't like what he chose.. so he proposed with it as is. It is so beautiful and it means so much to him. I am so honored that he gave this to me. The thought of it had me crying my eyes out last night. I don't know how i managed to get such an amazing husband-to-be, i really don't. I'll be sure to thank god every second of every day though, believe me.

      warning: mood swing ahead....   god damnit. i haven't been able to get more than ten minutes alone time with chris in over a week! it's mostly my fault because i fall asleep early - and i am fucking grumpy anyway, but seriously. there is never a moment there aren't people here. i am hardly going to see him for the next two weeks. *sniffle* we have parental turkey stuff tomorrow, a party here on friday, and then saturday he leaves for tour. this is so shitty. i always used to think it was gay when my friends would decline to do things because they needed alone time with their significant other, and now i completely understand it. i need hugs and attention and stuff! sigh. growing up is lame. and so is feeling like this. emotional, lonely, and far from fun. stupid pregnancy. now i feel like an alien.   i need to go out and do something. anything. except i can't think of anything to do. oh joy.   thank god my sister is coming friday. at least while everyone is outside in the hot tub or inside getting drunk i won't be all by myself again.

      so, everything is just fine. my car is a little banged up, but that's no big deal. yesterday after work i went over to the doctors office just to make sure that cleatus was OK. i was terrified, but quickly put to ease when i got to hear Cleatus's HEART BEAT!!! haha it sounded like a squishy underwater alien, but i was so happy. the doctor didn't even think we'd be able to hear it yet because it's so soon - but she was wrong, It only took her a second to find it. sounds like little cleatus is hard at work in there. it totally makes all the sleepiness and vomiting worth it.   8 weeks

      okay - I may have just had a defining moment of weirdness, kind of a weirdness epiphany. Not a weird epiphany - i've had those before and that's a familiar feeling. no, this is one for the ages:   so I'm innocently browsing slate and I happen to come across  urlLink an article  mocking a dog show and i'm chuckling along with the writer's description of the mutant poodle-thing that won best of show when i stumble upon mention of something called a neuticle. now, that could be the bastard stepchild of a neutron and a testicle, so I'm thinking "hey, radioactive gonads - you'd never need a flashlight - it's all good," and I make the mistake of clicking on the link to read more...   AAAHHHHHH!!!!!! they're little squishy (like, marshmellow squishy) silicone testicular implants for animals that have been neutered. just so the fuzzy-wuzzy darlings won't have a trauma when they discover they are bereft of extra dangly bits to lick and be despondent at their newfound state and perhaps cast themselves bodily into the garbage can and scatter juicy scraps all about in a cry for psychiatric help. oh yeah, and on one section of the site (i had to read it all, it was like watching a particularly gruesome car accident involving little old ladies, pink poodles and a case of silly string - no, wait, that would be genuinely funny) they actually warn pet owners not to implant neuticles that are larger than the pet's original testicles. to add design insult to injury, the damned site has an intro page of a blue ball bouncing on an invisible (but no doubt cold and unfeeling) glass surface. What's next? mammary gland implants for nursing bitches who, maybe, are feeling inadequate when faced with a squirming litter of hungry pups? They could call them mammicles and you could pop them in the freezer to keep the milk fresh...   i'm going to be under my desk, rocking back and forth for a while. Yeah, I think that's best for everyone.

      I am having a girl "vibe" by the way, I don't know if I mentioned that.. I guess we will find out soon enough though....   This morning I talked to my coworker about morning sickness and miscarriage. I have read in various places that if you have morning sickness, your risk of miscarriage decreases dramatically. She told me when she had miscarriages she wasn't sick, it felt completely different when she was pg with her son and daughter. IT made me feel better to hear firsthand from someone who has experienced both m/c and successful pg, not just to read all that crap. Well, I feel good then, because I sure am sick! ;)   Not much else to report. Hitting 8 weeks tomorrow. I will be pleased to keep this a secret at work 4 more weeks at least, and I think that is doable. My 1st U/S is in 2 weeks!!!!!!! Once I hear that little heartbeat and know there truly is a baby in there I will be ready to tell the world. But I will probably wait until week 12 to be ultra safe! More later...    7 weeks 6 days

      mmm. quiet.   i cleaned the house and made brisket tonight (after i went grocery shopping and to bed bath & beyond, that is). chris and his friends went to a show, so i have the house to myself. hehe. mmm. it smells like candles right now, and i like it.   i was goofy today. i got this strange burst of energy after work. i think i was driving chris insane. oh wait, i know i was. about ten seconds afterwards, i started thinking about the tile on the bathroom floor being cracked, and i actually got sad about it. can you believe this shit? cleatus sure has a sense of humor.   chris says that i am "nesting". i honestly had no idea what he was talking about when he said it too, which makes the whole thing even funnier. i looked it up though, and it made me laugh. according to the article i read, i have been "nesting" my entire young adult life. if i go into a real "nesting mode" my fifth month, chris is going to come home from tour one day and find that all of the sinks, carpet, tiles, and countertops have been replaced. then he will kill me. i don't think that it will be as funny as the article suggests, since i wont be alive to laugh about it with him.   dear god, please don't make me do that.   amen.    urlLink Nesting Instinct   "Around the fifth month of pregnancy, the "nesting" instinct can set in. This is an uncontrollable urge to clean one's house brought on by a desire to prepare a nest for the new baby, to tie up loose ends of old projects and to organize your world.   Females of the animal kingdom are all equipped with this same need. It is a primal instinct. Just as you see birds making their nests, mothers-to-be do exactly the same thing. The act of nesting puts you in control and gives a sense of accomplishment toward birth. You may become a homebody and want to retreat into the comfort of home and familiar company, like a brooding hen. The nesting urge can also be seen as a sign of the onset of labor when it occurs close to 40 weeks of pregnancy.   Nesting brings about some unique and seemingly irrational behaviors in pregnant women and all of them experience it differently. Women have reported throwing away perfectly good sheets and towels because they felt the strong need to have "brand new, clean" sheets and towels in their home. They have also reported doing things like taking apart the knobs on kitchen cupboards, just so they could disinfect the screws attached to the knobs. Women have discussed taking on cleaning their entire house, armed with a toothbrush. There seems to be no end to the lengths a nesting mother will go to prepare for her upcoming arrival.   This unusual burst of energy is responsible for women ironing anything in the house that couldn't out run them. Being preoccupied with ant killing, squishing them one at a time for weeks on end. Packing and unpacking the labor bag 50 times. Cleaning the kitchen cupboards and organizing everything by size to the point that you make sure the silverware patterns match when it's stacked in the cutlery drawer. Sorting the baby's clothes over and over again is a favorite theme. Taking them out of the drawers and re-folding them, putting them away and doing it over and over again. Nesting will provide interesting stories for years to come.   ....blah blah blah...   One that you and your partner are sure to laugh about in the years to come...if he ever forgives you for sending him off to work and ripping down all the wallpaper in the hall! You may laugh about it now but you probably won't laugh when you're in the middle of it. No one can pull you out of it no matter how silly your behavior may seem. It simply becomes something that you must do! "

       Star Trek: Lost Episode Transcript   (What kind of site would this be without at least one Star Trek reference?)  (Picard) "Mr. LaForge, have you had any success with your attempts at finding a weakness in the Borg? And Mr. Data, have you been able to access their command pathways?"   (Geordi)"Yes, Captain. In fact, we found the answer by searching through our archives on late Twentieth-century computing technology."   (Geordi presses a key, and a logo appears on the computer screen.)   (Riker looks puzzled.) "What the hell is 'Microsoft'?"   (Data turns to answer.) "Allow me to explain. We will send this program, for some reason called 'Windows', through the Borg command pathways. Once inside their root command unit, it will begin consuming system resources at an unstoppable rate."   (Picard) "But the Borg have the ability to adapt. Won't they alter their processing systems to increase their storage capacity?"   (Data) "Yes, Captain. But when 'Windows' detects this, it creates a new version of itself known as an 'upgrade'. The use of resources increases exponentially with each iteration. The Borg will not be able to adapt quickly enough. Eventually all of their processing ability will be taken over and none will be available for their normal operational functions."   (Picard) "Excellent work. This is even better than that 'unsolvable geometric shape' idea."   (Data) "Captain, We have successfully installed the 'Windows' in the command unit and as expected it immediately consumed 85% of all resources. We however have not received any confirmation of the expected 'upgrade'."   (Geordi) "Our scanners have picked up an increase in Borg storage and CPU capacity to compensate, but we still have no indication of an 'upgrade' to compensate for their increase."   (Picard) "Data, scan the history banks again and determine if their is something we have missed."   (Data) "Sir, I believe their is a reason for the failure in the 'upgrade'. Apparently the Borg have circumvented that part of the plan by not sending in their registration cards.   (Riker) "Captain we have no choice. Requesting permission to begin emergency escape sequence 3F . . ."   (Geordi, excited) "Wait, Captain I just detected their CPU capacity has suddenly dropped to 0% !"   (Picard) "Data, what does your scanners show?"   (Data) "Apparently the Borg have found the internal 'Windows' module named 'Solitaire' and it has used up all the CPU capacity."   (Picard) "Lets wait and see how long this 'solitaire' can reduce their functionality."   (Riker) "Geordi what's the status on the Borg?"   (Geordi) "As expected the Borg are attempting to re-engineer to compensate for increased CPU and storage demands, but each time they successfully increase resources I have setup our closest deep space monitor beacon to transmit more 'windows' modules from something called the 'Microsoft fun-pack'.   (Picard) "How much time will that buy us ?"   (Data) "Current Borg solution rates allow me to predicate an interest time span of 6 more hours."   (Geordi) "Captain, another vessel has entered our sector."   (Picard) "Identify."   (Data) "It appears to have markings very similar to the 'Microsoft' logo"   (Over the speakers) "THIS IS ADMIRAL BILL GATES OF THE MICROSOFT FLAGSHIP MONOPOLY. WE HAVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF UNREGISTERED SOFTWARE IN THIS SECTOR. SURRENDER ALL ASSETS AND WE CAN AVOID ANY TROUBLE. YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS"   (Data) "The alien ship has just opened its forward hatches and released thousands of humanoid shaped objects."   (Picard) "Magnify forward viewer on the alien craft"   (Riker) "Good God captain! Those are humans floating straight toward the Borg ship with no life support suits ! How can they survive the tortures of deep space ?!"   (Data) "I don't believe that those are humans sir, if you will look closer I believe you will see that they are carrying something recognized by twenty-first century man as doe skin leather briefcases, and wearing Armani suits"   (Riker and Picard together horrified) "Lawyers !!"   (Geordi) "It can't be. All the Lawyers were rounded up and sent hurtling into the sun in 2017 during the Great Awakening."   (Data) "True, but apparently some must have survived."   (Riker) "They have surrounded the Borg ship and are covering it with all types of papers."   (Data) "I believe that is known in ancient vernacular as 'red tape' - it often proves fatal."   (Riker) "They're tearing the Borg to pieces !"   (Picard) "Turn off the monitors. I can't stand to watch, not even the Borg deserve that."

      good news. horray! i just got a call back from the doctor i am not so fond of. apparently the blood work came back very good and our progesterone level was a 21. she sounded happy about that and mentioned that she usually looks for a 15. horray. i have to admit, i like her a lot better when she's being posi. today is a vast improvement from yesterday. my hormones are still insane though. boy, do i prefer this extra happy mood over the hysterical crying i experienced last night.   have i mentioned that i love chris more than anything in the world? i am so lucky to have him. sigh.   "Progesterone is recognized as a vital female hormone central to successful conception and a healthy pregnancy. The word progesterone is itself etymologically related to the Latin root gestare - meaning to bear or carry - suggesting the importance of this hormone in creating a fertile environment for conception and the continuing development of the embryo.   In short, progesterone is a female sex hormone that is secreted by the corpus luteum to prepare the endometrium for implantation of the fertilized egg. Following implantation, progesterone is then produced by the placenta during pregnancy to prevent rejection of the developing embryo or fetus. Therefore, progesterone plays a significant role in reproduction.   Progesterone:   -Helps create a fertile environment in the womb and promotes the survival of the fertilized egg through healthy implantation.  -Strengthens and maintains the secretory endometrium which sustains the embryo throughout pregnancy.  -Prevents the premature shedding of the secretory endometrium (menstruation)............"     urlLink yay for the internet explaining things to me

      today was difficult. more difficult than i was prepared for. chris and his mom took me to the obgyn for our first appointment. the whole experience started off on an uncomfortable note while we were in the waiting room. it ended with me being plain old miserable.   chris and his mom were having yet another conversation about marriage. yeah, if there's one thing i hate it's when they talk about it as if i have no part in the decision. she's obviously trying to get him to marry me, or was. i know that. i also know that we love each other and it is bound to happen someday - but all of the passing discussion about it is making me feel like shit. at this point i don't even want to hear the word again unless he's actually asking me. and i don't even care when that is- or even if he never does. i'm just tired of feeling like our relationship is something he's being forced into, because it's not.   i know that my hormones doing backflips. i know that a good part of the time i am being irrational. none of this changes the fact that the more this topic gets discussed in "passing", the more that i want to crawl into a ball and cry. i just want to say to everyone (my mom, sister, his mom): "hello! i'm right here. i can hear you talking. i am a human being and have (very irrational pregnant girl) feelings, ok? yes, i'd like to be his wife, but i am just as happy about how things are right now because we truly love each other and i have faith in that. the more you discuss it, the more you make me feel unwanted and that hurts. please stop."   now, i would REALLY appreciate it if none of you used the M word for a while. between our moms i've had it. deal? (that means you too, sister)   onto the next shitty event. i REALLY didn't like the doctor we went to. she was young,intelligent, and nice. she talked too fast. she didn't make an attempt to talk to me alone at all. she didn't look me in the eyes at all while she was speaking. worst of all, she scared me. and i felt very uncomfortable the entire time.   so, i guess i'm going to do a little more research as far as the doctor thing goes. i chris wasn't there i would have walked out within the first five minutes. i'm glad he was there though. he makes me feel safe. i don't know what else to say really. i still feel overwhelmingly upset and afraid.

      I curled back up in bed for a few minutes this morning - after eating my whole wheat crakcers and drinking half of my milk -  and... well, *basked* is really the only appropriate word, in the softness of our comforter snuggled up all around my ears. I don't climb back into bed often on workdays - mostly I'm late to the office because I never get out of it - but it was cold outside of our comforter, and it seemed like a good idea at the time.   turns out it was.   I had the first moment of something good I haven't felt in a long time, longer than I can remember. I'm not sure how exactly to describe the feeling. maybe a combination of contentment, happiness, optimism, peace - something warm and shining and pure that gleamed in my heart's eye like a pearl formed around a splinter of obsidian. I know I'm waxing goth-melodramatic here, and I hope that you will forgive me for it, but that's really what it felt like. I can still almost find that fleeting feeling of calm shining clean and white with all the colors of my emotions playing beneath its surface, but only if I don't try to grab onto it or stare too long at it. I'm better now, but only if I don't try too hard......

      things are starting to sink in. I haven't had a cigarette or a glass of wine since i saw two pink lines. I am hoping to go to the doctor tomorrow just to make sure things look ok. I can't help but worry about everything. everything.   I bought sone books yesterday. "What to expect when you're expecting" seems to be the most helpful so far. The most difficult part about all this seems to be the nutrition part. The diets seem so strict and difficult to adhere to. Hopefully the doctor will say things along the lines of "bacon and ice cream once in a while won't hurt anyone". heh. hopefully.   I already have awful morning/noon/night sickness and just about everyting is making me cry.   Chris is visiting his mom again, who is probably making invite lists and menus for the childs fifth birthday party. haha. She is so amazing.

        Ear you go!  It's never too late to start your Christmas shopping, and I have just the hot ticket for all you early birds out there who really do deserve the worm and whose family and friends only deserve the best. Check out these snappy little doodads, and at such a good price:   This luxury item reminds me of the scene in one of my all-time favorite movies, Breakfast at Tiffany's, where Holly and Paul, with $10 burning in their pockets, dash to Tiffany's, and the salesman suggests a marvelous little sterling silver telephone dialer.  Why use your own indelicate finger when a delicate implement designed exclusively for the activity is available at your fingertips? Indeed! Although cotton swabs (or Q-Tips, for those who enjoy using trademarked names as generics) serve the same purpose, you just don't get the same elegant effect from swabbing your ears as you do from scooping them (see the melon-baller-esque tip). And as everyone who's anyone knows, it's not just what you do, but how you do it.

      why we liberals don't like guns, by Ken Mondschein     "In the spirit of democracy, we present to you the following authoritative list of Why We Liberals Don't Like Guns.  1. We're Afraid of   We liberals are vegetarians, and, like most herbivores, we are easily startled by loud noises caused by things like guns, pickup trucks, and Ted Nugent. This brings us to the fact that. . .     2. We Don't Hunt  Tofu doesn't run away, and the biggest animals in my neighborhood are the subway rats. Besides which, since we believe so strongly in animal rights, it goes without saying that deer have as much right to live and be free and run for Congress as people do. Also, the thing about guns is that. . .     3. Bullets Come Out of Them  And bullets can poke your eye out, which is what Mom always said what would happen if we played with BB guns. Speaking of which. . .     4. We Know About As Much About Them As We Do About Fixing a '56 Chevy  Face it: Most liberals, being city-dwelling pansies, have never actually shot a firearm. (I have. Twice. Once was black powder, which involved the distinct possibility of blowing myself up.) However, even with my limited experience in shooting, I quickly discovered that. . .     5. We Liberals Are Really, Really Nearsighted and Clumsy  Most liberals, including Yours Truly, wear really, really thick nerd glasses and are secretly afraid we'd be really lousy shots. Also. . .     6. Shooting Involves Being Outdoors  We'd rather stay in and read Noam Chomsky and write letters to the Village Voice and work on our pasty complexions. However, no matter how liberal we are, one of the things about guns that scares us is. . .     7. We're Afraid Negroes Might Use Them Against Us  As much as we may decry any and all racism, most liberals can't name, off the top of their head, the last time they actually hung out with a black person. The hypocrisy inherent in this issue is worth a whole story, except that I'd get branded a racist and no one would ever talk to me again.  Also, it goes without saying that. . .     8. We Really Wish We Were European  Because we heard that European women are easy. However, you're not allowed to have guns in Europe. Speaking of Europe. . .     9. We Are Trying To Make You All Into Homosexuals  And that AR-15 just doesn't go with that handbag, girlfriend. Come to think of men in uniform. . .     10. We Haven't Had Any Really Good Wars Recently  There are two wars we liberals really wish we'd been around for. The first is World War II, because, to judge by how we always compare everyone to Fascists, we would have loved to help defeat the Nazis (but not the Japanese, because, Pearl Harbor notwithstanding, they were the victims of racism).  The second war we wish we'd been around for is Vietnam, but only to protest it, because nothing will ever again be as cool as the 1960s were. Also, we hear protesting the war got you laid.  Which brings us to. . .     11. We Like to Legislate  The liberal solution to a problem is to pass more laws. Only by constantly holding the threat of getting sued over everyone's head all the time can we create a just society. After all, people are inherently good and fair-minded, and that's why we need more laws to make them behave.   Actually, the real reason that we legislate so much is. . .     12. We're Trying To Install A UN-Led Zionist Occupation Government  We're Jewish, we're trying to take over, and only you and your .22 stand between us and complete world domination!  In fact, the Jewish lust for power brings up another fear. . .     13. We're Secretly Afraid We Might Shoot Someone  No! No! Bad thought! After all. . .     14. When I Was Just a Baby, My Momma Told Me, "Son, Always be a Good Boy, Don't Ever Play with Guns"  But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.     Of course, it's obvious that the cause of gun crime isn't guns; it's the fact that we live in a society where the poorest people are crammed into crummy inner-city neighborhoods and people get so fed up with all the bureaucratic bullshit they flip out on bullet-shooting sprees. Take away the guns, and they'll probably just go on thumbtack-and-Bic-pen-stabbing sprees..."   urlLink corporate mother fucker

      RED WINE The positive and a few negative aspect of wine, and red wine in particular.    Negative aspects Alcohol: high alcohol cunsumption results in a higher blood pressure and may cause hypertension. It has a positive correlation with mouth- throat- and gullet (med. oesophagus) cancer; under certain circumstances with liver cancer and liver cirrhosis. But what is "high" or "too much"? This defenition depends on the country you live in as well as you physiological condition. E.g. in the northern European countries, 2-3 glasses a day is considered more than enough, whereas the Mediterraneans think 5 glasses is still acceptable. Differences on a physiological basis: your body weight, dayly energy intake and the presence of ADH (= alcohol dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the stomach that degrades the alcohol before it can enter the blood stream).   Tannin: these compounds are plant polyphenols and may cause headaches. Tannins tend to bind starches while being digested. These starches are needed by the body to produce serotonin. In some people, who are extremely sensitive to their serotonin levels, it appears the lack of serotonin can lead to a migraine. It sort of "starves" the body for this type of raw material, much as not eating for many hours might lead this person to have the same migraine. Tannin sensitivity is also now thought to be cumulative - a person who begins life with no tannin sensitivities may yet develop one as he or she ages. People who are sensitive to tannins need to moderate their intake of tannins in all forms, and also be sure to eat a reasonable amount of food while ingesting tannins, so the binding affects of tannins do not cause undue stress. But see also below at the positive aspects.   Sulfites: some people are sensitive to it.   That for the negative aspects, now the more favorable and pleasurable facts of red wine   Positive aspects   Reducing coronary heart diseases: the wine is altering the blood lipid levels. It lowers the total cholesterol count, and raises the high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. This is supported by epidemiological studies: the polyphenols may be involved in this cardioprotective effect because of their antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties, resulting in decreased generation of oxidized lipids. The tested red wine extracts (cabernet-sauvignon grape variety) elicited enhanced NO generation, cyclic GMP accumulation and endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat aortic rings. Both anthocyanins and oligomeric condensed tannins appeared to be involved. Among the anthocyanins, delphinidin, but not malvidin or cyanidin, produced endothelial NO-dependent vasorelaxation (aka: it smooths the muscles of the blood vessels), indicating that only some specific structures are able to cause endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, independently of their antioxidant properties. To achieve this effect, extracellular Ca2+ (=calcium ion) is needed for activation (of endothelial NO synthase activation). Summarizing: their findings suggest that one of the mechanisms of the cardioprotective effects of red wine and other plants containing polyphenols may be the increase in endothelial NO production induced by oligomeric condensed tannins and anthocyanins.    Red wine maintains the immune system: According to a study published by the University of Florida, red wine does not supress the immune system like other alcoholic beverages. A two month study on mice has been performed to examine what immune system reactions red wine caused on mammals. The team examined mice of various drinking levels - non-drinkers, red wine drinkers, and heavy alcohol drinkers. They found that those who drank the red wine had a normal level of immunity, the same as that of the non-drinking mice. (The level of red wine consumption for the mice would equal that of a human drinking two or three glasses a night. But at the moment of writing (2001) they don't have a clue which compounds in red wine is causing this, but I'd go for the tannins.    Polyphenols in wine: like the tannin mentioned above, do have a positive effect on your body as well: they are excellent antioxidants. In short: they lower total cholesterol and blood pressure, lessen risks of cancer, stimulate the immune system, and have anti-bacterial properties. See the above mentioned aspects for morte detail.   Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene): is a naturally occurring antioxidant too that decreases the stickiness of blood platelets and helps blood vessels remain open and flexible. It is said that it inhibits the enzymes that can stimulate cancer-cell growth and suppress immune response. A series of laboratory experiments suggests the proof of this statement. However, this was only tested on animals. In another set of animal tests, resveratrol was shown to inhibit both the acute and chronic phases of inflammation (yet again the immunbe system). Wine is the primary dietary source of resveratrol, and red wine contains much greater amounts of resveratrol than does white wine, since resveratrol is concentrated in the grape skin and the manufacturing process of red wine includes prolonged contact with grape skins. Resveratrol has been used in connection with atherosclerosis too (a reduced risk of course). Resveratrol is a phytoestrogen (= similar to estrogen, but from plant origin, and is known to inhibit tumors in the breast and uterus), but it differs from other phytoestrogens in that it acts as an estrogen agonist and stimulates ERE-driven reporter gene activity in CHO-K1 cells (I couldn't get access to ERE gen information, nor the exact description of CHO-K1 cells, but the context of the abstract implies increased DNA transcription activity of specific ERE-gene sequences in genetically modified(?) cells in rat uteri).  A brief calculation: a glass of red wine provides approximately 640 mcg of resveratrol, while a handful of peanuts provides about 73 mcg. The amount used in animals to prevent cancer, however, would exceed 500 mg per human adult. This equals about 2.5 bottles of wine... So there must be at least one other component, or a mixture, that contributes to the decrease in occurence of cancer and high blood pressure prevention.   Flavonoids: Red grapes contain flavonoids, also powerful antioxidants that work as cancer preventives.   Anti-bacterial activity: In a study of 1800 people, scientists tested for the presence of Helicobacter pylori, which causes ulcer infections. Compared to non-drinkers, those who had one glass of wine a day had 7% fewer of these bacteria. Those who drink two glasses a day had 18%, and those who drank 3 or more glasses had 1/3 fewer bacteria. On the conto of tannins maybe?   Anti-stress: wine does have a calming influence (surprise, surprise). The fact that a dinner is accompanied by a drink which helps the body relax and unwind can help the mental transition between work and relaxation. Also, people fighting other illness]s can combat them better when calm and focused.     However, remains the question for the Health Board and researchers to clarify if red grape juice is as healthy as red wine. I'm not aware of published results that prove this hypothesis. During my college years some research has been carried out, of which the results show that the grape juice does have some positive effects, but not as profound as red wine. hihaa! Really, this is not just my selective memory speaking. During the preliminary research they didn't have the faintest idea for constructing a nice and plausible explanation for that, other then the scientifically correct description that goes something like this: "it is very likely a combination of well balanced different components and possibly environmental parameters acting together that influences the overall beneficial effect of red wine".      Conclusion  The net effect of drinking at least 2 to 3 glasses of wine a day is supposed to result in a healthier life.      Besides my own knowledge, I used the following sources trying to get the results of the most recent research: http://www.pulsus.com/europe/05_01/stoc_ed.htm http://endo.edoc.com/end/v141n10/3657-abs-frame.html (is an abstract from Endocrinology, October 2000, Vol. 141, No. 10, pp. 3657-3667) http://wine.about.com/food/wine/library/encyc/bl_tannin.htm http://www.healthwell.com/healthnotes/Supp/Resveratrol.cfm

      I don't know how many bottles of beer I have consumed while waiting for things  to get better I dont know how much wine and whisky and beer mostly beer I have consumed after  splits with women- waiting for the phone to ring waiting for the sound of footsteps, and the phone to ring waiting for the sounds of footsteps, and the phone never rings until much later and the footsteps never arrive until much later when my stomach is coming up out of my mouth they arrive as fresh as spring flowers: "what the hell have you done to yourself? it will be 3 days before you can fuck me!"  the female is durable she lives seven and one half years longer than the male, and she drinks very little beer because she knows its bad for the figure.  while we are going mad they are out dancing and laughing with horney cowboys.  well, there's beer sacks and sacks of empty beer bottles and when you pick one up the bottle fall through the wet bottom of the paper sack  rolling clanking spilling gray wet ash and stale beer, or the sacks fall over at 4 a.m. in the morning making the only sound in your life.  beer rivers and seas of beer the radio singing love songs as the phone remains silent and the walls stand straight up and down and beer is all there is.

      I want you. To want me. I WANT YOU TO WANT ME. I BEG YOU TO BEG ME. Sorry, it was on aol radio, and I like a Cheap Trick fix as much as anyone else. I'll stop it now.  I love the way perspectives change as we age. For example: 5 years ago, I had no idea I'd be 24, even though I was 19 and I could do simple math. 24 might sound young to those of you in your thirties or forties, but it's not. 24 is, in my opinion, when one changes from puppy to full-grown dog. Attitudes change, relationships change. Life mutates into this strange entity called "reality", and I'm not sure if I like it very much. Alas, there is someone very close to me who will always be eleven years older: Chris the Boyfriend.   Eleven years. Sounds like nothing to mature adults, right? I mean, I knew seventeen-year-old girls in high school who dated 32 year-old men. But I still remember when I was 11 years old--I was innocent. I played with legos. I played with Barbies. I had scads of Cabbage Patch Kids. I thought boys were icky. That same year, Chris was 22. He'd learned the special significance behind boobs; he listened to Metallica; he'd discovered the beauty of masturbation. He was banging  chicks and going to shows. I was learning fractions and playing four-square.  Chris and I started dating when I was 23 and he was 34 --quite a bragging right for a guy in his mid 30's. However, since the inception of our "relationship" (I hate that word), we've been playing this fun game. No, not the one with blindfolds and enemas. I call it "The Age Game". Simply put, he tells a story about his life B.J. (Before Jenna), and I proudly state how old I was at that time and what activities I enjoyed. For example, when Chris was graduating from high school, I was collecting my little ponys. He contemplated his future, and I began my long and illustrious career with illicit drugs. Wait. Bad example. Anyway, it goes something like that. Funny huh!  In fact, let's play a little "Age Game" right now.  Chris  1980: Chris was around twelve. He grew his first pube. Wondered what "white stuff" was like.  (this is a guess because he can't even remember this far back, apparently)  1982: Chris was 14. He learned the importance of a blow job. Soon after he found out how much fun sex is. (thank you, whoever you are)  1984: Chris was 16. He learned how to drive. (legally)  1986: Chris was 18. He started college.  2003: Chris was 34. He meets Jenna and can't seem to get rid of her.  Jenna  1980: Jenna was one. She wore a diaper and cried a lot. She was awfully cute, though.  1982: Jenna was three. She was pretty boring at this age and enjoyed sleeping and playing alone.  1984: Jenna was five. She impressed many family members with her ability to read Charlottes Web. She loved playing with her two year old sister more than anything.  1986: Jenna was seven. She started hating life, in general, and ignoring everyone around her.  2003: Jenna meets Chris and regains faith in the world. Her life is changed forever.  I'm sure a totally futile and moronic game like this one is infuriating to him, but I think it will always be a joy for me. Why? Because I'm both sadistic and retarded. (And I need to feel as though it's OK to be much more immature and sensitive than him right now).   Oh, and something's been bothering me lately (this is completely unrelated to the age game). I like to know everything. Everything. And as you all know, I have these great access and referral logs that allow me to know almost everything--mainly how you got here and where you're coming from. Yes, those are two different things. I've figured out almost every regular visitor to this site by these logs. Almost. The person who works for a company that starts with V and ends with R (to protect anonymity), who the hell are you? I have to admit, I'm stumped! At least give me a hint! JMEEISIS at yahoo dot com, I might even give you a tribute! Now, wouldn't that make your day? It wouldn't? Damnit. Oh well. Humor me.   p.s. Puerto Rico was beautiful and amazing and impressive and terrifying. (just like everything else). i missed rick and my computer most. The highlight was DEFINATELY Chris and I having a penny throwing party in bed. (at each other). Such silly jews

Chris,  I have fallen for you completely. I have been walking on cloud nine since I met you and we had our first lengthy conversation. Now that I am with you, I can say without equivocation that I am truly, madly, deeply in love with you. You are my boyfriend, my life partner, my soul-mate, my one and only, my everything. I know in my heart that I could live for a thousand years and never find any greater joy than I have right now.   I guess everyone hopes to find a person who completely captures their heart, mind, body and soul, but not until i found you did I believe it would ever happen to me. I promise that I will continue to be 100% honest with you. There will be no secrets I ever keep from you. You are the most amazing man on the planet, and I am the luckiest woman. If you'll let me, I will sing your praises every time we speak, every single day for the rest of our natural lives. I will sing your praises from every mountaintop, I have, and I will thank God every second of every minute of every hour of every day for bringing you into this world, and I will praise his name two times for bringing you into my life. You are incredible, you are incomparable, you are magnificent, you are the standard by which all other people should be judged, inside and out. You are my heart, you are my future, you are my life, from now until the end of time, if you will have me.    (girlfriend contract)   I love you. I want you in my life forever. I will never ever hurt you, lie to you, be unfaithful to you, or fail to live up to your standards. I will never ever leave you for as long as you'll have me. I will always trust, respect, and believe in you. I will spend the rest of my life trying my very best to make you the happiest man who ever lived.  With undying love and eternal devotion,  Jenna   urlLink muah

      I have a pretty major announcement to make today. Don't worry -- it's happy news, and as I prepare to embark on a lifetime commitment with the one I love, I want to share my happiness with you . I've decided to get married.   To wine.   What? Seriously. Every element of a love song -- the I love yous, the I can't live without yous, the you make my life completes and the wind beneath my wingses -- is how I feel about wine, and I've never felt it more profoundly than I do today.  It's time for declare my enduring love for wine in front of God and the world.  In other news, I need a nap that lasts until Christmasof 2005. Because zzzz.  I seem to have descended into a vicious circle wherein I don't get enough sleep because I have so much to do, so I lie awake worrying about how much I have to do, and about not sleeping enough, and about how I'll never get it all done when I feel so tired, and on and on it goes. Eventually, I get sleepy, and then, just as I prepare to disembark from the train to the Land of Nodthe the dogs..  So, for some time, I lie awake, serenaded by the melodious sounds of bored panting and chewing, and I worry, and I wonder about things.  I wonder why Jinx is chewing on on my sock. I wonder why I bother wondering about that, since Jinx will eat and/or play with anything that isn't nailed down, will eat and/or play with most nailed-down items as well, hates me, is crazy, is evil, is crazy-evil, and owes me ten socks. I wonder if it's true what they say about germs on feet. I wonder if I can catch a cold if Jinx gnaws on my sock and then drinks out of my wine glass. I wonder if the four year old sock I found (destroyed) the other day has germs on it from 1999. What if I get polio from that sock? Or tuberculosis? Or scurvy? I wonder if I should get up and wash my hands, although it's too late anyway and I obviously already have yellow fever and I shouldn't go to sleep at all since I'll wake up dead.  I wonder where the expression "wake up dead" came from.  I wonder if that "reeeee! ree ree!" noise it makes counts as yipping, or as squealing.  One forty-oneone forty-twoone for-- shit, did I skip one thirty-nine? I think I skipped one thirty-nine.  Do I count a howl as three yips or what? And how can nobody have stuffed a potato down that little fuckwad's throat by now? Shut UP, Yipsey Russell! You made me lose count! Wait. Oh. Crap, I've gone insane.  Two twelvetwo thirteentwo fourteentwo fifteenI'm going to kill myselftwo seventeenoh, thank God.  Aaaaand jinxed it. Nice one, Bunting. Crazy and stupid. Great. Two eighteentwo nineteentwo twentytwoahhhh. Hello, sleep.   (FYI: all of the dogs are being silent right now. i'm just feeling silly.)

      How To Keep A Healthy Level Of Insanity  1. At lunch time, sit in your parked car with sunglasses on and point a hair dryer at passing cars. See if they slow down.  2. Page yourself over the intercom. Don't disguise your voice.  3. Every time someone asks you to do something, ask if they want fries with that.  4. Put your garbage can on your desk and label it "in".  5. Put decaf in the coffee maker for 3 weeks. Once everyone has gotten over their caffeine addictions, switch to espresso.  6. In the memo field of all your checks, write "for sexual favors".  7. Finish all your sentences with "in accordance with the prophecy."  8. Don't use any punctuation marks  9. As often as possible, skip rather than walk.  10. Ask people what sex they are. Laugh hysterically after they answer.  11. Specify that your drive-through order is "to go".  12. Sing along at the opera.  13. Go to a poetry recital and ask why the poems don't rhyme.  14. Put mosquito netting around your work area. Play a tape of jungle sounds all day.  15. Five days in advance, tell your friends you can't attend their party because you're not in the mood.  16. Have your coworkers address you by your wrestling name, "Rock Hard Becky".  17. When the money comes out the ATM, scream "I won! I won! 3rd time this week!!!!!"  18. When leaving the zoo, start running towards the parking lot, yelling "Run for your lives, they're loose!!"  19. Tell your children over dinner, "Due to the economy, we're going to have to let one of you go."

      Sadly, everything they say about pregnant women and cravings and the complete erosion of decency is absolutely true, and this evening I found myself standing utterly defenseless in the stop&shop buying all of the ingredients necessary to make my mom's famous meat loaf and mashed potatos. Honestly, that was the only thing I could have eaten at that moment, meat loaf made specifically the way my mom makes it, and I cant remember a better tasting meal in the last 10 years of my life.  Another thing that has happened is all my clothes have started to fit differently, even though Im not much over my normal weight. I cant wear any of my jeans anymore, and even the comfy little pajama pants that used to hang on my hips are hugging my belly so tightly that I walk around like Ive got a corn cob stuck up my ass. (mmmm, corn on the cob)   I definitely thought that the nausea would have begun to subside by this time, but the last two weeks have been by far the worst of the whole pregnancy. And there is no way to describe what this type of nausea feels like, just how torturous this sickness has been. And whenever people ask me, always expecting me to nod quickly in return, Dont you love being pregnant? I feel like I need to stand up for every woman who has thought to herself in dark moments that being pregnant is the worst lot in life and give them a lengthy, gory detail-ridden treatise on why in reality this whole process TOTALLY SUCKS, starting with what it tastes like to puke up chocolate pudding.  But the other day, in those two or three seconds where I heard the baby's heart beat coming from my abdomen, I completely believed all the hype, that this never-ending nausea, this tightening of my favorite jeans around my expanding hips, this craving of all things greasy or fried, its all totally fucking worth it. Were having a baby.

       Things in the Past Week That Have Brought Me to Uncontrollable Tears    The finely orchestrated piece of crap otherwise known as the finale to Joe Millionaire.  The look on jinx's face when I tripped over him coming out of the shower.  The delicate beauty of a PB&J.  The realization that Paris Hilton is someones daughter.  Almost every sentence on every page of Under the Banner of Heaven, by Jon Krakauer.  The fact i can't seem to stay awake longer than an hour at any given time.  The fact that he is always awake to ask me if Im okay when I return from the bathroom.  Not having enough bread to complete the recipe for a pb&j sandwich and being unable to make a pchocolate chip pb&j sandwich.  Twelve consecutive hours of no bread in the house.  Various segments on NBCs Today show specifically engineered to make people in my condition cry, all of them involving the triumph of the human spirit or massive amounts of weight loss.  That one commercial where the guy is painting a wall in his living room and he accidentally backs up and knocks over the can of paint and it goes sprawling all over the wood floors and the Persian rug and he cant do anything but watch it splatter. That poor guy.  Being unable to fit into most of my jeans.  Remembering that when I was eight years old I thought I would grow up, have a baby girl and name her either Zoey or Emma.  A spontaneous bout of heartburn that started over five days ago and has yet to subside.  Seeing a man on television belly flop into a pool of water and thinking that he totally just hurt his baby.  Thinking that there is no way a uterus could fit inside a body that can fit into Victorias Secret lingerie.

      Last night I had a dream that I gave birth to a 15lb baby boy through my belly button. He came out feet first wearing matching little blue sneakers and a plaid fishing hat, and the whole labor was entirely painless. I just pulled him out by the sneakers, and plop, there he was.  I know that if I actually gave birth to a baby who was wearing clothes when he came out of the womb that Id be quarantined and that theyd take him away and do all sorts of tests, but when I woke up from that dream I was honestly a little disappointed that it wasnt true. I mean, having a baby who not only comes equipped with his own clothes but is evolved enough to know how to match them,... now that is the type of baby I can get behind.

      OK. SO, Now that the nausea has thoroughly subsided I am able to eat properly for two, and once Im done with two I feed the other 15 appetites that have seemingly taken up residence in my body. There are no words to describe the hunger I experience on a moment to moment basis, and not even white bread can satiate the urge to eat my own fingers. Not that I havent tried to curb the demons with white bread  bagels, crumbly buttermilk biscuits, rolls, English muffins, and little dough balls made from strips of Wonder Bread that I roll up in the palm of my hand. Never before I have I been such an irresponsible adult, clogging my arteries hourly with enough carbohydrate voltage to power the United States. Im willing to bet that my boobs are just storage receptacles for excess white bread, and lets just say that Im well stocked for the long winter ahead.  In addition to the boobation and hunger, the major second trimester side effects Im experiencing are aches and pains and cramps associated with the expansion of my uterus. If that sounds uncomfortable, you should try sleeping on your left side the ENTIRE NIGHT, five nights in a row as your thighs stretch and crack in opposite directions. Most of the books Ive read say that if I wake up in the middle of the night and I happen to be on my back, I should just roll over to my left side and not panic; however, sleeping on my back has the potential to suffocate the baby eventually and kill it dead in the uterus, SO BE CAREFUL AND GET USED TO IT! Im honestly afraid that if I happen to stop for more than a millisecond on my back as I turn from one side to the other that the Baby Police are going to come to my house and take me away in the back of a squad car for conspiracy to commit baby endangerment, and Id be totally guilty. Anyone with white bread boobs has to be guilty of something.  now fuck off.

      I used to like Led Zeppelin.  Blondes have it better than septic tank poopy reds.  Ones dog shouldnt smell better than ones own armpits.  If I had enough money to be on MTVs Cribs, Id have an entire room covered in blubble-wrap, with bubble-wrap area rugs and a bubble-wrap recliner, and Id walk around stylin in my bubble-wrap bling.  Snow is totally overrated.  Anyone with a website and too much time can find themselves selling crap merchandise, thanks to cafepress.  I never knew my nose was capable of such boogers.  All i need to feel happy is a chipwich.

      The past three months have been a creative nightmare here at Girl138 Headquarters, primarily because the parasite in my body has made it so that the definition of a good day is one in which I get up and actually wash my hair. Days when I actually take a shower or break out a tube of mascara are classified as really good, and on the rare occasion that I take a shower and wash my hair, I award myself gold stars of excellence.  Now that Im feeling better and taking regular showers, I am hoping that Chris and I will be getting out of the house more, especially since he doesnt have to worry about taking me out in public with my hair caked in hormonal grease. For the past several weeks (when the house wasn't packed with extemely loud people) weve been sitting on our butts for hours on end, doing absolutely nothing.   Ive decided that as a means of self-motivation Im going to try and publish a weekly set of photos that will include a status snaphot of my growing belly. (If you  urlLink click here , you'll see the first of the batch) This may or may not work, and in a couple weeks I may abandon the whole idea because Im lazy like that. But I keep thinking that it would be fantastic at the end of this pregnancy to have a weekly collection of photos that shows me getting bigger and bigger and slower and slower on the stair case, if only to be able to show it to the baby when he/she is old enough to respond to guilt and manipulation.

      Last night, while chris was having band practice, i got a phone call from my OBYGN. Apparently I had an abnormal pap result which they refer to as mild  urlLink cervical dysplasia . Basically, i have pre cancerous cells on my cervix. I was hysterical. Chris had to cancel his practice and sit with me. I cried all night long and barely slept at all. I still have a migrane.  I am really dissapointed to how my doctor's office handled breaking the news to me. When they called all that they told me was that I had a pre cancerous condition and I needed to schedule a biopsy. They didn't even tell me what it was called until I asked. That's it. They never told me anything about the negative HPV test or about how the condition is "mild" and has a very good chance of healing itself, until I called the office in hysterics today. (Not to mention it has a very good chance of being a false positive - since the HPV test came back negative (HPV is the usual cause) and I AM fucking pregnant).  I don't trust doctors and I am not going to allow them to do any further testing until after I recover from having this baby, since I have read a lot in the last 24 hours saying that there is a very good chance that the condition will dissapear after the baby is born - and and that it's even more likely to happen if I follow a good diet and stay away from smokers. Even in the worst case scenario I still have plenty of time to let them go cutting my cervix into pieces. Apparently this condition takes up to 10 years to turn into anything cancerous, and "mild dysplasia" practically never turns into cancer anyway.   Have I mentioned that most of the procedures they do to remove these cells are knows to cause premature birth, an incompetant cervix, and miscarriage? Some even destroy your ability to have children. I wonder if they think that I am unable to read.  I'm following my gut on this. The biopsy and treatment (or lack there of) is just going to have to wait until after this baby is born, and there is no fucking way I am allowing them to convince me otherwise. After the baby I will have another pap .. and if there is no change THEN and only THEN will I allow this to proceed. Period.  I am looking forward to going to the doctors office and introducing an idea to them that they have obviously never heard of before. It's called mother fucking bedside manner. I think that next time they want to scare the living shit out of someone, they should do it in their fucking office where the person can ask questions. Or here's an idea.. How about having the Doctor call the patient instead of some illiterate secretary.  Was I supposed to wait for 9 days until my next appointment thinking that I was going to die or lose my baby? I wont forget to thank them for the the sleepless night and stress related migrane either.

      I know that Ill probably have a little more insight into this when I finally give birth and am able to hold my own child in my arms, but right now, now as I can barely sit up straight without feeling the thump thump thump of my heart in my ears as it signals the march of acid through my digestive tract, as the smell of herbal shampoo in my hair urges me to hurl, as the mere thought of chicken wings conjures nightmares of being drowned in pools of rotting septic waste, I really have no idea how billions of women in the history of the world have not only gone through this once, but have agreed to go through it AGAIN AND AGAIN.  Is there an epidemic of amnesia among mothers that no one talks about? I cant imagine that Ill forget anytime soon what it feels like to be nauseous in my fingers and toes. I can feel the dizziness in my eyebrows and in my elbows. Every joint in my body has gathered with signs and megaphones and is shouting in unison, THIS IS NOT WHAT NATURE INTENDED. And I really have to wonder, how did billions of years of evolution end up here, with pregnancy ushering in wholly debilitating nausea and a sense of smell normally reserved for canines? I mean, its 2004, for crying out loud. Humans now have the technology to PAUSE LIVE TELEVISION, why cant a woman who is pregnant wash her hands without dry-heaving stomach bile at the smell of Softsoap? HOW ARE THERE HUMAN BEINGS BORN IN THIS WORLD WHEN THERE IS SOFTSOAP SITTING ON BATHROOM COUNTERTOPS?

      How Your Baby Grows -- A monthly diary of your baby's development  (MONTH FOUR)   Your Baby  The fetus moves, kicks, swallows, and can hear your voice. The skin is pink and transparent. Umbilical cord continues to grow and thicken to carry enough nourishment from mother to fetus -- but it also can pass along hazards like tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. Placenta is fully formed. By end of 4th month, fetus is 6 to 7 inches long and weighs about 5 ounces

      finally feeling a little better, i think. not AS mad at the universe as before.. but i still have a lot of thinking to do. babies don't make life any less complicated, that's for sure. i guess that's part of the deal though. all i know is that i am not really upset anymore. i'm just in fix things before you hate everything in your life mode...   on another note - i think i'm going out with julie tonight. hopefully we'll get some real food. that would be lovely.   time to shower and stuff. i look like i was attacked by a lawn mower and (suprise) a bunch of chris's friends just walked into the house.  bye.

      This year has begun on the shittiest note ever. Actually, "fucking miserable" would be a more accurate description. New years eve was a disaster for me. I tried to stay in good spirits but it was impossible. I made a ton of food for the hundred or so people that were at our house, but within an hour or two i was so exhausted and sick that I had to hide in our room. That didn't help much though, since people were screaming and making enough noise to make a person deaf. Having to throw up every half hour didn't help much either, since there was a ten person line to get into the bathroom all night long. I wanted to kill myself.. but I just kept telling myself that it was only one night... and it would be over soon. Too bad that wasn't the case.  Friday night some unknown person (i say that because everyone is pretending that they didn't know they were having another party) invited about thirty people over for another smoking, drinking, and being too loud to hear yourself thinking spree. I was even more sick than on New Years Eve. All I wante to do was go to sleep, but that was impossible with all of the noise. It would have been nice to be able to go downstairs and eat something.. because I was starving - but that was totally out of the question since the whole house had been transformed into a giant fucking ash tray. I tried to go to sleep so that I wouldn't cry - but it was no use. People kept walking into our room in an attemp to make me feel better or something. The only thing that got accomplished was that I was so upset I was unable to fall asleep until six in the morning.  Saturday Chris invited another six or seven people to sleep over. They left this morning.  SO it's sunday. All I wanted was one night to spend with Chris. One night that wasn't miserable or loud or filled with people.  Fat chance. He just went to a show with Rick.   I know that I am hormonal and easy to upset right now, btu in all honestly I feel like I shouldn't even be here. I am not sure that I want to be here anymore. It's too much chaos.. and it's no place for a pregnant woman. or a baby.   I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so unimportant. (even worse, I feel like i'm ruining their fun). I wish my mom wasn't so far away. It's hard having nowhere to go when it gets like this. My body is so tired and I feel bad about myself and everything around me. I would give a million dollars to have just one person in my life to realize that I am not feeling like this for fun. There is a fucking PERSON growing inside of me and it is hard on my body and mind.  Of course, that won't happen... because people are selfish and shitty by nature. I just wish that I had somewhere to go whre I didn't feel like a pain in the ass and I didn't have to be faced with the fact that no one gives a shit that the fact that I can't sleep and I am constantly surrounded by smoke all the time (especially in mass quantities) can and will hurt our baby.   I might get an apartment around here... Just for that reason. I need somewhere to go when everyone is being an inconsiderate asshole. The only thing that scares me is that If I do get a place of my own- and things continue to be like this - I might never come home. (not than anyone would mind, i'm sure)  Crappy New Year Everyone. Cheers.

      yesterday i ordered cleatus's  urlLink crib, dresser, armoir, changing table, and a glider . it's all about  urlLink bellini baby . seriously, i don't know what i'd do if i didn't make a good amount of money. i have such expensive taste. this stuff cost me over $3700.   thankully, everything turns into teen furniture - including the crib. the way i see it - the longer we can use all of this stuff, the better.  in other news, i woke up on the wrong side if the bed today. i feel sad and alone, again.i can't wait for this baby to be born just so that i have something to do with myself again. ugh. i think i'm going to go shopping soon. i know it's shallow way to deal with life, but it helps.

      i am going to be an "unmarried mother" and our baby will be considered "illegitimate".  Ohhhhh yeahhhhhh - and my baby sister will be getting married before we will. Have i mentioned that she met her boyfriend after we found out I was pregnant.  pretty cool, huh? ok, not really. i'm hormonal and i hate that I am going to be called a "single mother". I hate that our baby will be classified as "illegitimate". And even more so I absolutely HATE that Chris, Cleatus and I can't all have the same last name..  You know, like a  real family ? That shit kills me. Especially since we love each other so much and (if I have anything to do with it) we will be together forever. It just seems like such a fucking waste to me.  Yeah so, I brought it up today in conversation. This did not go over well. Basically, I tried to explain that no matter what happened - I was not going to have a different last name from this baby, even if it was only for a day. Chris didn't seem to like this idea too much. He said that I'm "causing the name problem" not "helping it" - because we "can" get married after the baby is born and then I can have the same last name as the two of them. I guess he doesn't realize that the name problem (as I see it) is the fact that  we aren't going to be married when the baby is born, and therefor this baby will have a different last name from one of us for an unknown amount of time  (he, of course, would like this person to be me).   Sure, we could get married now and have the reception/party after the baby is born. The was the whole reason I wanted us to elope in the first place. We could get some time to spend alone before the baby is born. see some sunshine. have some fun. We could *make it official* somewhere that we would really enjoy - and then after the baby is born Chris could have the wedding party that he really wants. With everyone he wants to invite. I thought everyone would win. Yeah. Somehow that turned into bringing the entire "wedding party" on the trip. hehe. Oh man, I am not getting into this again.  Yeah so, I'm crushed. dissapointed. sad. a little angry. etc.  I think that not doing this is selfish on both our parts - but if this is how it has to be, SO BE IT.  I'm just not going to be the lucky winner of the odd last name. Even if it is only for a short time. No thank you. I spend enough time feeling alienated. I'm having the same name as this baby. period.  I won't back down, but i'll get over being upset about it. I always do.  Anyway, I really shouldn't be allowed to read things like  urlLink this  in my pregnant state. So not helpful when I feel like this.

      Taken from one of those pregnancy boards I mentioned the other day:  "... Everything came back completely normal with the AFP test and everything is completely normal from the ultrasound.....the only sad thing was that I gained 6 pounds in one month! Wow! Anyone else with me?"  I guess we all gotta find something to be despondent about.  But...it gets even better. As I perused my way down the list of discussion threads on this particular pregnancy board, I came upon this title from another thread:   "Is it appropriate to wear velvet pants?"  I was captivated. Truly. I sat there for a good 2 - 3 minutes staring at that discussion thread title, debating on whether or not I should open and read some more.   Never in my life had I weighed the moral nature of pants, be them velvet or otherwise.   What the fuck could this woman possibly be talking about?   Ultimately, I decided it would be best if I never found out.  In other news, I went to see my OB today. Everything seems to be going well. My belly is measuring at 20cm (perfect).. the baby's heart beat is 155bpm (perfect) and my cervix is looking lovely as ever. Nothing abnormal going on for once. I am getting really excited about all of this. We're half way cooked! I can't wait to have this baby, but I really want him/her beamed out of me painlessly like on Star Trek...   Our next U/S is on March 2nd - then Chris and I can go TINY PENIS/VAGINA HUNTING! How cool is that?

      In less than two weeks Chris and I find out whether were having a boy or a girl.  During the fist trimester I was convinced that I was having a boy, primarily because I only had dreams about boys and everyone around me had been insisting that it's a boy.   Now that Im in my second trimester Im not so sure Im carrying a boy, and thats probably because Im feeling utterly overhwlemed with the urge to purchase little pink dresses, size 0-6 months. My feminist friends would be completely horrified to know this about me, that if I have a girl I will totally dress her like a girl. I know Im not supposed to impose my stringent, close-minded, privileged white bourgeois notion of gender roles onto my innocent child, but what baby girl in her right mind wouldnt want to show up to play group in  urlLink this ? or  urlLink these ?

      The problem with depression, at least as i experience it, is that when i feel depressed i feel overwhelmed. Or maybe it's the other way, my depression occurs when i'm overwhelmed. That sort of makes more sense, i get why i'm overwhelmed, but i'm not sure why i would be depressed. Whichever it is, i still feel overwhelmed, which leads me to feeling useless and think that my attempt to do something - anything - is futile.  What can i do to stop this? I can go somewhere quiet, try to think things out, and write some ideas out. That's what i could do. But instead, i'm trapped in this morning stillness - a stillness i usually love - with that burning question of what's the point? Why should i bother? i'm not a good girlfriend, i'm not going to be a good mother,  i'm not doing that incredible job that i wanted to do.  And yeah, okay, i know that isn't necessarily the truth. I know that i'm feeling overwhelmed/depressed and that's tainting my judgment. I totally get that. I know that it takes awhile to adjust to the ebb and flow of a new life and that i have plenty of time to find my footing. I love my life. I love Chris and I love this baby.  I know, I know, I know, I know. I am very lucky.  but this morning i still feel small and scared. hopefully writing it down will get it out of my system. hopefully...

      So Im going to sit here and tell you what happened, and Im not going to take it back, and Im not going to hate myself in the morning. In fact, Im tired of hating myself in the morning and making excuses.  Why are we constantly making excuses anyway? Why do we feel like we have to say, hey, I know Im going to hate myself in the morning, but I had a decision to make, so I made it?  Why do we have to say, hey, I know its not cool to everyone if we do this, but just for this one instance, I dont care if its cool or not. Why do we have to be concerned with whether or not something is cool with everyone?  And who the hell decided that formal weddings are cool? Was it the same person who decided that white lacy dresses are  the thing to wear ? And why am I not ashamed that I dont want either?  The point is, I was faced with a decision a little while ago. Have a quickly thrown together "wedding" without any input other than "tell me a few days before and I'll be there" from my husband-to-be OR ask him to just run away with me and "elope" to somewhere beautiful that we could have something that resembled a honeymoon.  Although both had their down sides, I knew we couldn't have them both, so I had to choose one of them, and apparently I chose the SO NOT COOL  one. I honestly don't know what happened .. but within three weeks this "elopement" morphed into something more disgusting than I ever could have imagined. Yes, a "formal wedding abroad". Sure. That's what I had in mind. A Wedding so far away that no one I love (including my own parents) could be there with me... and of course, all of his could. So, once again I get to be the alienated pregnant lady hiding in the bathroom  because there's too much smoke at the table.  Yeah. That's the perfect way for us to start our life together.  Why don't we just go to a justice of the peace and then all out to Friday's! That will be NEAT!  And I dont know, maybe I really am getting old, but Im starting not to care about what everyone thinks about it anymore. I thought this was supposed to be about us and ONLY us. And now, I am at the point that I'd rather do NOTHING than something forced and rushed and just thrown together in a hurry. that's what I was trying to avoid in the first place. Then I found myself searching for hotels that had casinos and golf courses and less expensive rooms so that Everyone could afford to go, SO THAT EVERYONE WOULD HAVE FUN, you know.. so I can be left alone in a hotel room. Then I find myself booking and unbooking dates because certain people have other plans. Then I finally get a date that "everyone" is free, and all of the resorts are booked. Ha! After the day I had today, I don't want to have to consider everyone else on the fucking planet ever again. I am not interested in what day person A is available and how muh person B can afford to spend. The way I see it we have approximately 4 and a half months of thinking about ourselves and our fucking relationship.. and we should fucking do that.  We NEED to do that.  What WE WANT is going to run far behind what's best for our baby after that.  Call me selfish and UNCOOL. I don't fucking care. The next few months are not going to be about you. or you. or you. They are going to be about Chris. and I. And if that means we have to wait until we can get something together so that we will  BOTH  be happy, then that's what we're going to do. I refuse to make a sacrafice this time and I refuse for him to sacrafice anything either. And since we want completely different things out of this, the only answer I can think of is that we wait until we can plan something that will make us both happy. He can have his million friends and family around to watch and I can have it be something classy and romantic that involves at least  some  time for us to spend alone. TOGETHER. We are already making enough sacrafices, and that's that. And if anyone doesn't like it.. they can kiss my  UNCOOL  ass, because I really don't give a fuck about anyone besides him anymore.

       i am insane.   i suddenly feel like writing because you are the only person that i have to talk to. (whoever you are) i don't know about what yet, but i'm sure this will lead somewhere. (ok, fine. i'm not sure. it probably won't. but that's never stopped me before..)  there are a lot of things that are upsetting me. i know that i am being stupid and that i should be happy - but, i'm not. i am going crazy. i know it's partially hormonal - but i also know it's partially because i feel like we aren't ready, as a couple, to give this baby a happy home. i am a bit of a martyr, i guess. i always give up a lot in an attempt to make the people around me happy. i hate asking for things in return, but when i don't get the things that i consider to be important - i get very hurt and defensive. it's pathetic and wrong - especially since i never even  ask  for what i want. i simply expect the world to read my mind. hah. and that's what seems to be happening now. i gave up on the big things. i am beyond being upset about chris not setting aside a little time to take a last vacation with me. i am even beyond being crushed by the fact that we won't be able to get married (in a way that i think we deserve) before the baby is born (and probably never after that). so, now i just feel unimportant, unloveable, unstable, and afraid.  the really sad part is that i didn't expect any of this. i love chris more than anything in the world. he is the only person in existance that has ever made me feel alive. he's the only person that i ever want to be with. i want to spend my life with him. i want to make sacrafices for him and more than anything else, i want to make him happy. most of the time i am miserable simply because i feel like i can't even do that anymore. before i was pregnant, i was able to handle so much more than this. i was so much more fun. i could have waited a million years for all of these things and been perfectly happy. and don't get wrong, just having him in my life  does  make me happy - and i know that should be enough. god, i really wish that it was. i wish that i didn't need him so much sometimes. i wish i could look in the mirror and say to myself "it's ok. if i have to, i can do this alone." even more so, i wish that what's going on didn't make me feel like i have to address doing this alone as an option at all. most of all, i wish that i understood why having a baby made me need him to make me feel protected, but suddenly it does. and it hurts.  result: i shrug it off, i lose faith, and i feel like all the "unimportant things" that aren't  progressing  in some way are a part of the worldwide conspiracy to make me feel sad.  at this point, i'd probably settle for some conversation about baby names. maybe some info as to when rick was going to vacate the baby's room so that I can get it carpeted and painted .. and schedule the baby furniture delivery. just a mention of it would do. of course, i'd also like to be able to have the wood floors fixed (they are so worn out that they give me splinters), but like everything else lately - i need help and a "date" to do that too.  of course, i haven't officially asked him about any of these things . i am too afraid of saying things the wrong way and sounding as crazy as i feel.    instead, i think i'll just wait around being miserable and hope that he finds his crystal ball before i give up hope in everything.   god, all i want is for things to be ok again. i want to believe that they will be ok. i want to feel confident and happy in again, because i know that's the only way i'll ever be able to be a good mother and "girlfriend" (just saying that word makes me feel embarassed these days). i know this is all crazy and she won't know the difference for a long time.. but i will. i just feel like she deserves things like a pretty room to come home to and floors that wont hurt her when she starts to crawl. and yes, these things will make me feel better. and no, it's not the same as having a "legitimate family" - or some approval and acceptance from our own families - but it will do because it will make me feel better.  it will make me feel like i'm doing something.   then, maybe i won't have to pretend that something is the way it's supposed to be, because something will be. maybe i want to try to make up for the fact that i feel guilty for bringing this perfect little person into a completely imperfect situation. i don't know. i just want something to be right.. just one little thing.   i guess i just want to feel like i've done something right for this baby - and right now i feel like i've done nothing at all.

      this is so good. you have to read it!   A fragment:  urlLink "But only one person is the appointed bearer. And that poor sap has to carry the burden the entire way, a burden that just gets heavier and heavier as the weeks wear on. The bearer gets increasingly tired and cranky as they approach their destination  and who can blame them? Their good-for-nothing companion doesnt do anything useful, except flit about and say things like jeeze, I wish I could carry the burden for a while! and occasionally fight off an enormous spider and/or fetch chocolate ice cream..."

       know how to piss off a pregnant woman?  eat all of the american cheese. AGAIN. and don't replace it.   this is the 10,000th time this has happened. you know, i am the ONLY person in this house that even bothers going to a grocery store. i don't eat that much stuff. i'm picky. but, i always buy EVERYONE food. cold cuts (i don't eat them), chips, assorted snacks, pasta, juice, milk, butter, toiletries, whatever. the only things i actually eat are american cheese, milk, and oatmeal cookies. this is no secret. YET - every time i am hungry.. there is nothing left that i can eat.   i admit, i am upset about a lot of other things as well - but this is just fucking stupid. how hard is it to remember the words "you kill it, you fill it"? (PRETTY FUCKING HARD, APPARENTLY.) or even leave me a note... so i know to buy more. how about that? (OBVIOUSLY THAT'S ALSO TOO DIFFICULT)  i feel like i'm in a college dorm (for entirely too many reasons) - and i don't like it.   i am very hungry and now i want to cry.    i hope everyone gets SARS today.

       second, third, and fourth thoughts.  yeah so, i was wrong about last night. chris didn't bring home 500 people , which is good. after last weekend... i really needed some rest from parties.  however, he did just take the dogs to the park. it rained the last few days, which means that in about an hour he will return with two huge dogs covered in mud. i guess i shouldn't have bothered cleaning last night. i guess i really shouldn't bother cleaning, ever. it's practically worthless around here. i don't know how i am going to deal with this in the upcoming months. everything inside me is screaming for order and that's one thing we have none of around here. ever. it's killing me.  in other news, the other day chris mentioned going to town hall to file for our marriage license this week. i never thought i'd say this, but i am not so sure that this is a good idea.  urlLink from what i have read  - the license is only good for 30 days... and he is busy practically the entire month. not to mention, we have absolutely no arrangements set. i am sad that so little thought went into this. we could have been flying out to the bahamas this week.. and had a beautiful ceremony and mini honeymoon. you know, some time together before the baby is born. that was so important to me. instead, it seems that he has opted to have a city hall thing.. no ceremony.. no honeymoon.. no nothing. in addition, he even suggested doing this "during the week" (so that it doesn't interfere with his schedule?). call me hormonal, but this does everything BUT make me happy. in fact, i am fighting the hormonal urge to scream at him about it. i am hurt and dissapointed. very dissapointed, in fact.   this, of course, is all my fault. i made it clear to him that i did want to get married before the baby was born. i guess i forgot to mention that i wanted it to be special.. and fun... and i wanted us to have some private time together to celebrate. oh wait, i DID say that. i guess it just didn't matter.   if i had somewhere to go, i'd be there. i don't know how to talk to him sometimes. especially when i am this upset. i don't want to say anything that i'll regret.. and right now that's just what i would do. the sad thing is - i have nowhere to go at all. the only thing i can think of that's more depressing than this - is going home to watch my father die and my mother go crazy.  sometimes i wish that i was anyone but me.

      well, we just got back from dinner with chris's brother and his girlfriend. it was a good time. i don't really know what else to write about. chris mentioned over dinner that he had put some thought into names for the baby -`but as soon as we got home he ran into the basement to practice`- so we didn't discuss it. i am curious to see what he's thinking. i guess i'll find out eventually... until then i'll just keep calling her julia. i think she likes it, hehe.  oh well. time for gilmore girls. wee.

      The baby has actually managed to wind me over the last couple of days by kicking me so hard. I especially like the well-placed kicks to the bladder. Eventually, I'm going to squirt pee when she does that...and then I'll have to make her pay, perhaps by dressing her like a clown for the first couple of years of school...ah ha ha ha... Okay, never mind. I'm just a little silly from lack of sleep.   The mysterious pregnancy insomnia has officially started. It comes and goes, and I have no real control over it. Although, I confess, I sleep much better when i'm on the couch.. maybe I could move out, into some kind of tribal Women's Hut for the remaining 18 1/2 weeks and sleep on their couch. I don't think the dogs and the boy would understand though. Besides, can you imagine the mess I'd have to clean up when I moved back? Oy Vey. I better not leave.  Anyhow, I think I'm getting the blues. Which sucks. Maybe it's just the waiting game of pregnancy, or maybe it's another hormone thing. I constantly feel unwanted, alone, or like I'm being criticized or attacked. Even my dreams have been sort of, well, depressing these last few days. I really wish we could take a vacation. Somewhere warm and exotic. Exotic meaning "Not Here", rather than exotic lady with a funny hat and pomegranates kind of way.  I'm going to climb into bed with Chris now. I miss sleeping near him. He isn't feeling well so he is actually in bed for once. (Although, I'm sure once i get into bed he will get right out and I'll get to have another crying *i feel so unwanted* moment.)   Sigh.  Okay, time to snap out of it...  Maybe I'll try writing again later, when I feel normal.

       this baby is kicking my ass, i miss chris, and i can't sleep. GOD DAMNIT!   its been less than a week since we discovered that were having a baby girl. and to be honest, i had been silently worried in the weeks headed up to the ultrasound. i hadnt felt any "real" movement in my abdomen, except for gas, indigestion and the occasional butterflies. most of the pregnant women i had talked to online said they had felt movement as early as the 15th week. i was starting my 21st week and terrified when the ultrasound technician began our session. what would she find? a festering alien pod? a gigantic lump of fatty deposits? Jimmy Hoffa?  once the session got underway, however, i was immediately relieved to see the baby moving almost violently in the womb, and i soon discovered that every movement the baby had been making was probably being absorbed entirely by the placenta which was sitting on top of her. she did several flips while the technician tried to take her measurements, and every few minutes she would flash her foot at the screen, almost as if to say, have you seen my feet yet? im not sure youve seen my feet. here are my feet! and people, she has the cutest feet in the entire world.  im pretty sure the technician performing the ultrasound permanently altered the position of the placenta because ever since our session ive been able to feel her move. and the sensation doesnt feel all fluttery anymore. no, when my baby girl moves its more of a BUMP and a THUD, as if she is kicking me has hard as her cute little feet can kick to say,  pay attention to me, motherfucker.    (contrary to popular opinion, i'm not going to use such language around my child, at least not intentionally, but i honestly think that the first word this baby utters will be that word or im constipated, just by virtue of being mine.)

      *yawn*  i love sleeping until noon. i haven't done this is ages. well, probably since the last time Chris was on tour, to be exact. hehe.  urlLink The boys  left for Canada last night around 9:30. That's right canadian friends. go check them out. i think they're playing with god forbid or something. go find them and congradulate the cutest daddy-to-be in the world. and buy their merch, haha. i think they'll be in both montreal & toronto on sunday.  anyway, i managed to stay up until 11 or so - hanging out with the ever so drunk Rick last night. it was lovely. he always makes me laugh!  today I think I'll do the grocery shopping, some laundry, and pick up a copy of  urlLink what to expect the first year . I just finished  urlLink what to expect when you're expecting  and I realized that in about a month I will be in my third trimester. whoa. i guess it's time to research things like how to take care of this little being outside of my womb!  that's about all for today. I miss Chris already. He did the sweetest thing before he left and showered me with the most adorable hello kitty gifts a girl could ask for. I even got new hello kitty slippers, which I love. I don't ever want to take them off. As always, he makes me wish that I could fit in his pocket and go with him everywhere (but as he said: if i could, i'd just pee in it anyway).  p.s. Julie. Come over. I miss you.

      Some things i'm noticing:  The fear is starting. Right now, it's not even really fear, it's just, Oh my God, I'm having a baby! My life, Chris's life, will never be the same.  Also, I'll eventually be someone's wife (i think). Lots to do. It's incredibly hard to focus on anything outside of organizing.  But back to the baby. If you look and talk and ask, you get lots of feedback. I'm terrified of breast-feeding, and decided against it, but now am rethinking. Is that crazy? I'm not sure. Everyone I talk to about this is militant...about either doing it or not. I'd like a fresh, on-the-fence opinion. Aren't there any? I have so many concerns, and am afraid I will be SO uncomfortable that it will actually NOT be beneficial to the little one.  Then as I was picking items for our registry, I worried: what if this is the wrong thing? Will it be too heavy for me? (I can't wait for the arm muscles I will inevitably develop come July) Will I cope? Is this item safe? I'm not even sure how to put a baby to sleep. How on earth is possible to wash the little one without hurting  her? Cutting baby fingernails? I can barely cut my own!   But wow, a mommy. This is a one way, no return, no refund trip. It's scary in that...and not at the same time. To have a needy little person around all the time is a bit off-putting, though, especially to someone who values her privacy as I do. And when am I going to write? Can barely write now, with all the work, distractions, and all the doctors' visits and so on.  Still, I'm excited. I know this is right, this is the right thing, but can anyone get over the fear of walking straight off into the abyss of the unknown that is first-time parenthood?   p.s. In response to all of the "what are you going to name her" emails: I don't know! Chris and I haven't really discussed it yet. I am hoping for the name I mentioned months ago (Julia Paige). It's the closest name I could find to Judy (Chris's Aunt) that I love. I figure we can also give her Judy's hebrew name to seal the deal. I also like Juliet and Jordana as first names- But, like I said - we haven't really discussed it yet. l'll keep you all posted as this progresses, i promise.

      Things that i'm feeling thankful for right now:  1. Chris. I love him more than anything in this world. I am thankful that I met him, that I love him, and that I am lucky enough to share my life with him.   2. Cleatus. (or should I say Cleatoris?) This little alien has changed the way that I see practically everything. If my eyes are glass then she is windex. I love this baby more than any of you can imagine. Feeling her flutter makes my heart explode.  3. The Cleaning Lady. I think I love her too. She made the house look amazing today. It even smells pretty. What a lady.

      time sure flies when you're a fattie.  things are OK. i got pretty pissed off last night because the dogs ate my cookies. It's funny how something as stupid as a cookie can upset a pregnant woman. I was so upset that I went to bed early with no snack. needless to say, I woke up pretty hungry and grumpy. I declared that I was leaving at 2:30 as soon as i got into work this morning. I am very glad that I did that since it's 2:15 right now and I feel much better. I think I deserve the break.. and it's pretty out. Maybe I'll sit on the porch for a while and do more white-trash-backyard-bbq-wedding research.  yes, i said wedding. it looks like we might actually be having one. maybe...  anyway.. it's 15 minutes until go time. I am in a good mood for once. horray.

      At 2:34am this morning I scurried blurry eyed into the bathroom for my nightly pee break, the first in what is usually three to four stumbling trips past bulky furniture and through menacing doorways that seem to grab my pinky toes every time I walk by. Ive grown to appreciate these nocturnal pee runs as they are the only time the baby isnt sitting directly on top of my bladder, and I can pee more than a half-thimble at a time.   Id been warned that this would happen, that there would come a time in my pregnancy when I wouldnt be able to empty my bladder in one go. But no one ever told me it would happen this early, or that I wouldnt be able to empty my bladder in 15 goes. At 2:34am this morning I was seized with an almost paralyzing panic, a sickening realization that I am at that point in my pregnancy, just into my third trimester, the point when my body starts to become so unbearable that the lesser of two evils is actually going through labor.  How terrible does life have to be that the actual process of childbirth is a preferable state of being? I honestly thought the The Belly would grow gradually enough that it would feel like a natural extension of my body, and this is perhaps the BIGGEST misconception I had about what it would be like to be pregnant. There is nothing natural about The Belly. It feels like an alien object has been implanted haphazardly into my abdomen, perhaps a basketball inflated with 20 lbs of loose gravel, and its constantly shifting its weight from organ to organ. For the first time in my life Im constantly aware that I have a gall bladder.  Did I mention that this 20 lb basketball has legs and arms and an annoying habit of trying to get my attention EVERY SINGLE NIGHT at 11:30pm by poking her toes into my bladder? It was cute the first time, for the first 15 minutes. But two constant hours of twinkly toes has me concerned that shes got an acute case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or worse yet, that she takes after her father and is trying to rewire some recording equipment that she recently installed in the placenta.  I know that her raging activity will slow down soon, that Ill miss the hourly thumping and nudging and bumping up against my spleen. But right now Im having a hard time concentrating on basic conversations, on simple activities like counting out change at the grocery store, on eking out the tiniest bit of pee after a full 10 minutes of sitting on the toilet with my leg behind my head, when all I want to do is yell out loud to my belly, in as diplomatic and non-threatening a way as possible, IN OUR FAMILY, WE DONT KICK PEOPLE LIKE THAT. And yet, how could I possibly expect her to take me seriously when we actually have thought about kicking people like that..

       Julia Paige Jordana Elizabeth   I am stuck on my original names. NOTHING else looks pretty to me anymore. especially when i am limited with a middle name like rose. here are the names i don't hate as much as everything else i have seen. sadly, none of them make me happy and none of them seem the least bit "right".    Cassidy : gaelic, witty (sadly, i think she'll get teased in hebrew school for this one)   Cecelia : latin - patron saint of music (I really want to like this one - but it's not happening)  Celia : as you like it (same with this. I WANT it to work but it doesn't)  Elizabeth : hebrew, loyal one (I love this, but ONLY as a middle name)  Ella : light (here we go again with the god shit)   Emilia : othello (can't use it - it reminds chris of his X)    Emma : thoughtful (way too popular to use, although very pretty)   Hazel : protected one (I love it but I'm afraid she won't like it someday)  Jadyn : god has heard, hebrew (i love the sound. I love that it's hebrew.i hate the fact that it's "god" related)   Jordana : intelligent, hebrew (my favorite. chris hates it)   Jordyn : intelligent, hebrew (i probably only like this because it's similar to jordana - and i think jordana is much prettier BUT it doesn't make me miserable)   Julia : the two gentlemen of verona (my other favorite. chris hates it)   Katelynn : pure (it sounds pretty but It's too common )  Kelsey : victory (cute, but again - i't doesn't feel right)  Miranda : the temptest (stupid sex in the city ruined this name for me)  Nora : light, honor (i like this but i can't find one middle name that sounds pretty with it)  Paige : helpful (another of my favorites. sadly, there isn't a middle name in existance that it works with. it's meant to BE a middle name, in my opinion)   5) if we don't come up with something soon i am going to become hysterical. i am less and less rational every day. i am uncomfortable. i'm having trouble sleeping. and i NEED to have this done. unfortuantely chris's suggestions have all made me ill. even some of the ones i have listed above as not hating are making me ill. i don't know what we're going to do. seriously.  pregnancy sucks.

      In three days I am going to be a WIFE. Eeeeek! I am starting to get really nervous about this whole thing. I know that this is going to be chaotic as fuck - and I'm OK with that. However, I am worried about getting everything done in time. Last night chris and I went to the liquor store and picked up tons of booze. It was funny. Just imagine this huge pregnant lady (me) carrying about 50 bottles of wine and hard liquor to the register - one by one. I hope no one thought i was planning to drink all of that! haha. That's one thing off the list to do - but there is still sooo much more. Tomorrow morning the cleaning lady (bless her soul) is coming over to clean the house up. Chris has practice tonight, so I will probably go shopping for soda and toilet paper and things of that nature. Tomorrow he is going to have to set up the tent and move the tables and chairs around and go out with me to buy more of all of the above. Friday will be mostly setting up and running around trying to do everything that we forgot about. And then boom: Saturday. I have a feeling this is going to FLY by.  Anyway, In case anyone is curious - Here are my instructions on  how to throw a wedding in 30 days with less than $3,000 . It might come in handy if one of you guys ever gets knocked up someday, haha:  1. Pick a date - free 2. Find a Backyard - free 3. Find & book  urlLink an officiant  - $275. 4. Pick out & pick up  urlLink wedding   urlLink bands  - $255.00 5. Go get a  urlLink marriage license  - $28.00 6. Hire  urlLink a caterer and a waitress  to handle food, cake, plates, utensils, serving, and clean up - $890.00  7. Buy a ton of alcohol, soda, cups, and napkins $600.00 8.Hire a Cleaning Lady so you don't kill yourself getting things ready - $300.00 9. Buy a dress. If you're pregnant like me there isn't much to choose from. I went with a  urlLink pink maternity sundress . I hate it, but it fits. - $88.00 10. get a  urlLink bridal boquet . I don't know why i "needed" one, but friends seem to think that it's important - $76.00 11. Don't waste $ on invitations. Call your friends. It's a backyard BBQ for christs sake! - FREE 12. Make one of your friends be the photographer and pay for supplies. If you're lucky, their  wedding present will be taking the pictures! (Thanks Tom!) $300. 13. Make your father-in-law and brother in law-to-be handle the music. Their CD collections are less likely to frighten the guests - FREE 14. Have the best husband-to-be ever, who loves you enough to put up with all of this insanity. 15. Have a sense of humor about it and don't expect things to be perfect or run smoothly. ;)    Prep Time: 30 Days Total Cost: $2,812.00   That's all folks. I am sure we're forgetting a lot, but who cares. WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!

      hmm. i just realized that i haven't updated in FOREVER. there is a lot going on at girl138 headquarters. so much that i forgot to tell you all about it, hehe.  we have a new addition to the family.  urlLink katrina  came to stay with us a week ago and i love her almost as much as i love chris. she's julie's dog - and is staying with us until julie works out a new home situation for her. she is the coolest dog ever. i want to keep her so badly! if only jinx was a little less loud about having her here... *sniffle*  anyway, i will be a wife in two weeks. yes. you heard me. TWO WEEKS. chris and i applied for our marriage license last week and picked out our wedding bands today. freaky stuff. i must admit, i am pretty excited. not so much about having this makeshift wedding - but definately about being his wife. heh. it's wierd to think of myself as someone's wife.. but i think i can get used to it. i love him so much it's wierd.   so yeah. there is so much to do! i still haven't figured out how we're going to accomodate the 35 people that will be here on the 29th. i still haven't done any major cleaning, ordered more food, picked out something to wear, or figured out if my dad will even be here. it's a lot of pressure. i am trying not to dwell on it.  did i mention that i will be having a baby in about 8 weeks?! hah. yeah. 8 WEEKS. Rick is still living in her bedroom. I still haven't found a painter or officially ordered the carpet. I haven't really bought much either - but i think i'll wait until after the baby shower to start freaking out about all that. I have a feeling that we will be geting a lot of what we need then. that reminds me - i still have to find her a nanny. and A NAME. haha. any ideas?   haha. i think it's time to crawl under the couch and hide from my responsibilities now.

      I've reached a point where, unlike the first six or so months of my pregnancy, I am now consistently cognizant of being pregnant. Up until recently, there were times when I could "forget" I was pregnant for a little while -- by that, I mean that I could get busy with work, something social, or even housework -- but now that has changed.  My body has completely changed in how it feels from the inside and how it looks from the outside. I'm fucking uncomfortable, and I still have the worst to go. My stomach is hard and big, my hips and pelvis feel like they are about to snap or shatter, leaving me with a giant sac of organs and baby balancing on nothing but two femurs, like an overfilled water-balloon on two toothpicks.  I pee all the time. I feel like I have to pee again as I'm washing my hands from the last pee that I took. I can barely turn over in my sleep. I can rarely get up from a reclining position without help. I can't bend over to pick things up, so I'm at the mercy of the people around me to pick things up, including me, or to flip me over every once and a while, like a giant beef paddy, so my hips don't disintegrate.  Then there's the hormones. I'm usually fairly balanced (laugh if you must, but it was once true). I've never been the type to cry at long distance commercials, "awwww" at the sight of Hallmark cards with little kittens on the front, or collect Anne Geddes posters. At this point in my pregnancy, there remains only a shadow of the (relatively) emotionally stable person I once was.  I cry when I can't get up. I cry when I face even the most minor of conflicts. I cry at cheesy after-school special type moments in movies or tv shows. I cry when I can't bend over to pick up my laundry. I cry because my hips and pelvis hurt and there's nothing I can do about it. I cry because I can't fucking turn over in my sleep without an immense amount of pain, and sometimes even then I can't turn over. I cry because I can't catch up with my work because my brain is fucking mushy and I don't know if I'll ever be smart and sharp again. I cry a lot about that one.  Mostly, I cry because there is so fucking much to do and the clincher is, I just can not pick up the slack. I'm physically and/or mentally unable to. This is the most frustrating thing ever. I guess I hide it well too, because it seems like many of the people around me (not all of you) just don't comprehend how useless I am. This is why I cry the most.

      I REALLY wish that Chris and I had eloped. I knew that planning a wedding would be really hard to do in my condition, but I had no idea that it would be THIS hard. It is impossible  not to get upset over the little things. I don't even want to talk to anyone about it any more. I should just give everyone the finger and send out invitations that say: "if you don't like it - don't come". sigh.

( urlLink NORA  is hosting headbangers ball) tomorrow is the baby shower. only four more weeks until i get to meet my little bean. i left work early today. i love my husband.   the bad  the baby's room still hasn't been vacated. after the shower tomorrow there will be nowhere to put her things. the dogs will eat them and i will cry. the painter might not be able to get her room done in time. i can't order the carpet until the room is painted. i can't have her furniture delivered until the room is painted & carpeted. i am very stressed out. work sucks. i'm tired ALL the time.    the ugly  trina pooped upstairs today. three times. it still smells and i just spent the last hour scrubbing and vacuming. the dogs won't stop barking and fighting. now i wish i  hadn't  come home from work early.

      today was a special day. not only did i get my wonderful husband to take me shoe shopping (i NEVER thought that day would come, haha) but - we also had jordana's first doctor appointment. She is doing well. She gained a little weigt and grew a little height wise. She is completely "normal" as far as all of that goes. I never imagined that a child of mine would be called "normal". haha. I won't get to used to that, promise.  Anyway, at the doctors office we discovered that she has a little infection in her cord. it was bleeding red when the doctor pulled on it.. and she started crying. then, the doctor did something to help it heal and I started crying louder than Jordana. Seeing her in pain nearly broke me into a thousand bits. Who knew it was possible to love anything so much.  My heart hurts when she cries.

      I can't believe that it's already been a week. Things are going well. (better than I expected). I LOVE being a mommy. When I look at her I can't help but wish that I was able to be one of those "stay at home moms" forever.. just so I'd never miss one of her gassy smiles or baby farts. Just thinking about being away from her for more than five minutes breaks my heart. I am going to have some tough weeks ahead with this weaning myself back to work thing.. that's for sure.  On another note - Chris has been amazing. He's a natural at this daddy stuff. And it's so funny how much alike the two of them are. I can already see traits of his shining through her. It makes me want to explode.  I feel so fucking lucky. Very tired, but lucky.  (oh.. and as if I don't already have enough to be happy about - yesterday i managed to fit into my pre-pregnancy jeans. life RULES. heheheh!)  xo

      last night i lost my mucous plug. gross? well, you should have seen the "bloody show" this morning then.    Labor Signs...    You pass your mucus plug, the small amount of thickened mucus that blocks the cervical canal leading to the uterus. You might actually see a clump of mucus in the toilet or in your underwear, or you might just notice an increase in mucus discharge. Sometimes the mucus is tinged with a tiny bit of brownish, pink, or red blood when it's expelled. This is called bloody show. If labor hasn't started already at this point, it usually starts within a day or two after you see a clump of mucus or bloody show. However, having sex or a vaginal exam can also disturb the mucus plug and cause you to see some bloody show even when labor isn't about to start.   anyhow, yesterday the baby furniture arrived. it looks adorable. i am having one lucky baby. ;)     ( urlLink more pics )

      yesterday was jordana's one month unbirthday. it's simply amazing how time flies. in all honesty i can't remember what life was like without her. it's just plain wierd.  she has accomplished so much in her one month of life. she got a social security card, learned how to turn over, smile, kick off her blankets, smack her parents (and herself) in the nose, and she has developed an appeciation for music. she loves baby einstein cds. they make her so happy.  she still hardly ever cries. once in a blue moon she lets out a "whaaa" but it always equated to "change my diaper mommy" or "feed me damn it". other than that she's all googlie eyes and silly faces. i melt when i look at her.  she has never used a pacifier or a "bouncy seat" or slept in her crib. although we have all of these things readily on hand she's never needed them. she's entertained by simple things ... like staring at the ceiling, paintings, and sleeping with her parents. she is such a happy baby.  we are so lucky. we really are.  as for me, i think i'm getting the hang of this mommy thing. i can tell you one thing - I LOVE doing it. this week i went into the office a few times in the mornings and then worked from home the rest of the day. every single day i cried hysterically. i hate being away from her regardless of for how long. I would do anything to be able to stay home with her all the time and it kills me that i don't have that option. in that respect, this has been the hardest week of my life. luckily, it's impossible to get too depressed when you have a family as wonderful as mine to come home to.  well, that's all for now. jordana is taking a nap and i have some work to do. chris is leaving for the UK in a few days and jordana and i will be spending that time at my mom's house, so i also have to pack. it's going to suck not having him around. *sniffle*
