       I took the  urlLink Blogging Personality Quiz  at  urlLink About Web logs  and I am...   The Pundit    I like to blog about a specific topic of interest that I am passionate about - be it business, politics, technology, law, education, entertainment, or literature. I blog regularly and I welcome relevant discussions about my topic. I have a constant thirst for knowledge.  Well then.  Looks like I am going to have to have a little more relevent discussions. Yikes.

       urlLink    The story of the blue typewriter...  When I tell my friends that I bought a typewriter, of course the first thing out of their mouths is, Why?  Why would I want a typewriter when I am surrounded by computers all day long.  To be honest, the reason for the typewriter purchase reflects just how big of a nerd I actually am.  Do you remeber years ago when you went to the library, and to check books out they had those cards in the back of the book?  Well, at a store in Highland, I found something called a "Personal Library Kit" ( see http://www.thelibraryshop.org/librarykit.html ).  Included in this personal library kit are those cards and other things you need to make your own library.  Since I have already taken one Saturday and spent several hours creating a database (eg. catloging) my books, this kit looks pretty fun for me, as you might imagine.  Well, then I got to thinking.  How in the world would I put the title and author of the book on the card   without   a typewriter.  Hence, the purchase of a blue typewriter.  I found it on Ebay and got it for $5.  Well, the typwriter was $5 and shipping another $15.  I still think it was a good deal though.  Besides the nerdiness factor, I do find it quite satisfying to use a typewriter.  I make a ton of typo's, but heck, its all part of the mystique of it.

      (Originally published on 5/19/2004)  Some of my kids have taken to callng me "Miss Deb". Its great fun...makes me feel like I am in the South or in Little House on the Praire.   Tonight I had to break up a pseudo fight. Two factions - a two fourth graders versus a 5th and two 7th graders. Doesn't seem like it is much of a contest, eh. I think the fourth graders wouldve given them a run for their money though. These little girls have got enough attitude to get them on Diva's Live.  The fight started with a look. One of the fourth graders said "tell that girl to stop looking at me or she's gonna get her face beat in" I was like, hold up there sweetness. Aint nobody getting their face beat in at the library. In retaliation, the seventh grader goes to the fourth grader (with a sneer) "What grade you in?"  Fighting words. I know.  In the end, I had the fourth graders promising a rumble and the 7th graders wanting to take it outside. Threats of banishment from the HC and a visit from security and the police dampered the fighting spirit a bit, till they took it outside and thought I would be none the wiser. I recruited the efforts of a librarian and together we stepped outside the library and broke up the "rumble". All in all, no punches thrown, just a lot of sneers and not so mean putdowns.  In the end, I got to be "mean", which was actually kind of exciting. When one of the girls said, "she started it", I used my moms phrase, "I don't care who started it, I'm finishing it".  Go Mistress Deb!

      I took a "Color Quiz". Here's my results. YIKES! Check it out at www.colorquiz.com   Your Existing Situation Unwilling to extend herself or exert undue effort (with the possible exception of sexual activity). Feels that further progress requires more from her than she is willing or able to give. Would prefer reasonable comfort and security rather than the rewards of greater ambition.  Your Stress Sources Wants to overcome a feeling of emptiness and to bridge the gap which she feels separates herself from others. Anxious to experience life in all its aspects, to explore all its possibilities, and to live it to the fullest. She therefore resents any restriction or limitation being imposed on her and insists on being free and unhampered.  Your Restrained Characteristics Believes that she is not receiving her share--that she is neither properly understood or adequately appreciated. Feels that she is being compelled to conform, and close relationships leave her without any sense of emotional involvement. Feels that she is receiving less than her share and that there is no one on whom she can rely for sympathy and understanding. Pent-up emotions and a certain egocentricity make her quick to take offense, but she realizes that she has to make the best of things as they are.  Your Desired Objective Needs a change in her circumstances or in her relationships which will permit relief from stress. Seeking a solution which will open up new and better possibilities and allow hopes to be fulfilled.  Your Actual Problem Feels restricted and prevented from progressing; seeking a solution which will remove these limitations.  Your Actual Problem .2 The fear that she may be prevented from achieving the things she wants leads her into a relentless search for satisfaction in the pursuit of illusory or meaningless activities.

      Last week was my first week as&nbsp;a Library Associate at the library.&nbsp; It was a kind of a&nbsp;learn off the seat of your pants week.&nbsp; I was just kind of thrown into it - mostly I worked circulation but I did handle the few reference questions that came by.&nbsp; My library is a small neighborhood branch that mostly serves kids, so there is generally not a lot of reference questions.   Top two reference questions last week:  A woman was renovating her house.&nbsp; She thought it might be a  urlLink bungalow  but she wasn't sure.&nbsp; She wanted the renovations and decorations to be accurate to the style, so we attempted to figure out the style of her house.&nbsp; We found some books at my library and ordered a whole bunch more.&nbsp; I also gave her the name of the architecture expert at the newspaper.&nbsp; Whenever I have been stumped with something - a good place for a special occasion dinner or wear to get a dress made - I email the appropriate person at the newspaper and they are really good about getting back to me.   A student was doing a report on his favorite book.&nbsp; He needed information about the illustrator.&nbsp; We looked in the books she illustrated, but to no luck.&nbsp; We looked at several different databases, still no luck.&nbsp; We googled her - no luck.&nbsp; We looked up the publisher and found out they were local.&nbsp; We called them, but they said that they do not provide information about the authors, other than what is provided in the jacket covers.&nbsp; Finally we looked up the illustrator, and it turns out she lives in Minneapolis.&nbsp; My supervisor actually called her, but I haven't heard if she called back.   Notable mention: Another customer called.&nbsp; She needed the customer service number of Stanley garage door openers.&nbsp; Let me tell you, there are a lot of businesses with the name Stanley.&nbsp; After several searches in the business database, I finally googled Stanley and garage door opener and hoped I found the right number for her.&nbsp; She never called back, so I assume it worked.   Odd Happening of the Week:  4 or 5 US Marshalls come walking in one day.&nbsp; They ask all of us working if we had seen a 6'3, 300 lb black man with corn rows.&nbsp; Apparently he was spotted on the main street a block away and took off running.&nbsp; I am guessing he was a "pretty bad dude" with the presence of US Marshalls.&nbsp; I mean, it wasn't like they were just the regular police.   Tomorrow night my roommate and I are going to see  urlLink Lucinda Williams .&nbsp; This weekend my brother is getting married.&nbsp; The whole famdam will be in attendance.&nbsp; Very exciting stuff.

       Last Friday marked the end of my year of servitude&nbsp;(ie AmeriCorps service).&nbsp; I hope you all know that I did what I could to eradicate poverty in this nation through the promotion of literacy.&nbsp; Go Literacy!&nbsp;&nbsp; All kidding aside, I had a fabulous year and I really loved my work at the library, running the Homework Center and Read With Me programs.&nbsp; I met lots of great kids and worked with some awesome people - my supervisors, library staff, and the other Vista's.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Future plans - I am also lucky enough to only be unemployed for 2 days.&nbsp; Today I start my new job at the library.&nbsp; Rather than being a VISTA, I am now a Library Associate - for the time being at least.&nbsp; I am a "temporary" LAPT, but hopefully I will get hired when they post the job in September.&nbsp; Basically, that means I will be doing anything and everything at the library&nbsp;- checking out books, answering reference questions, helping customers, you name it.&nbsp; Arlington is a great old library, called a Carnegie library, built in the early 1900s.&nbsp; It has huge windows and is all brick and beautimous.  &nbsp;  More Future plans - I am applying for graduate school for, you guessed it, Library Science.&nbsp; I'm gonna be a librarian!&nbsp; I plan to start in January at St. Kate's, which is the only school in the state of Minnesota that has a Masters degree in Library Science.&nbsp; The degree will probably take me a year and half - if all goes according to plan.

      not just a  urlLink mausoleum  anymore.  On Wednesday night, I dragged a willing friend with me to a concert at the Minnesota Zoo Ampitheater.  On the bill -  urlLink Taj Mahal and the Hula Blues Band  with opening act  urlLink Jackie Greene .  To be quite honest, I really had no desire to see this Taj Mahal person - I had never heard of him before.  I had seen Jackie Greene last fall when he opened for Susan Tedeschi at the O'Shag at St. Kate's.  He made a believer out of me.  Who knew I would become an instant fan of a 23 year old blues/roots/country/rock playing soon to be superstar.  I bought both his CD's immedietly and made all my friends listen to them, making them believers too.  Wednesday night.  A perfect Minnesota summers day.  80 or so degrees...some humidity and more than a few mosquitos.  Lucky for us we were sitting next to a smart person with some spray and she let us use some.  Only came out of there with a half dozen or so bites.  Jackie got on stage around 7:30, while there was still another hour and a half of good sunlight.  He blew everyone there away.  I'm not lying.  I think there might have been a handful of us who had ever heard of them before, but this crowd ate him up.  He doesn't banter so well with the crowd, but they were all just astonished that a 23 year old could write and sing this kind of music.  Serious. Check him out.  After his set, my friend and I stretched our legs and scoped the merchandise.  We ended up being two concert weenies and buying the commemorative tour t-shirt.  But hey..its a pretty cool t-shirt.  We even got them signed by the man himself.  When I told him that I saw him in the fall and owned his cd's and told him I came to the concert to see him open, he said "That's awesome".  Now, don't get the wrong idea.  I am definently not a groupie - there were some girls there who would take those honors that night, but I just wanted to let him know that I appreciated his craft.  The roar of the crowd and the wail of a guitar told us the starring act had taken the stage.  We made our way down to our seats again, not prepared experience the...well, the experience that   is   Taj Mahal and the Hula Blues Band.  On stage you have Taj Mahal on an electric guitar, a bass, a slide guitar, a man who played the sax, flute, and a few other weird looking instruments, and, get this, three ukeleles.  They wailed though.  It was unbelievable.  The best concert of my life.  You should have seen it...all these white middle-aged Minnesotan's getting up and dancing - in daylight - like no one was watching.  Wonders never cease...

      Oh, a nickel for every time I heard that at 7 am.  Well, I guess I would have a nickel, but the moral of the story is, if on the first day you have your new phone and the number used to belong to a sanitation removal company, change it.  Don't think it will eventually go away.  Just change it.  June 1st my roommate and I had a new phone number/new apartment.  June 1st we started getting about 30 calls a day about picking up peoples trash.  The calls would start around 6:30 in the morning and last until at least 7 at night.  What I liked the best was when a woman called and asked for my father.  I said, uh, no, he wasn't there.  She laughs and said, Are you sure [little girl].  I told her that I was pretty sure he wasn't there, since he didn't live with me.  She only called back about five times to make sure.  Now, most of these calls it was fairly obvious they had the wrong number.   First scenario.   Me: Hello?   Them: Yeah, hi, you didn't come get my trash today.   Me: Sorry, you have the wrong number.   Them: What? Isn't this ....  Me: Yeah, but they don't have this number anymore.   Them: Do you know what their new number is?   Me: No.  Bye.  Second scenario. Me: Hello? Them: [something in a language I don't speak] Me: Sorry, you have the wrong number. Them: [more of the language I don't speak or understand] Me: YOU HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER.  THEY DON'T HAVE THIS NUMBER ANYMORE. Them: Hang up and call again. Four or five times.  The final straw for us came with the couch question.  A young woman was very distraught that we didn't come pick up her couches.  I gently explained to her [at 7am] that we could not remove her couches and that I did not know who she could get to remove them.  She was upset because her landlord was upset, she explains.  After a lengthy conversation, her trying to convince me to do something, me trying to convince her that I couldn't, she dropped the bomb.  My phone number was on the side of trash cans everywhere around the city.  YIKES!  That afternoon I convinced the phone company that I desperatly needed a new number, I googled it, and it appeared to be a safe choice.    Moral of the story: Never talk to strangers about trash removal.

      These last couple weeks I have had the worst run of bad luck.  First, my car stereo is stolen last week.  Just the face and a connector piece.  Enough that my stereo did me no good and the stolen pieces did the thief no good.  There's a $100 down the tubes.  Two nights ago when I was at work, a rotten child (I'm assuming) came into the staff room - while I was in the adjoining office with the door open - and stole my cell phone.  Argh!  Thankfully I had my old cell phone and even had a sim card all ready to go.  Except now I think my battery might be old because I charged it yesterday and it was already dead today and I didn't really talk on it at all.  The kids at the library have been out of control this week.  I think they are mostly bored with the summer, because they do nothing but cause trouble.  I think today might be the first day that I didn't yell at any kids.  All week long, it has been a constant battle with them.

      Last night I attended my 5 year high school reunion.  It was a tolerably pleasant evening.  I didn't really have any burning desire to see the people that I remembered from high school - for the most part I have kept in touch with the people I considered good friends.  I did have one pleasant surprise of a friend there.  I hadn't spoken with her since graduation.  I think we may have emailed for a bit a year or so after graduation, but we lost touch.  It was great catching up with her.  After a few hours though, I had about as much as I could take and took off.  5 years really didn't change anyone that much - old attitudes die hard.  This last week the esteemed mayor of Saint Paul, Mr. Randy Kelly, endorsed George W. Bush for re-election.  Now, this news wouldn't be so shocking, except that Kelly is a long-time DFL (Democrat to those non Minnesotans) party member.  He is from the East Side of Saint Paul, where a Republican hasn't been elected from that district in god knows how many years.  This endorsement comes as a bit of a shock.  Maybe its something in the water, as our last mayor also switched from DFL to Republican.  Although Kelly has stated that he has no intentions of switching parties, there are rumors that the governor may give him an appointment to a state post, or that he might run for US Senate.  The reason that Kelly gave behind his decision to back Bush is that he saw a bumper sticker that said "I Hate Bush".  He decided the liberals were pushing the politics of hate and his mind was made up from there.  I am thinking that if the mayor of Saint Paul bases his decisions upon bumper sticker politics, the DFL party might be better off without him.  Also in the political arena, this new terror threat bothers me.  Not that I am afraid of a terror threat, but that it seems to be politically motivated.  Normally candidates can expect a boost in the polls following their nominating conventions, but with the announcement of a new "terror" threat, the Dept. of Homeland Security all but nullified the effects of the convention.  The Kerry camp has denied that it thinks the announcement was politically motivated, but honestly, can we really trust what we are being told?   From the 8/8/04 edition of the Saint Paul Pioneer Press "Now, on the subject of the convention, most observers agreed last week brought a newly energized Democratic party, one focused on a common goal. With the party now in the spotlight, many people are wondering... " (Stewart is handed a piece of paper) "Oh. Terror warning. Guess I'll have to stop talking about the Democrats." — Jon Stewart  On a lighter note, a  urlLink recent news item  states that the Dutch are now working to ban toe-licking.  Obviously seeking to protect the Danes pursuit of life, liberty and happiness, a simple solution is to ban toe-licking.  As I know you can all agree with me, when my toes get licked, I really do have a hard time feeling safe.  While the article states that the "would be Casanova" could not be charged with any crime for licking unsuspecting ladies toes, I have to wonder, just how many different body parts can a stranger lick before commiting a crime.

      I have recently heard complaints that I don't update my blog quite enough. People - I have heard your voices through the blackness of night and promise you a new day is coming forth! A new day of blogging. You will no longer live in fear of not hearing about the literate and shameless. I pledge to you on this day, that no longer will I deprive the world....  All right. I give up. I can't do it anymore. To be honest, it wasn't "people". It was only "people" if by "people" you mean my sister. Hey, at least this girl can always count on her sister. So I make this pledge to you, my sister, that I will strive daily to brighten your life with my daily quips, happenings, and strife.  To catch you reading fools up to date since the last post, Lucinda Williams put on a darn good show (although not as good as  urlLink Taj Mahal ).  Hmm...My job is going swimmingly. I am learning lots of new stuff everyday. I am hoping against all hopes that I will get hired as regular staff and come out of the darkness of temporary employment that holds no benefits. I like most of the people I work with, and I have also had the opportunity to work a couple of days down at the  urlLink Central library .  In other news, I turned in my application for  urlLink graduate school . Dum da da dum! All my paperwork is in, barring a recommendation that I dropped of for my professor this week. Hopefully I can bring you tidings, oh yes, of comfort and joy in November.  On the foot front, a pair of shoes that I had purchased from Naturalizer and subsequently had to return after the liner became unglued, are going to be in my possession soon! For those of you who don't know this, I dearly loved this pair of shoes. When I returned them, they ordered me a replacement pair, but they were out of stock. By luck, I was on their website and found them again...For 50% off! Go  urlLink Naturalizer !  Tomorrow I am going to the  urlLink Farmer's Market  with my dad, then he is going to come over and help me hang some pictures. I had purchased two prints from Ikea that complimented my "Chinese Peasant Art" or as Shannon and Bryce call it "Suburbia". Unfortunately, I seem to be very special in the ...art of hanging art....and can't seem to do it. That's what a girls daddy is for though! Tomorrow night I will be attending my 5 year high school reunion. Let the gossiping, commence!
