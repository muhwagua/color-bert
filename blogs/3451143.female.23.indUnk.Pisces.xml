      Which brings up the question-- why the hell am I posting something if I don't have something to say?  I don't know, probably because I'm weird. Or because I really have nothing better to do with my time since I just graduated from college and am currently (and seemingly forever) jobless.  I'm sure that one day soon, I will have much more to say, but until then, I'm off to watch a movie, frost a cake and try to figure out HTML.  Yeah, I know that it's pathetic, but what do you expect from someone who stays glued to the television screen rather than the computer?

      When I say family, I mean those who are not my parents.  I mean my aunt, uncle, cousins, and grandparents.  More specifically I mean my father's side of the family.  The normal family.  And this week the most annoying family on this side of the universe.    Being unemployed and unwilling to move back to the super small town I'm from, I have taken up temporary residence with my grandparents.  Both are very kind, reasonable, generous people and I love them dearly, but damn.  Living with them sucks.  There are many reasons why is sucks, but here are just a few:  instead of getting the room downstairs (away from them and with a separate entrance) I have the one next-door to my grandma and down the hall from my grandpa (his severe snoring has kept them in separate bed for a while), no more fun stuff to eat and lots of veggies, no HBO as if I paid for it they would surely claim it a waste of money, scrutiny of all financial transactions, job hunt and loan consolidation concerns, and the same story repeated one million times.  And out of all the things that irritate me about living with them, it's the last one I hate the most.  Because some of the stories are long.  And the rest are really fucking long.  And half of them have to do with the wunderkinds (i.e. my cousins).  I love my cousins, Elizabeth (5) and Katherine (6).  They're clever, sweet children and they love spending time with me.  What I don't like about them is their father.  My Uncle Jeff.  He's eight years younger than my father and the favorite son (denied by my grandmother, but seems to be the truth).  They love my dad, don't get me wrong, but he was a handful growing up.  "So smart, but so lazy.." as my grandmother would say.  He spent most of his young years in boarding school while my grandfather was in the army and my grandmother tended to Laurel (my dad's sister who died of cancer at 8).  Then Jeff came around.  And Jeff was the most well-behaved, intelligent child on Earth.   And because Jeff is so perfect (he can do anything, don't you know?), his children are the same.  Which makes it impossible to stand to hear anything my grandmother says about them because not only is it sugared with perfection, iced with genius, but it will be repeated twenty more times.  I'll confess that I still am bitter that as a child my grandparents were, on the whole, uninterested in playing with my sister and I, so we were sent to a back room to play with each other while they both pay great attention to my smaller cousins.  My grandma even went with them to Disney World.  The place I didn't go to until taken by my Aunt Sonia (Jeff's wife)  her  mother when I was in fifth grade.  So, lucky me.  I was living with the gparents when they decide to breeze through Atlanta before traveling to Hilton Head and their condo for the weekend.  And if the (well-meaning) flack I was getting from grandparents wasn’t enough, I had to endure three days of it from my uncle and aunt.  Who both told me I should go to GA Tech and major in technical writing when I was searching for colleges in high school.  And since my creative writing degree hasn't gotten me anywhere, I got to listen to them, really my uncle, tell me that I should've gone to Tech.  Now that I'm older, I think my disdain for him is a bit more obvious than it used to be. Truthfully, I used to like him a great deal... but that was before he said I looked pregnant in my Easter dress when I was seven years old. So after the college lecture, he tried to be very nice to me.    I've also realized that my cousin Katherine (not Kate, she insists) is a bit of a bitch.  After my grandmother had her read some story about Ireland and bells ("can you believe she can read that well"), we were entertained by some stories about her.  One about her approaching two women smoking outside at a party and telling them that "smoking is a choice" and that they should stop.  My grandmother thought it was darling.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't that sound a tad bit bitchy?  But perhaps it's just me.  After all, I'm just the spawn of the eldest; I'm no daughter of Jeff the Miraculous.  We'll see. Sooner rather than later, since they come back to town next week.

      My life is sadder now than it was two months ago.  Which I must say is a feat seeing as two months ago all I did was go to school, go to work, go to the movies and occasionally go out with friends.  Now, upon graduating the number of friends still around has greatly decreased, I don't go to as many movies, I obviously don't go to class any more and I spend most of my time with the 9 year-old boys I take care of.  The kids are great, but the longer I know them, the more comfortable they become with me and the more disturbed I become.    Case and point, I was watching two best friends, Nate and Jack one night while their parents went to a fundraiser.  We are playing Monopoly. Jack and I have to constantly remind Nate when to go because he has been hypnotized by the tv.  We're in the middle of the game, reminding Nate, yet again, that it is his turn and he should hurry.   "Nathan," Jack says in his slow, monotone voice, "It's your turn."  "I know, I know," Nathan replies, still staring at the tv screen.  "Then go!"  "I can't help, it I love the tv.  I have to watch it."  "Well, if you love it so much, maybe you should marry it."  This is the phrase that comes spewing from my mouth.  Typical kid-speak.  The boy's giggle and then Nate goes on, "But if I marry the tv, how will I have children?"  "You would have sex with it," Jackson replies nonchalantly.  Now the "to weird to talk about with a babysitter" alarm is going off in my head.  Or maybe this is too weird to talk about with anybody.  "Those would be weird babies."  Laughing.  "They would have tv heads and people bodies."  More laughing.  "But wait," Nate stops to think, "I couldn't have sex with the tv.   Because there's no hole."  I freak out, which just cause them to laugh harder, and then close the subject.  Sure, I knew about sex with I was nine.  My father checked out this cartoon from the video store when I was seven that explained the whole process to me.  Cute little sperm in a top hat and tails dancing with an evening gown-clad egg.  Hell, I remember being in third grade and there being a rumor that a student had sex in our elementary school library.  But I would never, and I mean never, talk about it with anyone who wasn't my age.  Especially my babysitter.  That would be weird.  But apparently not weird for these kids.  Shortly after I began to take care of Nate, he informed me that I had "big ones."  I thought it was a one time thing, said to see the reaction he could get from me.  But then a few weeks ago, Will, one of Nate's friends, informed us that the real meaning of the Outkast verse "I just want you in my caddy" was about having sex in the back of a car.  Nathan then started to ask me about sex in certain movies.  And then, the tv incident, followed by a weird conversation he, Jack and I had, which had originally started out with me talking about how much I liked Super Mario games and digressed into if I would marry and have children with Mario and Luigi if they were real.     All this leading up to the day that I sat on Jake Gyllenhaal's face.    We had planned to have a large water fight since it was summer and there was nothing better to do.  Knowing that I would get soaked, I brought my sweats and a thick t-shirt for maximum coverage.  Best not to take chances since the kids had been acting so weird lately.  To make a long story short, Will said he could see where my bra was and I decided to zip my jacket up and dry.  As I walked down the stairs, covered with puddles of water, I fell and broke my toe.  I'm injured, so we pack everything up, go inside and change.  Nate's mother, who works out of her office at home, advises me to soak my foot in a pot of ice water for the swelling.  I get the kids snacks and they start to play PS2.  I make my way to the back room to watch them, sit down, and soak my foot.  I place the pot down and plop onto the couch.  "I think you sat on that guy's face," Nate says.  "What?!" I'm thinking the worst.  Nate repeats himself.  'You sat on that guy's face."  I'm really confused now.  "What do you mean by that, Nate?'"  Throwing his hands up in the air, he slides behind Jack and Will who are playing Lord of the Rings.  He reaches underneath me and yanks out the GQ I bought with Jake Gyllenhaal on the cover.    "You were sitting on this guy."  Nate hands me the magazine.    I  breathe a sigh of relief.  "Ohhhh."  Thank God I had it wrong.  I open the mag and begin to read.  Nate retreats to his spot, sits down and then looks over at me.  "Why?  What did you think I meant?"

      "When you come back to Tifton, you'll be in for a culture shock."  This is what my father said to me earlier today.  Dodging the visit of his crazy Popeye-like father-in-law (or the grandfather i've only seen five times in my life), he decided to drive to Atlanta. I love my dad and was happy to see him.  In order to spend some quality time together, I invited him to come with me to a free screening of "Napoleon Dynamite" (fabulous, by the way).  As we left the theater be began to talk to me about other free screenings I've gone to.  Knowing that if I am still jobless in a week, I have to go home to Po'dunk, USA, he said the culture shock thing.  No shit, dad.  Truth is, I am absolutely DREADING going back to Tifton.  The thought of it almost makes me fall to the floor, a whiny, sniveling lump.  How fucking depressing.  I'd kill myself if I wasn't so totally paralyzed by the mere whisper of death.  And the truly shitty part is that I can't do anything about it.  When they get back from their trip, my grandparents will practically be tossing me out the door.  I've been doing resume overtime hoping someone, anyone will hire me.  Or even give me a courtesy call to say that they're not interested.  Seriously, who do you have to blow to get a damn job in this town?  Cause I'll do it.  I'll get on my knees right now, mouth wide open if it will help (I want to blow to get a job, not blow for a job... so prostitution is out).   Everybody I know is here.  All my friends, I mean.  I was one of those people who left town after high school graduation and tried to keep in touch with my hometown friends in a very half-assed way.  Those people were ones I knew for years and years (one since I was three, one since I was five and the rest from fifth grade).  I still feel bad for leaving them behind.  I love them all.  And of course, I always am meaning to write, but never quite get to it.  When my mind wanders to them , it never stays there long enough to pick up a pencil or turn on the computer.  Then there's my best friend from back then.  Unlike all the others, I fought to keep her in my life.  I put paper to pen and typed long e-mails every chance I could.  And we still fell out of touch.  Hell, I don't even know if she still exists.  She just disappeared after the summer of my sophomore year.  A beautiful letter, sweet gift and poof.  We knew each other longer than we knew our sisters.  I suppose this is the reason I dread going back to South Georgia.  The hotel vacancy was filled.  This one, we are sisters (from different mothers and fathers).  She knows me the way my grandfather plays blackjack.  So well.  It will suck to that kind of a friend again vanish from my life.  Especially since this one is closer than the others. It worries me that I might be lost in the growing shuffle of her life. Or that she will be lost in my laziness, good intentions never fulfilled.   I'm quite sure that I will lose my other friends (one is already leaving disappearing), like I lost all those other friends from high school.    Of course, if God smiles upon me and decides to bless me with a job, all this worrying will, thankfully, be for nothing.  More likely, in a little more than a week I will disappear. There will be no more independent movie theaters, midnight Krispy Kreme runs, late night overly-dramatic discussions, no anything mildly interesting (interesting is against the city rules).  At least I'll have satellite tv.    Hello HBO, goodbye humanity.

      **Warning: completely random post with no real point. Only the brave and patient should read on.**  I was at Game Stop yesterday (for those of you who think yourself too mature to mess around with video games, it's a store where you can buy and sell used/new games and other accessories) buying an extra controller for my Gamecube.  No PS2 for me, thank you very much.  I love my Mario and Luigi and Link, everything else I can pretty much take or leave.  Anyway, back to the story, I was in this store waiting in line behind a guy trying to sell all of his classic NES games (Super Mario Brothers 1-3, DK, etc.), highly irritated, mind you, because I was in a hurry and he was arguing at great length with the cashier.  It seems that he wasn't getting top dollar amount for his used games and this made him angry.  "They are classics!  This was one of the first Super Mario Brothers on the market, man!  It's worth more than four bucks!"  Of course, the cashier explained he could do nothing about the prices and the man reluctantly took the cash  because he "needed it more than they game," but nor without a long, nostalgic look back towards his newly liberated friends.  This reminded me of a conversation my high school friends Josh and Shep had about videogames and classic literature.  We were in the first few months of tenth grade (if memory serves) and the two of them were sitting in Bio arguing with each other.  This wasn't a new pastime and since our teacher was off at some karate tournament, they were a little bit freer with their conversation than they would have been if he were there. When we finished our work we were permitted to speak softly to those around me.  Josh and Shep sat behind me.  Mario 64 had been released a couple of months earlier and Shep, after beating the game, had loaned to to Josh.  Which was probably a bad idea since Shep had never returned Josh's favorite book, Slaughterhouse 5, which he reminded Shep of every second of every day in the hopes of forcing him to return the book (this never worked, as far as I know, Shep still has the book). Josh had lent the game to one of our other friends, Ronnie, who was notorious for never returning anything.  Shep was pissed, it was his (relatively) new game and Josh didn't ask him if it was okay to lend to Ronnie.  Josh, thinking of his precious hardback, said "It's only a stupid video game.  It's not like it's Vonnegut."  And the flood games opened.  Shep took serious offense with the comment and the two began arguing about if there could be a comparison between videogames and literature.  Most people would side with Josh's argument about how a great piece of writing would always be worth more than a videogame.  How crazy do you have to be to compare Mario with Achilles, a Musketeer, Hawkeye or any other literary hero?  Shep made the point that the only reason a first-edition of Joyce is worth more than the original Atari version of Donkey Kong is because it's been around longer and it's widely acceptable to be a book freak and not that acceptable to be a gaming freak. If reading is your hobby, you're considered to be educating yourself; if you play videogames most people automatically see you as someone who is a little less intelligent as they are.  Shep said that Super Mario Brothers should be worth just as much as Shakespeare since both are equally as imaginative and impressive.  I don't know if I would go that far.  And I don't even like Shakespeare that much.  But you have to wonder if that guy's first edition, classic Legend of Zelda game was worth as much as one of the first copies of Slaughterhouse Five, would it be socially acceptable to be an over-forty X-Box owner?  Or would you still be the lame-o next door who would rather stare at the tv and play Halo than enlighten himself by reading War and Peace?

      My car was broken into shortly before Christmas.  Some jackass broke a small side window thinking that with my car (which needed transmission work, fixed air conditioning, a new taillight, and two new door handles) was a veritable treasure trove of goodies. Primarily they wanted my new cd player, but since they couldn't pry it out of the dashboard and realized there was mostly a lot of shit in my car, they opted to take my hidden cd visor.    Now I thought that I cataloged every CD that was stolen so that I could moan appropriately when anyone mentioned the artist. Kind of Blue, Giant Steps, Jason Mraz, The Beatles, The Love Below, Ben Folds Five, Cake-- the list could go on and on.  About 30 CDs were taken among them was one CD of the Sinatra Reprise collection.  Just one. So I thought.  I understand what I am about to write is going to make me one of maybe twelve people under the age of thirty.  It's also going to make me sound like an ultra-geek, but I do not care.  I love Frank Sinatra.  That's right, love.  And I'm not talking about the movies (well, those too); I'm talking about the music.  To this day Frank Sinatra is one of only a handful of artists that I liked when I was thirteen that I still like today. The Christmas I was sixteen, I received one of the top ten best gifts ever (right up there with the My Little Pony Paradise Estates).  Great gifts are always something you really want, but never have to ask for. Those things that are unexpected.  And the Frank Sinatra Reprise Collection was one of them.  At the time, I only owned one Frank CD (it was hard then to save up enough cash to get anything and CDs were like two weeks of allowance).  My father picked up on how often he heard me listening to it and gave me four more.  I cannot convey how much I loved them.    Yesterday, I began to burn my CDs into iTunes (which has been long overdue) and realized more than just one of the cds were gone.  All of the cds were gone.  I was crushed.  No more "My Shadow and Me".  No more "I'll Only Miss Her When I Think Of Her."  No More "What'll I Do."  That is unless I want to shell about another $100 for a new set. I felt so violated when my car was broken into and rifled through, but it's nothing compared to the crappy feeling when I realized that some of my prize possessions had been taken.   What really kills me is the thought of them (probably) in a dumpster somewhere. I can't imagine a thief appreciating any good music, especially good music from over fifty years ago.

      Oh.  My sister.   That lovely creature that sprung forth from my mother's womb when I was three.  A blessing from God.  At that moment I thought I would never be alone again.  I would always have my sister, after all.  Bullshit.   Ever since I went to college my sister and I have gotten along much better than we had in the past.  We wait at least two days before we start to argue.  Kiddo, as I call her, and I have always been the most reluctant of partners.  My grandparents used to send me to the back room to play with her.  Being older of course everything was always my fault.  "You're older, you know better." I'd like to let the parents of the world in on a little secret, the younger siblings don't listen to the older siblings.  They could give a rat's ass what you say to them because they will always do what they want. And by always blaming the eldest you free them from the responsibility of their actions. Hell, I can remember times my sister did something just to get me in trouble.  And ever since she went to college, she disappears from my life for a good two/three months at a time.  You must be thinking that this is partially my fault.  After all, I could call her. I could e-mail her. Well, I do. Think of the person who you can never get in touch with.  The elusive fish you can never catch (that, by the way, was meant to be cheesy). Now, multiply that times seven.  That's how hard it is to get in touch with my sister.  And not just for me, but for every member of my family.  The other members are just more diligent in their efforts.  I give up after three, four tries.   I learned long ago not to expect a great deal from my sister (that way when she's fabulous,and she can be, it's a pleasant surprise and when she forgets you're visiting, leaves her apartment, locks the door and leaves you outside in the 100+ heat in your un-air-conditioned car you're pissed, but not surprised).  And so, the past year we have seen each other a handful of times (even though we live in the same state about 4 hours from home or each other). Christmas Day, Spring Break, and that's about it.  She's missed both my birthday party and my college graduation. I'm a little sore about the graduation thing, but the birthday party thing I understand. Although it would have been nice to receive a gift or a card or a call or an e-mail, but whatever.  I know by now, she'll contact me when she wants to (or needs something).  Now to understand why I'm angry with her now, you have to understand that my sister, while a decent person overall, treats the family like shit.  If you're her friend then congrats! You'll love her, she'll love you, you'll never feel like you've had a better one. but if you're her flesh and blood - look out!  Why should she care about how se treats you?  You're her family, you have to love her.  You have to like her.  You have to put up with her.  I cannot tell you how many times I tell my friends horror stories.  Inevitably, they meet her, she's sweet, they don't believe me, then she'll reveal her mean side, and they believe me.  I'm not talking about that normal sibling swiping of CDs and DVDs, I'm talking about throwing your math book at your sister when she is trying to help you with your homework (even though she was forced to do it by her mother).  That is my sister.  And so, I got a call about a week ago from my sister. She asks all the polite questions, not processing the answers. I ask her how she's doing.  She goes on and on about her summer quarter classes and new roommates and boyfriend, etc., etc.  And then we get to the reason she's calling me.  Her birthday's coming up at the end of the month.  Hint, hint.  I tell her I don't have the funds to get her a present.  She is disappointed.  I say that I didn't think she'd mind since she failed to not only send me present, but failed to acknowledge the day of my birth. She gets angry. She got me a present, but just hasn't sent it.  She couldn't find it to give it to mom so she could send it. Ah yes, after all, March 1st was just a couple of weeks ago.  Here's something else you should know about my sister, she'll lie forever.  Even when you know she's lying, even when you've caught her in the lie, she still insists she's telling the truth.  She will not give in. She will not admit it's a lie. I tell Kiddo that there's no need to lie, it's fine she didn't send me a present, but not only can I not  afford to give her one, I shouldn't have to. She yells at me, tells me she has a present for me, I should send one to her and then hangs up the phone. I tried to call her back, but of course, she has disappeared.    I guess I'll wait until she feels like it’s time to contact me.  She'll call back, apologize, talk to me, and then slam the phone the down.

      Strap yourself in, here comes the weirdness and the self-pity party.  There are certain times in my life where I find chrome domes attractive (but NOT the comb over guys - I'm particular with my shiny-heads).  Those are the times that I am really... really...  Let's put it this way--  We're the at the point where I can wear iron undies and a matching demi bra.  I haven't had sex in forever.  It's been a long, long time. It could only be worse-- if all the men were wiped off the face of the earth. Then I'd never get any.  And right now, George Costanza has never looked better.    Yes, that's right. George Costanza. No, not Jason Alexander. The actual character from Seinfeld. I know that makes me completely insane. You can't see it.  Who could?  It's my theory that everyone has someone they're attracted to that no one can see the attraction in (or none of their friends can see the attraction in - I'm sure somewhere someone loves George all the time). I have a friend that used to lust for Chris Walken. To me, that's a lot weirder than George.  But that's all besides the point.  It's not just George.  I also get  serious jones for Stanley Tucci and  Elliott on "Just Shoot Me" (truthfully, it doesn't take a dry spell to make me attracted to these to; it just amplifies it).  Honestly, at the second, I've got it worse for the Elliott guy than I have for any of my other lust targets.  But wait, now that I'm watching the Late Late Show, Vince Vaughn is looking pretty good.  God, have pity on me.  Give me a man or give me job.

      I don't like clichés much.  Sometimes I use them, out of habit or when it is the only thing I can think to mutter.  Like "wherever you go, there you are." I hate that one.   "You can never go home again."  I always hated that one, too.    Until Monday. Now I fully understand it's meaning.  As I am home, my dear three readers.  And it's strange here.  Not strange like the weird kid in your science class or the mold growing in an old tupperware container.  It's like I'm looking at life through binoculars.  Since I have come home, I've been out of the neighborhood twice.  Talked to three people, in person who weren't my parents.  And drove my car once.  And that was just to get a breakfast biscuit.  I have no need or desire to do anything but fill out resumes and fax them to Atlanta businesses.    Every time my parents try to push me to finding a temporary job here, I have to push back twice as hard with a no or the patented "I'll do it later."  That last one's particularly hard.  Because, being my parents, they know there never will be a later.  I spend most of my time watching satellite tv - mostly HBO, The-N and As the World Turns (which is being to lose its excitement).  And when I'm not doing that or fixing dinner, I am up in my room mindlessly surfing the internet for nothing.  Actually, today I start watching www.apple.com and the iTunes download numbers so I can try to get one of those 50 free iPods they're giving away.  Of course, I can't blame all of it on Tifton's lack of things to do.  Because even if there were things to do (which there aren't), I probably wouldn't go do them.  I fact, I am entirely comfortable with the day-to-day boredom I have sitting in the house.    I lack the drive to write new things and edit old pieces - something I usually l love to do.  It took me almost a whole week to write a new post.  And the only excuse I have is that I have full-on little town blues.  My house is no longer the home I once knew.  And my "visit" here is more like a prison sentence than a vacation.   During high school I would never have foreseen this version of my future.  I am most definitely not typing some piece of hard-hitting journalism or signing copies of my children's book.  Now I would be content just to sell a children's book.  Of course in Atlanta, as there are no book stores in Tifton and the nearest one is an hour away.  I can only pray that someone will hire me.  Look at my resume, call my references for fucksake.     How I wish I would have gotten that job.

      Is it just me or is tv getting stupider?  And no, I don't think that all tv is stupid.  I think that people who believe that television is some how to blame for all the problems in our culture are stupid.  Let's not blame everything on entertainment.    That being said, I think that the reason I can never find anything decent on the tele is mostly because of reality tv.  "Outback Jack," "Extreme Makeover," "Big Brother," "The Simple Life"?  Uck.  I'm even getting tired of the redecorating shows that I used to love.  I cannot take "Trading Spaces" any more.  I just want the before and after shots.  Spare me Paige.  Of course, my disdain for these shows only deepens since my father, for some reason, as taken an interest in a good many of them.  And with only two tvs connected to the satellite, my mother watches all the CBS dramatic programming on one and my father views all of his stuff on the other.  Thankfully, I spared from all the stupid rich girl, marrying a midget, dad dating since we can't get Fox or NBC (that is, for the time being).  And from all the dating/marrying shows since my father has no interest about hearing women and men talk about their soulmates.  Unfortunately, it does include the following: idiots in a house, idiots cooking, idiots fixing hair, idiots in a race.    And what is with the series sequels?  I like "Law & Order" as much as the next girl, but come on!  Do we really need Criminal Intent, the new trial thing and Special Victims Unit (and this comes from a serious fan of "Homicide" and crossover character Munch).  And now there's going to be three CSIs!  And  I'll admit to watching them from time to time, but only because they're on not because I have some deep desire to see them.  Then you've got all the rip-off shows.  Well, they might not be completely be rip-offs, but they pop up shortly after similar shows become successful.  And they're names all sound like each other.  Like with "The OC."  Now there's "Summerland" and "North Beach."  Or, as mentioned before, the millions of shows that have come from "Trading Spaces"  (which was itself a rip-off of "Changing Rooms").  Maybe the reason I can't watch the show any more is because all I see is the crap that's on tv because of it. I am super-crafty and love making cool stuff, but enough already! Can no one come up with original ideas any more?  So many dramatic and comedic shows are either inspired by or spring from other shows on tv.  I'm totally cool with spin-offs.  Sometimes from spin-offs come great tv.  I'm more talking about when "The Sopranos" became successful on HBO how NBC just had to do their own mob story.    Or shows taken from British television.  Unlike other countries, America can't just bring in successful, inventive programming from other countries.  Oh no, we have to make our version.  Our attempt at bettering it for the States.  Why do we have to make our own version of "Coupling" or "The Office"?  Can't we just leave well enough alone?    And while I understand that some of the shows I watch are probably equally repulsive to some people (though, I can't understand why anyone could hate "Scrubs" or "Arrested Development" if they've ever watched it)-- how can anyone not find "The Swan" vomitious?  And I'm still angry about the sting left behind when networks cancel viewer-supported shows with decent ratings because they think that they can bring in cheaper shows that might make them more money on.  Or when networks more around the time of a show you like to watch so much that it makes you think that they don't want you to see it; they just want to take it off the air.  ABC (the Absolute Bastard Company as I like to call them) is the worst offender.  They canceled some truly fabulous shows- "Sports Night." "Gideon's Crossing," and "My So-Called Life."  But they could still afford to keep crap like "Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place on.  If they could keep that on for years than they could have kept "Clerks: the Animated Series" on for six weeks.  Fox and NBC have also canceled some of my favorites, especially recently.  Let's see there was "Ned and Stacy," "Freaks and Geeks," "Undeclared," " Cracking Up," "Deadline," and (I know my friend would kill me for not mentioning) "Miss Match."  All these gone to make room for the likes of "The Simple Life,"  "Average Joe," "For Love or Money," and more news magazine shows.  And don't get me started on the cliffhangers that will always be unresolved.  Would Angela have ever given Brian a chance?  Would Dana and Casey ever get together?  And, worst of all, would Betty have chosen Scott or Victor (in case you're wondering this is from AMC's "Remember WENN"- never to be out on DVD)?  Couldn't they afford one more episode for clarification purposes? A this-is-what-would-have-happened-if-we-weren't-jackasses-and-canceled-the-show episode?  I'm sure that I am coming off as a television snob.  But I'm not. I'll give anything with a brain (and some with only part of a brain) with a try.  I'm not too good to admit that I'm glued to "The OC," addicted to "As the World Turns," and can't get enough of "Degrassi: the Next Generation" (and the original Degrassi, too, if the reruns ever air).   And I hate to be one of those people who say they only watch HBO... But like it or not that's the way I'm beginning to feel.  This summer the only shows I'm looking forward to, with the exception of "Monk" and the aforementioned "Degrassi," are on HBO.  I can't wait until I get to see "Entourage" and new episodes of "Da Ali G Show" and "The Wire" (which technically doesn't start until September).  And that's about it.  And I get the feeling from all the "coming this fall" hoopla, that next year is not going to be much better.  Can someone please deliver me some intelligent shows?  Or at least some where I don't feel like I am seriously lowering my IQ or seeing the same thing over and over again by watching them?

      My little sister will be leaving early this morning to travel from Savannah to Pennsylvania so she can meet her boyfriend's family.   Which is unbelievable.  For two reasons:  First of all, she has been dating this guy for less than three months.  And two of those months he hasn't been in Savannah.  Not that I am a expert on relationships, but isn't this the kind of thing you do before you move in with someone or get engaged or have a baby?  In other words, it seems a little quick.  Really quick when you factor in the $200+ her supposed "completely broke" ass had to shell out for the plane ticket. When you need to borrow some cash to help pay your water bill, you should not be spending large wads of cash on the unnecessary.  She has always been a dating machine, but never the kind of girl I would except someone would fly in to meet momma.  That being said...  The other has absolutely nothing to do with my sister and everything to do with me.  Never more than right now do I feel like Joan Cusack in "Sixteen Candles" (or was it "Pretty in Pink"?)-- feeling completely unattractive just wanting a little water from the fountain without having any luck.  My best friend is (and rightfully so) currently involved in her own male dating saga.  I being currently (and seemingly perpetually) single have no significant other to gossip with her about.  All our talks tend to be extremely one-sided because I juts don't have anything I can add.  I suppose when she is done talking about her boyfriend I can discuss the upcoming movies of Jake Gyllenhaal, but it's not really the same thing, is it?  In my memory the last time I was formally introduced to a guy's parents, I was in ninth grade (I should say his father since I knew both him and his mother since kindergarten).  And that shouldn't really count since he turned out to be gay, so who knows what the dear was thinking as he introduced us.  I could have been his alibi (sure, you laugh now, but I'm from a very small Southern town and his parents weren't that open-minded).  So, not counting that guy, the last time I was introduced to a male-person's parents was...  I'm not going to lie.  I can't remember.  Even my mother revealed to my sister (before my sister got angry and hung-up the phone because my mother didn't remember to tell her to bring a gift to the parents) that she never thought Hallie would meet someone's parents before I met someone's parents.  But there's still time for me.  Rub it in mom, rub it in.  I do wish my sister luck.  I hope she is pleasant, thoughtful, and thankful.  I hope she's everything to his family that she's (usually) not to us.

      When life gets depressing I've always found comfort in movies.  People have never been able to console me that well.  Who knows why.  Maybe because through their back pats and hugs I am reminded of whatever I would rather forget.  So, I often turn to the familiar faces in my favorite movies.    For problems with love usually the Jon Favreau movie "Love and Sex" or "Broadcast News" (which I also turn to for job woes).  For all other problems including those involving friendship, disappointment and general down in the dumps I mostly put on Stanley Tucci's films (pretty much just "The Impostors" and "Big Night"), "Singin' in the Rain," "Guys and Dolls" and "The Good Girl."   And if I'm seriously wallowing in self-pity I watch "Donnie Darko"-- which, believe it or not always makes me feel better (I remember that at least I'm not seeing at psychotic bunny).     Lately, my film companions haven't been helping with frustration.  I sit down to watch one and find I would rather be plucking my eyebrows (maybe not that, but you get the point, I'm bored from the beginning).  To ease my worries I have been obsessively (or more obsessively than usual) watching my old taped episodes of "Homicide".     My friends reading this are now rolling their eyes.  I'm quite sure that they thought that I was already watching the show every spare moment in my life.  But they're wrong. Before the past two weeks, I've been on a H:LOTS hiatus for probably about two or three months.  I'd watch the occasional episode every now and then (more than likely "A Model Citizen" from Season Two or "Night of the Dead Living" from Season One), but I haven't broke out the tapes since they started coming out with the box sets-- so, it's been almost a year.   Now I find myself compulsively watching the things.  Even now, James Earl Jones is talking to Yaphet Koto and fixing a basketball net in the background (I could tell you about the rest of the episode almost verbatim, but I wouldn't want to spoil anything?).    Who knew that murders, suicides, morgues, interrogations, bad ties and Richard Belzer could make a person so happy?    And even though I have absolutely no money for it, I still shelled about $66.48 for the Season Four Box Set.  Mike Kellerman will arrive tomorrow-- just in time to help me cope with another job rejection.    But enough about me, what do you watch when you've had a shitty day (or month)?
