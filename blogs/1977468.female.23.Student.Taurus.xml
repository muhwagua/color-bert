       Melatonin is the key to a successful and happy life.   That was a lie. A lie I may regret for the rest of my life... I'm sorry, and I admit it. One thing it does well however is help your sleeping habits, if they are out of wack. If they are in wack, I imagine it would put them out of wack. Drugs can do that if youir not careful. I have to wake up at 6:30 on mondays and wedsdays this quarter for my Ti-Chi class... I find this interesting, since the only reason I signed up for the class was to exercise with Eric. I called Eric today after the class and asked him why he didn't show up... apparently he's not going to school this quarter, he decided that 3 weeks ago. Did he tell me this? No. Frankly, Eric, I don't know where this relationship is going.   Nevertheless I thank the Melantonin for correcting my "awake after 1pm" syndrom.  Music remains the cement between my sanity and reality.   Listening to: Loudermilk; Rock n Roll and the Teenage Desperation

      Beach. Trip. Beach trip. To the beach. Get the general idea? Excellent. We arrived at the beachhouse with heroic flair abiding, our long hair and barbarian claymores signaling the begining of a new era -   Spring Break 03': Escapade of the Still-life and it's cr3w...  And an Escapade it most surely was, for as our foreign eyes met the ghetto-town of Seaside it was clear that rockedge was in serious scarcity... Rockedge needed to be done, though not with Axe's and Amp's, but a rocking of sheer suave-ness and cruise'n power.  And rock we did. We unsettled the poor unsuspecting populas with such a thundering ripple of public disturbence, none such thing had been seen in ages. Through the windows of a Plymoth Voyager LE, a small town was changed. Temporarily at least... until I turned off the bluegrass music to keep Eric from screaming.  Other developments found their mark as well, as we discovered that "Conan the Barbarian" is in actuallity a C rated porno flick that failed. To quote Jeremy formally of the band known as Still-life, "All I wanted was a comedy." We did many other things however... things so crazy and remote that to mention the mere occurence of them would be in dishonor of the event, for explaination would not do justice enough to appease the spirit of those occasions.  When we exhausted all other forms of rocking, which included walking on the beach from 12:10AM to 3:00 AM, we resorted to classical rocking... STILL-LIFE STYLE. Joe's new song shall be ready for the FCOG show next month.  chills and thrills to the peeps on the block. that was a shoutout.

      A poem I just wrote.  it hurts to be warm cause everything bleeds bathing in an orange light over the street I found myself lonely beneath me and wandering switching polarity  and your signals mean nothing on this side of heaven to sleep is relief we are just who we are what more are we? slow and pulsing monotony graying always in decay yet beauty survives but seldom stays for me when the mold forms I suffocate hesitate then change and breathe  stay tuned for further developments. Soon I'll have a few linked pages to this one with pictures and songs and stuff. It'll be cool. Notice the banner is gone? Yeess.... that costed me money! Love it, please.  Last night I dreamed I was a Barbarian Hero. There was a fortress built on a coastline somewhere, and I defeated the army that lived there. How you ask? I lured them  outside . Thats right! That could be a deep thought if given enough leeway. The army and I had a round 2 though as well, because later on they kidnapped my fricken wife and were planning on having her marry the king of the fortress. "NO WAY" you say. Yes way. This time though I just walked along the wall where they couldn't see me to the back of the fort and saw her through one of the windows... so I busted through the window and she jumped into my arms. Then we evaded them as they persued us by swimming up a sandy bottemed stream into the highlands. Then we made sweet love in the bushes. It was an awesome dream. Eventaully all rationale fleeted though, because we heard a jeep coming, and as it turned out we had somehow stumbled upon a WW2 battlefeild. I'm not sure how, but I ended up having a fist fight over the cockpit of an old-style bomber while my wife remained on the ground hiding near a waterfall from an artillery scout. The bomber ended up crashing and my dream said "game over", and suddenly I was looking at the main menu for a video game. Then I heard Joe say "you suck at this" and he started reconfiguring my keys.   I want more dreams like this, so im gunna go!  PS. Whoever you are, drink more water. You shall thank me with your thoughts.

      The beach this weekend was fun. Make note of this however: Longbeach is a social wasteland. No happening nightlife to speakof, but the cops have a good time pulling people over. Jeremy, Brandon, Monica, and Russel and I walked on the beach from 2am to 420am. Those kind of beach walks are the best. We started talking about theology, and it occured to me how deprived my friends were of Christian fellowship when I myself have the fortune of such discussions multiple times a week. I didn't know what to think about it besides that I'm blessed.   I had more vocal lessons today and SWEET VANILLA SUGAR its SO FRICKEN AWESOME. I learned today the I have 2.75 octaves currently when most people only have 1 when they start. to that I say  WWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOO  !!!!!!!!!!!! Something clicked today, Danielle said told me its a whole lot easier to sing well the louder you get and booya! I found I have some very nice pitches. Well, I actaully can't tell the difference but thats what she said. In a few short weeks I'll have 3 octaves... and from there, who knows? I'm excited!   I think I may buy the BlogSpot Plus so I can post the pictures im taking with my new camera and some songs and such. It'd be cool. I also want a links.   Few: the unused refrain  the fields will seep with misery and weep my heart's virginity the horizen blurs beyond what is  as it flows into eternity  one can only love what he can perceive and thus I see nothing apart from me my eyes have turned inside to face my mind, my brain, my fallacy  few

      Do you people ever get in that akward mood where you don't feel like you fit together as well as you could as a person? Maybe some of the pieces are too sharp, and others too rounded. The colors only match each other under a cetain lighting, and while you come together to form something very interesting its not always pleasing to all six senses. Thats how I feel right now. Thats also how I feel when I don't get enough sleep, which is funny... because I'm tired right now.   Time to hit the reset switch.

      SPOON IS COMING SOON.  I received a personal communique this morning reguarding their new tour. Actually, it's a news letter... but it felt personal. It read this:  "For all of you way out west, we're in the early stages of assembling a summer tour that'll be heading your way... probably in July so stay tuned. with love in our hearts and ringing in our ears,  your friends at Spoon HQ (northern regional office)"

      Me and Eric tested out my camera tonight... I hope the shots turn out well. The film is for "Daylight / Indoors" and we were taking shots of night-time outside. Kinda a bad combo I think. Overall I had an interesting week, mostly an optimistic one. I think my mood in general is improving over time. In general.  Listen to Elvis Costello.  your voice is the colour of your breath this is the blue of nothing lost, and noone gained sweet dream dream softly each breath narrowing in depth each thought spiraling to its death

      Today was my birthday, and people REMEMBERED. Maybe cause I posted it on this journal, or maybe because they love me. I'm choosing the second one. I got some sweet clothes for my birthday, as well as a a truely special Camera, which means I now have a new hobby. Whereever I go the camera shall follow. It's a really nice one too.   We had a buncha peeps over for Easter, so finally all the "clean up the house!!!" stress has left. I got to talk with a whole frick load of people which was really awe-some. I also had my first vocal lesson tonight, and I can already tell the difference in my singing. This was a good idea. Before too long every woman will swoon at a single twitch of my golden lips. Right now they are about bronze... I'm nearing silver lips, but making steady progress twards gold.

      My shirt fits very well. I noticed it has a hole from an ash though, which disturbs me... I haven't tried on that sweater thing yet. It's like the Atom Bomb of fashion, use it once... maybe not at all if possible, knowing you have it makes you feel like a villian. It's that ugly...  try downloading Wilco, "I'm the man who loves you". It's the only song of their's I found that has serious vibe... oh and go here:  http://www.standard-candle.com/jpurvis/    this is the guy that showed me how much a photo can say. I asked for some kind've a camera for my birthday, I want to start a project. It would basically be me driving around finding weird looking places, with weird lighting, and weird feeling and capturing them... INside the camera...  music is coming a little easier this week, I noticed the stuff I was making up was really really fast and energetic... which means I'm in a GOOOODDD M00D. I think it's gunna last for awhile, I gots a feeling. Also getting itchy for lyrical writing. I'm gunna try that... I turn 18 on sunday. I might have a party next month sometime, I didn't want to plan a party that would conflict with Tia's, but Tia keeps switching the weekend of her's, so I just decided to wait. What does turning 18 mean? I can vote... I no longer am protected by minor laws... I can SIGN for MYSELF... I can be drafted... umm. Is that it?

      I went to Value Village today, I bought a severly ugly sweater-vest and a 70ies shirt which is now back in style! Eric and Joe B wanted to go to buy Joe a cool suit for prom. He already owns a Tux, but he wants to spice prom up. His date (Brandy) is cool with it.   Over the weekend I went to the beach with Brandon and Joe A, we got Brandon's retainer. Had fun talking and stuff... I'm trying to stay on this upswing, but im hitting walls here and there. I'm having to deal with the things I've been avoiding, the things that gave me problems in the first place.  Here's another song by that band. It's beautiful in form, soulful in meaning.  Crooked Fingers: Under Sad Stars  Set me on fire white liquor girl Come burning down my throat pristine and pure We have been slaving all day long Among these neon lit half slums Toasting our false hurray The late night favors drinking itself numb  Come out tonight white liquor girl One million stars can't heat such a cold cold world One million distant vacant lights All glaring down on you tonight Lighting a distant vacant sky One million distant vacant lies  Under sad stars in dingy bars We turn away we tear apart One drop of grace distant and safe They cannot touch you where you are Cold shafts of rain falling dark gray Falling so far they can't be saved They cannot hurt you anymore Here underneath these sad sad stars  So turn out the light white liquor girl One shot could set you free from your troubled coil You have been burning bright in vain Here underneath the sad sad rain Painting the town as black as sin Begging to get done wrong again  Under sad stars in dingy bars We turn away we tear apart One drop of grace distant and safe They cannot touch you where you are Cold shafts of rain falling dark gray Falling so far they can't be saved They cannot hurt you anymore Here underneath these sad sad stars  Under sad stars in dingy bars We turn away we tear apart One drop of grace distant and safe They cannot touch you where you are Cold shafts of rain falling dark gray Falling so far they can't be saved They cannot hurt you anymore Here underneath these sad sad stars  Copyright © 2000 Red Pig Publishing

      The show turned out just fine. We played moderately well, still waiting for "the perfect set" to happen, but in the meantime the audience doesn't know the difference. Hahah! Oh well. My tuner went jacky for a song, the battery was dead and it umm.. tuned my whole guitar a step sharp. Kinda make for an interesting sound. Like, suck.   My cold didn't affect my vocals much at all, suprisingly enough. Same problem with the vocals, none through the moniter. The girl who organized it (Danielle) offered me voice lessons, but ONLY because I mentioned I wanted them badly, not because she was incinuating that I sucked... wait... oh crap.   Stay tuned for further annoucements.

      In the morrow I have a show. It should be cool, but risky. We'll see how it goes. My voice is still recovering from my cold, now I have a head infection. The acoustics in the building kinda suck... alot... and my ears are ringing more then normal. We'll see how it goes.  I stumbled upon this band, and this song which I am truely loving.   Crooked Fingers: A Little Bleeding  You say you came to save the day But now it's evening And all your victims have gone home  You claimed to take nothing away But you kept stealing These things you could never own  Last night I drove to go nowhere at all And came to the saddest thing I ever saw A pretty girl all strapped up in an ugly car Driving through a shady crowd of criminals  Truth comes in waves leaving no trace Or any meaning To all the bad things we've done  True hate won't wait and love comes too late Into this evening Into this night so dark and cold  Last night I drove to go nowhere at all And came to the saddest thing I ever saw Another pretty girl inside an ugly car Driving through a shady crowd of criminals  A little bleeding A sinking feeling The victim I would never know  Copyright © 2000 Red Pig Publishing

      So im not grounded, which is a stress somehow avoided.   Prom is getting shakey. I won't delve too deeply into the details, because I don't know them. All I know is that Jen's uncertain now about going, which basically means she's not looking forward to going with me even if she does say yes again. I still don't understand the signifigance of it all... why it seems to weigh so heavily. Whatever the case, it's gunna be awesome, because I decided that. I was talking to Tanny about prom, and she offered that if worse comes to worse she'd take pity on my situation and escort me. If that sounds pathetic, its not.   The only thing that would suck about going stag  (im so used to it) would be riding alone in the Jag. I imagine if that happened I could put Tokyo in the front seat and fasten the seatbelt. Tokyo is the name of my beautiful guitar. I just wrote her a love song. It's called "Me and the Tokyo". When my band gets it's website up I'll host the song there, cause I've been recording it.  I think for the first time in a while my emotional scene is getting back in check. For about a year and a half I was so knotted up inside I lost my attraction to women altogether. Last week though, I saw a girl, and I thought she was really hot. Thats a big step for me. It's one thing to know when someones hot, but to FEEL the hottness is another thing altogether. I felt the hottness.  I saw part of the "gang" at Clark today. We rapped. That means talk, not like actaully rapping. That would be dumb.  Sleep time, bye byes.

       I've been obsessing over this song I'm working on... it started with a few slightly catchy chord progressions, but now it's morphed into some kind've Asian Trance song because of my sister's keyboard. I started messing around with it and layering things and now I wouldn't've recognized a few days ago.

      Yeah, so im gunna be grounded when my parents get back from Palm Springs. Woop-de-fricken-do. I'm still not quite sure how all of this works... I've never done anything stupid. I don't smoke pot, I don't go sexing up, I don't go partying, I don't break the law, I don't understand why all of the sudden I have a curfew and it matters so much. The only thing I've done wrong is to 20% of the time not follow a rule which doesn't seem justified to exist in the first place. So they are going to ground me and I'm going to shrug and life will keep happening and I will still be wondering why. I was under the impression I was more responsible for myself then they were for me... it seems like its been that way for a very long time. MY actions spawn MY consequences, whats the point of interjecting artificial consequences which have no meaning connected to what I did "wrong"? If the whole point is to protect me, then the alleged "consequences" will actaully happen and I can say "oh, that was stupid". But I haven't DONE anything stupid.   Another poem.  beauty beckons us forth along the end of familiarity in delirium the bliss is found listless we call it,  ponderous. beauty beckons without assertions as sirens would of sailors in the mind dangers are cast aside as in the now with the lives we choose to sacrifice cold comes the air to the lungs of the soon forgotten splintering on the rocks to remain for countless seasons to be bleached by sun torn by wind drowned by waves and dislodged to try again

       What a night/day. Me and Eric drove around last night from 11 to 4.30 am, we visited all the popular locales. Washougal, Camas, Downtown Vancouver, Cascade Park, the waterfront, Woodland, Longview, and Battleground. Not in the order. Needless to say... I didn't get a whole lot of sleep. My Dad called from Palm Springs... he said he wasn't happy because we woke up Breanna when we came in. I'm not sure HOW we woke her up. Oh well   I need it kick it over to band practice. I'll end with this poem. Katie made me want to try poetry once more. Here are some words put together to imply meaning. See if you can find it.  costly strides are made  with hope of meaningful endurance seeping wound's can testify sucking poision out the way it came attempts to ryhme my thoughts  my love and my intentions only reveal the holes through which they sift in silence the gravity I accept remains  as the nature I reject, unhindered it sustains folding like a house of cards my will shall find it's resting place along the river death provides coffin nails are serenaded by sounds of soft Amazing Grace

      Here's a poem Katie Anderson sent me a few weeks ago.  they say that they enjoy it and they tell me how they feel.  and yet, i doubt their assurances and weak smiles of sick courage.   listen to the end.   and the end may grow  bigger.   or increase,  or live,  for something greater  may be  approaching.                                  _  small ideas  float deeper within my mind. i search for a greater meaning and return with empty  verbage. the fault lies in  returning - something i never should have done. and people lose touch of what they truly believe and are willing to stand up  for,  openly, or will have begun to regret the mistake of beginning their journey, in the wrong direction. without the belief that  all directions  eventually merge, they have no hope for redemption  apart from the  hope of some honorary  title. how inanely unimportant. the redundancy of life weighs down upon us all and tedium eats up the flesh of our dreams. flames rise from where they  greedily lick up the liquid of  dying aspirations, given up to the strange arms of indecision and  uncertainty.  lives are lost.  Katie happens to be a genuis if you did not gather.

      The path to spiritual and personal healing is a path of peril and pitfalls... but perhaps within those dangers lies the confrontation nessesary for the healing in the fricken first place! It's odd then that when calculating risks, the unknown is considered as an automatic danger, all the while the outcome is flagged as irrelevent. This is all theoretical of course.  Speaking of flamingos, school this quarter is going to be the ultimate shiz. All my classes have been condensed to Mondays and Wedsdays. It's cool, to say the least.  The effects of my DayQuil dosages have made me nearly unable to function in society. I realized as I drove home today that I had all the behaviour of a drunk and/or stoned teenager who shouldn't be driving. Or just a teenager who shouldn't be driving. It became increasingly more difficult to walk in straight lines, form speach, comprehend ideas... umm... there were numerous other effects... I'll just say memory for now as one of them.  currently listening to: the ringing in my ears

       The universe needed something... something new, something to break the ever setting mold of insipid repetition. The universe needed a means and a vessel to forment this accretiously apocryphal scheme, a young sycophant by the name of Dave. The time had come for change. The time had come...   for an update   (ubiquitous thundering thundery noises)  Yes. I have returned from my divergence of social presence, a parting of who's sole purpose being the recalibration of my inner locos of artistic voice. A parting long overdue... so understandably it also occurs as a parting long overdrawn.  In any case, here's the shiz. My summer plans have been made and can be best summerized by the use of a semi collen; lots of gigs at larger venues, a trip to England for graduation, more gigs and the recording of our first album, a week long tour around washington / idaho for extended gig coverage AND whatever else happens to happen. The summer shall be a musical one, and im preparing mentally and equipmentally wise for the long hours of hard rockege. I'm also working on my serious rock swaying in the mirror.   Lessons have been beneficial and frequent ebaying has lead to the addition of a few items which will hopefully get me closer to the sound and tones in my head, as opposed to the ones coming from a crackling near-dead 1/4 cable I regret buying on account of it being cheaper then the others. go here. www.explodingdog.com   This man is a genius. I will post some of his pictures here when they seriously hit home... for now this one does the job nicely:   http://www.explodingdog.com/january1/whitesound.html   As long as im posting shiz  look for the Still-life website to be up soon. I'll post the link when its actaully operational.  Both proms were success as they rocked, but now a third prom looms near, the way this will play out remains a mystery. I'm trying to remain circumspective...TRYING to. I'm basically a "Get out of not having a prom date and having a horrible time at home alone with your bad 80ies music Free Card" (that was a monopoly reference).   I decided to start reading things, things that are actaully interesting. Maybe they will help my writing. I'm also thinking about starting and finishing a novel idea I've been working on, which should take awhile. I'm working out now too, 5 days a week as a matter of fact. weights every other day with running inbetween. What else... I'm emotionally stable. Currently anyway, ask me again in five minutes and I'll be painting pictures of headless birds swimming in an ocean of abandonment with the sky collapsing.

      its been quite a few days since I've updated, and woo wee... nothing's happend. Day of Defeat v1 came out this weekend, I've probably spend about 20 hours playing it since sunday. It's pretty fun.   Prom was the uber strong-sauce. Lauren, you were simply a darling. You were the most happenin girl there I reckin, and everyone knew it. Thanks for being so spontanious, I know its against your INFJ!   My sister gave me a satchel today from europe. She just got back from italy. Satchels' are all the rage over there with the guys, here people call them purses. I'm going to try it out at the mall and see what kind've reactions I get... Although I can't decide what to put in it. Lip balm? Mints? maybe a small book? I really don't need anything off hand bad enough to carry it with me in my satchel.  I also dropped off my SG off today to get a custom bone nut installed, as well as a REAL SETUP, which it did not receive the first time around apparently. Well you get what you pay for. From there on I'll decide about replacing the pickups, if needed, and also about my Fernandes which is burning a hole in my soul. The guitar isn't my style at all, but it's still a fricken good guitar, im not sure how much money I wanna place into it cause I know I'd sell it to anyone who would be willing to buy it. Eventaully I'll have enough money to buy a more suitible alt guitar, either an es-135, a tele of somekind, or maybe if I wait long enough a Gretsch Sparkle Jet. Ooooooh that'd be tight.  I think im gunna start taking guitar more seriously, as in learning more scales and such, since I only know one. Eventaully it will improve my song writing im hoping. I've decided to make Queens of the Stone Age a musical influence on my writing. What they do is beyond words. They capture such odd feelings, and in a way thats just raw and colourful. It's true stoner rock.

      Last night the dream was a little more sad. There's this girl who sits in front of me in one of my classes, she's really the hottness. For some reason her and I had found our way in the jungles of Tibet on a photoshoot. We were both photographers, but I was following her the entire time, and I kept suggesting what looked like excellent shots and such, and all she would do is point out my mistakes. I also ended up following her around most of the time cause I didn't want to get friggen lost in a jungle. We came upon this hut at the bottom of a grassy slope, it was right on the river. It was so beautiful too... I don't think I could describe it. The plants I saw don't exist, and I couldn't capture the mysticalness with words even if I tried. She went into the hut (it was creepy) and I was like "hey"! So she came out with this guy she hired to carry all of her photography equipment! Isn't that lame? He was really bufff though, he was wearing one of those 80ies miami hawaiian shirts. So eventaully I was like "screw this". And I let her go off and I never saw her again.  Then I was on a beach, and my friend Nick from hawaii was there. Everyone around was collecting something for a giant device, I don't remember.   I wish life could be more like dreams. Everything in my dreams is vivid and wild and exotic, there's action scenes and and fricken awesome locales, its like a giant playground where I can be anyone I want whenever I want. As long as im sleeping that is.  I'm going to prom with Lauren. HEY GURL, WHAS UP!! Shoutout to Lauren! Tomorrow we're going to CAM's prom, then next saturday I'll be going to her prom at Prarie if she doesn't find out what a freak I really am... I think she's on to me though, she's been calling me a nerd over aim.   I gots to sleep, tomorrow is prom day!!! Gots to be fresh!!!

      I'm playing at Lauren's party tomorrow, and after sorting through my personal collection of acoustic songs, which seem to me like practice almost (even though they hold deep meaning apparrently), I decided I should play my best stuff... and since im only really proud of one song (my most recent, as is always), I decided I should write more. So thats what I mostly did today, and im very pleased with my grooves. They are the most complex with vocals, and I can belt these mothers! w0ot! So now I have 2 songs, both really awesome sounding when played alone. Here they be:  speak through weary eyes one day I will find me and the choices I made they won't remain we were born to flow and I know, ohh ohh know, ohh ohh is heaven really high enough to keep my from my daydreams the choices I made they won't remain we were born to flow  and I'll tell you one thing that you won't admit these eyes have seen the  real light, the truest form of it and I'll give you something that you will deny the rest of your life and beyond, and beyond  speak through weary eyes the world has tolled it's promise to keep you wanting but always in need  we were born hollow and I know, ohh ohh know, ohh ohh  and I'll tell you one thing that you won't admit these eyes have seen the  real light, the truest form of it and I'll give you something that you will deny the rest of your life and beyond, and beyond  And this one:  in the song of life we are the lines in this sound of mine I am alive, I am alive  you know a single rythme can change ending of our time and in the rise of mine I sing along, I sing along  its like a telephone you know the operator in this song of mine I realize, I realize

       Ohhhh wieewe boy! Eric and I saw the Foo Fighters play last weekend, they were AWESOME. Dave Grohl is really funny live... but for I had no idea what an awesome guitarist he is. A few times they went off on these 5 minute long buildup/bridge/multiple solo/jamming sessions that were cooler then the song themselves. The crowd smelled horrible... it was nasty, we came out cover in sweat... none it it was ours.    I'm still waiting for my telecaster to be finished... I emailed the guy who's building it (Tom Cassell in california) and from what he said it should be almost done by now. I'm pretty stoked. I emptied my bank account as well, much of it on pedals. I had to send my amp in for a warrenty repair in San Fransico, I hope it gets back soon.    I'm getting a full time job, to pay for the rent my Dad's gunna charge me now. So there's a good chance I might move out in august as well, which should be interesting...    Uh what else... oh yeah, I need to go hiking. I need to escape for a day. So I will, perhaps next week. Today Lauren is going to show me some of her Camera-ing tips. In return she wants some of my mad guitar skill... thought I must admit, as great of a teacher as I am I'm not sure if I can pass skills of such maddness on so easily. Since my band can't play for her party thing this wedsday im just gunna to an acoustic set thing... all alone. Which means I have to write some more acoustic songs, listener friendly ones. Cool.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.   My head is in disrepair.  "Rain coursed over all surfaces of the city in a seemingly relentless torrent of downward force, driving the souls and spirits of each pedestrian to the lowest manner of their being. Still they pressed through, seen only as phantasmic blurs of shady perpetual motion, gliding to and forth across an atmosphere thicker then one of oil and canvas." - Prospect

      I'm going to be in Palm Springs for a little while. So you know, yeah.  This is a song by Beck, who is a total Genius  Go to sleep We're so tired now Altogether in a snake pit of souls New days To throw your chains away To try to hang your hopes on the wind  Little one Just a little way Today all we need is waiting  Night rise Like the evening prize In a turnstile backwards we fly Cold bones Tied together by Black ropes we pulled from a swing  Little one Just a little way Today all of the dreams are waking  Can't stand on crooked legs I'm cross-eyed to the wall In these harbor lights Satellites explode  Drown, drown Sailors run aground In a seachange nothing is safe Strange waves Push us every way In a stolen boat we'll float away  Little one Hold on All of the dreams are wasting  Copywrite Beck, whenever he wrote it, im note sure.

      do you honestly think soap companies make soap for sensitive skin out of the goodness of their hearts, as an outreach to those people out there with tempermental skin that need to be touched with kindness? Your wrong, they only make soap like that because there is a market for it and it sells. Once again, it all comes back to money. Sometimes Capitolism makes me sick.  Tapping Empty Veins  your voice is the color of all you say but when it comes and goes,  it makes hard to know all the subtle-ties that you convey to me  tapping empty veins in a painful way and who else is at stake  as I lay inside of my peace of mind the thoughts I need to condone are the ones I throw are the ones I repress and second guess   tapping empty veins in a painful way and who else is to blame    im probably gunna scrap the 2nd verse. I dunno, I was messing around. Everything is a work in progress. MAybe I should work that into a line. Work in progress.

      I just watched an episode of the original G.I Joe tv show... and OH MY GOSH IT WAS HORRIDIBLE!!! The scripting was like aimed at 4 year olds or something, the animation was very very very choppy, and the scripting... I don't think I mentioned that it just sucked... it was almost bad scripting satire, it was that bad.   **Girl G.I Joe punches undercover enemy staff on a dinner boat**  Guy GI Joe: Haha, nice one.  Girl GI Joe: THanks, oh... hows my hair?  Guy GI Joe: Even Cobra couldn't make you look bad.  Girl GI Joe: *chuckle* Turn off the charm, you might attract whales.   WHALES!!?!?!?!? FRICKEN WHALES?!?!?!? What does that have to do with *ANYTHING*!?   *Cobra sees his staff defeated back at base through ominous nonexistant video survailence hovering somewhere overhead*  Cobra: I have morons on my payroll!! (in scratchy evil voice)  *Meanwhile the richest batchler in the world is being wooed by his suitors*  Suitor: Me and your fortune were meant to be!    I'm going to watch it every night now.. its on Adult swim.  I'm so dirty from working today I might sleep ontop of the sheets. I take showers in the mornings now to wake up, even though otherwise its not logical.   Uhh... and now a random quote from Eric.   "But seriously, I'd be lucky to find a girl who enjoys being around me as much as I do."

      Urgh! my sister bought these crickets to feed to her lizard, and they are doing their mating thing really loud and the sound is filling up the whole house so I can't sleep. It sucks! I know in the back of my mind they exist to DIE! they are bred to be eaten! How depressing is that? It's a fricken lizard, go let him catch his own food... at least there's sport in that, at least the crickets have a chance then. My sister is sick... she finds death, the consequence of sin, to be fascinating. She likes to watch the lizard, which she named "Edwin" devour the little animals she buys for him. Do you really think thats the way God intended it? Everything eating each other? No.  No sir.

       So I was weeding today... and it made me wonder. I was weeding to maintain a sense of order about the yard, a sense of geometry to the way the plants lined up. The weeds looked out of place because they grew in random places as opposed to in the straight lines of the legit plants. Then I pondered about how realitive the concept of order was, or rather how we perceive order on such a narrow wavelength. The legit plants in the row were not in a perfect row, it would be impossible for them to be in a  perfect  row. They would all have to be clones of the same plant with a perfect symetrical branch system, and the line would have to be straight down past the subatomic level.   Then I realized that the amount of order it takes for even a plant (a weed, even) to grow, from the electrons surrounding the atoms of the elements which form the molecules and the compounds and the way they wrap around each other to form an organism which feeds on water and sunlight and reproduces itself an infinate number of times is far FAR FAR more orderly then any stupid fricken line of bushes on the side of my house. And then I wondered why I was destroying this, when it occured to me again that even a concept such as destruction follows a very specific order... nothing of the plant is actually "destroyed", it simply enters into a process of assimulation with its surroundings. Eventaully some of those atoms will end up in other plants. Which brings me to a theory of mine, which is that even something as seemingly chaotic as "decay" is merely inperceivable order.  Chaos is inperceivable order.   Even the idea of hitting something and it breaking is cause and effect. Even the concept of death, which is considered by a few atheist's I've talked to be the crowning proof of the fact that humanity and the world is in constant decay, even death is a begining/end style deal. The idea of "decay" suggests that something is going from more order to less order... which means there has to be order to start out with. But the concept of decay is egocentrical to humanity's wavelength of order.   All those astroids flying around up there in space wacking each other are following a very complicated system of gravitational forces and physics. When light hits something it reflects in a very predictable manner... the idea of predicting something implies you are observing a *pattern* and drawing the lines to see where its going next and how its going to repeat itself.  I'm pulling completely random examples, but everything is an example.  So back to my original point... which is that weeding is a menial, useless task. It's like standing on the beach screaming at the incoming tide. You can't stop them, they'll just keep coming. But unfortunately I am part of another system, which is a family structure... which means I have to do what my parents say or else I don't eat. Logical? Yes.

       Uuhhh yeah.. Yep. Yeah. This is another update. Uhh.   Eric. Connie and I went to Seattle this weekend for the Spoon concert. That was kind've an adventure. The concert didn't start until like 9:45, but the ticket said 8:00. So we sat on the floor for an hour or something after they ripped our tickets cause they wouldn't let us in the bar where the seats were. Nevertheless it was cool. The first band was The Natural History. They really rocked some sausage. Uh, then "The Vells" played, but their name should've been "the Help We're Still Stuck in the early 70ies British-Pop-Rock Pyschedelic Scene(s)" and/or the "Our Singer is having a Sex Identity Crisis". He sang like he thought he was a women, but deep down inside he knew he was a man.   SPOON ROCKED OFF THE HIZZY. I was singing along with Britt, and he kept looking at me... probably cause im really tall and I was sticking out of the crowd, but also because I was screaming at him and doing rapid-fire directional tumbs-ups at him while they were setting up. So towards the end of the show while they were playing Paper Tiger, he walks over to the Bassist and I swear he says "that guy in the front row is singing our words". Of course I didn't HEAR that, but I read his lips. TRUE STORY. I'm not joking at all! I had an impact on Britt Daniels. BRITT DANIELS ladies and gentlemen. That was pretty cool. I'm listening to him right now. He's like the brother I never had.  So our parking ended at 12:00, and the concert got out at 1:15... see a problem? yeah... so we had to pay a 25 dollar fine. Kinda sucked, but mostly for Connie.. cause she was the only one with cash! Ahaahhaha! So then we got lost looking for gas. I turned on the car and the gas light was on. We ended up in Bellvue. THen we stopped at a Walgreens. Then we got lost trying to find Connie's house. We didn't even decide to drive home until 3:30am, we were debating whether we should stay at my friend Tom's house. So we drove home. Me and Eric kept each other awake with a Spoon cd and a will to live. I've never had a deep discussion when I was that tired, but it provoked thought.   The band is getting ancy. We need to finish recording. Then everyone will be happy and welled mannered. We just need to record. I would die with peace if we'd just record.    I'm going hiking next week. Uh what else... My summer plans went to hell. I don't particularly care, just an observation. I guess im going to Palm Springs (don't have a choice), and to a family campout (don't have a choice)... and then to Seattle for a few days (choice? no.) and then a Wedding... and still my dad lays a guilt trip for not having a job. LOGICAL? no.    All my creativity is starting to evoke itself in a side project of mine, a recording project. I wish I had a more serious sounding keyboard... mine is from the 80ies... everything I've recorded with it sounds like a parody for a real song. I will find a way to work this into my style. Or maybe a way to digitally alter it. I kind've wish I had access to a huge Lord of the Rings style choir. And I wish I knew how to use one of those Conducter sticks.

      I just got back from England yesterday.   I have this saying, that everything in Europe is backwards. I made that up before I went to England, and it actaully turned out to be correct! People drive on the opposite side of the road, the hot and cold water taps are switched, door handles must be turned in the other direction, and there are beautiful women everywhere. The women part may be due to the fact we were in London, but since thats where I was the whole time, I guess we'll never know. I was there for 8 days with my family, and it was alot of fun. We stayed at a hotel in the "West End" of town, in the heart of Londen. Our room was actaully open to the street like a normal apartment though, very cool. The stores there were incredible... there is a whole other society out there for people who have more cash, and it affects everything you do submersely. Thats a blanket statement I won't dive into, its something you have to observe for yourself. Unfortunately you have to go somewhere where there is an upper class to see this, and that excludes most of the country.  We went to Harrod's a few times. This store is a occupies an entire city block and is 8 stories tall... This store has *everything* in it, its like a mini-attraction... there were about 8 seperate clothing departments in it to cater to different styles and money brackets... I won't try to list everything there because I won't do it justice, but lets say I saw 7 foot tall fossils people were buying for their living rooms and a 17,000 dollar miniture Jaguar X Series car for YOUR CHILD.No comment from me.   I also saw a play which was awesome... uh... me and the fam went to dinner twice a day at different restaurants... I saw alot of stuff. The parks they have there are massive, there's horse back riding in them and lawnchairs that the city puts there. We rode one of those double dekka busses the first day on a tour... the Tower of London is actaully more then just a tower, it's a huge fortress spanning from when the Romans first occupied Britian.   We took a day trip out to Stonehenge and to a city called Bath, because of some Roman Baths they found there. The baths were pretty cool, but I thought the town was incredible. The ENTIRE town was designed in the 1700s by Father and Son Architects out of a single type of Stone!! There was so much history there, and everything little nook and cranny had plants growing out of it. The river Avon ran through the middle of the city, and there was a park there in the middle of town with stone fountians and a bunch of school kids putting on a band concert.  We also saw a few Castles... I took a few rolls of everything, I'll scan them and upload all my pictures for you all to see... One thing I wanted to do was to go around by myself and the camera in one of the large London squares at night... but I didn't get around to it :(. I was usually too tired by nightfall to go off by myself.  There were so many handsome girls there, and they all talked in dainty little accents and said cutesy words like "mummsy" and "Spottsy". It was odd because I only saw 3 obese people there the entire time, and we were in the heart of the country! The saturday television was educational... uuuhhh what else... I got called a Gentleman alot by bathroom signs.  I'm glad I went... international travel is so enriching! I want to do more of it. I got alot of experience, alot of mediation was done on my songwriting style and I decided I have to be more brave and raw, im finding ways out of my "wasted potential" mentality which has been sucking me dry from the inside.  For the fourth of july I'm going to the beach with my family, and then to a party I hope hosted by a friend of a friend from Seattle. Still-life is playing on the 9th at a small church, then Eric and I are going to a Spoon concert in Seattle on the 12 I think... I have yet to get ahold of everyone since I've gotten back.

      Ok so I got a job. Umm, being a Janitor. For my Dad. But you know what? Shut up! You know why? Because I said so! And cause im on the fricken payroll!  Speaking of having bad converation skills, here's a tip for you all.  Never start a conversation with the words "Women are like cattle". I'm not speaking from experience. I'm not. But I've observed from other people that it seems to provoke conflict. "Women are like" is better, but be careful with what you put after that. A cunning "women are like  so cool " could be a good idea, but take heed that you do not sound incincere... hmm... you know what? I think it'd be best if we didn't even try a "women are"... don't even claim to know how to generalize women. Don't even claim to know anything about women. In fact, don't talk about women at all. Don't even try a "Women...". Thats the only way to play it safe.

      I've just ended the day by watching a very special little gem from the 80ies, and it was time well spend too... for yes,  I am  refering to  Labyrinth  starring the musical genius of David Bowie. Ten minutes into the movie you will find yourself completely absorbed into the curious creatures offered by this world, and the mystical riddle-me-this poetic playfulness of the dialogue of which they speak. The story itself is one of legends. Nothing other then epic. The greatest scholars... even the most learned philosophers could, applying everything within their intellectual prowlness, do nothing more then merely skim the surface of the infinate depths which can only be known as Jim Henson's creative think-tank.   Having thought about this movie, many questions seem answered... yet many remain.   I have deducted that Sarah, the young girl and main charactor of the movie, is a symbol of childhood. One of which we can all relate. But what of the baby she journey's for? The baby is the duty, the responsibilty she hates but knows she must strive to secure in order to take the next step in her process of self actaulization. All through the movie she repeats "Because I have to" in reply to Jaroth's daunting pleas for her to stand down.  The Labyrinth itself represents the path from youth to inner growth and maturity, my Labyrinth was highschool, but the path may be taken many ways and hence... not all are the correct way, and not all journeyers succeed. Every landmark along the Labyrinth translates into a growing pain of socialization. Jeroth, the evil goblin prince which hold's Toby (the baby) hostage, is nothing more then the forces of peer pressure at work... because while he affects and causes all kinds of obsticals to appear and influences every creature who resides in the Labyrinth, he is defeated within his own castle at the end when Sarah realizes that "You have no power over me." His charactor is a direct physical manisfestation of this pressure, his revealing tight pants seem to hint at the need to show masclinality to the world, while at the same time being countered by his feminine hair (he has extensions) which makes reminds me of how we are expected to be all things to all people.  Every seemingly random encounter holds true to be the lessons learned, the personal revelations that must be made if you wish to reach the end of the maze. The old man with the flamingo bird sticking out of his head advises her that "Sometimes you have to walk backwards to get closer, but your always closer then you think" meaning that knowing your own faults and weaknesses actaully makes you stronger then those who fail to. Afterwards though, the bird demands a contribution to the old man, so Sarah gives him a ring... meaning the lessons learned often cost something: namely pride.  The pit of eternal stink symbolizes the lasting effects of a reputation gone wrong, as if any part of you touches it you smell horrible until death. Jaroth (peer pressure) threatens to throw Hoggle (love-deprived citizen of the labyrinth, i.e a class mate with self esteem issues) into this pit if he does not betray Sarah with the Peach of Forgetfulness. This peach is nothing more then an icon of self-concentration, as it distracts and makes you forget about your journey to self actaulization. Sarah falls prey to it and is sucked into a magical bubble of "im a self centered jerk" as she lives out her fantasy of being a Princess in a Fairy Tale complete with a smokey ball room scene... I ask you, how many girls have you met who are at this stage currently?  But it is only after she escapes this bubble when she realizes the material world is "just a bunch of garbage". Brilliant. All through this journey is the clock, an icon which appears time and time again to indicate the pressure to grow up as quickly as possible. I could analyze every second of this movie, but I will not. Instead lets move on to what I *haven't* figured out.   Why does the little overly zealous dog ride a larger dog which is mellow and cowardly? Is this some kind of symbol of political activisism, as only the people who speak out publicly are represented in government and hence, control everything about the larger group of silent people? Why can the Giant Ape Muppet thing beckon the command of boulders? And who are "the cleaners"?  Perhaps one day we'll have the answers... but until then, I invite you to come over and we'll watch it in speculation.  I'd even make brownies.  And now a song.   words fail  oblivious to the mirrors she's got for every angle you counter it with the sense of confidence you've bottled but when it all comes down when it all pans out there ain't nothing to be found in her there ain't nothing but the chance you missed the chance I can't repeat every song I sing that I can't complete and a mindless mediocrity I confess I confess I've been remiss I've been  too depressed to make myself this obvious cause when its all layed down when its over and out the me you see for me is only face deep so words fail they've been tossed around sunk like empty freighters run aground and chained to every future occasion  Copywrite **ME** YOU FILTHY SCAVENGERS!!! No copy/pasting! I'd have your retirement funds!! I swear!!

       First of all, whatever your doing stop right this instant and watch this video:   urlLink And no, im not talking about the cheers theme song.   Read the intructions. I don't care if your doing CPR on someone right now. This video is more importent.   Secondly my friends, many of us are familur with the one rule of engagement that holds true for all matters related to women.         Never get involved with, in any way, a girl who admittably enjoys romance novels.    There is no expection to this rule. But something has been forgotten, or often slips beneath the cracks. I am refering to TEEN GIRL MAGAZINES. This filth, gentlemen, is the propaganda of a society gone to sheol (a fancy word for hell). Stray from the crumbley and wicked path which can only been known as a subcription to "17" or whatever other magazine is your sick cup of tea. I only speak such vigilence because in my time of greatest weakness I have fallen prey to the seductions of gaining the infinate knowlage of the teen feminine world.   But all it not as it would appear.    This publications are rigged and formulated to be addictive in nature, with their colorful illustrations and their helpful "hints". I witnessed myself in my most pathetic state of being as I began to read "Simple Steps to Fearless Flirting" AND WAS INTRIGUED. Before a mere hour had passed I had given myself a palm reading (I am destined to be a scientist, but im also psychic), determined my special animal messenger (A Bunny), and had read the entirity of "10 Things Guys Wish Girls Knew"  WHICH WERE ALL ENTIRELY FALSE!!!!  These magazines create and define pre-existing problems for girls, and then offer theoretical but mostly just false advice on how to handle these situations.    All this crap was written by some 20-30 year old woman sitting in a tower somewhere in New York, and who thinks she still relates well to girls and their problems. The things they are tell girls about guys like me makes me want to vomit up my internal organs and then swallow them again so I can go hop on a plane, fly to New York, walk into the office of the editor of that magazine and puke my PRE-PUKED guts all over her. And if the "her" happens to be a "him", then I don't even know what I'd do. I don't even know.   I can't talk about this anymore.

        At long last dictionary.com has provided me with the word which defines who I am.   Word of the Day for Monday August 18, 2003     wunderkind \VOON-duhr-kint\, noun;    plural wunderkinder \-kin-duhr\:    1. A child prodigy.    2. One who achieves great success or acclaim at an early age.       It  was even written that, at 20, his best days were behind      him.  He  had  gone  from  a  wunderkind  to  an  object of      sympathy, a hero struggling not to be forgotten.      --"Owen  shines  like  a  beacon amid the wrecks," [1]Times      (London), May 29, 2000       In  the mid-thirties, he became the youngest and best state      director  of  FDR's  National Youth Administration, a Texas      wunderkind  who  at  age  twenty-eight  beat several better      known  opponents  for  a  south-central Texas congressional      seat.      --Robert Dallek, [2]Flawed Giant      _________________________________________________________     Wunderkind  comes  from  German, from Wunder, "wonder" + Kind,    "child."'    This weekend was fun, I went camping with my family and then to my cousins wedding.  The funniest thing happened. I was sitting playing my guitar and this little girl walks up to me (not my cousin) and starts talking to me. It was completely adorable. She was 4 I think. She asked me how I was playing guitar, and since I was playing above the 12th fret I started to explain to her how the Greeks discovered that if you cut a wavelength in half you end up with the same wavelengh in a different frequency, and how that applied to the strings.    She kept changing the subject. It was annoying, but cute.    Then out the the middle of nowhere she's like. "I killed a hamsta". I was like "what?" and she was like "I picked him up and I threw him, and then I sat on him and he died". It was a gift from God. The whole weekend was better after that, it was so unbelieveable funny. I guess you would have to just have to had to met her or something.

       I'm getting more and more pleased with my song writing, its starting to get to the point where the vocal melody drives the song itself, kinda like folk. Thats a good stretch for me since I'm typically a guitarist first and a singer second.  those pictures are off of www.explodingdog.com  the guy is really a wonderful artist, I like everything about what he does. I decided it'd be cool to see my mood rather then read it. so when I have an extreme mood, you'll know. I just can't get enough of this guy's work. Go to www.explodingdog.com right now. Don't delay.

      so last night I had this dream I was going on a mission trip to some african country, right? but there were all these delays and random occurances. I don't remember them clearly, but when I got to the airport noone I was "expecting" was there, because the truth was it was all a front for a special forces mission I was going on. My partner was like WHOA BABY. Not like "hot", but "cute". So we get out there and it turns out all my friends, and my cousin, were in the special forces too! how cool is that?   So we get the briefing, and it was complicated... but my only part was protecting our drop-zone (a tree) with my partner. So they all ran off with their cool guns and such, and my partner (I'm going to name her Steph... steph is a good name for her since she reminds me of a girl I met at camp a few years ago who also happens to never talk to me anymore) climbed up into the tree, but I couldn't find my rifle! I know! so I started feeling around in the knee high african grass and I found this piece of junk rifle from like the 30ies, and the action was allll rusted out. So foes start appearing over the horizen... and what do you suppose they were?   HIDEOUS ROBOTS!!!! They had boxy bodys with the face right on the body, no head... kinda like tiki idols... but so much more lethal. Thier mouths would get tiny and stuff, but then would get circular, which is when you had a chance to shoot them. So we popped alot of them but eventaully they lumbered all the way to our tree! So this "game over" comes down into view and it starts over again.   this time I climb up into the tree with Steph, cause the ground wasn't working out too well. It worked out alot better up there cause we repelled them. So the mission was over right? So my dream fast forwards us talking to her house, at 3 am in the living room. She was a really cool person... to bad she DOESN'T EXIST. So we were having some really great conversations when her mom walked in and was like "your on medication Steph, if you don't get sleep you'll never die". And I was confused so she explained some bogus process of the blood replentishing itself. Yeah. So I went home. I never saw Steph again, and I never will.   So on the next mission I'm sitting alone. Typically alone, actaully. And ERic who was one of the special forces walks up to me with HIS new friend who happens to be a girl. She was a model from one of those russian block countrys, but I didn't want to tell him that she was boring AND not hot enough to be a model. She was complaining that her ex-boyfriend who was a designated "bad guy" stole her sun glasses, and Eric wanted to get them back with Special Forces Power.   So thats when my mom wakes me up and tells me to mow the lawn.   and thats my dream.  And I'm back from Palm Springs, and it was so-so. Too hot.

         added: finished photo's section. seperate pages with "commentary".    removing: Eisley references. They really annoy me now.   I spent all morning cleaning up my room, hardcore style. I found.. lots of things... that've been lost... for years. First I found my lost birth certificate. Then I found the lost birth certificate I got to replace the first one because I needed it to get my passport. Then I found the passport I'd lost. My mom found my 16th birthday present, a traditional hawaiian gold ring with my name (in hawaiian) on it. That was pretty cool, as I've missed it for a long time. Since my 16th birthday, roughly.   I also found a bunch of old school note books. It's very interesting to read my highschool notes freshmen through junior year... they'll be notes down the first half of the page, and then all of the sudden they will stop mid sentence and have a poem or song down the rest of the page, and then maybe a list of things to do for a LAN party or angry thoughts about *insert anything stupid about highschool*. It's crazy to see what and who I was thinking about during those 3 years. I have about 30 songs now that I've pulled out and found as wadded up pieces of paper. Some of them just make me wince, other ones are actaully very good, which is odd because I thought they all sucked at the time.   but enough of that. I think its time for some   bike rider educaton   I went to a Mogwai concert last weekend. They were awesome. The trip there however was not. Nick got some directions off of mapquest, and in my opinion as far as mapquest is concerned im better off using my navigational intuition then following their horrible directions. Nick and I followed them precisely until we got to a 3 story bridge, the directions told us to take an exit on the top story of the bridge which was an impossibilty as our lane of traffic was on the bottom. So we took a few turns and ended up skiping about 7 steps of our mapquest "directions", found highway 26 ourselves and with Jen's cell phone guidance pinpointed the location of Aladin's Theater and parked.   Not before a "run in" with a bike rider though... and when I say "run in" I mean he ran into my car.  I was pulling out of a neighbor hood road back onto the main road, and as I  creeped  and  slowly   peeked  out to look  both  ways for traffic, I hear this thump on the side of my car (the bike running into my car). Then a few seconds later I hear more thumps (the bike rider kicking my car with his foot in anger). So he comes up to my window and starts yelling at me and such, and of course I felt horrible. That is, until I thought about it for awhile.  It was almost night time, there were no streetlights and as I got out of the car I realized this guy was wearing no reflective material, and had no lights of any kind on his bike. Right. So he was angry, and I wasn't exactly sure what had happened (I assumed it was my fault) and he kept saying "You didn't even look! You didn't even look for me!". Not that I would have seen him anyway, but he hit the back end of my car... which means my entire car had to have passed in front of his trajectory, and I was not moving very fast. Having the right of way doesn't mean you can be a moron. Whatever the situation, lets go back to the core-fundamentals of road survival.   car vs bike = car   this is because  car > bike . see how that makes sense? bigger beats smaller.  here's another example.   pedestrian vs semi = semi   this one should be easy for you.  pedestrian     so the semi wins.  here's a tough one...   car vs car   now in this senario you actaully have to apply other factors besides size (they are both the same) and use physics, another thing I've never learned. When you can master that problem you will have snatched the grasshopper out of my hand.   Nick. Despite what you said about running away if the guy punched me, I know deep inside myself that you would've stuck by me and kung-fu'd his azz.

      Posers are everywhere. They may pose as different things, but there's one thing thats true for all of them. They all suck.  It happens everywhere. Your doing your own thing, and the door swings open with a bang. Everyone turns their head. The poser enters, grinning, possibly holding a skateboard for everyone to see, or more offensively a guitar. The poser struts in, feeling the warmth of everyone's gaze while scanning the room for whoever's inperceptive, whoever might think he's cool and accept him. He then heads for the group of impressionable freshmen girls.  He walks with his arms suspended away from his body, as if to incinuate that he has overly developed back and chest muscles, which is never the case. Every hair on his head has been carefully positioned with twizers. He is the textbook definition of whatever is currently "in" at the moment, from what he wears to the music he talks about to the shows on television. More importently he is the textbook definition of whatever his "group" (the crowd he is trying to appeal to) thinks is "in". Therefor his powers are useless outside of his range of influence, his target audience.  As the poser nears this group of girls his eyes sparkle with a sense of determination, as if to say "lets do this." He greets them warmly, following every rule of social engagment. The girls smile and giggle,  boyfriends are great for social standing  each one of them secretly thinks. His conversation is preplanned, he's considered every possible senario. Thus he talks about about nothing for awhile, until they notice the guitar. One of the girls unwittingly says "Oh! is that a guitar?", or "You play guitar?", or "Oh goodie! Play us something on your guitar!" - Interpretation:  Dance for us man puppet !  But thats precisely what the poser is. A puppet. A social shapeshifter adhering to the clichic fantasies of every young girl who has them.  His lip twitches slightly up in the corner,  just what I was waiting for  he mentally chuckles. So he cracks his neck and prepares to pose. He takes his time, as to attract as much attention as possible. After all, the more impressions he can make with one operation the better. He then kneels into the traditional acoustic players position. He'll strum a few chords to "warm up", something obivously only an authentic musician would know about. The anticipation festers.  He then begins the song he's been practicing for a couple months. Posers usaully never have more then 2 or 3 songs. Any song with the key lyrical phrases "my heart", "flying" or "dreams" are highly effective and candiates for poser-worthy material. If your an edgy poser however, look for the the lyrical phrases "falling", "crawling" and anything that has to do with "rain". These are more useful against girls who talk about being into the "heavy" or "hard" music scene, i.e. POD and anything else on your local Alt Nu-Metal radio station.   During the duration of that thing he does with the guitar which people assume is music, he scruntches his face as if to say " Look at me. Look at me being an Artist ." and another face that says " I'm so serious about this song written by someone else about a theoretical situation involving a girl ", faces he both learned off of MCI Commerials and Album covers from his expansive collection of one-week-radio-wonders.  When he finishes he may or may not attempt to conceal the expression of cool satisfaction with himself which he carries on his face.  Operation successful . The girls are probably giggling right now, and some new guy in the corner who doesn't know any better is in envy.  Know this, however. Knowlage and perception... aye, and general social intelligence is the only device in which to detect these people, but be loving. A public thrashing is their worst nightmare. These people will not rejoin authentic society if crippled. Rather, let them dig their own holes. Eventaully they will figure things out through their own means, as painful as they will make them.   Remember: At the heart of nearly every poser is a little boy wanting to be loved... that or a little brat who just needs to be loved... either way they need love.  If they harrass you then also know this: they have a tendacy to alienate and avoid those who are on to them, who have a healthy sense of self confidence, people who are self actualized. So next time a poser shines his Crest-Teeth-Whitening-Strips shiney smile, realize he's a super stupid sauce head and ask him a question about a topic that is actually relevent to life. He'll shudder where he stands.  Interesting Facts on the Poser:  He often has 2 to 3 vassal posers which follow him around and observe his behavior. They are usually victims of insecurity.   The poser will plow through relationships based on social temperature and trends/currents.   The poser cannot stay in one group for extended periods of time, and does not react well to spontanious behavoir   The poser will often change his faction depending on which social resources he's already exhausted.   "Hi everyone, welcome to the Casbah. We're the Quarrymen and we're going to play you some Rock and Roll." John Lennon

      I am so fricken bored. Its a good thing I have my first classes tomorrow, it really is. I'm starting to scare myself.  I just spend the last 30 minutes of my life organizing my away messages for AIM. Do you realize how lame that is? I have like 40, so I went though and capitolized all the names, added some proper grammar and rewrote alot of them. Noone should have time to do something like that. Before that I organized my buddy list catagories, because I had 8 folders.   Speaking of organization, my mom has been on my case about it. My room mainly. Last week she had an interventine with me because my room "smelled" as she put it. I told her to get off my case because my room was fine and that the smell was coming from me, and then she asked me when the last time I took a shower was and well... you know what I was doing for the next 30 minutes. As it turns out we were both right. The room still smelled.  Last month she approached me about organizers. She said "If you clean up your room  really  nice, I'll buy you a closet organizer!". She made it sound all sparkly like candy, but I knew it was a trick. Closet organizers arn't   fun  ! It's like when you have to give your dog a pill, you act like its really a treat and by the time they down it they don't care if they've been had. So I didn't. Then one morning she wakes me up at the crack of noon and says "put pants on were going to home depot and buying closet organizers." See? It's like a game of chicken of who's lazyer, and im a pro.  Don't expect any late night entries after school starts. I just won't be on. I'm waking up at 7 every day of the week with expection of saturday maybe... this isn't from will power, but from the fact that M-W-F I go exercising with my dad and his  personal trainer , and T-Th I have classes and such.   This year will be grand. I'm on a regular exercise program, I have a light class load (of music), im taking private voice and guitar lessons, writing on my novel and working on my band pipe-dream, and I have a job.... er... sort of. I'm going to ask to help me make a picture story/tour of my typical janitor shift... I'd post it here, and it'd be awesome.   p.s. trish thx for the HTML thing, im getting it work the way I want thx to JOSH! thx JOSH!

      	I just wrote the prologue for my first book in the series. Oh yeah, I'm writing a series of books. Writing this feels premature as I am first creating my material before I write the book (I.e launguistics technology politics history culture warfare ect) but I've been brainstorming heavily the last 2 days. I have a Glossary of Terms, a plot Outline of all 3 books, a Timeline, and 2 seperate papers im working on describing everything there is to know about Valentis, Corrcan and the Serephi. This plot is 2.5 times more complicated then anything simular, and while that doesn't nessisarily mean that the plot is gppd... it actaully is good. It's very good. But I can't tell you :p  "The Dominion Nomanatti was the greatest of all strengths in the Beforetimes. The expanse of their reign knew only the limitations of greed, unquencable in it's yearnings and betraying in it's forfillment. Such was The Dominion's demise. As is written in the Books of Chronology, the first galactic government was the last. Not one among the Dominon of a Thousand Systems foresaw the colapse, not one would prepare for the Age of Forlorn which followed. The one flame of glory which had taken countless generations to kindle had smouldered, and all those who basked in it's warmeth were left forever bleak in the vast oblivion. 	Thus ended the Era of Grand Hemegony, and what lead after noone can say in right authority. The supply ships stopped coming. Systems like ours, systems like Valentis must have been numerous. Many suffered the hollowness of mouth. Like an infant lost of a mother's milk, so we fought to tame the soil in the weakest of states. Not since has their been such pain. The planet beneath us pruned our people, and in it we found our lives renewed. Eons have passed since the Age of Forlorn, but eons have no hold on the affairs of men. Different agendas, different names and people, but war is and will always be the same. 	It is no suprise then to find ourselves on the verge of a great war, the war of our Dynasty, the war of one victor It is because of our past that we push forward so boldly, into what we call a great smelting. A purification. It is because of our future we fan the furnice, for whomever holds the virgin system of Udarious will be ensured much gain. 	The inner systems have progress, the churning of industry and the science of life giving. Valentis has nothing. It had always been there above us, somewhere, as an overlooked key into the circle of the thriving. We detected the ore by mistake. Mass quantities of it, enough to mine for generations, and sell for fortunes. Our probe had been misguided on a mission of dicovery towards the void when we passed the planet.. Our first recon ship has been sent, but it's departure has been made known to Corrcan, the nearest surviving planet to us. What is known of Corrcan dictates that they have not faired as well from the eons past. They are reckless in their desperate measures, but their recklessness makes them unpredictable and therefor dangerous. Corrcan has sent their own ships."  I agree it needs some work, but I have a looooonngg time for that :/

        There's this ritual I do when I'm going to be home alone for extended periods of time. First, I get nake-ed. This usually is not difficult, seeing as how I rarely do my laundry I don't have much to wear anyway. Then I tranverse the expanses of the house multiple times, sitting in every chair and lying on every couch, and inspect each room accordingly. Then I go to the kitchen, and with my hands on my hips I assess my food options. After it's clear that I need to live at Wendy's for awhile, I call someone I know. It doesn't really matter who, I don't tell them I'm nake-ed. It's one of those inside jokes thats a  *really*  inside joke, as only I am a part of it. Then I sit down at my computer, and write in my blog.   Do you see where I'm going with this?  I'm nake-ed. Nake-ed as I type this. I hope this doesn't make you feel uncomfortable or anything.  Anyway moving on, I have a situation that needs attention. Somehow this girl called "Kiwicrgrl09" got on my buddy list, I have no idea how. I attempt communication with her regularly, but she continues to blow me off basically. This lead to questions... questions like "why"? Needless to say, I have begun to scientifically document the happenings as of late.

The briefing is over, now get to work yall! Thank you. From now on I'll be adding quotes of interest. I bought a book about the early years of the Beatles so the first ones will be form that.  "They were doing four solos on one song, which was unheard of in those days; you'd do the song straight from the record. People stopped dancing. Instead they walked forward and just stood and watched. We thought, something strange is happening. The Beatles were jumping on chairs and smoking on stage, Paul McCartney was playing this guitar with four strings on, and Pete was pounding out his powerful drum beat- oh , and John Lennon was having a fight with someone at the back of the hall. What a night." - John McNally

       I have this idea, this vision.. and whenever I think about it I get tingley skin. You want to know what it is? Ok, promise not to tell **anyone**, im serious.  An Archtop... a Cello... A Violin... an Acoustic... am acoustic base... a piano... and a crazy half-insane inde-drummer - playing my messed up stoner music.  It's the formula for the perfect band. Now not every instrument would be in every song, hence the idea that someone plays more then one instrument... probably the pianist would also play the violin or something. I dunno. This is something I am enbarking on, but it will take proabably a year before this all pulls together. I have the music for all the different music parts planned out alright, but not the knowhow to coordinate that many instruments all at once and make it sound like love .... cause the idea is to make these imaginary people play exactly whats in my head. I have to *show* them what im thinking.   I'm taking piano lessons, guitar lessons, and vocal lessons. Holy shizniz, could it be real? Could this be happening? Me willingly seeking out knowlage? I'm taking music theory at clark this year as well as ear training, and im going to become really good at writing staff.  Oh yeah, and I'm writing a novel on the side.   But thats secret! Even more secret!

      Whats up aye? Well I'll be telling you alls then... standard journal-like post.  UUhhhh gosh... Last week I went to homecoming with Trish. It was at Evergreen. It sucked. We stayed like 10 minutes and left. The DJ was too "down" with our "scene", the people were uptight and had gel in their hairs, and the punch was suger free and made from jello mix. We went to the portal where we saw all my homies I know through Josh Wakemen.. whom I met the weekend before.  So we talked there for an hour or so, then went to Denny's and talked for an hour or so. Then a few of us went to a park somewhere, and Daniel assembled his Arabian Water Bong with the exacting mastery of a sniper deconstructing and reconstructing his boom stick.  Speaking of boom sticks, I watched Army of Darkness again last night. AWESOME MOVIE. Josh Moore came over after bible study and we gave it a whirl... one of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when a demon infested chick starts going crazy inside of the S Mart, and Ash gets up on the counter with a shotgun and goes:   Ash: "Lady... I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.."  Demon-infested chick: "Who the hell are you!?"  Ash: "Name's Ash... Housewares..." - cocks shotgun  *boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom*  Awesome, completely ingenius.  Tonight I met Daniel again, a bunch of his church peeps were at the portal and we went and saw Kill Bill. I now have this fear of being decapitated through unnatural means. I don't know the phobia name for it.  This week has been less then so cool. I'm really tired when I wake up in the morning... jogging at 7am now- its getting old. I'm supposed to be doing it with my dad, but he's not even there 1/3 of the time. So like, this morning when I got back from jogging, I took a nap. From around 9am to uhh... 1:40pm. Yeah. Very bad. So I called to cancel my voice lesson. Very very very bad.  My sister Chrystal is down here. She's going to see my sister Bre in cali. My dad left too, and my mom's been gone so naturally, I've been playing Counter-Strike with my fellow clan CareBear teammates. BREANNA: thank you for the CareBear theme song you sent me! I've been playing it into my mic when I join servers. People say it sounds like crap! Its precious.  Umm.. as long as I'm being random, I found some software to help me structure my Novel. It's cool...  pretty cool ... it has a bug though, the company hasn't emailed me back about it.  Also, I really hope my new band thing glues together. If its going to happen, then I have to be the glue.   Life is about to get painful... I can feel it.  I'm not seizing enough of my blessings.  Duck and cover!! OH well, I have to write a shallow entry now and again.. if only to keep contrast.  ------------------------------------------------------------  "Good... bad... I'm the guy with the gun." - Ash,  Army of Darkness

       My Review   I keep reading these reviews by " urlLink Plugged In " and I'm just getting more and more angry. The idea behind Plugged In is good. It's a good idea. But whoever is writing this stuff I strongly disagree with. So I decided to write my own review.    Point A: They assume people do not use discernment.   This publication subscribes to the same way of thinking as the people who think if I play Doom and listen to Drowning Pool it is going to cause me to go out and kill people and enjoy it. It's utterly ludicrious. If you are going to tell me that then you also have to say that your children are only Christians because you tell them it is a good thing and make them go to church every sunday.  Hello? God gave people an internal locos of control. It's called "Free Will".  If I as a teenage Christian cannot go see " urlLink the Italian Job " without becoming corrupted and deciding that being a criminal is a good thing (because I am a stupid internalizing dim-wit teenager), then how in the ************* can Christianity still exist today!?  Your reaction when you intake **anything** in this world are decided by YOU and who you ALREADY ARE. Forgive me if my Worldview encompasses more then just whatever is on the exclusive Christian market, but anything and everything of this world, if perceived wisely, reveils God's truth because it is the ultimate truth and it is unescapible.    Point B: They are biased beyond Biblical standards.   Addressing the very first paragraph: They praise Creed and don't even mention when they use rape as a metaphore for intellectual/emotional abuse in "Beautiful" but assume that Nirvana is being literal when they sing about it. Funny how this reviewer is willing to do research behind questionable Relient K songs but doesn't do  crap  (oh no! heaven forgive me! I mean "c***") to find out what Kurt Cobain is talking about in his song.  'Worse yet, "Rape Me" is destined to be  an accessory in violent crimes against women by suggesting that they enjoy being sexually assaulted-repeatedly  ("Rape me my friend . . . hate me, do it and do it again"). Tongue in cheek? Hard to tell. It will be interesting to see how the band tries to justify this one.' - Bob Waliszewski  Kurt said in an interview the song was responding to the bands that were copying Nirvana's style and then debasing Nirvana. Thats what he was saying. Creed used rape to describe a feeling of rejection "The Beautiful raped me, raped me, raped me." And if you ask me, beauty (coinciding with order) is more of an institution of God then social slander.  Either way, they either have condemn both or allow for both, but to not even mention the Creed one is simply odd.  Keep in mind though that  none of the above ever suggests that rape is a good thing , in fact, they use it as an illustration only because everyone knows its abominable and horrible, along with genocide and crusifixion and whatever else. If it's wrong to merely mention rape, then why is it still in the Old Testiment?  It makes me wonder how Plugged In would review the Bible.   I remember (I believe it's in Judges?) reading about a mob which surrounds this guy's house and busts on the door, so the owner of the house throws his daughter out there to pacify them and  they rape her until she's dead . Then the owner the next morning, in protest,  chops her up into several pieces  and sents one piece to each of the Tribes of israel. So they are all understandablely miffed about it and grab their swords and slay everyone (disemboulment anyone?) in the town and burn the whole place down destruction style. Plugged In would condemn this story if it were not already in Biblical context.  How about Song of Solomon? The book is sexually explicit. It does not talk about procreation and obeying the first commandment given (go forth and multiply), it simply talks about the enjoyment factor of sex and pining for it with your partner.  The Psalms are full of conflict, hardship and prayers for protection and that God would strike down and annihilate enemies. Job mourns for who knows how long over what has already past (he is a HUMAN), and every person (aside from Jesus) in the Bible disobeys God time and time again. If I were to review this all "Plugged In" style I would say this:  Pro-social Content: Shows nature of God, explains salvation and identifies love as very importent. Several stories which inspire insight and perserverence.  Objectible Content: Innumerable sins including: murder, rape, genocide wrought by the armies of God, hate for God, sexual inmorality of every fashion (beastiality, orgies and homosexual) disobedience, slavery, the breaking of every commandment, pillaging, tortures and general displays of the carnal depravity of mankind. Strung with universal conflicts needing a solution humanity fails to use to be resolved. Several references to Satan himself and Satanism, witchcraft, demonic occurances of several types, necromancy and the summoning of spirits and the dead by God-fearing men.   Conclusion: A very mixed bag. Not suggested for the children of the family or anyone sensitive to change or uncomfortable material.    My point here is that its not the material which has the influence, its how you assess it and how you "plug it" into what you already know. Reading a book on Nazi rhetoric can either strengthen what you already believe about God or bend you in another direction, depending on  who you already  are. Likewise CS Lewis could have the same two affects on an Athiest.  Hence, there are people out there who should not expose themselves to certain things if they are easily seduced and/or lose control. God knows your weaknesses, so  its very wise to follow your personal convictions , but to draw a line between black and white on what material is always good and always evil is foolish.  Consider an Axe. It is a neutral object. You can use it to make firewood with and stay warm, or you could murder someone with it. Either way, the axe is just an axe. The sin or goodness is born and carried out in the person, and no two people are exactly the same.  Some material causes the same God-seperating reaction in all people, and therefor God has told everyone to not partake as it is harmful. Pornography for example, although the boundries for what is pornographic and what is not is mostly determined by the society you grow up in. Our standards should be more oriented on Biblical Standards and less on the generic cliche's of what our society has deemed wrong for itself.   Why is "shit" offensive when the word "poo poo" makes people giggle. There is NO difference between them and what they mean besides what people have been told is more-wrong. Intercourse/"making love" is a respectful term for sex, while f***ing implies exactly the same thing and makes cetain people gasp. A dork is short for:  "Slang. A stupid, inept, or foolish person: the stupid antics of America's favorite teen-age cartoon dorks (Joshua Mooney). Vulgar Slang. The penis."  Dork then is in actaulity a hateful vulgar word. Follow the rules and what-have-you, but realize its all the same whether you excuse it or not, the difference is whether or not you choose to be offended- or whether you examine the actual attitude and intention behind the person communicating it.   Anger is anger, whether or not you cuss someone out with big words or little ones. Saying a mere "Good Heavens" by using logic dilutes the reverence behind the holy institution of God's throne. With the same logic you can see why words which represent sex, another holy institution, are all one and the same, but realize the words have nothing to do with it- its the use of them. Some words have become interchangable with certain uses of the meaning, which is unfortunate in my opinion because it makes things more complex then they need to be.   This all is why I think God cares more about the condition of your heart then the motions you choose to go through. The rough edges get smoothened out if you want them to anyway.    Point C: They are uninformed and pre-judgemental   Below is what this author says about The Colour and the Shape. Following that is what I see it as.  'Whining self-destructiveness and misery dominate "My Poor Brain." On "Everlong," the artist is invited to "waste away" with a woman of questionable sanity. Though  vague , "Monkey Wrench"  could be interpreted  as the frustrations of a teen whose parents refuse to accept his homosexuality.'  So Dave Grohl's best friend commits suiscide, he moves halfway across the country, his wife later leaves him and he doesn't know Jesus and he's not allowed to have one "miserable" song on the album? Job got pretty miserable for awhile too, blame the fall of mankind for misery, not Dave Grohl. It happens to everyone. The song even states "Sometimes I wish that I could change/I can't save you from my poor brain". It's about past baggage hindering his relations with people.  Everlong is a love song which uses the joy making music with someone to describe the emotional aspects of the exchanges that go on during a relationship. You can interpret "waste away" in any way you want to drive a point across; thats ultimately up to the listener (or reader, the the reviewers case). I personally see it as living to the end of his life. Assuming it is sex, I imagine he was writing it about his  WIFE  of the time, which never was a bad thing. And nowhere is her sanity mentioned, unless he's just suggesting she'd have to be half crazy to go for Dave.  Dave Grohl said in an interview I read Monkey Wrench was about a dysfuctional relationship. Maybe Dave's lieing, but either way I after reading back through the lyrics the only connection I can make between the song and homosexuals is when he says "one in ten" which this reviewer probably assumed refers to the incorrect statistic of 1 in 10 men being gay. That is like taking a single scripture and building your own cult, it doesn't work as its incongruent with the rest of the song, its a real stretch.   Assuming he is correct (which he is not), I do not see how the conflicts and confusion around the issue of homosexuality is an illegitimate frustration, moreover why the topic itself is objectible when this song neither justifies it or condemns it (probably because thats not what its about).  On another album they place two songs under "Objectible Content", Halo and Come Back. The Chorus of Halo is "Halo/God only knows/right behind me everywhere I go". I like this song, because it reminds me of the spiritual protection God gives and it's apparent even to a non-Christian. They dismiss this song because of an f word used in the context of "messing up".  ------- halo God only knows right behind me everywhere I go  say your prayers when you get scared you pray you're gonna make it and then when you're done you keep f****** up (everyone has done this) one day soon I'll disappear (die) and if you'll come I'll take you somewhere to go  to keep from growing old (Heaven) disappear the light is breaking disappear outside their range disappear I'm tired of waiting disappear before we fade away (Death) -------  That is their decision. In "Come Back" I think Dave's talking about not giving up on someone.  ------- moving again comfort of the chase (keeping busy with purpose is comforting) now and again this my saving grace (purpose is a grace of God) dead on the inside I've got nothing to prove (I see this as being dead to one's own desires and giving up pride) keep me alive and give me something to lose (thanking God for life but realizing the temperal state it is, concerning materialism) goodbye this time I'm leaving you I've been gone so long so gone so long but I will come back changes changing back and forth again trading places strangers in the end I will come back for you --------  You could interpret the last part of the song however you wish. The reveiwers did not even try. It could make you think of Christ returning, it could make you think of returning to Christ, it could make you think of anything you associate it with, but for me it makes me think of not giving up on someone no matter what has happened or will happen.    Point D: They are uninformitive.   Calling it a review of music would be incorrect, as nowhere in any review I've read do they specifically address the music itself. They address the lyrics, period stop. Sometimes you'll find the word "edgy" or "upbeat", but thats less then you'll get from the guy standing at the counter in Wal-Mart. I'm not even convinced that these people are required to listen to the music, if they are they don't mention it... and since half the meaning of music is translated through the INSTRUMENTS these reviews do not give you the whole value of what is being discussed.   Any authority that would call  Smashmouth  a varient of  Punk  is hardly an authority at all in my opinion. They also suggest Creed's "Weathered" as "a good mainstream alternative to the likes of Korn, Staind and Drowning Pool." I apologize, but thats like telling a Cannible Corpse fan to listen to Kenny G, they are nowhere near like each other.  Whatever the case the reviews are literalists, which does not mix well with music unless you listen to Pop or Country. Which is amusing, because those two genre's fair the best. Aaron Carter sings about doing his chores, and he gets a good score. When they are not sure what to think, they tend to give leniency to whom they so choose.    The Conclusion of MY Review   Not only is it unbiblical to expect a corrupted world to live up to the higher standard without the aid or reason or motivation of a personal relationship with God, but it is also ungraceful. It is even more strange to condemn the fruits of this world and seek alienation, as I believe God is capible of supplying wisdom and insight through anything- esspecially the places we must live in and interact with. I believe that understanding these people, which by the definition of the world are more normal by human standards, does not mean you also have to agree with them and/or condone their behavior and/or sacrifice a goat in your backyard.  And I also don't like Plugged In.  The End.   Hey, that was a long post. -------------------------------------------- "There is no man that ever ate, no man that was ever born, no joyous son of king or queen, for whose sake I would do you harm" - the Tain, pre-roman celtic ballad

It was a 7 hour drive to get to my grandparent's farm. We had to wake up a 4:30 in the morning. Then we drove out to a field where we were debriefed, but honestly I have no idea what was said. It sounded something like this.  "So you two gotta walk the third to the second yonder draw over past the drag fence up there, but don't cross the adjacent fence which flies down on the opposite ridge, cause McWagoner's already cut the double flip-flop and we're hoping the herd is north by west-south. Thats why Kent here is circling back when the ball drops, if that happens you'll have to tell us because I'll be gunning the rig back to and forth along the gully-line and Jackson's creek. So the whole point is to re-align the fee-fi-fo-fum, to catch the overflow and head'm off with a box-in and if need be a second banger-rang. Just don't forget the banger-rang."  I decided that all concludes to "Go stand on a hill, and if you see a deer you should either shoot it or not shoot it, depending."  So me and my Dad spotted all these deer, but we couldn't tell anyone cause the radio went of range. So we didn't shoot them, and they ended up going over our "draw" further down where Ed was. And then we shot them. We stood around and shot deer... we really didn't even have to move that much. There were no line of sight obstructions besides the hills, the deer didn't really stand a chance because I saw groups of hunters on every hill for miles around.  We had 8 tags, and ended up with 9 deer by 9am which I guess is phenominal and never happens. But I was still sorta bored. I had fun because it was all new, but if I went again that wouldn't really happen cause I guess most hunting trips are just walking around for a long time... which is almost as boring as standing around.  I told my Dad that I didn't understand the challenge behind the hunting, because putting a scope on a deer and pressing a trigger is really easy, and the only way you find them in the first place is half by luck. He talked about how men have always hunted and such, but I wasn't buying it cause men haven't always had high powered scoped semi automatic 7.62mm rifles, and 2 ton Ford Trucks to carry the dead stuff and the night-vision goggles and the anti-phermone spray to cover your scent.   If I go next year I might as well just bring some hand grenades, and maybe a launcher for them. That way you could get dozens of deer at once right over the hill. I mean, its not like anyone really even needs the meat anyway you know?   Or even better, just put a lazer on a satillite and hit them from orbit. Enough of the line-of-sight crap! Just set up a laptop out there with a little portible dish and look for heat signitures. Then you could charter a helocopter to go pick up the carcuses, and they'd already be cooked for Ma.  So anyway, to avoid the hunting regulator people since we had a deer with no tag, we drove back through the hills cross country style and it took us an hour. Thats bumpy stuff to, since of all cars 4x4 trucks for some reason have the worst suspension (IT MAKES NO SENSE).     ---------------------------------- "I heard if you play a Window's 98 CD backwards, it says satanic messages.. thats nothing, if you play it forwards it installs Windows." - some guy somewhere that once said it  notes: Eric is starting a movie review segment of the site, since he's great at that... annndd James is helping me with thumbnails for the pics.

      I'm reposting this song because its beautiful and honest... its kind've one of those deprivation type things.  Crooked Fingers: Under Sad Stars  Set me on fire white liquor girl Come burning down my throat pristine and pure We have been slaving all day long Among these neon lit half slums Toasting our false hurray The late night favors drinking itself numb  Come out tonight white liquor girl One million stars can't heat such a cold cold world One million distant vacant lights All glaring down on you tonight Lighting a distant vacant sky One million distant vacant lies  Under sad stars in dingy bars We turn away we tear apart One drop of grace distant and safe They cannot touch you where you are Cold shafts of rain falling dark gray Falling so far they can't be saved They cannot hurt you anymore Here underneath these sad sad stars  So turn out the light white liquor girl One shot could set you free from your troubled coil You have been burning bright in vain Here underneath the sad sad rain Painting the town as black as sin Begging to get done wrong again  Under sad stars in dingy bars We turn away we tear apart One drop of grace distant and safe They cannot touch you where you are Cold shafts of rain falling dark gray Falling so far they can't be saved They cannot hurt you anymore Here underneath these sad sad stars  Under sad stars in dingy bars We turn away we tear apart One drop of grace distant and safe They cannot touch you where you are Cold shafts of rain falling dark gray Falling so far they can't be saved They cannot hurt you anymore Here underneath these sad sad stars  Copyright © 2000 Red Pig Publishing

      The mall.  A capitolistic whore house established to facilitate the sick materialistic lusts of a nation who's only shared pasttime is the consumption of unneeded wealth to the means of pacifying their immediate selfish pleasures. Knowing this, and contributing to the system makes me even more of a bastard, I admit it. I went Christmas shopping yesterday with Eric.   Going into those places, seeing the glitter in a child's eyes as he handles *insert random fad toy* discusts me to no end.  I want to rip it out of his hands and scream "IT WON'T MAKE YOU HAPPY" until either he starts crying or his mother intervines. Likewise, watching teenage girls browse through aisle after aisle of the latest slutty trends leaves me in a stumper as I wonder if they ever question "who" is telling them that its "cool"... HELLO? The very companies which are making the profuct zibberscone-sauce heads!  When will the masses take control of this twisted manipulating funhouse known as capitolism and realize that slaving away your whole life to reach the top of the pay ladder leaves you with nothing but a life behind you of sacrificed opertunities, comfort and personal health all given in the name of some pie-in-the-sky retirement fund when we can all fineally "relax".   If quality of life is an interchangable term for convienence, then America gets the trophy. But its a deceitful trophy; the shiney iridecent shell merely a mask for the rotting wormwood which comprises the core of this wonderous prize. A prize of fools, as the very forces which drive this system buy into the same set of false values as the ones they are manipulating. Success has what to do with money? Nothing. Money is a tool of influence, it defines noone who has it. It only means they have it, how they aquired it and what they use it for is a much more relevent issue... an issue which sheds more light into who you are rather then what you have, an issue which lost it's battle as soon as the term " consumer economy " became an acceptible banner to fly under.  -----------------------------------------------------------  con·sum·er    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (kn-smr) n.  One that consumes, especially one that acquires goods or services for direct use or ownership rather than for resale or use in production and manufacturing.   A heterotrophic organism that ingests other organisms or organic matter in a food chain.    what does heterotrophic mean?   het·er·o·troph     ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (htr--trf, -trf) n.   An organism that cannot synthesize its own food and is dependent on complex organic substances for nutrition.    We look to society to give us our food, and it tells us we need money. Money never was nutrition, its the longest running joke on the planet. When I have children, I am going to buy a cabin in the middle of colorado and live out there until they are around 20 years old. I will tell them that we are the only people on earth, that there used to be countries and things but everyone else died. This will allow me to mold them to me exacting standards...  Of course, they will be encouraged to attend college when they become of age, and I know a liberal arts education will undo alot of what I had taught them. Either that or they would reject everything they were being taught... Well, it'd be interesting either way.  Ironically, I am leaving now to go entertain myself with Counter-stike... despite my editorial up there.... hey, I said I was a bastard.

      When I'm at work, my mind wanders. I'll think about school, perhaps a little bit of what I saw on the news, my agenda and such. Somehow, I always come back to me staging my own murder.  When I take out the trash the door is usually left open, so thats where the guy would slip in. I figure out where he would hide and such. Sometimes I think I'm more likely to get cornered outside, but then I have to ask myself what would I do? I decided running to the gas station would be the easy thing to think of, but im not a great runner due to...  muscle contracture . Or I could try to lock myself in my car, which is always near... since I lock it though (to prevent people from hiding in the backseat while im gone) it would take some pretty calm and agile hands to get in AND lock it before I'm dead. And then there's all those scenes from various movies where the helpless girl fumbles with her keys while the killer slowly moves in.  Reguardless, if the guy got into the building I'd be screwed. I wouldn't hear him because of the loud music. He'd wait till the vacuuming part, then come up behind me and do one of those killing things where I die. Thats not the scarey part though, cause then the CSI come in. I'm most afraid of them putting chemicals on everything and examining the carpet and realizing that I actaully suck at my job, that there was still dust everywhere and stuff, and it would all go into the police report. Then after examining my body they'd know that I hadn't brushed my teeth that morning. They'd know who's food I'd been eating off the desks, and that I walk funny and don't follow my own budget and have never been in love. Then they would drop the case, and it would all be in a report that my parents would not be allowed to see. So maybe there is a happy ending.  Now im going to work TWICE a week. See? Now I go on wedsdays to vacuum and again and check the trash. I think thats cool. It'll increase my revenue by about 30%.  Next quarter im taking intro to poetry, piano 101, and soc 101. I'm happy with it. I can't decide if I should get a part-time job though... it would be in retail, and I would kick arse at it, but then there's the question of the precious time I'd loose, the time I'm waiting to do something great with. I'm not sure if working qualifies as great. I'd get money, but since I'd be working how would I enjoy having money? Clearly the better option is to have free time  and  money, so if anyone has figured out how that works tell me asap. Wellfare doesn't count.  Lately I've wished this blog wasn't so public, so I could talk about really interesting things. It used to have that compacity. I look at blogs like  Christmas in July  and swoon with envy. As is now though, I get almost 1000 hits a month... most of which I don't know.   words fail  oblivious to the mirrors she's got for every angle you counter it with the sense of confidence you've bottled but when it all comes down when it all pans out there ain't nothing to be found through her there ain't nothing but the chance I missed the chance I can't repeat every song I sing that I can't complete there are somethings to be said, that are never I confess I confess I've been remiss I've been  too depressed to make myself this obvious cause when its all layed down when it all pans out the me you see for me is only face deep so words fail they've been tossed around sunk like empty freighters run aground and chained to every future remembrance

       Okay, I just got back from doing my jogging with Herman and my Dad. I like running now, you know? It feels good all over; as opposed to feeling horrid all over, which is what it felt like for the first few weeks. On monday, Herman told me something along the lines of "If you sprint all the way back (from halfway) then I'll give you a special suprise!"   I thought to myself, gee, self, you love suprises AND special things. So I ran all the way back, and today when I tried to redeem my special suprise, he told me it was the "joy of running" and that now we could start the running sooner, i.e shorten the warmup part. Wow. Thank you Herman, you fabricating crizznatch.   Speaking on the topic of general health, I've been starting to do all kinds of funshine healthy type things, not even knowingly, in the last month or so!. (sidenote: to breanna and chrystal... now that your gone, I can walk around in my underwear again. mom and dad are so used to it they don't mention even when I ask) I borrowed this tape on visualizations from Elizibeth, one of my dad's psychologist worker people, and aside from visualizing it also talks about funshine BRAIN facts. OoOOOOoOo! I want to share this joy with you now. It's a Herman joy.  This is my summary of my collective knowlage of the brain, some of it is deducted so bear with me.   Interesting Thing A   Your brain is oriented in one of three ways:   visual : most people are visual thinkers, oriented around sight.   kinesthetic : touch has the largest impact, most athletes are this way. People who like to hug alot. remember textures and such.   auditory : think in sound and thought, alot of musicians are this way.  There are more catagories, depending on what system you use. Bre told me there are seperate ones that catagorize how you learn, they are different but very simular. All they do in my opinion is expand on the 3 mentioned above, which as they are still apply to learning as well.   When I say oriented I mean its your crutch. For me, when remember things I hear them before I feel them. When I describe things to people I always go back to the way they sound. When I write fiction, ambience is the easiest and most affective sense I use when illustrating things. Of everything, music sways my emotions the most. Last night in the car, during the climax of a song I gots chills down my entire spine.  You can use more then one though. I use two very heavily when I really think about it, but I don't think anyone is naturally great at all three.  I'm also a visual. When I took a bunch of intelligence tests (legit ones, not internet ones) I scored highest in the visual-spacial areas. That makes sense. I'm always drawing infinate lines off of surfaces and seeing where they cross, noticing patterns in shapes and placement, have an odd sense for color congruency and can rotate 3 dimensional objects in my head. I'm also good at proportional type stuff and depth. I learn really well through visual too; i,e last night, with Jen. She was showing me music theory and I had to picture the fret board of a guitar. It's easy for me to make sense of WHY theory works when I use it to find patterns in the lines and dots of where the strings meet the frets. Then I had to draw it out, and the connection I was trying to make made sense.  I think I started out as a visual, but during school I had to develop my audio because during class I couldn't see the board for four years. That combined with getting into music eventaully triggered me to use my audio alot.  You use all of these, you just depend on one or sometimes two more then the other(s). When you visualize though, you need to use all of them at once, and its great for your brain. The more senses you engage at any given time the denser the wiring in your brain gets (the axons) and the more complex connections your brain creates between cells. In studies, the better problem solvers were the ones with denser wiring. They could solve more complex problems while using less energy.   Interesting Thing B   Now, you also prefer a side of your brain. Its common knowlage. (The sentence that went here was wrong.)  The left brain = linear, logical, verbal. relies on intellectualness. It's about intelligence. Reading, writing, math.  The right brain = musical, creative, non-verbal, patterns, big picture, emotional. non logical but generally accurate. It's about intuition and wisdom and the like.  I notice society labels the right side of the brain as being your "heart". However, our society is focused mainly on the left side of the brain, or the "head" (head vs heart). School really messes little kids up. Thats what I think. Every subject in school demands left brain action, so kids as they grow weak right brain functions like imagination, empathy and the most importent communiction skill of all: that of the non-verbal. I think that the reason that alot of later labelled geniuses do horrible in school is because they don't sacrifice their right brain.   Einstien's parents thought he was retarded. He later ended up succeeding because he learned to use both, first the right side then the left. His ideas were all  very big picture  ideas he later used logic to prove. It boggles me that science is so associated with the left side of the brain when the progress part happens almost exclusively through a combonation of right and left brain thinking.  The moment you decide to live entirely through your left brain your also deciding to be incorrect, esspecially in science as it's always being revised and changed.   Interesting Thing C   Visualization exercises the right part of your brain, which is a good thing. When you visualize your nervious system switches from sympathetic (ready to trigger fight or flight) to parasympathetic operation, which tends to be more creative. This is because the sympathetic lies in the beta range (of brain waves) while the parasympathetic lies just below that in the alpha range.  beta: alert - high frequency -  alpha: calm - high ampitude theta: profound, dream state, visions - high frequency and ampitude - the subconcious delta: sleep state, regeneration  Beta is where most of us are most of the time. Any time your nervious, any time your body is tense, any time you have anxiety. Meditators usually put themselves in alpha, your brain can handle more powerful thoughts, just not as quickly. Visualization occurs on a borderline alpha/theta state. Hypnosis is entirely in the theta.   When you visualize it puts your brain down into alpha. It won't happen very quickly at first, its something your brain has to exercise. In my college success class a tip that applies for almost everything is to keep yourself relaxed, in class, on tests and during homework. Thats because you recall and memorize things more easily, as well as have more complex thoughts. The opposite to that would be freezing up mentally during a presentation. Fight or flight works well in the jungle, but not in soceity. Not unless you live in New York.  Borderlining theta, which is where the subconcious lies, is where visualizing works the best. The subconcious cannot tell the difference between what you imagine and reality. This makes sense to me, because I often have childhood memories which actually were dreams I had at the time. This is why visualizing works.   Hypnotism occurs in the Theta, and it is unreliable because you have no reality filters. The hypnotist can suggest things that will become memories in whoever's hypnotized through the uber power of imagination or visualization or whatever.  In Psychology we talked about how if a person can imagine themself doing something, then they are definately capible of it. Visualization works kind of in the same way, execpt when its optimized its working around the theta level. So far for me this has only worked as a motivation technique, because I tell myself I like studying and I now I do. I don't expect anyone to be impressed by that, but the results are mostly long term. There are numerous examples on the tape I listened to, he talked alot about athletes and how they visualize making baskets or running faster, and also about guys like Nikola Tesla, and about how he invented the electric motor through visualizing over a period of 3 months, before building it. His first model surpassed prototype standards.  Visualizing is basically a way to bypass the beta/left brain limitations you place on yourself by injecting whatever you want into your sub-concious and altering things from the inside out.  Alot of people already practice this and don't even know it.  For instance, in my junior year of highschool during algebra, I'd place my head on my desk and picture this Donkey in an old style show suit doing a tap dance on all fours to some 20ies motion picture style piano. He had a top hat on too. I visualized everything from the courseness of his hair to the colors and the lights and the sound of the audience. At the end he'd flap his lip a little and go "Shibbity!" It served no real purpose besides putting me in a good mood and getting relaxed. I'm not sure if that really counts as an example.. but its still visualization, as long as you engage all your senses.   Conclusion: visualization = good   "Every authority that is not confirmed by true reason seems to be weak, whereas true reason does not need to be supported by any authority." - John Scotus Eriugena, 8th century

       Well I'll tell you all whats up with me- but it won't thrill you, and it certainly won't chill you. The chills will have to wait... Although don't wait too long, because they may never come, and on your deathbed you will curse my children. I the children I will have eventaully. Okay, I can't promise that will happen either... and now its time to shut up.   The party went pretty well. Eric told people to show up at 6, and so naturally since EVERYONE wants to be fashionablely late noone showed up until 8ish. We played Mafia for awhile, and that was fun too, cause we had some actual good games which is never garrenteed to happen.   My parents were gone most of the week. I really don't mind being alone anymore... before when I didn't talk to people for days at a time, I'd become depressed. Lately though, im just good to go for funness 24/7 and happy to be alive... However, my Dad told me that whenever my mother asks me if I missed her, the default answer is YES; but when I'm cutting apples in the kitchen at 4am wearing nothing but socks and a scarf, its hard to say that other people would be an improvement to my sitch. Reguardless, I shouldn't take time to think about it when she expects an immediate answer.   JAMES YOU MOTHER OF A CRIZZNATCH!!! I can't believe you went to Valve headquarters!! I've been reading about that shiz since the begining of forever and stuff! why can' *I* be a witness to illegal software exposure... on the other hand... what kinda sites you been digging through lately JAmes? eh?! AYE?! haxor sites!! that what I'd guess... so take your reward, but remember the people like me who DON'T use google to find what their looking for.   I'm starting on my project for my college success class.. its called "Sleep: Every Student's Battle". It'll include stuff I pull out of psychology journals as well as detailed illustrations (a picture of sleepy time bear + a GI Joe = Sleep) all to demonstrate why sleep is so importent. I'm going to draw connections from the benefits of good sleep to everything from a healthy libito to the lifespan of the oil filters in your car. Sleep is where its at... which is ironic because its what I should be doing right now as opposed to this journal. I'll end this journal, because I want to sleep... but to be truthful, I know in the back of my mind that I will end up playing Master of Orion 3 for at least another hour. mm. The more I think about it the qwiker I wantto endthisjournalokbye.  "You sit on a throne of lies!" -Elf (Will Ferrel to dress up Santa Clause)

      "Irate Marylander shoots his roommates' console, but the 9mm round fails to penetrate its casing. When called to investigate a shooting last Friday night, police in Anne Arundel County, Maryland found an unlikely culprit--an Xbox.   The Baltimore Sun reports that 34-year old Robert Preston Kersey had grown enraged by his roommates constantly playing their Xbox at high volume. According to the police report, Kersey emerged from his bedroom at 2 a.m. brandishing an automatic pistol. Rather than shoot his roommates, Kersey took aim at the offending Xbox and fired a single shot at the console. While the bullet's impact disabled the Xbox, its thick plastic casing deflected the 9mm round, which ricocheted away harmlessly. Other than the Xbox, no injuries resulted from the incident. Kersey was later booked on two counts of reckless endangerment and one count of destruction of property."

      Okay. Here's my paper on why sleep is importent to students. It's not funny, not charming really, but I put a few hours into it so have some decency and give it a read through.   Sleep: What they didn't want you to know  	Sleep is a topic which pans out to be more controversial then any of us would like to believe; however that is precisely what I plan to discuss. This paper will cover all aspects of sleep which I deem important for the student to know, primarily its importance to school through the effects of sleep deficit, societys attitude toward sleep; the misconceptions and false assertions as well as the connotations these imply. Most importantly, Ill discuss ideas to help change your sleeping habits if you feel touched by the information Im providing, followed by my own reaction.  	Amongst the priorities accentuated by society, sleep as one is almost non-existent. With the integration of electric lighting and the progression of the twenty-four hour society, our biological cues for rest are often offset by a constant barrage of stimuli. Traditionally productivity was only practical in the daylight, hence providing a natural barrier for our bodys to align to. The recent availability of round-the-clock services and entertainment combined with the increasing value and desire for time however has changed this, more then ever discipline is required to meet the demands our bodys face us with. This is true of relaxation and nutrition, but I speak namely of sleep. The irony here lies in that while trying to attain the highest standard of industriousness, society as a whole has sacrificed the importance of sleep- thereby hindering the potency and effectiveness of that productivity.  	 This reality has manifested itself in tragic ways. Such disasters as the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion and the Exxon-Valdez oil-spill have been attributed to sleep loss, as well as the near melt-down of the 3 Mile Island nuclear reactor. On sleep related accidents the American Psychological Association states: 	 The NCSDR estimated that the total societal costs- including such indirect economic costs as loss of productivity resulting from disability or premature demise- might be 10-fold greater, approximately 150 billion. A recent publication (Leger, 1994) provided detailed calculations of the total costs of accidents owing to the basis of 1988 statistics. Legers conclusion was the economic impact of sleepiness-related accidents in the United States during 1988 was between $43.15 and $56.02 billion. (Carskadon and Taylor, 1997)	  	Pressman and Orr state that on average, one hundred people die on the road every day across America due to sleepiness related accidents. The results of a sleep study (Hirshkowitz, Moore, and Minhoto, 1997) showed that, while compensating for disease and age, people who generally got less then 6 hours of sleep or more then 9 hours per night suffered a 30% higher death rate then those who slept a normal 7-8 hours a night. The same was true even for people claiming to have no health problems.  	The monetary cost on society is apparent, but to understand why this occurs, or moreover, how sleep loss directly affects you and the way you live your life (and therefor its impact on others), it would help to understand the changes your body undergoes while under a sleep debt. The most scientifically measurable alterations (Walsh and Lindblom, 1997) include changes in the autonomic nervous system; your body temperature drops, blood pH lowers, and blood pressure rises 25% in prolonged cases. A dropping respiratory rate parallels a lowered oxygen consumption, which hinders exercise. A shift in cerebral blood flow has been attributed to a shift in metabolism, this also alters the balance of hormone production which affect mood.   	The noticeable changes occur with mood and attitude, people suffering sleep loss are generally more fatigued physically and emotionally as well as lacking vigor. When deprived of REM sleep, numerous research shows a decline in concentration, creative problem solving ability and intellectually divergent thinking (Hirshkowitz et al., 1997). When this research was done in children, this translated into the symptoms of ADHD (Lippincott/Willians & Wilkins, 2003). Short-term to long-term memory transfer also suffers (Hirshkowitz et al., 1997), which may explain why sleep deprived subjects in another study had severe difficulty learning and executing new tasks when compared to normal sleepers. These all fit very poorly into school and work performance. Even more disturbing is the impairing effect it has on motor skills, coordination, reaction time and judgement. An international study on CNN.com found that sleep deprived drivers performed worse then drunk drivers on test courses. The same study states that 16-60% of road accidents involve sleep loss. Combine this with cell phone usage, food on the go, and the stress/anxiety/depression which often causes or is caused by sleep deprivation, and you have a dangerous road situation... especially in California, as they dont follow the law anyway.  	These impairments seriously detriment any task which requires an amount of thought or interaction to carry out, for example, anything you do of importance during the day. Social interaction- your relationships, making a living, carrying out responsibility of any kind; feeding your animals, remembering errands, making appointments, there is no end to the list. School would be near the top, as your ability to learn and process information- especially in college, largely depends on your brains higher intellectual functions. The overwhelming majority of evidence has suggested that sleep serves as your bodys primary process for retaining new information. School is not the end of it though. A students lifestyle and schedule are typically chaotic in nature, often balancing work with school with family, apart from social and personal life. One could argue that sleep is the single most controllable factor for success which cements all these together, and often it is the first healthy habit to give way, perpetuating stress and an overall less than enjoyable quality of life. All of these can hinder performance in ones endeavors; be it school, relationships, career, or hobbies.  	Fixing sleep problems can be simple or extremely difficult. Many times conditioned sleep abnormalities exist long after the cause of their existence depart, leaving or creating separate health problems of their own (Spielman and Glovinsky, 1997). The problem could also be due to a sleeping disorder, which may include having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, waking up and or/ quality of sleep. The only true way to know would be to meet with a sleep specialist. Family MDs on average receive less then 2 hours of education regarding the diagnosis of sleep disorders as well as the medication of them (Carskadon and Taylor, 1997); they more often then not regard sleeping problems as symptoms of depression or anxiety, which may delay proper diagnosis as sleep disorders often exist independently and cause depression themselves. This is due to a lack of information carry-over of recent research about sleep into the widespread public eye and medical education. The National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research refers to this as a pervasive failure of knowledge transfer (Carskadon et al., 1997). For the purposes of keeping this paper concise and effective, the information Ive acquired regarding the self-assessment and behavior modification techniques for sleep related issues will be distributed in the form of handouts to the class.  	The above information would have helped me immensely had I been so well informed during highschool, where many of my classmates and I suffered from chronic sleep deprivation throughout the greater duration of the years. The act of staying up to complete homework was often regarded as noble by our teachers, who remained as ignorant to the real life ramifications of sleep loss as the students themselves. It bothers me that the school system has not taken serious measures to address sleep loss via the education of school staff and students, because whether due from poor time management or poor habit, it is a silent killer among students who often become burned out from the inability to cope with multiple assignments. When one considers the similarities between a sleep deprived person and drunkenness, one has to wonder why the school system doesnt aware itself to these problems but has policies against students coming to class drunk. A projection by the NCSDR (Carskadon et a., 1997) estimates by the year 2010 79 million Americans will be affected by sleeping problems. Age- like cancer- is a major factor in determining ones susceptibility to sleep problems. If the current generation proceeds with present sleep habits, I would imagine this number to mushroom as time goes on. It is my assertion that social education on sleep would be extremely beneficial in the national health interest, as it stems to all tiers and facets of society. I hope this knowledge will help the students of this class.   Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. - Ben Franklin   Here are my references... because they took just as long to format as it took to write the paper in the first place      References       	Staff and Wire Reports, (2000).

Reaching for an oversized chrome spoon, he gathers an intimate quantity of dried muffin reminants, and brushing his scapular aside proceeds to dump these inside of his shirt.  He turns to us and speaks...  " Some people like cupcakes better ...   I  for one care less for them ."  Arragantly twisting the sterile canvas snoot of a fulling charged icing annointment utensil, he puts forth a quarter ounce green rosette near the summit of a dance but radiant muffin of his own design.  Later he says...  " Some people...  some  people like cupcakes exclusively while myself, I say there is not, nor ought there, be nothing so exalted on the face of God's great earth, as that prince of foods...  the  Muffin  "  **drums enter**  Earl, you thought he was a man but he was a muffin! He hung around till he found that he didn't know nothing Earl, you thought he was a man but he only was a muffin! You guys are weirder in the night as a result of him snuffin!  **blazing guitar solo**

        You, my friend are a true individual. You most likely hate trends and are creative. By seeing things differently, people either admire you or think you are a bit strange. I'm guessing you are a lot like me. Perhaps a Good Charlotte hater? I hope so. An inspiration to us all, continue being you! (If you like GC, I'm sorry, I am just expressing an opinion)    urlLink   A Deeper Look Inside Yourself (with pics)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     this person is crazy off the hizzle... I actaully DO dislike Good Charlotte!!!

      im really lazy. im SO lazy in fact, that im going to let this coinicidental converation do all the work for me during this post. Hmm... copy... and.. paste! whew!  RainingDownBlue: how was the beach? res0nation: approvable RainingDownBlue: that's nice res0nation: it was rock-awesome RainingDownBlue: who all went? res0nation: joe asbridge, joe broders, eric, josh moore, corey moore, daniel, josh wakemen and brandon and me RainingDownBlue: cool RainingDownBlue: man fest res0nation: yes. res0nation: I played axis and allies on friday res0nation: from 1 pm res0nation: to 7am RainingDownBlue: gosh res0nation: it was pretty intense RainingDownBlue: i am gettin that res0nation: you know who people truely are when you are driven to the frayed ends of maddness RainingDownBlue: hm res0nation: under those conditions res0nation: it was obvious who were friends, and who were little bastards RainingDownBlue: uh huh res0nation: whiney little people who blame everything on the dive res0nation: *dice res0nation: rather then give people named dave an ounce of intellectual credit OR merely cease to snivel long enough for me to complete my fricken turn RainingDownBlue: lol RainingDownBlue: i'm sorry, dav-id res0nation: don't be res0nation: I drove them into the ground RainingDownBlue: oh you heartless bastard! res0nation: 18 hours of their lives wasted because they would not learn from their mistakes res0nation: rather then adapt their tactics, they would blame helpless circumstance res0nation: when the UK launches a beach landing on Japan, you know things are out of hand RainingDownBlue: hm res0nation: no amount of dice rolls could cause something that perverted to happen res0nation: thats pure genius at work RainingDownBlue: i guess so RainingDownBlue: wow  there you go folks a snippet of my beach trip. there are other moments in which we all find ourselves just meditating on how ingenius we are. one such moment manifested itself when Eric came running up the stairs like a giddy little woman, barely containing his glee. he hopped off each foot and clapped his hands near his face to hide his secretive joy. he then whispered "we are taking all the marshmellows out of joe's lucky charms!!" and tryed to hide his giggless by shoving them to the deep parts of his throat. Joe was in the next room. they put all of his marshmellows into a zip lock bag and hid it in secret place.   this is ironic due to the fact that joe was earlier commenting on the cereal to marshmellow ratio, and how it favored those little sugar covered pieces of sugar, rather then the fluffed dyed sugar which is SO much better.  so when joe found them, he drew a picture of a hand sticking its middle finger out and replaced it with the zip lock bag. Later on, Eric and the other Joe found an insulting suprise when they checked on their project. That friends... is genius

       I'm not dead or anything, I just haven't updated. Mainly because I haven't felt like it. I try not to stress over things, esspecially things that are optional and that I don't *need* to do. I updated the links, but nobody usually notices when I do that. I did type one update, but internet explorer crashed and I wasn't about to type the whole thing up all over again.  I went on the vacation thing, but it wasn't a cruise, it was an island with a resort on it. I relaxed alot. I took sailboat lessons... and went on a nature thing with my sister and dad. Overall, the place was a ripoff. I found the small things were better then the resort itself. Buying pop tarts was one of the many highlights of the trip. I never get pop tarts. Maybe because they really don't taste that great once you actaully eat them.. but just the fact that I went and did something unusual makes me feel warm inside. I wrote on my book and played Final Fantasy Tactics alot. I hung with my cousins. I think overall though, the best part of the trip was getting back home. That was the most exciting part.  I'm going to the beach this weekend with some friends of mine. You know who you all are.  Okay, bye bye.

      I am so totally utterly stoked. This morning I got a phonecall from CAM, my old high school. They want me to be a JUDGE in a BEAUTY CONTEST.   Yes.  So I gave them my demands. A complimentry breakfast pastry. They agreed. I've been thinking about some good questions to ask all day.   Amoung them: "Theoretical situation. A mad scientist captures you and your favorite sibling. He puts each of you in a seperate room with a button in each room. If you push the button you will die, but your sibling will live. If, unbeknowst to you, your sibling pushes the button he/she will die but you will live. If you both push the buttons, you both will die. If neither of you push the button, you will both die. What do you do?"   "Everyone has that quiet place they go to in their mind. Mine is a Dojo, high in the mountians. Where is your quiet place? What does it smell like? what does it sound like?"  And most trickily: "Theoretically, if I gave you my number, would you call it?"  I cannot wait for this.

      Wow. Well today the INTERNATIONAL, SOCIETY, OF POETS contacted me about personally appearing in a CONVENTION, so recognize my poetic GENIUS.   Hmm. Slighty odd considering they've     NEVER SEEN MY FRICKEN POETRY      Dear David,  I'm sorry you will be unable to join us at the 2004 International Society of Poets' Spring Convention and Symposium at the Walt Disney World Resort--the largest and most prestigious poetry event ever held. As you know, you were selected to be honored at this event, and we were looking forward to your presenting your poetic artistry in front of the more than 2000 poets from over 50 countries who will be attending.  However, because we don't want you to miss out on this unique opportunity altogether, we have arranged a way for you and your poetic accomplishments to be a part of this event in a major way, without your actually being present. Although you will be unable to participate in the Convention contest (you must be present to win), you can receive all of the awards and benefits of ISP membership we have scheduled for you--including your custom engraved Outstanding Achievement in Poetry Silver Award Bowl (see it here), your bronze Commemorative Award Medallion, and your Full One Year Membership into the International Society of Poets for 2004--if you will allow us to present one of your poems at the convention in your place.  We have arranged for professional poetry readers to read your poem at this largest gathering of poets in history. Our readers will present your poem with imaginative style, so that your artistry receives the worldwide exposure and recognition that it deserves. Your poem will also be featured in printed form, proudly displayed in a special room at the convention that will be accessible to more than 2000 attending poets and guests.  And let me  tell you  a little about the  actual awards and membership benefits  that you will  receive by mail immediately after you confirm your participation  in this prestigious event  by submitting your poem :   -- Your Outstanding Achievement in Poetry Silver Award Bowl (a $200.00 value) is a magnificent work of art in itself that measures over 10 inches across and over 11 inches high. It is handcrafted in silver and has your name custom-engraved on a beautiful cherry-wood base. It is certain to enjoy a special place of pride in your home and will serve as a fitting symbol of your unique poetic artistry.   -- Your bronze Commemorative Award Medallion (a $40.00 value) is a deeply etched bronze medal brilliantly displayed on a 25 inch red, white and blue satin ribbon.   -- And your Full One Year Membership into the International Society of Poets for 2004 (a $60.00 value) entitles you to a personalized membership card, an ISP patch and decal, entry into special contests during the year, and a subscription to The Poet's Corner quarterly newsletter. Please note, if you are already an ISP member, your benefits will be extended an additional year.  David, all that's required for us to immediately send you all of these Awards is for you to submit a poem to be formally presented at the convention. Additionally, we must also ask you for the necessary funds ($169.00 plus p+h) to cover the costs of the time and effort required to present your poem before the convention attendees both aloud and in writing, as well as the costs incurred in insuring and shipping to you these extremely bulky and heavy awards via Federal Express.  David, we are, of course, ultimately most interested in meeting you and having you personally present your artistry in front of the thousands of other poets who attend these live events. Unfortunately, this is not to be the case at this time, so we're trying to do the next best thing. But we sincerely hope to personally present you with your most deserved awards in the future.  Sincerely, Steve Michaels Convention Awards Chairperson      wow!! my own special award, a 200 dollar value, can be MINE for only 170 dollars!!   YES!! THANK YOU GENEROUS GODDESS OF LUCK!! How can you give me an award for something you have not seen? Oh wait, your not giving it to me.. I'm PAYING for it with my own fricken money. Thank you so much.

       I had three dreams last night.  In the first one, I was at some kind of resort club. There were swimming pools everywhere, and a rocky beach, and people I knew, and we were all having fun.  Until *they* came.  The Navy Seals were onto us. They started coming in off the beach, I fortified my position in some bushes and started working my crazy magic with the shotgun I keep in my pocket. Things got worse from there, some Colonial English soldiers thought it would be cool to join the fray, which was more then okay with me because I had found a browning .50 calibur machine gun on a sidewalk. I remeber some other fragmented things, like me shooting a fat guy in the back, but esstentally I was the last man left and they were all looking for me, when 6 Stars started blinking at the top of my vision. Thats right ladies and gentlemen. I HAD FINEALLY REACHED 6 STARS. I've never been able to (in grand theft auto 3). But I was dead right after that, because they brought in those invisibal stalkers from balder's gate 1 & 2. I couldn't hit them fast enough.  In the second dream I actaully had a wife or girlfriend or something, and basically we were running from her mother. We were at her mother's house and she was INSANE. The obvious solution was just to kill her, but she had some kind of magnetic field around her body that deflected bullets. So it was this huge car chase, we were driving through all this country until we eventaully reached a huge city on the coast. We tried to hide there, but eventaully we had to ditch the car because the wife drove it through a restaurant. I remember us hiding in this dark alley and the mother was walking slowly down it looking back and forth for us. She was huge and ugly she was. And she had some other cybornetic abilities. She used mind control on the police we called. I remember we dailed 911 before we got to the city, and it was this long computerized list of "if you are going to die, press 1. If you have cut yourself, press 2.". But she used jedi mind control on the cops once they found us anyway.  In the third dream I was out in the wilderness. I had no weapons or anything. An EVIL man had CAPTURED Funshine Bear!!! He was using him in a long lost ritual to convert Carebears into torrents of epic power. He was waiting to sacrifice Funshine (who was sedated) to the Queen Wasp (who was only the size of a normal wasp).  The Queen Wasp had arrived when I tried to stop the man. He pulled out a hand gun and so I started running. There was alot of tall grass I could hide in, but he started following my trail. WELL, I double backed around a large group of bushes and made it back to where Funshine was. I grabbed him and started running for this hill, because the freeway was on the other side of it.

       D&D    I look to you, clutching your redbull like a potion of clairvoyence; Grabbing up the dice like tiny agate, only to drop them once more. Your eyes are piercing, as if to say "I have a backstab ability of x3"!  My sight is drawn across this table, A man draws steel and fells his blade; Thrusting it into a microwaved burrito. No Dagger of Harrowing by any means, but more then enough to "down" his foe.  I glance around the room and hear the Tolkin metal. Blind Guardian, the bards of present day. Someone is reading the rule book again, protesting the game master; who is a rogue in more ways then one.  Greasy Dwarven hair, Elfish constitution. The daylight knows none here.  How could anyone give this up for sex?   Copyright 2004, David Agnor  My latest work. I just added the middle stanza.

      While I'm at it...   Regrets of a Paladin    these walls stand to hold me the dice fall to slay me If only had I dexterity. Damn my lawful good alignment!  I am not fighter nor cleric but like the half elf, born between parents. Damn this THACO I dispise!  I have not spells till level 9! I hate this game's long term design! only curses my good intentions find. Damn the minimum Charisma of 17 requirement!  Damn my lawful good alignment! Damn this THACO I dispise! Damn the minimum Charisma of 17 requirement! And Damn this petty, 10 sided hit die.    I'm considering starting over as a ranger. Or a thief.

       By Dave   I wrote this poem.   What I did for Valentine's day    Thou hast leveled to level 11 deep in durlong's tower, a paladin fights for goodness across this cold world it could not be so, had I a girl  SLay the bastards! In a glory devine! 161,000 xp will soon be mine! I fight for love in these halls of peril A love I must myself deny  For women know not the ways of danger save, exept, that dual-weilding ranger she fights just as I.. and she is a girl. Though deep down inside, I know she's not real.  And all we are? Pixels in the wind... Pixels.. in the wind.. Dust.. on the screen    Thats not all I did on valentine's day though. I trimmed my armpit hair... I also massaged my scalp. My hair lady said I'm thinning on the top of my head. I know. I'm going bald. Whats next, prostate cancer? I'm not going to fight it. It's time to lye down and die. I had a good run. I mean, I've never been in love. It's hard to believe some people die as virgins, but you know, there is a peace in ignorance, there is a peace in not knowing what you missed.

       big fricken  suprise  ....     Your soul is bound to the  Solitary Rose : The Alone.   "When I wake up alone, the shades are still drawn on the cold window pane so they cast their lines on my bed and lines on my face."   The Solitary Rose is associated with loneliness, melancholy, and patience.  It is governed by the goddess Merope and its sign is The Sword, or Unrequited Love.  As a Solitary Rose, you may be summed up as a hopeless romantic.  You desire love and have so much love to give, but thing just never seem to work out the way you want them to.  In life, you can be very optomistic, even when things are gray and nothing works out to your expectations.    urlLink   What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      So tonight I was sitting around this fire with some people, and they were talking about those shallow things people occupy themselves with to kill time between sleep. And these two girls I know were talking about their hair. And as they were talking they started to look at me with one of those "your looking at us while we're talking" looks that can only be answered with a more prolific stare, the kind that tends to warrent inspection from the recipent. So one of them wanted to know what I thought about the topic, and I told them.  I said that my angle, is that from the larger perspective, a mere generation after they die all the details of their lives will be reduced to two documents lying somewhere in a government vault, a birth certificate and a death certificate.  People will be unlikey to even know the most prized accomplisments of their lives, much less the hairstyle they predicted would be cool during the spring of 2004.  From the cosmic eye, the most prolific triumphs of mankind are less then nothing, no more or less significant then a handful of dust stiring on the dark side of a phantom planet in a solar system of one of the many billions of galaxies hurling to and fro in gravitational dances occuring long before we even knew what a star was.  Nations falling, the greatest men in our history are reduced to factoids, the answers to questions on gameshows people watch to relax after work.  Mankind's ignorance to the universe is as uncalculatable as mankind's ignorance to itself and where it stands in the universe. Millions of people are born and die thinking about nothing but what they are going to wear the next day. And eventaully the universe will colapse upon itself, all trace of our existance gone.  This really isn't the kind of opinion on hairstyles people like to hear. I had to defend my statement, which is true, by telling them things matter in the eternal sense. They already knew that though.  So they changed to subject to something else.  I think it was shoes?

      What I don't understand is when two people who are different get all lubbie with each other, everyone nods their heads and says "oh you know what they say, opposites attract". And then when two simular people get together those SAME bastages all circle up and say "oh, you know what they say, two birds of a feather run together".  If opposites attract, then why am I not attracted to disabled short fat ugly new age women from Siberia, who have no sense of humor or love for witty intellect?  Maybe the latter statement is more true. Or maybe people just fall in love with other people, and everyone wants to find some kind of pattern which really isn't helpful to anyone or changes anyone's chances in regards to themselves.  I can see why people with things in common would typically have a better chances to take a liking to each other because conversations are more likely to happen... as opposed to not talking, which usually doesn't go anywhere.   Eric had one of the stealing my wife dreams again. I suppose the only way to completely eliminate the possibility would be to either:  A. Never get married.  or more likely  B. Kill him and make it look like an accident.    Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey   #37: I remember that fateful day when Coach took me aside. I knew what was coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm off the team, aren't I?" "Well," said Coach, "you never were really on the team. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your helmet is a toy space helmet. You show up at practice and then either steal the ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times." It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought, something is brewing inside the head of this Coach. He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I felt the handcuffs go on.

      So my parents have been gone all week, and I've had alot of nothing time. Yesterday I sat around my house holding photographs of myself. I held my senior photo and stroked with one finger my full head of curly beautiful hair, and wondered what the David of Fall 02' would have done differently had he known the fate which lie ahead of him; A slow death. Death by uglification.   Picture a monster who's existence is only confirmed through those he has destroyed. Invisible, lurking to and fro preying on the unsuspecting. The first thing he takes away is your self confidence. He infects your mind with thoughts of "should I wear a hat?" or "she's staring at it again, damn damn damn". He flaunts the fact that you will never be married. What slim chance you had, smothered. I know bald people, and listen to me people- they are not getting married anytime soon. I cannot blame women. I mean, if I were a woman I doubt I would choose the guy with a horseshoe over the younger man with all the same qualties save he HAS hair.  I would have smelled every rose just a moment longer. I would have cherished those times in Tribes 2 when I die 10 feet before capturing the flag, but my momentum causes the enemy flag to land ontop of ours for a capture. I would have asked Betsy Sue to go steady.  I'm learning to like the me I'm turning into. Perhaps if I'm lucky, I'll get a job as a manager for a fast food place in a low income neighborhood. Of course, I'll be 43 by then. I'll wear a little headset so people know who's in charge, and a seperately colored plastic name tag. I'll be the guy who always says his lines the  right  way as an example to the new employies. And on weeknights I'll drive home in my ford taurus, and watch taped VHS reruns of M.A.S.H to a TV dinner. And as I fall asleep on my lazy boy crying because I have no wife, I'll look past the trashcan full of empty rogain bottles and used subcriptions to the hair club for men, and see an 18 year old boy in a pictureframe who was blind to his own demise. The 18 year old who would never suspect himself turning into the kind of person who changes their answering machine message every time someone calls, because it so rarely happens.   The last coherent thought running through my mind before it drifts into blissful none-awareness will be on Eric, who lives in a big white mansion on the hill, married with 4 kids; 2 boys and 2 girls who always loved to run thier fingers through daddy's hair.  And if you don't think Eric fits into this whole scene, perhaps you should know that currently I dream of Eric stealing my wife about once every 3 weeks. If you think thats me just being insecure, then you should also know that yesterday Eric confessed that he had a dream he was jealous I was getting married, so he stole my wife and moved to hawaii where he found true happiness.  Done.

       By Dave   Here's the final draft for my english comp papers. I know. It's awesome, people- please stop emailing me telling me how much you love this paper. Please. I can't keep up with them. I'm so alone.   Dave Agnor Scrivener  English 101 - 1pm April 27 04 - Paper #1, Second draft  	Whoa there, Mr. John Wayne. Think your cool huh? Yeah, Punk? Well then answer this question. What is cool? Huh? Yeah, I thought as much. Maybe you should go read my source material, the Merchants of Cool interview with John Seabrook, then come back and well rap about it. Curious? Typical. But before you read on realize this; this paper isnt about you, its about my response to the summarized text. The interview discusses the relation between the commercial media and the ever-growing market of teenage consumers. It mostly talks about Music Television (forthwith known as MTV). Ive categorized what I consider the key points of it into the following sub-topics: the Targeted Audience, Feedback loops, and Mass vs Subculture. I agree with almost everything Seabrook says, but I disagree on his apathetic attitude toward the effects and causes of what makes what he says true. Seabrook isnt connecting all the dots, only the ones which lead away from personal responsibility. 	The targeted audience of these Merchants of Cool are the young folk, more specifically people ages 18 to 24. Several factors place this demographic apart from the older and younger crowds. As a whole, teenagers represent an incredible spending power. A person reaching teenager-dom for the first time not only has a large amount of disposable income, but also has influence on how the income of their parents is spent. Marketers have concluded that the only reoccurring sellable product to this cash cow is what the cow deems cool. The eternal struggle with marketing the Cool lies in this groups anti-conforming tendencies. As soon as something becomes widespread and marketed, the Cool appeal is lost. This is the nature of trends. The marketers are therefore driven to detect what the next Cool will be, and drive it home to the bank as early and as long as possible before switching to the next sellable trend. Seabrook states that another perk to appealing to this demographic lies in their psychological stage of development. 18 to 24 are the formative years of a persons life. Often their lifetime preference of music, clothes and brands are decided during this time. The belief is that if you can sell them on your brand during this time, they will be return customers for the remainder of their life. 	I agree with Seabrook, although he is no prophet in regards to this fact. I find what he states especially true for brands which tend to raise hobbyists and enthusiasts into a kind of loyalty. Ive seen this happen personally with peoples attitudes towards vehicle companies, genres of music, and musical instruments such as the Fender vs Gibson argument. I believe this is because while people form their identities in a materialistic society, they will often use their possessions and preferences in products to define their identity to the public. How often have I heard people argue the classic Pepsi vs Coke debate? An innumerable amount of times, all in the halls of my highschool. I agree with Seabrook on his stances with the targeted demographic of MTV, although what he says above is well known across the fields of marketing, sociological, and psychological research. They really are not unique enough to be an opinion of his own as they are generally regarded as true. 	The phenomena of the in-out cycle is not attributed to, but rather accelerated by MTVs main technique for discovering and selling cool, the Feedback Loop. The basic mechanics of this system are simple; the effects are profoundly diverse. MTV researches upcoming trends by finding trend-setters and interviewing average teens in the major cities, where most fads are born. From the processed information they gather, they decide whom to air, what clothes the hosts should wear, which genres are going in and out, and generally what teenagers want or dont want. Thus they design their programming, coincidently forcing the Cool out of the trend while the money flows in. They then gather more information, rinse and repeat. This is how Seabrook explains the loop.  	What he is more reluctant to divulge are the effects the programming has on determining the next Cool. The true brilliance of the loop illustration lies in the looping effect MTV has on the teenage culture. This is due to the fact that because it is using Cool, a cultural concept, the programming becomes a cultural entity. They sell a lifestyle and an attitude through the CDs they choose to market, the people they choose to display and the nature of the shows they air. They sell a culture back to the original culture which is not a pure representation of the latter, it is laced with money making motives. The information they process on teenagers is not to understand them but to understand what MTV has or can find that they would buy, be it a detrimental or positive societal influence. Seabrooks defense to this has been the argument that they are only displaying what people are already doing. He states: 	Now that we have the web, where there are plenty of websites like darefordollars.com, where you can pay someone to do something really gross, like cover themselves in dogshit. It puts together the audience with the people that are willing to do that. And so there you see something beyond MTV... I dont think its entirely driven by the needs of programmers to get peoples attention.  	My counter argument is that they are not displaying an accurate representation of what people as a whole are doing, but what certain people are doing that is marketable. MTV is over-representing a select few, causing many of the blank-slate feedable teenagers to absorb the culture as their own. They take the piece of mass culture and spread it around nation-wide, making it a trend. I believe as often as they predict trends they create them. They also a catalyst for the behavior they choose, not just mirrors of an MTV parallel society. 	Deeply correlated to the Feedback Loop are the concepts of Mass culture and Subculture. Seabrook explains how these two ideas interact to show why the feedback loop operates in the manner it does. People in general, but especially teens want to absorb and be a part of an authentic culture. They use the media as access to Mass culture. The problem with the Mass culture is that it in itself is not a separate culture, but in fact a collaboration of countless smaller subcultures throughout the nation. Mass culture by definition cannot be authentic, because it is a set of compressed and processed ideals meant to be packaged and distributed. Subcultures are a much less calculated, they emerge from the sociological characteristics of humanity. They are more authentic, and therefor more sellable to a culture deprived youth. Seabrook ends there, but I dont think thats where the issue ends. 	I believe a teens struggle to find authentic culture is rooted in the merging of the Mass cultures and Subcultures through the vehicle of the media. If one spends more time watching television then one does in school, societys traditional institution for socializing the youth, then I would argue by means of exposure the person is more socialized to the mass media then their own hometown subculture. My experience growing up reflects this. Often when my peers reminisce about their childhood and those childhood memories, they are only comparing with each other which kids shows they watched growing up and which their parents would not allow them to. Evidence of this phenomena are everywhere, most ironically though its appearing at the mall. Walking through trendy teen department stores youll find t-shirts of Nintendo game characters, Ninja Turtle t-shirts and G.I. Joe stickers. This at first might seem odd, but they sell remarkably well to teenagers who embrace these nostalgic icons of their childhood. They are referencing to a past subculture which only appears authentic because at the time they experienced it they were too young to tell the difference. All these are sold under the soft glow of MTV and VH1 monitors hanging overhead. Being socialized at early ages to the Mass culture has deprived kids of a healthy amount of authentic subculture. When kids decide its time to rebel, they look to that same source of Mass culture. After all, television is where they have gotten their reference of cultural identity in the past. In a sad way this encourages the mass media to copy and exploit more authentic subcultures. These cultures are turned over to the trend makers like quick fixes for a culture addicted teen society. One that will never get a permanent fill through the media, only a sampling board of choices which leave them ultimately hungry for their own unique identity. 	Everything Seabrook said is true, yet how he portrayed the connotations of what he said I would argue to be false. Perhaps the media's interactions with teenagers represent less of a cultural mirror, and more of an economical device; less of a mathematical equation then an unstoppable force of an evolving and technologically adjusting world society. Graphing the progression of this trend would lend me to believe that it will get much worse before it's passed.

       By Dave   SALE SALE SALE  So long story cut short, I've gotten ahold of these  urlLink speakers  right? They are the ones on the right with the gold thumpas if you look at that site.

Imagine the smile on your loved one's face when they see you walk through the door with this set of earth shakers!

       By Dave   Anything I say could and will be eventually contradicted. That said, I'm still flirting with the idea of another site. The kind where what I say is none of your frickin business. Where I talk about my emotions.  Wait a second... OOHHHHH, a JOURNAL! Can you sense the conflict?   There is power in anonymity.  What if one day a new link appears on my sidebar? Just another random site... or is it? People might read it and say "what a fanciful dumbass", and that would be fine. But no- with you people I actaully SEE you and you KNOW what I put here. Do you know how scarey that is? Everytime I write something, it can only be as intimate as the person I least trust who reads this page.  People I've never met before.  I have an admiration for those people who just spill there hearts out like hotel mints, everyone gets a little piece of the joy. People like that blogger "Christmas in July". See, I met her once, and she was completely silent. Like...  a mysterious oblisk... ooffff... untapped interaction. It's an identity thing. There's two sides to everyone, there has to be. That blogger and me, our 2 sides are like diametrically opposed. I hold back here, she holds back in person. I think? I have no idea. My point is- it has nothing to do with integrity, its more to do with the context of the friendship.  There's Dave, then there's Dave-Lite. Dave-Lite is what you all get here, half the emotional calories, 95% less fat. If that makes ANY sense...   Here's a poem I wrote last night.   A Still Forest Song    Whos woods are those? Ive watched them from these crumbled walls. That soft lit glow, it pours like wine into thine eyes; my mouth aghast, dry and blind. Must I lie so long?	  Chime, chime that song so vile; the flies return unto their piles. Doth day know not of nights sound reign? 	  Whos woods are those? For mists roll back and past, illumine. Though erie shadows cross asunder, broke upon the trunks which shield them, the faerie stand beneath such darkness. They chime and lie as I.  Sing, sing the dirt and leaves. They lay framed in perpetuity, for wind has not, or will not blow. 	 Whos woods are those, and where have I to go?   Copyright 2004 David Agnor   10 dollars  to who can interpret this in the same meaning I wrote it...  email me at  res0nation@comcast.net or post here... or AIM me.

So we decided to record something there in this booth they had, and so we made up a song and played it. And here it is.   Soo umm... copy and paste this into your browser... I don't know the "code" and all that.  http://res0nation.blogspot.com/yeah.mp3  Then we had six minutes left with nothing to do... so we did Wild Thing... which. Well, this was all improv- but it's still AWESOME.  http://res0nation.blogspot.com/wildthing.mp3  So thats what Falconer's dad was refering to. I'm currently home alone again, the parents are in Palm Spings. Again. So we'll see how that goes.  Oh yeah and there's Kareoke at the portal tonight... and Eddie is playing in a band there.

        By Dave    I scratched my cornea last night/this morning with a new contact. While it gave me blissful comfort during the day, it's true origins became apparent as I imagined it- through tears and bloodshot eyes of stinging agony- being forged in the depths of hell with the same hammer used to melt the one ring of power.   I went to OHSU this morning at 8am. I'd been up since 6am however, as there is no greater alarm clock then a protein deposite rubbing away the outter layers of your retinal lense. They removed the bastard of a contact with twizer style ear cleaner things.  Between those two hours though, I was left to my own devices. Anyone who suffers from a problem which cannot be solved knows it becomes easier to cope with if you make it everyone else's problem. So I logged onto counter-strike bright and early for some hard core whining.   I changed my name to:  **BLINDED_BY_DISLODGED_CONTACT**//pain  And I proceeded to play several lame rounds, screaming into the mike that it was sinister to KILL a guy (me) when he's been blinded with a disloged contact. Inbetween rounds I would moan into the mike. Finally a guy from the other team started counsling me and started giving me tips. "Salt water" he said. Well THAT DIDN'T WORK SMARTASS.  During my complete and inexcusable bitching I had a revelation. There are only a few types of CS players. Out of the hundreds of thousands of people who play everyday it boils down into a very few typecasts. You call tell by their names. They are:   Player(1)  These are the new players, although you can hardly consider them human in this context. They have no idea what they are doing, do not respond to teamplay or advice, and will drop and join randomly. They subtract from the game... which is fairly obvious if they cannot figure out how to rename themselves from the default.    Funsie_Bags_Squirral_Wang  This is the guy who tries very hard to be funny and creative, and fails. They often try to pioneer new combonations of sexual organs and animal names, mixed with words a clown would say to a toddler. They often sing into their mics, as if the concept of annoying people for entertainment is somehow novel.    SuperKiller  Persons under 10 do not understand what cool is. They join the game sporting names like "Silver Dragon" and "Flamer_Death". When these people use their mics, you can tell they are like 8 because they have really high trembley voices which demand to be muted.    7x7//:team-m4|)5ki11z0r   These people pride themselves on their ability to be incoherent. Apparently there is something elitist about having an attitude and horrible grammer. These guy's are the souped up honda import owners of the CS world. They also are very good and determining who is a "nub" and who is not. See? Perfect example. It means your new, and obviously are worthless and do not deserve to play the game at all.   {ClanTag}AnimeReference  Clansmen tend to be neutral. They are serious about the game, and often use teamwork. Nothing wrong there. Territorial on their own servers usually, probably because they are paying for it. Often in college.    French/German Player  Yeah... pretty much, unless their cussing at you, noone knows what they're saying.   Other then that? Well, you get rogues. I probably missed a catagory. Otherwise? Spot on.

       By Dave   I have made an ultimatum.  After shopping today at lloyd center and having some serious no-bs discussions with my image consultant, I have decided to go  urlLink  rugged  . What kind of rugged? The only kind.  The here-I-am-in-a-torn-up-tank-top-at-a-gas-station-in-montana rugged. The I haven't-shaved-in-two-days-and-I-don't-even-care rugged. Any rugged which strikes a "hey, who's  that  guy?" into the people around me, thats the right kind of rugged.    Example:   Fabulously Single Girl: "Hey... Who's  that  guy? mmm MM!"  Insider Friend of Single Girl: "The rugged one?"  Fabulously Single Girl: "Yes! Is that what they call him?"  Insider Friend of Single Girl: "That's just what I heard. They call him rugged. Goes by the name of Agnor. But thats just what I heard."  Fabulously Single Girl: "He's so.. torn. So un-groomed. So irresistable.. so... so..."  Insider Friend of Single Girl: "Rugged?"  Fabulously Single Girl: "YES! I need to talk to him!"  ---------  As you can see from this illustrious and soon-to-be-true situation, I am a genius. Still not convinced? I shouldn't have to do this but...  What girl could resist the likes of  urlLink   this   rugged guy?   **Since the polo pics were replaced, thats the new rugged pic. Thanks falconer**  Now mind you, these are the lightest defcons of rugged. Maybe code yellow rugged. I'm talking about code red rugged.

       By Dave   I give you  morning in the head of dave: an inner dialogue   -  I think I should get up.   -  No.   -   I don't want to waste the morning    -  Your already a waste.    -  I should be doing something productive..    -  Huh? and whats that?    -  I could find something. I'll think of something I can do.    -  No. You have nothing. You have no one.    -  Eh...    ---------------  -   Oh geez was that two hours?    -  Might as well have been 5 hours, nobody misses you.    -  Mom and Dad are gone. I wonder where they went..    -  They didn't wake you up. They obviously don't care. You could think about this more clearly if you just relaxed. Yes, see? With your head on the pillow like that...   -   Yeah, it is easier to think this way.    --------------- -   Ohhhhh. is it 12:30?    -  Your such a lazy dick.     -  I can't believe I slept in again!!    -  Your weak. This is so typical. Have fun trying to fall asleep tonight.

       By Dave   A recent urge? To buy a fish.  Just a little fish to be there when I get home you know? Like a little fish wife. I'd come in and be like "You wouldn't  believe  what happened at the office today..." and the fish would just be open and receptive to anything I'd have to say. And it would depend on me, and yet through my shortcomings be content. I would read it books on fish hygeine, and frolic with it.  Because my fish is the best there is, it would deserve the name of a god. Rathyngardandamandadon! Brilliant. Thats pronounced Rath-yn-gar-dan-da-dam-an-dan-da-don. I'd tell people he was the incarnate of the Gaelic god of War and Awesome. I would construct for him a throne of stone from which he would reign the far reaches of his 1 gallon tank. Perhaps if he gained favor with me, I would buy for him some fish concubines. Neons perhaps. Hot little harlots if I ever met a harlot fish.  I love fish. If people were more like fish we wouldn't have war and drugs and pornography. I mean I've never seen  a fish work a camera before! The world would be so ideal... so serene! We'd bump into each other mindlessly, our fragile existences merely accenting the ebbs and tides of the astral plane. And when feeding time comes, look out folks! thats when things get crazy! it's like an awesome game where if you lose, you starve.   And when a fellow fish gets sick, well, bonus meal. Everyone's happy! I mean, its not like we knew him. He was the new guy. You either handle the shock of rehabitation or you don't, its the unwritten law of the tank. Maybe we should write it down anyhow, just for the legality aspect of it. Someone is bound to get upset. Probably a dumbass guppy.

       By Brezer   Thrifty Rental Car reposessed my car this morning while I was in the shower. Besides having a grade-school vocabulary ("Yeah, the insurance company won't pay for your rental, they're being all mean to you") and excusing their idiotic behavior with 'the system' ("Oh, because Mercury won't pay for it, we had to take it out of your credit card") they are also complete incompetent #@&*****!!! and I hate them. THEY TOOK 400 DOLLARS OUT OF MY BANK ACCOUNT without my knowledge so I overdrew and my credit's maxed out and I've been bombarded by 100 dollars of overdraw fees and had to cut up my cards and reset my accounts.  ...   No phone call, no nothing, and now no money. Not even spare change. And Mercury still refuses to answer their phone or return my calls.  I give up. I'm defeated. The system has sucked all the life out of me. There is no one good, not even one. "Breanna," says Dad. "You can't count on anyone to take care of you. They're like little machines in some room somewhere just working the system." Thanks Dad. Yes, no one cares about me or my life. I thought my life was important but it took this accident to make me realize I'm just some insignificant name in a database of thousands of unfortunate souls.

       By Brezer  I hate UCLA students. I hate anyone under the age of 22. I hate drivers who don't look where they're going. I hate silver 2001 Honda Accords. I hate emergency rooms and chiropractors and pills and pillows and ice packs. I hate uncomfortable cheapo rental cars with teensy little horns. I hate towing companies and repair centers that forget to order parts and I hate, hate, HATE cheap insurances companies. Cheap insurance companies that don't give a rip about inconveniencing me for 4 weeks while they dink around and don't return my phone calls while I walk every place and then rent me a car so cheap it hurts to sit in the seat and don't go look at my poor Jeep while it sits in the repair center NOT getting repaired. I hate back pain and neck pain and headaches that never go away even though I am supposed to have fun at DisneyLand and go to class and learn my orange belt in Kenpo and get on with my life. It could be worse, but I still hate it.

      By Dave  I'm ashamed of what I have become. These last few weeks, little pieces of my toddler precessor have been finding their way back into my life- like slain demons rising from their ashes to screw me over socially.  It started innocently enough, I began to have allergies... which developed into a sinus infection. I'd wake up in the morning, and my nose would be full of dried blood. Isn't that disgusting? But you must understand this, before I can continue. It was horrible. My nose was cracked and itchy. So I cleaned it. You know.....  This happened everyday, and I knew it had to stop but it was always "tomorrow", "tomorrow". First I just needed a pick at my nose when it hurt, when it itched. Soon enough, I needed to pick my nose to do just about anything; to get a soda, to answer the telephone, to check my email, to brush my teeth... just to get out of bed in the morning. I am ashamed of who I have become. Now, I pick my nose constantly, unless someone is looking at me- but forgive me sometimes that doesn't stop me!  My last 3 weekends have dissolved into me and Eric with some friends, sitting in my car by ourselves and talking about how girls don't like us while we all pick our noses, wondering. Then I yell "Oh sweet mother of pearl no!" as I realize I'm sinking deeper into my addiction. Perhaps this is some symptom of my waning hope that I will find ever true love.   Its as if I watch as a force inhabits my body involuntarily. I know its wrong, but my hands don't... my hands just go towards my nose and I don't think to stop them until someone in the other lane at a stoplight looks over and glares, or I see a child in a minivan picking his nose and I think "That's discusting" and I dawns on my MY FINGER IS IN MY NOSE.   Help me...

      I made a few changes, most noticable the addition of my dream log and a conversion of my old photo page onto the new site. I'm sure breanna will like the new title of the site, as it now includes her. I discovered how a CSS style file works, which makes things a little easier.  What do you do when someone's actions directly contradict what their mouth and their face and their body tells you? Do you listen to the actions or them? Or do you stop talking to them altogether...  Why is this a concern? Well, its not. Truthfully, it would be prideful to think it has anything to do with me. The only thing it has to do with me is that I'm the insertable varible in her equation of how her charactor/ideals/problem solving skills apply to life. I'm not the solution or the cause, just an interactive witness.  I keep seeing ads for "flexible cds". What? Does making them bendy somehow improve them? The only way to find out is to buy them, and find creative uses. In that way... I guess that the advertisers won. It's like making a product that nobody needs, and since it makes no sense people are intrigued enough to try them. Anyone remember that gameboy you put on the table, and you put your eyes up next to it cause they're shaped like goggles? The display was just red and black. It's comparable.

       By Brezer   Ooooooooh. . . Strange. . . I'm on a blue page now, instead of orange. I can deal with that. I can handle change. I'm big enough to share a site with my brother. It's kind of like sharing a room. We did that a few times. And he never threw objects at me in the middle of the night for snoring (cough*CHRYSTAL*cough). The only problem this might pose at first is that you might mistake me for him. Now let me get this straight. I know how to spell. I'm an obsessively good spellr. If there are grammatical errors, wrong punctuation narks or misspellings, then you know I'm not writing. Here's something else. I like boys, and he likes girls. This should tip you off. I have a feeling matters of the opposite sex are going to come up frequently, so take note. Lastly, I am four years older and female, so my topics are  always  going to be of a more mature nature.  Good. I'm glad we cleared things up. Signing off.

       By Dave   Okay. Can anyone explain to me the concept of dyed jeans? I love them in the store. I love them on my body when I wear them out. I even love them as I loving place them in the washing machine. What I don't understand is what happens IN the washing machine, because the stylin jeans I put in come out with none of the kickass left.  These polos im wearing (DONT JUDGE) were awesome in the store. But WHY  SELL  A  PRODUCT  if its going to pull a  SWITCHO   CHANGEO  on the  CUSTOMER  after the   FIRST  WASH ?  Thats wrong!!  I read the tag! I followed the directions! But these jeans spite me with their uber plain not-worth-a-second-look texture and tone. The jeans I bought had brown hues.   Why I am the sole victim of tragity? Like yesterday, I opened a pack of my Scooby Doo fruitsnacks- and they were ALL YELLOW. Who eats the yellow? Well I did, I was forced to. How many people does that happen to? No one I've met.  My summer is half over. I'm going back to school on monday. I'm glad though you know? It will keep me busy and productive, and there are few thing I consider more invigorating then writing a paper. It puts you in the moment- its do or die. You have to make numerous split second decisions. Do I elaborate on point A, or reference point C to example B? How far is  too  far over the paper's max charactor limit? How much can the  teacher  handle?  I've been spending it alright though. Lots of relaxing, and writing (not enough though) and yesterday me and eric had our first airsoft battle. I think the height of the evening was hearing eric scream each time I hit him. Eric's height was probably watching me come at him on the mower (as if that would someone give me an advantage).

       By Dave   Alright  maggots , I'm going to tell this to you all straight. There's going to be some changes around here- and I'll be damned if any of you gets in my way. Brezer is joining the cr3w, and maybe in the future Eric or Chrystal. I haven't asked them about it, so don't break the news. It's our little secret for now.  So Breanna and I will be joining forces to bring twice the updates (hopefully) as however many are happening now, and all this for one less click of the browser then you all currently are suffering through. This could double the traffic. All of the above fermenting I have decided is good; because this is America- the land of bigger-better-more.  Perhaps if Eric joins on, he can do movie reviews. Remember that? He was going to do movie reviews once upon a time.  The point of this post is: don't be surprised if the site goes through some growing pains in the next few weeks. Notice I changed the template... this one is written in XHTML - its not as customizable as my last one. Not to worry though, I hope to take a webdesign class at clark. Perhaps if I do that, I'll have the tools to get creative with the site. Right now it feels like I'm rubbing sticks together.  Between the shoutbox and the new comments feature, I hope we can gradually move to the comments. The shoutbox space could be better used somehow. Also, the comments would be more topic oriented- as they are posted in reply to an entry.

       By Dave   This is my 100th post. I've been putting it off, hoping for some kind of epiphany. Those don't happen very much. Or really, at all. So I didn't have one.   But I'm typing this anyway, which is okay. What better a post then the 100th post to show that I'm not perfect? I can't always be witty or genius. The next big post will be the 1000th post... which... at my current rate, will be 10 years. If I ever go that long, I pray it means I'm still not living at home. If I am living at home it should be for a good reason. Like my own house burnt down with my whole family inside, and so I'm a male widow. Then no one would poke fun at me. I wouldn't be so self concious.  I made a quiz for you guys:     Take my Quiz on QuizYourFriends.com!     I hope you enjoy it.   I went to the beach last weekend. Here's some quotes from the trip.  "No. Your all my bitches, now shut up." - Eric  "We're going to portland right? The beachhouse is in portland?" - Nick  "'Safeway is open 24/7, I thought.' -brandon 'Your MOM is open 24/7!" - My first good mom joke ever. A passing into true manhood.  Joe and Brandon went too, but I don't have quotes for them. The only things I can remember Joe saying are not repeatable in good taste. Brandon... I can't remember what he said that wasn't whining. Here's something.  "Why I am always the pervert? Listen to Joe! And I'm not short, not after junior year." Brandon "Shut up, pervert!" Eric "Eric, its not he's fault he's perverted. He's short." Me  Eric ran around like a girl. Thats not a put down to women, I say that because he was screaming and pleading in his falsetto. Most girls don't even do that. It was because Brandon brought an airsoft gun, and Eric wanted to know how it felt to be shot. So Brandon was loading it and Eric changed his mind. So we chased him, naturally.  There was a stand off between us and Joe. When we got bored we'd go lynching people with the airsoft gun, usually whoever wasn't there at the moment to argue. Thats why it was dangerous to wander off by yourself.  Joe locked himself in the bath room for about an hour. We waited outside and turned all the lights off. It was pretty interesting, you'd've had to been there to know.  Oh yeah, I started my novella. It's good so far.  Bye bye.

       By Dave   So here's a dilema. The following links piss me off.     urlLink Some guy who worked at a chicken farm.      urlLink Meet your Meat.     So what do I do now? I will probably never enjoy a hamburger again. Thanks alot Alec Baldwin, you informative ass. On the flip side, I'm not crazy about becoming a vegitarian either. See, I don't even know if I spelled that right. I couldn't do it.    Then there's Peta funding the eco-terrorists, who blow up buildings. And burn stuff down. I read that in Time Magazine. Granted, it was an anti-Peta ad. But that's not cool you know? If chickens could own land deeds, would they still do that to humans? Where's Peta when the slaughter house is happening to people?  ...  Is there no middle ground? Perhaps if we gave each cow a funeral, my concious would be eased. At camp, when we caught the fish, I prayed over each one. That they would pass into the darkness in peace.     Does anyone think those animals don't know whats going on? At least sedate them or something. My sister won't go to the dentist without being sedated. Maybe that poses other problems when we want to eat them.      If your thinking "oh look at the sissy girly man", that video says chickens can play videogames better then monkeys. Video Games people. Chickens have over 100 different squacks, in which they can designate whether a preditor is traveling over land or water.      If I can make one vow, I will say that I will never kill an animal disrespectfully. I met a chicken one time, and I thought he was cute. I'm sure I'd hate him in the long run. But for that day, we were friends. Till I ran out of food.      Perhaps the only thing to do is to make a t-shirt.       "Animal Cruelty is Flipin Not Good."      I thought about "Animal Cruelty Sux Eggs." but that could be taken as a horrible pun.      Eggs was a subtitute for ass. "Animal Cruelty Sux Ass." is really too... I dunno, Flipin Not Good is better somehow.     When I see meat now, I hear the cow's voice. It's saying "Mooo.. mooo..." as if to tell me, "Be aware Dave, for the end is ny! Woe to thou whost feed the machines of torment, for in the end all shalt reap what they hath sown!"

       By Eric   Inside the dank room the hostages squirmed against their bindings. Sarah had propped herself against a pillar attempting to chew through the gag tied tightly around her head. Her auburn hair spilled down in curls to the base of her slender neck. From Sarahs eye a single tear fell saturating her red satin dress. She looked around the room; in the dim light she guessed that there were twelve people in the room each as desperate as her. Looks of absolute misery plagued the faces of all that occupy the area. An acrid smell burnt at Sarahs nose. Her eyes searched for the source. In the proximity of what use to be the buffet line the lay a pile of cans in disarray. One of the cans had been punctured in the side. Its contents spilled onto the floor creating an expanding pool the crept closer inch by inch. Atop the drum a black box hummed softly.  Wham! ...    A sound came to the heavy door at the top of the stairs. The banging increased. With each beat the doors strength slowly diminished. The brass hinges creaked as they began to pull out the wood frame.  Boom!  With resounding finality the door crashed to the ground sending dust flying into the air. Sarah jerked her head away startled by the noise, and when she returned her gaze she made out a silhouette of a man clutching a shotgun. Shrouded against the night sky she couldnt make out any of his features. The figure stood for a moment and then swung the gun onto his shoulder. He walked into faint light. Blood flowed from his abdomen across his thin white shirt onto his dark jeans he however showed no signs of pain.  Somebody call a taxi? His voice sliced through the silence. Sarahs eyes glossed over with uninhibited joy. Dirk! She exclaimed. I thought you were dead.  Dirk walked over to her and picked her from the floor. Her reached for her hands and tore through her constraints.  Happy to disappoint. He grinned. It was apparent he hadnt shaved in a few days. He gazed at her and reached around her waist. Give me some sugar baby. He leaned in and their lips locked. They kissed deeply each of their hearts bursting with ecstasy. Dirk abruptly pulled away his demeanor changed to one of seriousness. How long ago did he leave?  Sarah looked about the room. About twenty minutes.  Dirk relaxed slightly, but from the veil of darkness a man in a business suit emerged. He drew his arm quickly from his side. The barrel of his socom pressed firmly against the side of Dirks head. The man sneered.  So predictable Mr. Martin. Always the persistent hero. The words crept from his mouth with emphasis on every syllable. But I have a feeling that your luck has run out Time to die Mr. Martin.  --------  Its shit.  George slammed the manuscript down on the table. He was a short man in his late thirties with dark brown hair, slicked back. He wore a black pinstripe suit and had a neatly trimmed goatee. He looked down at his nails and spoke with an air of stern finality. Its complete shit. He exhaled.  Mark?  A man at the end of the conference table snapped to attention with speed that would gave an ordinary man whiplash. Uh, yes Mr. Smith? He swept away a strand of wavy brown hair that fell into his eye. Mark seemed strangely out of place he was the only one wearing street clothes. He had no idea why George made him attend every meeting he was only an assistant.  Go get me some coffee and a muffin. George spoke evenly. And if its poppy seed, I will kill you.  Mark stood up from the table and quickly left. George looked around the table and answered everyones questioning glance. You get better service if you threaten them a tad. George cleared his throat. Alright, now which one of you bastards gave me this piece of shit?  Two chairs down a middle-age man with a receding hairline waived his hand timidly. I did. George looked at him through green slanted eyes. Who are you? Bob. I run the creative department.  George fingered with his tie, observing the checkered pattern. And what sort of movie do you think this script would make? Because it sure as hell wouldnt be a good one. It would be shit, like the script.  Silence filled the room like mustard gas. Bob glanced at the script before him and then to George and then back to the script. Georges stare burned the side of his head. A look of confusion fell upon his face. He stumbled through his words forming ideas as they escaped. Was that rhetorical? Because you kind of answered your own question.  George opened his mouth when Mark burst through the door carrying two cups and a variety of packaged muffins. He approached the head of the glass table and set the load in front of his sovereign. George eyed the assortment his eyebrows raised.  Why are there two cups? He demanded.  I wasnt sure if you wanted decaf or regular. Said Mark. George glared at the cup near his right hand. I hate decaf. He wrapped his fingers around it and hurled it out the window. A grin came to his face. Mark shifted awkwardly. Uh, Mr. Smith that one was regular.  Damn. George grabbed the other and heaved it out the same window. From below the faint scream of a woman could be heard. George sat up in his chair unaffected by the occurrence. Right, well back to business. He selected one of the muffins from the pile and swept the others onto the floor. So Bob. Do you think that audiences will like the fact that the movie killed of the main character? Mark! Why are you still standing? Go get me another cup of coffee!  Bob shuffled in his seat as Mark walked to the door. Well, we thought that that aspect of the script was um, kind of original. We liked the unconventional ending. George stared intently at Bob. You mean when the annoying sidekick pushes the bad guy into the piranha tank?  Umm, yes.   Bob, do you know what an ulcer is?  Bob nodded.  Well you and this script are giving me one. With that George threw the script out the window. I could write better than that. Gimme some sugar baby? they stole line is from Army of Darkness. George sighed sinking deep into his leather chair. Every summer its the same thing; mindless action movies, always poorly written and full of plot holes. But if you throw in a few explosions and some nudity no one cares! The door opened and Mark walked into the room clutching a cup.  George lifted his hands into the air. Why do we do it? We are making movies that no one will ever remember! Everyone will remember Die Hard, but is anyone ever going to remember John McCann: Man of war? Why do we do it?  Near the end of the table a man wearing thick wide brim glasses raised his hand. George nodded at him. He spoke confidently. Money. We do it for the money. Man of war grossed ninety million. And the one before it grossed seventy-eight.  George took the cup from his assistant and leaned back. Good point. Mark. Go get that script from the parking lot and some skittles.

       By Dave    "Is this a date?"    Good God. Did she just ask that? Did she just come out and say it?   "A date?"   "I just... you know, I wanna know."   "Well before we can answer that question, we must first both agree on the terminology at hand. Notably, the concept of date and or dating itself. Without this its impossible to know if its even applicable to the present context, thus being a question worth answering at all."  "Uh... Okay. I guess a date is when two people go out. And maybe theres some romantic intention?"   "Youve just described any two people who have ever been together in the same place at the same time. Its my belief that what we perceive as intention is merely a form of human recognition at work, an irrational process indicative of our nature. Intentions are only remembered and relevant in relation to the result, moreover placing what the given intention is to be determined by the person experiencing it after the result has become apparent. In that way, the validity of an intention is left solely based on the individual, which I cannot ubiquitously trust, on principle."   "I dont know what the hell you just said."   "Then we cannot agree, and further discussion is unprofitable. The answer is indeterminate."   "So its not a date?"   ...    Am I talking to a wall?  "Dammit woman! It cant  not  be a date anymore then it  can  be a date. In essence what you ask demands that I attack the definition of the nature of reality itself, that I hem the fabrics of our malleable perceptions into something coalescent and processable. You seek answers to debates which have been confounding the most brilliant minds humanity has yet produced for eons past and will confound for eons to come. You ask that I bottle these answers and give them to you in shades of black and white. You ask more then any man can give!"   "Forget I asked."   "You dont understand what Im trying to avoid here, a communicative entropy. I could superficially give you an answer. But, in doing so, I would compromise the meaning of the interaction, and in doing so the value and entire point. The implications of my yes would undoubtably become trans-mutated into whatever the basis of your yes is. Your question is this a date could be one of infinite meanings and therefor one of infinite consequences;  which  all depend solely on the definition of the word date,  which  we have already decided is indeterminate for all fucking intensive purposes! Dont you see what Im trying to avoid here? Im trying to keep us both on the same page."   "I said forget I asked."   "Okay. I just dont want you angry at me."   "Im not."   "Good."  Damn... that was a close one. Derailed that train. Why is it so hard to breath? It must be her. Shes so tense, its rubbing off on me. Dammit. Wait. Were not talking now. Hmm. This feels awkward. Oh shit. This is an awkward silence. Say something. What should I say? Who cares.  "So, I dont know that much about you. Whats your favorite color?"   "Thats kind of an odd question to ask."   "Oh? I really dont think so."   "Your not going to tell me that colors are relative or something?"   "Well, granted, how we divide the spectrum into shades is the result of our cultural socialization. If youve studied any of Victor Turners work, youd know he explored the widespread classifications of colors in various cultures. The Ndembu of Angola, for example, linguistically identify the entire spectrum into black, white and red."   "Thats fascinating. Yeah. Umm, I really like purple."   "Thats a good color."   "I think so to. Do you feel like your getting to know me better?"   "Peripherally. Whether or not you think so, the color question was more insightful then it was juvenile. Colors are processed by humans to have meaning beyond their literal value. They become symbols of abstractions we have no other way of indicating, much like words themselves. I would argue them to be a form language, but thats just me." Ah. Dont laugh at your own jokes. She should know I have a sense of humor though.    "Yeah. I think its pretty. One tim-"   "Beauty. A mystery to behold. Itd be interesting to study beauty, what constitutes it on a personal and or social level. I remember reading something about it subconsciously being related to the symmetry of the person in question, but that raises many more questions. How does one delegate the concept of beauty when applying it to nonhuman objects, such as architecture? Is it dependent on the level of artistic design, or how it conforms to a preformed expectation of what that building ought to be? Fascinating. The psychology of beauty. What do you think?"   "I think Ive found the answer to that impossible question."   "Amuse me."   "This isnt a date."   Copyright 2004 Dave Agnor

       by Brezer             Up until my ninth autumn, death was a distant reality to me. People who were old died sometimes because they were sick, or just because they were really old. My fifteen-year-old uncle Nathan killed himself with a shotgun when I was five. He liked to do cartwheels in the living room when I came to visit. I wasnt there when his sister found him though. They took him away in a black coffin and my grandma cried and cried, and I never saw him again. That was all I knew. Death meant you never saw them anymore. Death happened to other people, though. It never occurred to me that it happened to children like me. That year I learned that it did, and it came as close as the seat beneath me.    His name was Marcus. I remember him vaguely: a blonde, freckled, ordinary second-grade boy who got on the bus with his blonde, freckled, ordinary sisters, every day, just like the rest of us. His class had the same playground period as mine, although we never mixed, partly because of the cootie problem but also because I was a fourth-grader, and fourth-graders dont play with second-graders. Everyone knows that.   ...   It was Friday when it happened. The bus-riders were just as obnoxious as ever, keeping up a consistent roar of shrieks and songs and filling the air with flying projectiles aimed at the back of the bus drivers head. The bus driver was an older woman nearing retirement and probably praying for it every second of the route. She was nearer to retirement than she was aware of that day. Among the most insufferable of her torturers was my classmate Michael, who was infatuated with gross novelty songs and body noises. That day, being Friday, he was feeling particularly jovial and led the rear section in twenty-six rounds of Jingle Bells, Batman Smells as opposed to the customary fourteen. I sang along, although my older sister Chrystal, ever the mature almost-middle-schooler, sat tucked up in her seat over the wheel base and occasionally rolled her eyes in our direction as if to convey her poised disgust. Marcuss stop came and he got off with his two big sisters, who went behind the bus and crossed to the other side of the street. It was a day for coats since the wind was blowing, and the tall evergreens outside swayed and lolled in the gusts while the autumn leaves swirled down to the dirt. It was this same wind that knocked the homework papers out of a little boys hands and scattered them on the pavement. The driver pulled the door lever and we lurched forward, as we had done a thousand times. And then it happened.    Bump.    It is a large bump. I hardly notice it even though I am sitting next to the back wheel. Suddenly Michael turns to me and says, Oh my God! We just ran over a kid! I think he is joking because he is never serious. But the bus is eerily silent. The driver is frozen. It is like time has stopped, and we have entered a dream. She moves like an old, old woman. She stands and takes the CB radio. The feedback blasts our eardrums and in unison we all clap our hands to our heads, gasping. I cant hear what the driver is saying and numbness creeps over me but then there is screaming from outside and it is the two sisters running into their house. Terror seizes us.  What is happening?    Fire trucks come screaming down the street, followed by ambulances and police cars. If it is any other day it would be cool, but this is real, and it is loud, and it is coming for us. The police officer tells us to stay away from the back window, which is really an emergency exit, but there is no need. None of us wants to see what is behind the bus, not even Michael. Instead, we huddle together as if it is chilly and we dont have any coats. All of us have coats but it doesnt seem to matter for some, because they are shaking, and most of them start to cry. Chrystal is white as a sheet. A little dark-haired boy who was sitting up front falls into her and begins to sob into her stomach. In between gasps I hear him saying, I wanted to play with Marcus today. I was going to play with him. He is my friend. I couldnt find him. . . I couldnt find him. . .     Is Marcus dead?    We wait for what seems like an eternity. There are at least fifteen people in uniform behind the bus, but they arent moving very quickly. There is a little Russian kindergartener who is crying, so I go put my arm around her because there isnt anything else to do. She doesnt understand English, but it doesnt matter. I wouldnt know what to say to her anyway. Everyone is crying, and I wonder if I should cry too. What am I supposed to feel? I dont think I can cry. I am too tight inside. I want to go home and I want to know what is happening outside.  Why wont they tell us anything?    Someones mother shows up. She somehow found out what had happened and gets on the bus. Our driver is gone now so it is just us. Mommy, is Marcus going to be okay? the son asks fearfully. She is hugging him reassuringly and obviously on an adrenaline rush so she speaks very loudly, Yes, honey, Marcus is going to be okay. Hell be okay. I feel a surge of anger. She is lying. Does she think we are all idiots? The ambulance is still here. Everyone is still here. We all know he is still lying back there, just like he has been for ages, not moving, and not going to the hospital. On her way out she keeps talking and she wont shut up. Another bus is going to take you home, honey when you get off if you drop any papers dont stop to pick them up okay? Okay? Promise me youll just wait for the bus to drive away if you drop any papers, okay? I hate her. I hate her for lying to us and then for telling us how Marcus got under the wheel. I want to punch her in the face. She thinks we are stupid children, but we know what is going on.  We all felt the bump.    The replacement bus finally comes to pick us up. It has only been an hour and a half but it feels like a year. We are told not to look back but out of the corner of my eye I see a brown blanket by the back wheel and then I know for sure. It occurs to me that I will not see Marcus anymore. No one will. He is dead just like Uncle Nathan is dead, only he didnt mean to be killed. That night there is a news story but it is wrong. They say Marcus was in the front of the bus when he was hit and they show a shot of a different school bus loading different children. When Chrystal hears it she bursts into tears. The next day a policeman comes to our house. My sister tells him that she was sitting over the back wheel when it happened. Nobody saw him because he was bending down to pick up his papers under the back wheel. It happened at the rear of the bus. He scribbles on his little notepad and I dont understand why they would make a mistake like that because we all felt the one bump. Why didnt anyone ask us? I expect them to fix the news story that night and tell what really happened, but they dont. Instead they show a story on a protest down town. I think adults are stupid. They plant a tree for Marcus at our school, but I dont understand how a tree is supposed to help him now that he is dead.    Afterwards all the state school buses were fixed with long wooden bars that fold down straight out from the front of the bus, so that kids can walk out where the driver can see them when they cross the street. I dont think this would have saved Marcus because he didnt go in front of the bus. Nobody seems to care about that though. They still refer to it as the accident that sprung a whole crop of new bus safety procedures. But I remember it as the day I realized that death could happen to anyone, even children, and I remember. His name was Marcus.

       By Dave   Just a few cents man. Im not going to buy alcohol. Hey, wait up! What? Do I  look  like a drunk? Man you have no idea, you have it all backwards. You wanna know? Okay.  	 Last summer I was in Seattle, just on the streets. Can you believe that? Well thats what life was showing me, life is bigger then us you know. And Id sit and watch these people everyday, the same people walking by to work or where ever, and they didnt change. So I was thinking about it all; the people and life, and life doesnt want that for people. They are being held back man, held by the  chains that bind . And one by one I saw each link in the chain... Obesity, carbon dioxide, the machines... its a chain man, it comes full circle.  Machines  man; the alarms clocks, the stop lights, the light bulbs, the cars, the mechanical pencils. Its all a cycle. Why dont people ever think about it? Because theyre trapped. 	 They drive their cars to the McDonalds. Over and over, until they cant walk. They try to exercise but they cant man, its the air pollution from those damn machines. They cant breath enough to run. Ever try jogging in LA? I walked from LA to Reno once, I know all about walking. So it gets worse and worse, and more machines come to solve the problems.  No . I know the world needs a change, I have the answer. You in a hurry? Right.  ...   I spent two weeks conflicted. I knew what was wrong, but what could I do about it? I started walking one day, and I was walking down to the pier- it happened. The next piece of the puzzle, life gave it right to me. This bike was coming up the hill towards me, and the chain broke. The chain broke man, and the bike stopped working. Think about it. I watched the guy fix it, it was one link. So you see where Im going? We only gotta break one link in the cycle, and the rest falls apart. The  cycle , man! Isnt life amazing? 	 Where you going? Dont worry, Im not busy today. Ill just tell you on the way. From that point on it came together. It was only a matter of which chain link to break. We cant break carbon dioxide until we break the machines, because the pollution chokes the trees so the earth cant filter it. But the people are blinded, they want the machines. They need their eyes opened to what the machines are doing to them. Im attacking obesity.  	 Around this time I decided I should share my discovery, and this is where the story gets strange. I rode the bus to Seattle Pacific. I knew the best place to start was to inform the elite of society, people who have reputation. They could write books, like what happened with El Nino. I talked to those fucktard professors and their campus security for hours. Can you believe they didnt get it? An establishment of education and theyve been missing this the whole time. I told them, I was just the messenger from life. Fucktards. Ive read more books then anyone I know, and they ignored me like I was crazy! Ive never seen one of them in Barnes and Nobles in their fuckity little ties. You ever met those kind of people? Yeah. Youre an alright guy, you know that? Alright. The story.  	 I knew from that point on that I was on my own, with no help from the society Im giving my life to. I had a problem: How to make the masses know, to understand. Thats where this money comes in man, Im getting to it. Are we taking this bus? Dont worry about it, I can handle it. 	 Anyway. My buddy Ralph has this epiphany, he says to me Woodrose, what do people need with every meal. What is there at every meal. I knew it. Napkins! We need to mark the napkins! Of course we couldnt do it manually, you gotta approach this stuff scientifically. What we need is to hit the napkins at the source, in the factory. Weston & Sons is the largest paper merchant on the west coast, I did research. It seems simple enough- I just need to control that factory for... maybe two days, it will be on napkins everywhere. The plan. For once Ill be getting the better of the machines. See, this is how it works: People read the napkins, and realize whats wrong. But also on the napkins is a proposal, which most people will take, because its common sense.   Whatever money they used to spend on fast food will be sent to my Brake the Chain foundation. The Napkins are just the beginning. Once the book is written, I can get on Oprahs booklist. I know how this country works. If I can get on Oprah, Ill gain the support of every woman. So maybe I do some late night shows, you know, the spokesperson thing- until the foundation reaches 8 billion dollars. It wont take long, McDonalds annual revenue by itself is 12.5 billion. Well be sucking money from fast food places all over the country. Man how far are you riding this bus to? Well, we should have plenty of time. 	 Okay. Now when I said I have a scientific mind, I mean that in more ways then one. Obviously, it takes a certain kind of person to draw all these connections, and have the ambition to carry all this stuff out. It also takes someone with social connections as well, and I have those. Ive lived in all the major cities at one point or another. Now stage two of my plan, people have told me its odd- but let me ask you this: when Columbo was kneeling before the Queen of Peru, do you think he gave a damn about what the court thought of him? With their whispers? No. He had one thing on his mind, America, and  Democracy .   Freedom  , man. He was a freedom fighter, and so am I. I would have be a lunatic to think I could change the entire world. Possibly the US, but not the entire world. So the real question is; these followers, how do I protect them from the machines? How do I save this sect of true humanity? We must start anew. From the ground up. Ill explain. 	 By now we have 8 billion, more then enough to catch the attention of John Carmack. You know who he is? The infamous programmer behind Doom and the Quake series. I happen to know hes been taking an interest in space travel recently, he has his own team in that X-Plane competition. We hire Id Software to design for us a ship, large enough to fit my followers. But heres the difficult part. The ship has to be in the shape of me. It will make sense later on. This is a pretty tough assignment for just Id Software, but going back to the social connections, you wont believe who I met in Tacoma, outside of a bar of all places. A guy named Ross, used to be an animator for the Transformers, that show. So Ill get him to do the advising to Carmack, since Ross is more of a conceptual visionary. 	 When youre a leader type, you gotta be thinking about the people. Thats why I know I have to provide for them, they need a direction after giving up the fast food. Thats why 2 billion of the foundation will be used to form Woodroses, an all natural health food store. The company policy will be: if you drove there, you cannot come inside. So heres a place they can go to eat, and it will keep them walking at the same time. All profits will go towards the construction of our ship. We getting off here? Right, I should finish. 	 With that added income, it shouldnt take long before were all on our way to Mars. The ship will land vertically, serving as a 10,000 scale statue around which well build our new society. Now this is where it gets philosophical. By this time weve definitely broken the chain, but you have to ask yourself how long do we have until those same chains come back... its people man, its people who bind themselves. This is some heavy shit were talking about here. So how do we escape the chains that bind? We become the chains. If we werent people, we could not be bound. Im no fool, you cannot live on Mars without the aid of machines. You just cant escape them any other way then to join them. My consciousness will be transferred into my mechanical statue, where I will help them construct my giant robotic wife. Once were done building her, its only a matter of us populating Mars with our own race of Decepticon children. 	 The only problem with this plan is, I gotta make a phone call, and I dont got the change. I gotta call a guy named Floyd Holland, he works night shift for Weston and Sons based out of Spokane. Once he hears my plan, hell be my contact in the company, and thats the first step man. So you have to decide, are you going to help humanity, or what?   Hello?

      by Dave  In other cultures, there is no dispute about what it means to be a man. Theres a process, an initiation. Maybe that means having your testicles pierced, maybe it means being beaten with pointy sticks, maybe they leave you somewhere to die and you find your way out alive. In the Wookie culture, the young ones must retrieve something from the inside of a man eating plant.  With all these cases though, theres a clear cut passage. If you can handle it, everyone agrees youre a man.  There is no such thing in America, and what we do have varies. In some groups your manhood may mean getting really drunk. In highschool it meant hitting some sweet airs on a motorcycle. Most popular of course, is banging as many chicks as fate would allow you to.   ...  So as a ponder my own manhood, I realize my accomplishments place me, culturally of course, more in league with women. I dont mean to brag, but Im a good listener. When I need to, I have a good sense of color coordination. I have an acute social awareness, when I choose to use it. Those things dont seem to count though. They dont make me a man.  Im going backpacking this weekend. Hiking is one of the few times where I feel my manhood in its true element, where I just know. Theres several important things to know about hiking. You have to be prepared.  First of all, if you dont have a knife, youre asking for death on a silver platter. Thats why I always bring a backup knife for each of my primary knives. I keep one on my leg, one on my belt, one on my shoulder, one on the back of my pack, and then one large one inside my pack- just in case Im disarmed.   Scenario : A vampiric beaver is at the leg of a fellow hiker, tearing at his flesh with its soul sucking incisors.   Solution : Use one knife to pin his beaver tail to a tree, one to trim his sharp beaver nails, and 2 knives to pry open the jaws of death. Then use your largest knife to amputate the victims leg, because its probably going to get the brown death (beaver disease). You cant apply first aid without a knife, so get out your sterilized medical knife to cut the gauze stripes at the right length.    There are several other important uses for knives, which no other tool can claim. Firstly, knives are capable of making any object pointy, and therefor a weapon. It only takes one knife to build a hunting arsenal.    Example : in the Edge, the two characters kill the bear with a large pointy stick.   Secondly, I cannot understate the usefulness of chap stick. Aside from offering your lips comfort, it can be used as a greaser, or to make small objects waterproof.    Scenario : An angry tree has fallen on a comrade.    Solution : Use the chap stick on the contact area to decrease surface friction. Wedge and prop the chap stick up vertically under the log to give the victim enough space to grease himself out from under the falling jaws of death.  In any of these dangerous situations, when you can smell the jaws of death closing in around you, the greatest tool you have is your ability to manipulate the environment. I speak of being resourceful.   Scenario : You are thirsty.   Solution : Drink water.  Somehow, when Im out there with all my stuff, its like Ive become the G.I. Joe I always wanted to be as a child. There is a peace in knowing I can survive in the wild as I construct my fragile illusions of masculinity. An illusion which is shattered upon my return to society.

      By Dave  So what happens when you google "agnor"? Well, you get a list of search results. And what happens when you read those search results? Well, you find things with your name in them.   Agnor is also a beer company. I found an  urlLink Agnor Beer Clock  for sale, it was 59 dollars. There is a microbrewer named Craig Agnor.  Agnor is a European electronics company that does something with radios. Some guy with the last name Agnor got arrested for a HUGE meth lab. There's a famous Violinist Agnor, a Professor Agnor, some Agnors who run a Halo team for x-box...   There's Agnors all over the place. One lives in hawaii. I saw his pictures. Agnor is the charactor in from what I could tell is a horrible, horrible sci fi story.  ... read on   Some Agnor won an award for inventing a chili mix. There's a middle school somewhere named Agnor-Hurt. An Agnor wrote a paper on some astral physics... um. I think Agnor is also foreign slang for something horrible which involves a penis and alcohol, but I haven't pieced together what yet.   urlLink This song  was written about me by a Greek fantasy metal band.   THE FABLE OF AGNOR Music: WOLFCRY Lyrics: Andreas The Wizard  AN ORPHAN CHILD When He Was Born One Moonless Night Under The Stars Alone He Cried An Orphan Child, His Mother Died As She Was Giving The Gift Of Life  Fairies Were Gathered All Around And Took The Child From The Ground They Raised Him With Their Own Hands And Every Night Singed To The Stars:  CHORUS: Lord Of The Forest Bless This Son Give Him A Brave And Proud Heart Listen Our Pray Within Our Song Protect His Soul And Make Him Strong  The Little Child Became A Man And Learned To Live With Sword In Hand His Name Was Agnor The Homeless One The Fairies Still Sing To The Stars:  THE WISEMAN It Was One Cold And Rainy Day When Agnor Heard The Wiseman Say: A LEGEND STANDS BEYOND THE TIME AND WAITS FOR A BRAVE KNIGHT TO TAKE AWAY THE GOLDEN SWORD AND MAKE HIM KING OF THE WORLD  DELIVERANCE So One Gloomy, Winter Day The Homeless One Went Away To Find The Golden Sword, And Break The Evil Oath And Rule The Kingdom Of The World  All The Way He Had To Fight With The Forces Of The Night All The Fears Of (His) Youth, And Of (His) Childhood Gathered In His Pathway  1st CHORUS: The Legend Of The Sword Is Standing High Waiting For The Call Of A Brave Knight Looking In The Future And Crying For The Past Eternal Dreams For Endless Fights Into The Warriors Hands   Only a song ten minutes long does me justice. And this does me justice. My very own tale.

      Tomorrow I leave for the good ol' 'Couv. My summer vacation hasn't started yet, and if you abide by the 'no homework' policy of summer vacation, it probably never will, ever. Ahhh, the good old days of college, when one finishes and starts each year separately, with the blissful 3-month period of refreshment, fun, and completely sedentary thought life. Forget high school summers. Who even misses that? Just as a warning to you all, if you ever meet a person who laments in a wistful manner, "Remember high school? The best years of my life! I wish I could go back and do it all over again." RUN AWAY SCREAMING.  ...If high school was the best years of their life, then what kind of crap life are they currently living? Don't get sucked in! They were never mentally there, if they recall those 4 years of hell with fondness! They probably remember high school as the back buildings by the dumpster smoking weed with their friends, living off their parents' hard earnings with ne'er a care in the world. Yes, too bad we can't all have high school that way. It would make it so much easier for us world-domination types to overthrow the populace, and give people like my brother something to discuss besides articles on video-game playing chickens and tributes to the meat market by Alec Baldwin. Speaking of which, I went to In N Out today and had a big, fat cheeseburger.      So Evie and I are loading up the Jeep (the newly repaired Jeep, in its prime and shinier than ever) with the Pipmeister, Herbie the Love-Arachnid in his mossy lovenest, two baby rats, a big suitcase of clothing and a brand-new wedding dress draped over it all. Most likely Evie will be scratching away at her Californian hives, which appeared like a bandit in the still of the night and spread all over her person in blotchy swollen blooms. And when I say everywhere, I mean everywhere. While "Life is a Highway" blasts through my speakers and the wind from the sunroof ruffles our unkempt hair, Evie will be driving and rubbing her face on the steering wheel, and I'll be balancing my Addictions homework on one knee, a Narrative Therapy novel on the other and the road map out of this popsicle stand on the dash, held fast by my bare toes. Wish us luck. Here we come, Washington. ...
