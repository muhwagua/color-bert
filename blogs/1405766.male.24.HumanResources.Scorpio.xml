      So Ren and I went golfing today with Big Dave - wow were the scores all over the place though!  Dave shot 141, I think ren settled somewhere in the 124 range, and I rounded out 18 with a 93 (my front nine really licked ass though).  Though it was a little cold, nice day for golf!  Tmrw is the last hurrah social, coupled with golfing in the early afternoon, I'm going to be absolutely fusched!

      So I guess that the world is again trying to conspire against me making my ridiculous comments on blogs.  For some reason or another the comments feature does not exist on this blog at the University of Manitoba.  Nor am I allowed to comment at home as my goatfuck computer will no longer allow popup windows to actually contain anything but ads.  Fucking Bullshit.  On a happier note, today is my last exam, 6 of 6 at 6pm.  Hmmmmm.... that's a lot of 6s.  A beastly amount.  Then I will forsake my Pharmacy crew for my old pal sickboy and drink with him this fine eve.  I think we should bring the narg and some cushions and sit in a circle in the lane behind the Camby.  We should whip up a batch of bathtub gin for the occasion.  Then get in a fight, perhaps with eachother or go to the Zoo and real man challenge each other to do fight animals, or outdo them at stuff the animals excel at.  We could challenge Sean to outgay a bonobo.  They whack off too I think.  A'ight.  Last ditch effort to lern.  (Spelling perhaps).

      Sitting here, wondering what it would be like to be a lesbian.  I mean, it's not as crude as the gay sex.  It's certainly beautiful (as we can all attest to that after a good boobwatch viewing).  Lesbians must really love their V's.  They love them so much that they want two... I mean, us guys can all agree that we love our cocks.  We can fiddle with them, scratch them, do everything thing we want to them... but (contrary to popular belief) I certainly don't want another one.  However, I do understand the wanting two V's thing... as their has been many a dream where I had two at my disposal (I was a greasy V repairman - "my business is pussy, and business is good" was always said about a hundred times).  Now, if you were born a hermaphrodite - and you had the choice to be either a male or a female... and if female, straight or lesbian... which do you think you'd pick?  I would have to go for the lesbian thing... have a V of my own, and get to try out others every now and then... the best of one world, but oh what a world though!  Next question, if you could be God for a day and make one thing happen... anything at all - it can be a selfish desire, a sexual fantasy, peace on earth... anything... what would you do?  I think Steve would change the Bible so that Jesus was changed to Steve... (flaw in that being the whole "Jesus wept" thing... think about it - if you were Paul or Peter or John or whoever wrote the thing(thing = Bible), sitting there with your bottom ho writing that sentence... wouldn't you think "Holy Fuck, the Messiah's a pussy!)  So, yeah, why are you crying Stevie boy?  huh?  Your father has "fro"saken(that's when your daddy shaves your head, just before the all-knowing fro realises its full potential) you or what?  Lost in a dessert? - get a fucking map!  Mary Magdelaine your best friend but you can't nail her - well grab a willy wrapper and slam that bitch... things we could say if Steve was the Lord and Saviour (because we're his buddies)... it's too bad we weren't best pals with Jesus - it'd be great... we could have him on our bowling team, walking from lane to lane explaining that this isn't the pedophile jesus, this is the son of God Jesus.  We would for sure get into Heaven, and we wouldn't wait at the gate - we'd have V.I.P. passes, and gain back door entry (hehe).  That's the real reason that Peter denied him thrice - he just couldn't handle all the tang that comes with being a best friend of a God.  Those fishermen screwed the rest of us over though - they hated their jobs and asked Jesus for a hand - so he tried his magic shit... but instead of making fish smell like pussy, it went the other way around.  He was young, he was still trying to control everything... I wonder what I'd ask for... probably a 24 hour sushi train at every street corner.  That and I'd get a manager's discount, cause you know... God would run the joint - and it would be the best ever!  Plus, coming of age would no longer be defined by your first fuck - rather it would be the ultimate RMC.  I would just have to open up a chain of Key Lime Pie bakeries.  Although, God would probably be brought up on anti-trust charges, and he'd have to split his kingdom on earth and in heaven into two separate parts.  So we'd have "Heaven XP" and "Heaven 2003" - both would work well, but it would be frustrating switching back and forth - a lot of deprogramming to do for either one.  Plus, Hell would just be a short walk down the road...

      I think that what we really need is a simple pentapartite structure for all that organization stuff.  We need a crime wing, a propaganda/memetic engineering division, a bureau of data mining, a holy funk church, and something else [open to suggestions, I just think it should have 5 parts altogether] all dedicated to getting jokes (even the crime wing whose secondary purpose is funding the rest of them).  I figure we slot our pharmaceutical officer into crime and maybe the financial officer, or maybe we put him into the church to try and get us some charitable organization status.

      if I am to be picked as the COK and bagel fetcher I need a budget of about 1 million dollars U.S.  For starters I need to make my way to Zimbabwe and have a chat with Robert Mugabe on how to rig elections, then go off to Cuba and speak with old Fidel Castro to find out how he rigs his elections. Compare the two methods and miraculously get myself elected as president of Timor-Letse where I shall make my base of operations, since I'm planning on going international.  Due to the cheap labour we shall have an endless supply of fresh, cheap bagels,and not only do we get fresh bagels we can also send all subpar-DJS5'ers to work as slave labourers in the bagel factories. These are the year one plans from the nominated COK and bagel fetcher.

      I like how you changed the description of the blog (that could have something to do with your post problem also)... especially removing the "designated smart guy" part. Not that you still aren't the smartest guy in the group or anything - it's just that your fire preparing skills and joint rolling skills (I hear) are just not up to snuff. Until you change those ways, I think "original member" is a more appropriate description. Oh, and while I'm on it - because you're going off to the journalism thing and you may run into new candidates for membership into the djs5(if we want to branch out)... I think we should make a new "test" for you to take with. While we trust your judgement, it is good to send home test results before we start franchising memberships (the cya principal at work here). That and if you set up DJS5-Fake London, we're really going to have to take a long look at the structure of the organisation. Maybe I'll go ahead and designate myself as the CFO... you or Hassie can be the CEO(although neither makes a strong candidate as the both of you will be away from the djs5 head office (ren and I's house) for at least a year) (sorry Steve, but you're the CPO - chief pharmaceutical officer (hehe) and Reynold - you're the COK (chief operating kid *and bagel fetcher))

      A momentous occasion, Africa has just entered the DJS5 blog, to celebrate this occasion I will be writing pointless shit untill other members get rightly pissed off, or at least untill Justin wonders why he invited me to ever be part of this blog.  For starters, I cycled home against the wind, I had a good piss this morning, I also had yoghurt and granola for breakfast. Some may respond to my choice of breakfast with, "why don't you go hug some tree's?" My response to such people is, "at least I'm not fucking men." I think I will end my first blog entry with that.

      Hey - let's not make the bigger people's DJS5 shirts white this time!  Maybe a nice green or blue and be sure to make the bigger people (whoever they may be) try the shirts on to make sure that they fit.  I hear bigger people don't like small clothes - knowing full well that they do sell big people shirts here (as opposed to stupid fucking "oh look at me, I'm starving for shiva" shirt sizes in india).

      Well, here's something not so serious:  So I was at Saffron's with the boys this evening watching Game 7 (stupid fucking Jeff Friesen and his great hands)... having a good time and all that.  Then, all of a sudden, Nicole alerts me to the fact that my brand new truck is being towed.  This doesn't sit too well with the Sean, so I run out to the lot and ask the driver why he's towing my truck... he replies, quite appropriately, "it's my job."  I asked him to hold on a bit, as there must be some mix-up here.  I look over at Mike (the server, not scotland) and he's laughing his ass off - I figure he called the tow company on me - I wasn't pleased with him at all.  He said that he didn't do it, and I run to get Holly or John or whoever can help me.  Sam, the manager, comes out and asks who the owner is - I tell him that it's my truck and that I would like it put back in my spot.  Sam walked over to the tow truck driver and told him to put the truck back down... the tow guy obliged.  Here's my moral question of the day:  Forget that Osama is my co-pilot.  Forget that I'm going to run into a family of four crammed into a suzuki swift (as it's the only they can afford) and kill them all, all the while saving myself and my gecko.  Forget that the emissions alone are expanding the hole in the ozone layer by five dubic yards a day.  Forget all of this - should I have paid the extra 12 dollars to buy the "no-tow" package?  She's had two rides on the back of a tow truck in her first week... basically it means that Mubutoo Mumbaso is either a natural bad-ass or that this is just another way that the man is trying to bring the African Canadians down!

      Something Serious  So when I go to work at the hospital I have a 10 minute walk that ultimately winds its way underneath the Norwood Bridge (to avoid 16 crosswalks).  Now I'm not completely paranoid, but I'm not completely blinded by ignorance and realize that there aren't a whole lot of people down there and wow, we sure are close to downtown (and its poverty stricken crimebent populace) and gee, if I were going to jump someone, this would be an awesome spot.  At least I don't have to be worried about getting raped (I hope) but at the same time I'm still attached to my watch and I don't have a lot of money to be handing over in exchange for a face not full of bruises.  So I'm careful.  I keep an eye out behind me, I keep my wits about me, I carry a gun.... or maybe not.  Well today as I strode bravely back to my car, I saw a figure in front of me lying against the support of the bridge.  I quickly evaluated the situation, was this a panhandler, do I have any change that I won't give them, did I stretch enough if I have to make a break for it?   As I approached I realized that the figure was a native guy, lying down with his mouth slightly open and his tounge sticking out.  Oh, shit.  So now what do I do.  I have no clue if he's dead or just passed out.  I don't want to go over there and check his pulse and shit, what if he wakes up and starts kicking my ass?  What is my responsibility here?  I don't mean legal responsibility, I mean in a more humanitarian moral sense?  I'm sorry, but I just don't think I'm quite ready to play the Good Samaritan.  I stopped and made sure he was breathing.   I'm assuming he was just sleeping it off.  He was on his side, so he wasn't in danger of drowning in his own vomit, should the situation arise.  I don't think I should have called an ambulance, should I have?  They cost a hell of a lot of money, none of which I could afford for this poor soul.  I didn't want to call the police on him, if they would even show up.  So I left him sleeping there, but I'm not sure if I did the right thing and I'm not sure I could do the right thing.  Troubling.

      A few things...  First, I too was doubting Seans decision to buy an X-terra but offroading in the floodway was too much fun.  We (and by we I mean Sean) drove from St. Mary's to Springhill through the floodway stopping only to take pictures of the incredible trackmarks left from the night before, check out a burntout car (for human remains), and take pictures of the truck doing stuff.  I'm so impressed at the hills that thing took.  More than 45 degree inclines!  Through streams man!  Streams!  Well only one stream, but multiple times.  I hope the pictures turn out and Sean can scan them and post them.  Look for the movie coming shortly.  We figure that I'm going to end up taking pictures or filming Sean and Ren's flaming demise.  Oh but it'll be good though.  Speaking of movies, I saw the Matrix Reloaded on Saturday.  Wow.  Perhaps one of the greatest action movies of all time.  My chair was soaked in jizz.  Seriously, I don't think I even have precursor sperm left.  The philosophies in the movie were a little.... I dunno.  I was watching the action too much.  I guess I'll have to see it again.  Andy was sitting beside me and kept hitting me when he got all excited.  It was like sitting beside a small child.  Well on thursday my band is playing Beausejour.  I think we've finally found a name (thank God!).  We're changing it from Red Light District (which I've hated since the beginning) to Alverstone (which is the name of the street that Darrin's house is on, where 60% of the band lives and where we've practiced all winter).  Our next two shows are in June, on the 5th and 22nd.  The show on the 5th is with this band Antigravity, who are actually pretty good and psychodelic.  Their manager came to see us play and liked what she saw and is trying to help us develop our band.  She's trying a little too hard which makes me a little nervous, because I'm not too sure of her intentions.  She's giving our names to a whole bunch of people to take pictures and design a website when we would rather have us or our friends help us.  If I have to pay to get something done, I'd rather give the money to a friend of mine than a friend of hers.  But she has given us a few good ideas that we hadn't thought of and a small glimpse into the "industry".    I'd also like to give props and shout outs to Ren who is a musical genius.  If we gave him a guitar for a month and gave him someone to watch he be awesome!  I'm super proud of him.  Since no one turned up to my house the other day Ren, Andrew, Kelsey, and I sat in the garage drinking beers and playing guitar.  Ren and I started learning bass, which is a super fun instrument (I can play "Hey Joe" now!).  Then we moved on to guitar.  Ren picks up chords just by watching and automatically knows where his fingers have to go. Its sick (sickly awesome!).  All in all goodtimes, if a little slow.  Sorry Ren for stealing you away from Rachels no doubt incredible(ly whiny) party.  The next time I'll plan it a week ahead and invite more souls.  Anyway, I'm off to clean the room.

      I may have doubted Sean's decision about buying an Xterra but the first night of cruising in the old floodway cleared me of all my doubts.  It starts with Sean calling me and saying that he is stuck in the floodway with his dad and he needs my help.  Well, the first thing that popped into my head was wouldn't it be funny if I pull Sean's xterra out with the tiny neon, just as I finished that thought Sean tells me it's just a joke and as if an xterra could get stuck...  Sean picks me up a short while later and we head off to the flood way where we start cruising at around 80km/h where there is no road.  Very impressed at first but it didn't take long before I got bored and thought the xterra needed a tougher challenge, like maybe try and get to the other side of the floodway, the water couldn't be more than 8" but no Sean wouldn't do that.  Eventually we found a part where there was no water at all and since Sean wasn't going to be a big pussy about it, he gunned the truck across.  The next thing we knew was the xterra was sitting in 2 feet of mud not moving forward or backward.  Meanwhile Sean kept trying, spinning mud all over his brand new truck,  there was mud splattered all over the roof as well as in the  car because somebody forgot to close the window. Well we were pretty fucked so I sat there and watch the lunar eclipse while Sean panicked over his new xterra that wasn't more than 48hrs old.  It's funny the problems Sean and I have when the two of us get into the same vehicle.  Justin you have to scout out the bog and see if we can recreate the scenario for you, remember there must be a lunar eclipse.

      So Sean was about to buy a house when he had this brilliant idea... Little side tangent before going into brilliant idea.  Sean generally knows his stuff, or at least knows his ATC, or seems to know if anyone cares enough to listen.  Sean is basically smart enough to own a car, x-box plus games, djs5 tattoo, fish and a geckel.  The only thing his smarts haven't got him yet is a nice little house to put his things into, and a toonie. Now comes the brilliant idea ...Sean has strongly considered buying himself a super-charged Nissan xterra for all his friends to hangout in.  So with this new turn of events I have decided to call dibbs on the trunk as the new Argileh room.  I figure the front dash could hold the tv and x-box since the xterra does have stadium seating so everybody gets a good view. Plus with the roof rack bucket thingy we can just store the beers ontop along with the fish and geckel.  So to those who figure Sean's plan was not brilliant and should have bought a house first remember, who needs a house when you have a nissan xterra.

So, for our  urlLink TRIP  to fake London next month - I'm looking forward to eating nothing but  urlLink GRANOLA  and drinking nothing but  urlLink WATER  - especially with Chris to help pass the time.

      I'm sitting at Steves computer listening to some realtionship dispute between some girl who shall not be named (like Chelsey) and thinking how maybe I should be a bastard and type out the converstion as I hear it.  Steve, "um" Chelsey, "Please leave me alone" Steve, "um I will"  Chelsey "Steve Reynold is sitting there be some kind of host" Steve "Um I will" Steves quote of the conversation "Um I will"  Steves quote of the summer "poor Choices"  He hasn't made poor choices like Remps yet but steve has just told me that he has.  I'm sure it has involved breaking up with Chelsey so he can spend more time trying to win that Toonie, Poor choices.  I feel that Steves super power for the DJS5 comic could be poor choices, but maybe Justin has a better idea.  Steve has actually finished his desperate conversation with Chelsey, I mean the girl who should not be named and so now I'm being the shitty guest.  So Justin just think about Steves super power possibly being poor choices you might have fun with that.

      I finished reading American Gods (shout outs to Justin for that one) awhile ago and I got a thinking (it's not as weird as it sounds), in the bible it says that we can't worship any other gods before the big G but what about after? Could I go to church in morning and then go and dedicate a battle between a feeble old man and a mongoose on speed to Odin? Technically I guess I’m not breaking a commandment (unless there is a huge part of that commandment I forgot about which condemns me to hell for even thinking about it). Anyway just a thought. I'm heading up to the cottage for the weekend so I’ll see all you hushpuppies on Monday. Anyway have to go tie myself to a tree for nine days.

      Whoo yah – “Dan Wiens”   It’s my first post.   One thing I forgot to mention in my e-mail about Quebec City is my interactive poll. So considering that it’s better late than never here it is.   In Quebec City we stayed with Laura’s friend Simon, who was renting the apartment off a guy at work who was sub-leasing it from a girl he knows (don’t roll your eyes this is all very important). So at night we decided to watch a movie. Well most of the movies at the apartment sucked (think Steve’s parents taste in movies). Just as we finished going through all of the movies we found a home video (now it wasn’t homemade porn or even a snuff film). The tape was the wedding tape of someone (we couldn’t tell which iteration of occupant the tape belonged to) so we watched the tape and made our own director’s commentary to the feature (it’s funny when you don’t know the people in a home video it really seems like a low-budget art-house movie). So my question to all the faithful readers out there in the electronic ether is:   Is watching someone else’s weeding tape wrong? a)	If it’s wrong I don’t ever want to be right b)	Steve you will rot in the seventh ring of hell (which thankfully isn’t the Gary        Glitter ring of hell – Oh but he loves 10 year old Singaporean boys).  c)	Hey they were probably French so it doesn’t matter, but Anglophones on the other hand…. d)	Fill in your own response… for all you creative moral types out there.  Vote now our lines are open.

      My blog isn't working and I'm done my polling paper and the drugs need to work through my system right now and I've got a verbal gunfight going on my speakers, so here we are.  Superheroes are on my mind.  Does anyone know any story about a hero who's only power is that they've got a future version of them self that visits them in a completely intangible and whatever form at random intervals?  I really like the idea that that's this guy's super power, he can go back and visit himself in the past, but only a certain interval back, like say ten years.  There'd be some limiting factor on it too, oh like an exchange.  Okay, so at seemingly random times or maybe we Hulk it up a touch and make it when the guy is stressed by something, he pulls his future consciousness back into his head and leaps his own forward, hopefully into something that he can deal with up ahead without those ten years of knowledge.  Does that make any sense at all?  Ooo I like the idea of this yoyo effect between the present and the future and the past.  So how would you do this in a story  of whatever form?  Would you tell it all from the perspective of one consciousness so you jump forward and get yanked backwards with it, or would you tell it chronologically with the consciousnesses jumping in and out of the situation that you've got set up?  And would you be able to leapfrog these things?  Maybe the jump takes a while to wear off, so you've got Hassie who gets into a dangerous situation, yanking Hassie+10 into his body.  The situation is dealt with, but Hassie+10 is still around, so he yanks back Hassie+20?  Or does he just pull back Hassie, since it's just Hassie who's occupying the next spot in the line?  Or do you fuck it up even more and pull back Hassie+5?  I mean, keep halving the gap if a nonoriginal Hassie is in Hassie's spot.  So if things get insane, you're becoming more and more yourself because eventually you're just pulling yourself from a second in the future back into your head.  That would be kind of cool, since as things get more stressful, Hassie stops being as theoretically cool from having long term foreknowledge, to more practically cool by knowing which direction big badass is pointing his blaster even before he does.  Which also helps ensure that there'll be a future Hassie to yank back.  Then as things settle down, they all start popping back into place.  I like the idea of having a lag of twice as long as Hassie+10 takes to calm the situation down before he gets popped back to being Hassie+10.  And then one day when Hassie stops pulling back Hassie+10, there's a question of what happened; is Hassie+10 dead?  What happens if Hassie is in Hassie+10 when Hassie+10 dies?  Is there any way to play this out so that Hassie +10 yanks forward (since there aren't any Hassies after he dies to yank backward) Hassie after Hassie as he dies, trying to escape the death stress?  Oh, maybe instead of pulling out the future Hassie from whatever, you pull him from a dream, and then for that last 10 years Hassie dies every night and it creeps slowly backwards as Hassie dies.  Maybe that doesn't work.  I don't know.  Did you like how I used Hassie to keep this brainspew vaguely on topic for the DJS5 blog?  I did.

      Props and shout outs to Justin for correcting my failed link.  It goes to my band's website that is pretty bad for the most part.  Check out the picture site to see how incredibly gay the rest of the band can be sometimes.  The guestbook is kinda funny, here's a quote from a guy who posts as Jovifan:  "To me, its a good idea to always carry two sacks of something when you walk around. That way, if anybody says, Hey, can you give me a hand? You can say, Sorry, got these sacks."  I'm going to try to improve the rest of the site little by little so that one day everyone (yes ~12 billion people) will wake up one day and be all "wow, that's a great site.  Not a word about football or ATC! It's totally up the skirt!"

      So the jizz is still drying in my pants from the Antibalas show on Friday.  That band is so good I swear to God I exploded my vas deferens.  There was funky beats and jizz everywhere!  They crammed all 12 musicians on the stage in a giant "U" allowing the brass section a spot to come up and solo.  All those people who could have come are suckers for not doing so.  I went, I can't have children now.  I just hope I hit some fortunate girl in the v.  Oh, I know I'm getting old now.  gr 7 Westgate girls at the bar.  I can't drink all day.  I cry.

      Okay, so these renegade tibetans get into some gengineering and create a perfect being.  The monkeyduck.  It is the kind of thing that can't exist in our universe, completely outside any natural laws.  That is how perfect it is.  It starts reshaping the world in its own image.  This angers someone who then summons the greatest heroes of many times and spaces.  The DJS5.  Now, I've got the Hungry J origin story written, and I know I want Africa to be a pestilential cloud that greatly covets toonies.  The others I don't have together yet.  This isn't much of an outline, sorry, but I'm very tired and not at all drunk and I have to go to class.

      Caution Slow Readers: May take more than 10 minutes! I'M SEAN.  I'M SO LOUD.  I LIKE PENISESSS IN MY BUM!  MY MOM DOES TOO.  FOOTBALL! I'm sorry - when I read our mission statement of "a group of top secret super heroes dedicated to the erradication of all things disco through explicit funkification of the gibb brothers."  I read "top secret super heroes" to be The Bombers.  "erradication of all things disco" to be Driving wildly in the xterra.  "explicit funkification" to be "takes longer than 10 minutes to read only if you're a moron and grew up taking the short bus to school".  "gibb brothers" to be andy and fred (or whoever the other gibb brother(s) was/were) - that and CFL FOOTBALL IS SUPA-COOL!  There is nothing wrong with the occasional football related post.  I didn't comment on your post about a moral decision that you had to make over whether or not to curb stomp a drunk.  Where are the crazy hijinks, plans for world domination, jokes or racist commentary in that post?    Here are my suggestions for acceptable DJS5 posts:  1) Anything I want, except for ATC and CFL (I'll give you those)       -just note that I've yet to talk about ATC on this blog 2) Steve Gregg sucking shit out of a dead donkey's ass (had to fit the porn in there somehow) 3) Justin and his failure to shed his Menno skin and learn how to use a computer 4) Reynold and how he sometimes wished he could win a toonie 5) Hassie - well pretty much anything he wants too... I believe we've yet to read a hassie authored post...

      But really though, its not like Sean doesn't have his own blog that he can fill with his irritating football rants.  Its just been dying to be updated with CFL and ATC shit.  Where's my daily update about the crazy antics of the OJIs?  How come I haven't heard about the stupidity of Air Canada Pilots?  Who would win in a fight between Arlan Bruce III and an Air Korea pilot?  Who knew Matt Dunnigan doesn't play for the bombers anymore?  Lets all do the Superbowl shuffle right off a fucking cliff before two planes come within 10 miles of eachother.  ALTHOUGH SEAN IS SUPA-COOL and HIS OPINIONS DO REPRESENT THOSE OF THE DJS5 - CAUSE WE CAN'T THINK FOR OURSELVES!  Really, none of that is DJS5 stuff. I don't post shit about the facinating world of pharmacy here.  Seriously, how many people who read stuff here (because I'm sure our readership is in the tens of thousands) care that in Quebec, 25% of the population have macrolide resistant bacterial populations due to an overprescription of Azithromycin which has a longer halflife than other macrolides (eg. Clarithromycin) which allows more time for the bacterial population to gain resistance.  Wow, facinating eh?  Problem is, NO ONE CARES!!!  Might as well listen to my sister tell a half hour story about a guy from Brannigans that nobody knows.  THING IS YOU SHOULD KNOW FOOTBALL - FOOTBALL IS SUPA-COOL!  All I ask is that we throw away that whole "freedom of speech" thing and reserve this blog for all things cool and interesting like the crazy hijinxkxs, plans for world dommination, jokes, and borderline racist commentary.  (RACIST COMMENTARY IS SUPA-COOL)

      Fucking Autopac!  So, they don't include my skid plate as part of what they'll repair.  The fuck is that?  It's part of the fucking vehicle isn't it?  I asked the guy why not, and he said it was cosmetic - it had no purpose.  I told him the purpose was so it looked like an XTERRA, he laughed at me.  I said that most things on cars are cosmetic - why replace the bumper cover if the actual bar is the only useful part of the front assembly.  He said: "that cosmetic piece also reduces impact".  I asked him if the skid plate was a hologram... if things could go through it without slowing down in the least.  He said it was minimal - I told him his logic was faulty and that a skid plate reduces impact... in fact, for the safety of my vehicle I wanted brush guards installed on the front and back of the vehicle.  They're certainly useful.  We got into a cordial little argument, and he said that there is an appeal process - I asked him if I could appeal his parents decision to have sex nine months before he was born - maybe there was some way of turning that leaf.  He didn't appreciate my comment, and then we got into a less cordial tussle over who is the car guru and who isn't.  I advised him that my being smarter than him in every other way automatically vetoed his right to condescend me, then I told him that that meant he was speaking down to me.  Then he pushed me, I pushed back - he gave me a right cross that would scare Lennox Lewis - I stumbled back onto my truck, put my foot on the bumper, and pushed off into crazy white guy tackle form and threw the two of us through a giant glass window that had "buckle up" painted in the top right corner.  We went rolling threw the reception area of the claims centre - tables flying, books strewn - blood and guts left for all to see.  After the 20th succesive punch to his mangled cranium he conceded that the skid plate should be covered and that I would be assesed a 10$ fee for fighting with the estimator.  As I drew back to really appreciate that 10 dollars he told me if I got off he would reduce the fine to five bucks, so I got up off him...went to walk away, and then I said "oh, but for an extra five bucks I can kick you in the balls though" - and so continues my streak of impulse spending.

      I figured I'd try updating the blog while at work.  Using the time designated for control duties to fill people in on the ins and outs of my personal life.  I do this, thinking only that it would be grand if I updated from work - but I really have no clue as to what I'm going to write about.  A random word from the dictionary (and Jared will love this one) is "mongoloid" - a person having qualities of or relating to a mongol.  (sidebar: microsoft outlook's spell check does not recognise these words - therefore, they're underscored in red and it's bothering me to no end)  Fucking microsoft outlook.  Really though, I wish I had an email editor that didn't suck balls.  It automatically opens the email up for you - there is no way of deleting a message without opening it (and whatever fucking virus it holds) onto your desktop.  Maybe I don't want the email titled "hot sluts dripping for you" to open up while I sit in a crowded room at work trying to delete it.  Maybe there are some things that should just remain closed.  Thing is, outlook is the work editor and it's the fucking editor that works best with mts high speed (apparently) - I can't use a hotmail account - I don't want to spend the extra cash for a mailbox large enough to hold all the free porn I receive.  Which is another thing, how to porno providers make any money?  I mean, there are sites like  urlLink PORNDIRECTORY.COM  and  urlLink TOMMYS-BOOKMARS.COM  (both of which offer links to free porn - and both of which can be found on  urlLink WILWHEATON.NET )  Also, other sites offer minute long clips (and frankly that tends to be enough for me these days) - even a hot picture on  urlLink NEWSFILTER.ORG  is enough to store in the old memory bank.  I really like looking up information on airplanes and remote controlled trucks, but I really wish I could go two minutes without seeing links to a porno site.  I'm actually thinking of installing netnanny onto the computer, just to block all that shit right out.  grrr

      A quick recap about the trip Ren and I took: 1) Around Madison Wisconsin, a fucking Jeep in front of us decides to kick up a spent tire laying on the side of the road and we run into it - pushing my bumper back 2 inches and making it really difficult to turn left without shuddering from the scratching and screeching noises.  FUCK 2) Around Kalamazoo Michigan, Reynold decides to take a little snooze - he was driving.  Sean pulls a classic "what the hell do you mean there are faces in the road" and takes over the driving, aided only by little white pills and the desire to get out of that goat fuck country.  FUCK 3) Get to London, drop Rachel off, Ren goes to sleep, I deal with autopac, nissan, and a friendly body shop to see exactly how much they could repair the vehicle without invalidating my insurance.  No sleep + autopac = frustration.  FUCK 4) Forgot what I did that afternoon and evening - I think we went out for supper, but that's about it.  Little white pills keep your eyes open, but not much else.  FUCK 5) Thursday morning Ren and I go to Niagara Falls, check out the "walk beneath the falls" thing, go to the casino, where I won - amazingly enough.  I go to a casino to lose, not win... I have a bad time if I win.  FUCK 6) The drive back from Niagara was cool... you've got to ask Ren or I in person about a 96-ish BMW M3 that loved to zing through traffic - funny. 7) We watched Justin's team get trounced in Ultimate, went out for beers with his class and got pizza.  While we waited for the pizza to be made, we took a little walk - where Ren and I ran up and down a steep embankment by the Thames River (clever, no?).  I was wearing sandals and hurt my ankle (not bad, but enough to go "FUCK" a few times). 8) Friday morning, when Justin was in class, Ren and I created a character for his pod racer game (which defined the fucking trip it seems) and advanced farther in the game in one morning than he has in the weeks, nay months, he's had it. 9) Friday afternoon we went to Toronto, saw someone from Winnipeg who recognised me, I ate some bad chicken - paid for it on the drive home - (I forgot the schwarma in london - oh so good) - walked around, I bought a nargeile, I bought some shoes, we went to Kathleen Saurette's place, then on to this club... which would be super cool for shows, but not so cool as an 80's dance bar.  Although, there was an Asian guy who made the evening - he sang along to every song and pretended he was a rock star - the world was indeed his oyster.  I fell asleep on the way home, but Ren was driving so that's all good. 10) Left London at 9:30 am on saturday and drove a long fucking time.  Highlights include a traffic jam in Chicago - where we saw a pimped out Caddy - think maroon with gold rims, the driver was nearly fully reclined behind the wheel - we drove by and wow was he ever a pimp though, he even had his bottom ho in the front seat with him.  Driving too fast by cops in Wisconsin is fun - waving at them as you go 90mph in a 65mph zone isn't so much fun as it is ballsy.  Oh yeah, when we crossed the border into the states the border control guy asked us a few times if we had any sandwiches with us... after we answered that we had no food or meat or vegetables... very odd - maybe I should have pulled out the old "we've got a shit sandwich, and we're all going to have to take a bite" but I didn't want to be beaten and raped by an INS guy with a hatred of sandwich bearing Canucks.  Crossing back into Canada was a bit better - it felt great to finally leave that goat fuck country... I really don't want to go back at all.  FUCK  The nargeile should probably come out this weekend, we've got to Christen her good - I don't have a name for her yet - so the race is on!

      So a Koala and Prostitute hook up.  They go back to the prostitute's place where the Koala starts going down on her.  He's at it for over an hour and the prostitute has multiple amazing orgasms.  When the koala is finished, he gets up and walks over to his clothes and starts putting them on.  The prostitute leans over on the bed and asks for her money.  The koala stops, looks at her, and then keeps on dressing.  The prostitute gets irate and demands her payment, but the koala just ignores her and starts for the door.  In a fit of rage, the prostitute walks over to her bookshelf, grabs a dictionary and flips to "prostitute" and shows it to the koala: "Prostitute: A woman who has sex for money". Calmly the Koala takes the dictionary flips to "Koala" and then walks out the door: "Koala: A small marsupial that eats bushes and leaves".

      So a few things are happening... I guess I'm officially on the "Sean's Sirens" MS Bike Tour Team.  When I was talking with Laura Loewen about it - I made a slip up or two... "don't worry, the old Sean's Sirens will be sure to finish well" - I, obviously, was using "the old" in the manor all hate but are used to - not in the "my teammates are all Rachel's mom's age" kind of old.  Naturally I wanted to sing one of Nigel's originals: "Sean's got a shovel and he's diggin a hole - it's gettin really big it's gettin really big."   On second note - I'm having trouble trying to decide what to wear to a funeral.  I know it shouldn't be too much of a concern - but wearing a pin-striped navy suit seems inappropriate.  Wearing a plain navy is alright - but it's so damned hot these days that I'd rather not sweat ten pounds out at the wake (sorry guys - not a real wake... just using the old thesauras).  Wearing a cream coloured suit seems inappropriate.  I thought maybe tope(?) pants and a black top with a nice shirt and tie... but apparently people aren't wearing black to funerals anymore - it's too depressing.  Any tips from anyone would be more than welcome... here's what I have:  Suits: Navy, Spring Navy with pinstripes, Black (single and double), Cream,  Slacks: Black (3), Navy (1), Tope(2), Grey(2),   Blazers: Black, Charcoal, Grey  So yeah - I can bring any combo in with shirt and tie... and that's another thing... can I wear a golf shirt with slacks?  Or is work casual out of the question?  What if I wear golf shirt with slacks and a blazer?  Who knew I'd need so much fashion advice for summer funerals... winter's easy - black, spring + fall - navy (it's a very thick navy... please don't suggest it) but summer... I'm even thinking of pairing the navy pants with the pinstriped top.

      Okay, it's not exactly DJS5 material, but Hassie, I got a much better outline of how that time jumping comic is going to work and how it'll resolve itself and it uses your model of the five panel independent storyline things.  But I only use five of them, so once they're all on the page it just turns into a big clusterfuck squaredance, jumping strip by strip and then panel by panel, then it might get down to sentences started and finished in panels directly above and below each other, getting more and more chaotic as it goes.  But I've got a resolution worked out that doesn't require everything to do a big unsatisfying swell and recede.  And my basic outline for each of the timethemes is picked as well as crises and triggers.  Making the sonsofbitches dance is going to be awful though.  Which reminds me, I saw Russian Ark today.  It's a 90 minute Russian movie filmed in the Winter Palace in St Petersburg and the entire movie is ONE SHOT!  One take, expertly choreographed, done with a steadicam.  The technology now exists to do what Hitchcock tried in Rope (which had something like 12 shots if I remember right).  And this hungry man of a letter needs new pants.

      Hopefully this post will now be brought to you by Hassie and not little steve or the letters A, W or T.  This has been a weird week with the folks leaving for Australia (for 11 months) and packing up the house. It’s a weird feeling being kicked out of your house so some strangers can come and sleep in your bed, eat your food, and where your underwear.   As a PSA (public service announcement not pubic stealth anomaly) to inform all the people in cyber space who read those (which I’m sure are in the thousands, nay millions), and who I haven't told about my living arrangements this summer, I'm moving into the old S dog's place (i.e. Sarah's) this afternoon. So from now on everyone can get a hold of me at the Michealson Health Spa (I can already feel the pounds melting away).

      On The Last Days of a Choice Filled Summer  This summer of poor choices is winding its way down, and while sad - its time had to come.  Though not official until September 21st, I'm calling an end to the summer after this weekend.  I've had times where I've drank too much, times where I've drank too little.  Places I should have been more (the lake), places I should have been less (Area Control Centre).  Choices I should have made, and choices I had to make by the very definition of the period.  Memories I want to keep, and a lot more that I want to forget (hey, skirt girl).  Yes, I'm content that I've done everything this summer asked for.    It started with a bang at folk fest.  Being my second year of going all out, I had to "just give 'er" - so we went out on Tuesday evening and came home Monday afternoon.  I drank my cooler dry in two days, and only after a friendly trip to the beer store was big blue replenished.  I made some poor choices, I made some good choices, and I made some odd choices - it was perfect.  (I call the two months in between "filler" - so... fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller  fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller  fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller fillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfillerfiller  It'll end this Sunday in Regina as me and 12 of my best friends cheer the bombers on to victory in a hostile Taylor Field.  I'm concerned only in that with all the face and body paint we'll have on, and the horrendous amount of beer that'll be in our system - Saskatchewan Doctors may choose not to operate (who am I kidding though, Saskatchewan couldn't produce a person smart enough to hold down a job, let alone a critical one in the medical field).  No - with the thousands of dollars I've spent on beer, golf, baseball, good times, wings, and friends... this trip will be the perfect conclusion - as transcanada ball will be played while swilling root beer, eating chicken wings (day old) and cruising with friends...  This summer was perfect though.  We're all old enough to know what's right and wrong, but young enough to do it anyway.  We're smart enough to know our feelings, but dumb enough to hide them.  We're man enough to watch our friends move away and grow, but boyish enough to cry for them when they leave.  Yes kids, we're the chosen ones - we've got the world on a string... in ten years, all I can hope for is to get at least one golf game in with the boys a year.  I hope that my kids and the other DJS5 kids get along.  I hope that my third ex wife doesn't come back with a better lawyer every time I get a raise.  It's now, now is the time to do what we want to do, say what we want to say.  We've labelled the past few months as a summer of poor choices - but really they're good choices - because they're our choices.  Nobody forced me to do the things I did... in a world where everything people do will be guided by rules and popular conventions and laws - it's good to know that we can still go out on a limb and be free.  I've tried it all, stress relief through every technique imaginable - but the only thing that worked this summer was forgetting all worry and being a kid.  Maybe for the last time.

      It's a little late, but I was wondering if any of you internet blog readers out there would like to sponsor me for the MS 150 Bike Tour this year.  Every year 600 of my closest friends and I ride our bikes 150+ kilometers over two days in support of MS.  Two days of struggle each year is nothing, in my mind, compared to what some people with the latter stages of MS go through every day.  If you can, send me an  urlLink EMAIL  with your support and I'll mark you down and pick it up in the next week or so.  I ride this weekend and am still a few dollars short of my goal - so yeah... that's enough begging for one day.

      From Africa:  "I'm at conference working on slow computers using some ridiculous system so here is the gist of things in Africa. Sitting in a bus with mennonites who continously sing is close to India bus ride bad. Running wild in african villages is cool.  Conference is bad. The only cool part of Conference thus far is seeing the people of my childhood. Another positive is I have not been raped by Robert Mugabe but I have eaten rape wich is not good. I will be trying to find a better internet place in Bulawayo instead of these horrible computers at conference.  See you all soon eh!"

      wow - did I ever sleep well last night!  After a long three days, I finally put my head down last night at around 10:30 for some well deserved rest.  I woke up at 2:30 this afternoon!  A gorgeous 16 hours of uniterupted sleep!  I haven't slept that well since Dave Wiebe knocked me out in '96 (oh, but he delivered a solid right cross to the back of my head though!).  Tonight, I'm heading out to hooters for beer and wings with J.R. - he thinks there's a preseason monday nighter tonight...  there is - it's just not on television.  I didn't want to spoil the beer and wings night though - so if any of you wanted to come along - just give my cell a ring before... as we'll probably be somewhere else (I'm thinking hoegaarden town having hoe-ees and sue-ees).

      Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gary Coleman, Larry Flynt, Various Adult Film Stars... yes the Californian Gubernatorial race is certainly shaping up to be a fun one.   Here we thought a pro wreslter governing over Minnesota was funny - now imagine the Terminator (in his broken English/superb fitness sort of way) discussing state policy with his cabinet.  Wow - the only thing better would be for a dude named John Conner (I'm sure there's at least one in California) to run... who would protect him?  Would they team up?  Would Linda Hamilton get jealous and join out of spite?  It'll be fun!

      Ah - 6:45am... it's the best time to post.  All I've got is a joke for ya - it's one that I hate, but don't fret, you'll hate it too!    Q- How do you get your girlfriend to make dolphin sounds?  A- You flipper on her sotmach and try to enter her from the rear - and she goes "an-uh-an-uh-an-uh-an-uh-an-uh"  Although Victor Penner probably knows better ways to do it.

      So yeah - funerals... I don't really like going to them - but I like being there (if that makes any sense).  I like the chance to say goodbye, I like to hear nothing but good things about a person.  It's not the whole story, but nobody's going to an asshole, saying "he was a buggering rapist, and he cheated on his taxes."  No - you'd say "he was a clever man, finding ways around the government left and right and he was so willing to spread his gift to all - even when they didn't ask for it!"  It's great!  I like the idea of people in a church, mourning the passing... it's the least you can give for a life passed.  I'm not one of those: "oh I want everyone to have a big old party when I go."  No, I really don't like the idea of poor choices being made over my waking body.  If I'm to go this weekend, this is what I want:  A nice air conditioned church for the funeral.  My best buddies ushering people to their seats.  I don't want an open casket at all - I don't like looking at people in there caskets - so I don't want a bunch of people looking at me, critiquing the make-up job.  I don't want Amazing Grace to be sung (it's like Pachabel's Canon at weddings - it's a little over done) - and I don't want the "walk in the shadow of death" passage to be read (see above).  I'd feel unconfortable having a minister deliver the message - so I'd like my bachelor of theology buddy to come up with appropriate readings from the Bible and I'd like a relfection of them to be done by Justin (in his "this is my serious voice, but it sounds like I'm making fun" voice).  I'd like Hassie to get up and start to tell a joke, but realise that he can't say it in front of my grandma - and invite people to come see him later if they want to hear the joke.  I'd like Stevie G to lead a good african song (full rain, full rain maybe) - hopefully his drum solo won't suck like so many folk fest drum jams!  I'd like the eulogy to be read be someone who can get through it.  While I don't want to sound like an asshole (as I've done this myself) but if you're going to cry, it's very touching - but it really makes everyone else cry and I don't want my guy friends to well up... as tears in their eyes will seriously hinder their ability to walk my casket to the hearse.  I don't want coffee and buns to be served in the basement - I'd like to have some solid bar-b-que action...  As for pall bearers - Steve, Hassie, Justin, Reynold, Jared, Dave, Chris and my dad (maybe Nigel too - we can have the hobbits up front and the giants at back.)  For the funeral procession... I really like the idea of saying one more "fuck you" to the city's drivers.  I want the procession to roll through downtown Winnipeg at 25 klicks - then down Corydon at idle blasting country roads from my truck... then on to all the red lights cameras in the city - roll through all of them with the four way's a going.  I want to slow down traffic for at least one day.  For all of my stuff - that's when we'll have the party.  The "dividing things up party"  each item will be assigned a poor choice:  For my truck - you'll have to drive from coast to coast in your own car - but do it off roading... and it can't take more than a week - and if your vehicle breaks down - tough fucking luck!  Steve - your jetta's cool - but think of how cool it'll be going through flax fields in saskatchewan trying to win the truck!  For my gecko - you'll have to lick dave's neck (andrea is not allowed in this one) - my fish go to the first who can capture barney (my shark) with his teeth.  My tv and computer go to the person who can succesfully to the matrix spiral dive (ren and I have tried and failed miserably) off of carolyn's dock.  At least 40 witnesses are required (this means a party at care's of course)  other things like cds will be given out on a first keg stand, first served basis.  For each keg stand, you can pick one item (like my coffee mug - or a nice tie perhaps).  For any football flags, you have to prove knowledge of the team and the game through random skill testing questions administered by my dad - example "how many games did the memphis mad dogs play in the cfl? what was the reason for their collapse?  Was their franchise revoked or offered back to the league voluntarily?"  Those kind of things...  oh yeah - and when everything's said and done I'd like someone to come up with a wicked ass toast to say every december 19th - in honour of poor choices and, you know, my birthday and all!

      I get on a plane in 6 hours - in 9 hours I'll be in Toronto...  I'm very tired right now, but because of a few poor choices I'm not going to sleep until 5am or so - that leaves me one solid hour of sleep.  Of course I'll sleep in the waiting room, on the plane, and probably most of the way to Rachel's place from the airport... It's a damn good thing I have those little white pills to wake me right up.  I'm not taking a carry on bag which may be a mistake - I'm just going to take a nap.  I'll be spending wednesday and thursday in Toronto - friday through sunday in Ottawa, and then on a plane at 7:15 am and back to work less than an hour after I touch down!  Jeez - It's not a smart thing I'm doing - but it sure will be a fun thing!  Justin - sorry I couldn't make it down to London - but if you're going to be in Toronto - give my cell a call, it'll be on for most of the trip!  later suckers!

      Alright there will be four rounds - each one testing a different writing style, each of the first three rounds will be marked by the panel and assesed a point value of 1-10, with the final round having a maximum value of 15 points.  Bonus points will be added as we see fit.  Each round will have a certain theme - the first three may either be original works produced for the contest or they may be reproduced works from days past.  The final round must be original - however it may include quotes from previous works... there will be no limits.  The contest will start on September 24th - the contest will last until October 31st - at 6pm C.T. (I've got to hand out candy after that) - entries will be accepted anytime before the end of the first round (October 1st at 9pm Central Time).  Justin and Reynold have both been accepted into the contest, any other entries must submit a piece to prove worth into the contest.  The top prize now stands at: a roll of duct tape (slightly used), a squash ball (two yellow dots), and an alien sand wedge!  Plans for a second place prize and a best of the contest award are being explored, but may turn out to be nothing more than a pipe dream (note the difficutly of forcing a dream on someone else!).  Schedule of events: now until September 24th (contestants get their game faces on) September 23rd - the first theme announced (it may include something about Steve's birthday) September 24th - October 1st - round one submissions accepted and posted October 2nd - the second theme announced October 3rd - October 10th - round two submissions accepted and posted October 11th - the third theme announced October 12th - October 19th - round three submissions accepted and posted October 20th - topics announced for the final round October 21st-23rd - contestants pick their topics (Justin's first, the rest of the order to be announced) October 24th-31st - round four submissions accepted and posted November 1st - Reynold and I move into our aparment November whenever I can get the internet hooked up in the new place - judgements posted, and winners announced.

       Here's one from last October in Aleppo. I understand if the contest won't accept old stuff, but I think it's pretty good regardless.  And it's nice to remember how a year ago we were not on this continent.   A white coat buttoned all the way up keeps the chill off I suppose, though a better supposition is that she wears it to draw eyes to her: eyes like mine.  The contrast is astounding between her and her five companions.  All are dressed in black head to toe though only two have their faces covered: the slender unblemished one who wears the mask to prove her piety that she holds to a higher purpose than her beauty and the tub full of bulldog woman whose hand is constantly beneath the mask pulling at teeth and nostrils.  As a group they're dwarves or nuns, but not the girl in the white coat buttoned all the way up.  She is definitely a girl in the Western mould.  From her crossed legs left over right whose feet kick restlessly to her book she purports to study but yanks her eyes away from as boys walk by to her delight when the tea cart comes along and she can pick out things for her companions that I hesitate to call her friends through some slight prejudice of mine.  I'd like to think she's with them as a kind of background to show off the whiteness of her coat which draws you to the healthy curves of her face.  Then a communication engineer comes up to you to offer you a meal + a place to sleep and nudging off those advances of friendship causes you to lose sight of her and then she's gone.  Three dwarves from the nunnery remain on the bench in that square but none of them wear a white coat.

      It's official - I propose a writing contest between the resident "journalist" and the resident "african" (and anyone else who thinks they can write a cool fucking post.)  Justin's held the top spot until he just got "one-upped" by Reynold's slow descent into insanity piece.  Oh Justin you've had some good posts in the past... certainly blowing the everyman's out of the water (my own horse fucking shit rants included), but now's time to show us your true grit.  Show us what that fancy school and that tiny apartment are teaching you - knock our socks off.  To anyone else that wants to enter - you must first submit a piece to me or any other members of the DJS5 who've pulled out of the race.  The sample piece must not be the same as the feature contest piece - and the contest piece must be of equal or great calibre than the sample.  Write away people, write away!

      My slow decline into insanity I believe started with those bastards called Rickshaw Wallahs.  These men began to make me bitter and jaded, I arrived back in Winnipeg forgetting about how my soul has been shredded and life began to seem normal again.  Then came the Africa trip which was supposed to be like going home I never imagined that Africa would continue to eat away at me further letting me slip nearer to the deep abyss.  I should not really blame Africa for my problems worsening, but a group of 13 Canadian Mennonites.  These Mennoites believed that one should not drink because that leads to dancing and dancing leads to Aids. Since i'm no dancer I do neat need to fear the Aids, but drinking is a wonderful way to escape the awful, incessant sounds of poorly sung hymns.  Since I was trapped with nowhere to escape it lead to banging my head against a window untill I began to see spots flash across my eyes.  I figure the brain damage I suffered that week on the bus almost made me give up and I was ready to throw my sanity at the Fuckers at the back of the bus who just wouldn't shut up.  For the rest of the trip I was living on a precarious balance, but I managed to hold on and Survive two gruelling weeks of Mennonite tours and conference.  I was ready to make my escape, I found my way onto a train leaving Bulawayo but we were no more than twenty minutes from the station when Bam! our train hit a half ton truck killing the two people inside.  It became a rather depressing 19 hours to vic falls and when we arrived it felt like a sad escape, but it was an escape so soon my depression lifted and I managed to claw my way back up from insanity.  Finally I arrive back in Winnipeg but summer is over school has started and people are in the middle of their busy lives.  I deal with it, but now I have been back for one week  and it feels like an eternity since I was in Africa.  I have just finished working 32hrs over the last three days and I have another eight to look forward to, there does not appear to be any breaks untill october.  I feel as if I am slipping again I just hope I make it untill October...

      I've a new favourite past time!  After listening to the crazy whack jobs that come out only on crappy American Radio, I now spend at least half an hour an evening scanning the AM band for more of these dingleberrys.  While not as funny as the woman who said "I'm not saying he was murdered, it's just that a number of people including myself, believe he was murdered" - this will certainly stay with me for a while:  (background - they're discussing some twisted metal cross that was found in the rubble of the WTC attacks, and whether or not it should be incorporated into the new design)  Host - "Well Jim* from Chicago, what do you think about the atheists oppostion to displaying the cross in the new design?" Jim - "Well Tom, I believe we have to be careful not to step on any toes here... let's use the new buildings to unify our country, not put any more boundaries up" Host - "Jim, what's wrong with keeping the cross?  We can fashion Jew stars out of metal if that would appease their desires, can't we?" Jim - "That's not the point, let people worship what they want, don't push it down our throats." Host - "What harm has a little religious devotion ever done to us anyhow?  How is a little faith and conviction a bad thing?" Jim - "Well it seems a few people with religion and conviction flew a couple airplanes into buildings two years ago - that was probably a bad thing don't you think?" Host - "umm - uhhh, cut to commercial"  I lost it - I laughed so hard I almost took the truck into the ditch - so good!  That signal came in from Chicago by the way... I love inversion and the AM band!    * - names have been changed to protect the funny and stupid alike!

      I'm all pent up, a candidate to become a loose cannon I tells ya!  So our baseball team (the T-Bars) decided to not show up for the playoffs.  The team is usually made up of myself, Jay, Jared, Jamie, Nicole, Dallas, Jessica, Crystal, Ben, and Mitch... Jared and Dallas are in Ottawa - Nicole "has" to work (her father owns the fucking place - you'd think she could take a fucking sunday off here and there) - Jamie is out for some unknown reason - Crystal, Ben and Mitch (being Dallas' friends and not liking us all that much) pulled out - and Jessica doesn't want to play.  This leaves a team of 2 - Myself and J.R. - which means that we're not going to be playing - which means I'm pissed right off!  Oh well - it's the first NFL sunday of the season tmrw and that should be enough to keep me going!

      I grew up never knowing the wonders of watching Sesame Street.  It was Djibouti Street where I grew up.  Pretty much everything had the Djibouti name on it, from the country to the city to most of my friends.  I remember getting up early every morning to crawl outside where the television was.  Even though the sun was just waking up, it was already Djibouti hot out.  I'd meet up with my friend Larry and his brothers Djibouti and Djibouti and we'd settle into the dust for our puppetwatching fun.  One of us always had to stand up to shade the television so it wouldn't melt.  Djibouti usually got picked because he was the biggest.  For the longest time he didn't know that we could see Big Djibouti's imaginary friend Djiboutiupagus on screen.  We'd watch Djibouti street for an hour before switching over to Mister Djibouti's Neighbourhood, or The Friendly Djibouti.  Then if no one had come to get me when they took the others home it'd be time for The Price is Djibouti! in which Djiboutans would make wildly inaccurate guesses on how much toothpaste cost in America.  "Five Thousand Djiboutis!" was the standard answer, when us smug worldly kids knew it was far closer to twenty.  I loved television.

      Alright, no people on "approved list" received appeal applications by the appeal deadline so the scores of 4 and 1.9 stand!  Next - This round's submission deadline is 24 hours after the first contestant submits.  If you do not check the blog or can't come up with something in enough time... you lose!  For God's sake Justin - let Reynold submit first (haha).  Okay the theme has to draw from early childhood experience.  Justin is not allowed to write about how he was abducted by a Kalahari tribesman and brought up to love Jesus through consistent beatings with a Springbok's pelt.  Reynold is not allowed to write about his early childhood move to Manitoba to escape Leroy, his mother's "business manager," Tommy (who for some reason always carried a bottle of baby powder), and to leave his mother's former life as a Call Girl behind them.  You will lose points for missing the hint.  You will lose points for blood stained cocks and wide eyed antelopes.  You will lose points for making fun of big guy's who go flying into a corner and end up shifting a vertebrae!  You will lose points for refering to an abortion as an "ovarian mulligan."  You will lose points for refering to the Queen's backside as an "ass" - it is clearly not a donkey... rather a North American Reindeer - a Caribou of sorts.

      On Sunday I was at my aunt and uncles for dinner and I was talking to my three year old cousin.  She told me, (imagine a cute little girl with blond locks holding up three little pudgy fingers)  "I'm thwee."  I asked her when her birthday was.  She told me, "Apwil."   I told her how I was a complete bastard  for missing her third birthday and if should would ever forgive me.  She said, "I will fowgive you wenold," and gave me a quick peck on my cheek. I then asked if she ever forgotten somebodies birthday or missed an important date.  She told me this story:  "wonce when I was wittle I went to the pawk and saw a big dawg.  The dawg wan up to me and bit me here (she points to her left arm where there is a little scar)then we had to go to the doctow and he put a bandid on my awm."  She looked so sad when she told me this story. So don't be bastards and make my little cousin cry again.  Also, if my cousin can forgive me for missing her birthday six months ago, you guys can forgive me for being two days late with this entry. Think of the Children.

       Today.   Noonish.  22 days, 23 hours early.  Eighteen thousand legionnaires are standing as unflaccid as they wished their dicks were.  All except the guy on the end next to the cadets, who doesn't need to.  Wish, I mean.  They stand propped up by flags and cliche ridden bagpipe tunes about returning from blindness.  Each one in uniform except for their shoes.  That's the only difference between today and the actual event.  On November 11th they all wear their uniform black shoes, their real Remembrance Day shoes.  There's a parade and wreath laying like this every day though, for these half senile former/wannabe soldiers and their ladies' auxilliaries who forget and put on the wrong shoes.  Today is all about forgetting.  It makes them giddy to be called upon to lay a wreath.  It's the only thing they've laid in a long long time.  The exception again is the guy on the end.  He's taking advantage of everyone's distraction to undo the fly of a tuba playing eleven-year-old cadet.  Vile old thing, you can see him think, but they don't let them in the band any younger.  There's fear in the boy's eyes while applause ripples politely through the ranks.  Speeches about never forgetting are stirring the poppy stained flag from its limpness.  No one watches the mess that's made while a pride filled woman is assisted in her wreath laying.  The guy on the end has slipped back to his position.  He gives the cadet next to him a sticky nudge.  The chaplain steps up to the mic for a rousing prayer, before they parade off again, guns loaded with defective ammunition.  He encourages god to encourage everyone gathered to never forget.  Never forget all the soldiers who were attacked, violated or just couldn't swim in all the days that came before.   This wrongly-shod day, though, we're supposed to disremember.

      As some of you might have read the Chinese are now able to get their tiny asses into space which seems to have frightened NASA slightly.  NASA thought they had a near monopoly on getting things into space with the only competition being the ex-commies who need billionaires who want to go into space.  Since most billionaires are smart enough not to trust the rickety old spacecrafts there is a very low market of billionaires ready to try their luck with the Russian space program, therfore NASA really does not have anything to worry about with the Russians.  Now all of a sudden there is a second communist country that has reached space, and with cheap chinese labour the Chinese might be able to undercut the exceedingly rich NASA folk and get things into space much cheaper, destroying the NASA monopoly of getting things into space.  To counteract this very disturbing news to NASA folk, they came up with this fantasy of building a 100 000 km elevator into space with solar panels crawlers cheaply carying things into space in an attempt to steal some of the glory away from the Chinese.  The Chinese I'm sure will have none of this and put the first Chinese on the moon to pee on the American flag.  NASA had better be worried with Chinas cheap labour, and with communism's zero fatality record in space things are looking a little desperate for NASA.

      Watching  urlLink CITY BY THE SEA  right now - it's great to see DeNiro play an emotionally torn cop who squints all the time and talks beneath his own breath.  Great to see him branch out.  I know it's his character but he plays it so well!  The movie itself is shit until now, but being a Bobby flick I've got to give it a chance and see it through.  Great camera work and lighting though!  Decent angles in every scene.  Great tits on Eliza Dushku who plays DeNiro's son's ex-girlfriend/mother of his child.  Her eyes are so deep - you could just fall right on in.  And now, finally, to the first assignment for the writing contest:  I will remind both of you that it may be either an original work or a previously (unpublished) work.  This round is worth 10 points.  You will be marked on creativity, coolness, form and extras.  There will be penalties for excessive use of commas, crimson tide references, and lack of drug use.  If you would like to challenge a score - feel free to submit to three people from the "approved list" and we will throw out the high and low scores and take the middle.  Round One entries must be submitted by Sunday evening at 8pm.  You may either submit the entires via email or blog post.  Note that all entries will be posted on the blog once scores are determined.  Blog readers may challenge a ruling - but unless a written appeal is received from the contestant there will be no changes in score.   Round 1 - Seeing as how I forgot that this contest was supposed to start on Steve's birthday - the theme is forgetfulness of semi important dates!  Define the theme as you like - however you may be required to explain your definition!  Write away Justin and Reynold... write away!

      And in what Sean listens to news,  urlLink BLACK LIBERATION RADIO .  I started downloading Dan Bern tunes and a bunch of The Vines stuff... but by the end of the hour I had Nat X skits and a fuckload of gospel music... the black man in me got liberated.  (to nip this one right in the bud - yes Steve I ate a black man and he's free now... Justin, I didn't clench so hard that I ripped a black man's dick off... Hassie, my hatred of the Haka doesn't re-constrict the black man inside me... and finally - shut up Reynold.)

      So, with the rugby world cup starting on Friday and I'm in a pool with the guys from work.  Unfortunetely I can't pick the outcome or any of the teams, we just get a random team drawn from the top ten and the bottom ten.  Here's my prediction of how the pools will end up though - feel free to share your opinion sir Hassie (wherever the fuck you are).  Pool A-     Winner - Ireland     Runner - Australia Pool B-     Winner - Scotland     Runner - France Pool C-     Winner - England     Runner - South Africa Pool D-     Winner - New Zealand     Runner - Wales  First Round Playoff Winners     1) New Zealand     2) Ireland     3) Australia     4) England  Second Round Winners     1) New Zealand     2) England  World Cup Champion will be England, 3rd place will go to Australia (only because they're hosting it and they will have the crowd and the country behind them.)

      You know what I hate?  Assholes who don't get the hint the first two times!  Guys that call late, disrespecting house rules (effectively disrespecting my parents) and try to berate and irate friend to come out when he's obviously chosen to stay in.  Simple rule #1 - cell phone is off I'm either sleeping, working or preparing to do one of those.  Simple rule #2-8 - John Ritter's dead so we won't ever know the last 7... it looks like Steve has just one simple rule to follow now!

      A few things: 1) I bought the scarface anniversary edition today... 2) I bought a John Prine anthology today... 3) I bought a beveled glass cutting board today... 4) I tried to buy another gecko today, but there were none that I liked* 5) I finished lullaby by Chuck Palahniuk today... (better than monsters, close to survivor, but nowhere near fight club and choke)...  * - when looking for a new gecko, one of the pet store guys asked if I was buying it for my child.  It seems that I'm too old to be buying geckos, they're a child's pet apparently... this is the reptile they recommend to kids who have succesfully negotiated an anole!  Wow - my dreams of building a gecko terrarium where all can live in freedom (of religion, from persecution, from military service), a geckosylvannia if you will, were shattered by the guy's laughs.  He told me if I wanted a real herp I had to get a bearded dragon (I want an arid environment dude... the smell of the humid lizards [iguana, skink] is too much for me).  How does adding a beard make it a suitable pet for me?  I happen to like Max Diefenbaker, so much so that in the new and improved terrarium (bigger, better, more trees [if anyone knows their sylvannia references]) I'm going to have his very own diefenbunker!  If there's ever a nuclear attack, the top members of government will be safe - their wives have to stay home and die though!  I'm debating as to where I'll put the bank of gecko vault, but I'll let you know later!  If anything the guy should laugh at me being a geek and leave the choice of reptile thing alone!

      So, do you have a rulebook for the Star Trak CCG - first edition laying around?  Ren and I started to play this afternoon - wuickly realizing that we don't know how to play.  I can remember bits and pieces but there are still a lot of holes.  I tried looking for the rules online here - but they can't be found.  Just second edition rules or universal first edition rules - no 1994 rule sets to be found.  So Justin - send them here buddy... we need them!

      Things that piss me off about living with Reynold: 1) He doesn't post responses to blog entry contests; 2) He takes all the covers; and 3) He watches Crouching Tiger in dubbed English.  That's all - oh and we're having an apartment warming/ren's birthday party next Saturday (15th) - stop by and drink yourself stupid...

      Reynold and I are now connected to the internet.  I haven't seen my roomie in over a day now and I really don't know when he's moving in... but we've got two computers hooked up to the net now - it should be all good from here on in.  Just to note that my back is still fucked up - especially after ren and andrew put my bed in the closet and I had to pull it out.  That hurt.  Arranging the living room so that all we can have decent conversation with guests and not around boxes.  That hurt too.  Filling the fridge with beer and emptying the scotch bottles.  Didn't hurt so much.  Email me if you need the phone number and address.

      Back from a major hiatus and now sans ads this is discojivesuper5.  I use this as a place for interesting links and such.  Other DJS5ers do other things.  At least they have in the past.  Personally I'd like to see more blogging about Big Loud's new foray into university and musical exploits from that Alverstone drummer sometimes known as the Poor Choices.
