      when i sleep i allow these visions of you to surround me, memories. i like to remember life in your arms, you always feel like home.. no matter how long or how far.. you'll always feel like home to me.. comfort in honesty.. comfort in you and me.. i sleep and i allow myself to remember you here with me.. i know i do, because i wake up and i always remember my dreams, however obscure they may seem. as long as some trace of you is there with me, my dreams stick inside my memories. memories of you feel like home.. you feel like home.. maybe one of these days.. i'll be home.  - a piece of you is here with me..

       wow. bored. crack. went to class. and i'm FUCKING aggrivated now. yeah that's right, i'm FUCKING cursing because it's so much bullSHIT, oh yeah, i'm getting FUCKING yelled at for stupid SHIT because my stepdad is an ASSHOLE. apparently i curse too much. how about them MOTHER FUCKING&nbsp;apples.   oh well. my parents are trying to use super stalker skills on my brother, and they want me to like be a FUCKing pawn in it, it's FUCKing ridiculous. b/c he goes to "work" but he is never parked there, and he doesn't ever wear his work clothes and he is never like dirty like a mechanic should be, and if he is getting dressed at work, why doesn't he ever have dirty laundry? whatever i could give two SHITs less about wether or not his stupid&nbsp;ASS has a job, he is just being fucking retarded now, and i'm so sick of hearing about it every god DAMN day. and i'm sick of having to call him to basically lie to him, they wanted me to call him and be like, where are you? i need a ride, i'm stranded. so what if he said yes, i wasn't even at the school anymore. so i would be basically selling him out, and thats just FUCKed up. fuck them, just give up on him already, what do they want me to tell them? blah. &nbsp;   i feel very not loved lately, and i better not hear any&nbsp;SHIT from anyone on this, it's just how i feel, i know people love me and all that fun stuff... but whatever, it's not even worth writing down. feelings change. people change too. &nbsp;   i wrote some fun poetry in class today. wanna see? of course you do.     Never Cold. 7/27   i'm almost sure my body's sleeping.  closed off to the world; hibernating.  you try to say i'm cold, but my body's not shaking.  i am not shaken & i am not afraid.  the heat i am keeping penetrated your bones  while you were there sleeping with me in your arms.  that love kept us warm. but this hate boils my blood.  so now that i'm hiding, you think that i'm cold.  little do you know my heart beats so fast that it  boils my blood &amp; i'll never be cold again. - christine. &nbsp;   I Lived (in your arms) 7/27 &nbsp;   you thought that you were the one keeping me warm.  all those nights i lived in your arms.  we were always so close but we kept ourselves so far.  you never accepted that i was still living while we were apart.  thought i could never be warm without you there.  what a way to show how much you cared. (that much faith in me?)  leave me here see if i can still feel.  with my heart in your hands, you poked and prodded,  but never breaking it again.  saying how you would never leave me to be cold. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep my heart warm in your hands, or  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; please reintroduce it to this hold in my chest.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - christine.     yeah, i wrote the first one out of boredom. and then when i read it i felt like contradicting myself partially. emotionally monogamous with a sentimental overdrive and a habit to hold old grudges just as long as&nbsp;i hold onto everything else. and we all know, i have a big problem with temptation, expectation, and letting go. - i don't know what to sign these things anymore. so i guess i won't. &nbsp;&nbsp;      the one thing that i'll never get is how you turned out like all the rest, but i can take it, i can take it.

      so today i went to school, went to the doctor, tore apart my house looking for my social security card, found my cell phone, went to the school, got my working papers, went to pathmark, applied for a job, went to roseannas, went in her neighbors pool, ate dinner, came home, got dressed, went to old navy, went to lisas, ate some cake, borrowed some movies, came home, got pissed off b/c my computer was being an asshole, cleaned my room, started my laundry, went downstairs to go thru all of my stuff and throw as much as i could away, filled 2 garbage bags, that both wound up breaking because they were so full, got all of my other shit in boxes and brought it up here, cleaned all the rose petals and stupid shit off the floor of the basement, changed over my laundry, turned the power back on for my computer, sat down, and now im taking a breath before i go fold my laundry, do the dishes, shower, lay down, watch a movie and go to sleep.&nbsp; i'm too tired to even finish doing shit, but i'm too tired to get in trouble so i'm just gonna make myself do it, tomorrow i'm gonna go thru my shit and try and figure out what i'm putting back on my walls and shit, because yeah, i don't even know anymore..  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well i need to go, before i pass out, i love you fireflies,&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are my sunshine..&nbsp;&nbsp;over, over again.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-christine.    if only i had one more chance to change my life today then i would never let you go all my friends keep telling me that i should leave you for a while so you must show your love to me and tell me what you feel i thought that even you had feelings for me too i know i was wrong and baby when you care, then i will be there by your side and now i stand here alone in the dark without you there's nothing more that i would like than be with you  i close my eyes but i can't stop thinking of you  and now i stand here alone in the dark without you..

       I hope that you missed me   I'm glad that you kissed me   I'll see you again when I die  know that I missed you  know that I'll kiss you  Whenever an angel flies by..  Crazy in bathtubs  Those  innocent  backrubs..  I know its confusing,  I know its amusing..  We walk, we find  I dance by your inner mind     I just want to thank you  The pain made me stronger  The artist is what I will stay      Know I'll forgive you  Hope I'll outlive you  I'm glad that you stood in my way   Want to thank you my friend  Want to thank you again  Want to thank you...     stage kiddos. stage.

         i cant ever explain this feeling in my gut and why you leaving always leaves me in a rut i get stuck and every fucking time i start to wonder why i even bother to count the days when i think of it you might just be far away marking down the tally till you cant remember these days or even my face if i cant cry the tears because they wont come out does that mean that this body remembers what you are about and it really knows what the deal is this body has been keeping count of these things ive been taking for granted does it count how many tears ive shed how many were wasted it recalls the things you should have said it even remembers what you meant every time that i was gone in the head it could see thru my alcohol blurred vision to the reason why you would only approach me when i was stuck in a drunken daze stuck drunken and stuck the only thing i could need they wouldnt let me leave trying to and succeeding rebuilding this dependency this dependency that was slowly dying with that part of me you always had that way to know when my defenses were down they all always fall down so you could slip yourself back in and so you could always stay around youd never be forgotten in that defenseless mind state i could have never seen you left in the lost and found    I cant ever explain this feeling in my gut  why you leaving, always leaves me in a rut.  I get stuck. (every fucking time. )   I start to wonder why I bother  to count the days when I think of it,  you might just be far away marking down the tally  till you can¡¦t remember these days (my face)   if I cant cry the tears because they wont come out  does that mean that my body remembers what you are about  (really knows what the deal is?)  this body has been keeping count of these things  I¡¦ve been taking for granted (it counts)  how many tears I've shed (how many were wasted.)  it recalls the things you said (even remembers what you meant.)   every time that I was gone in the head,  it could see thru (my alcohol blurred vision)  to the reason why you would only approach me  when I was stuck in a drunken daze (stuck, drunken and stuck)      (--they wouldnt let me leave, it was the only thing i could need--)  (-the only thing I need, never let me leave-)  (the only thing could never need, they wouldn¡¥t let me leave)  trying to (and succeeding) rebuild this dependency  (this dependency) was slowly dying with that part of me   always had that way to know when my defenses were down, (all fall down)  so you could slip yourself back in (so you could always stay around.)  you'd never be forgotten. (left in the lost and found)       one sentence, expands itself into a thousand forgotten forevers. your memory plays on repeat, yet negates everything you should remember about you and me.        -whomever i choose to be.

        me :&nbsp; i realize you need not my advice just my love.&nbsp; you know you have that.&nbsp; what do i give away now?&nbsp; what do you do when there is nothing left to process package and send away?   lisa :&nbsp; wrap up truth in denial.&nbsp; it leaves something to reveal.&nbsp; rip thru the layers of half-lies because  honesty only means something when it's given as a gift , not as an expectation.  me :&nbsp; a sucker for words, silence means more than expectations.&nbsp; over time you learn that eyes lie.&nbsp; crying doesn't count if you can't look at me while you do it.&nbsp;  deviate the emotion, be somebody else.   lisa :&nbsp; somebody is still something.&nbsp; there will always be something to cry about.&nbsp; the ultimate goal is to be nothing with  nothing left worth the tears.   me :&nbsp; nothing is impossible.&nbsp; impossible is nothing.&nbsp; the  same thing  is the  wrong thing .&nbsp; the wrong thing is nothing.&nbsp; yet it is everything.  lisa :&nbsp; everything turns to nothing.&nbsp; this is the great cliche of living.&nbsp; if silence is golden, give me bronze instead.&nbsp;  i'd rather hear you speak the lies than find them hiding in your eyes .  me :&nbsp; who needs to hear the lies?&nbsp; when you look at me you know they're there.&nbsp; you can feel them when i look away from you.&nbsp; you feel the hidden meaning. &nbsp; the reason i'm lying .&nbsp; you feel my love for you.  lisa :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what i feel is chemical reaction.&nbsp; seratonin.&nbsp; estrogen.&nbsp; testosterone.&nbsp; love is a mating ritual void of meaning.&nbsp; we are not hearing the lies,   we are the lies. &nbsp; we are not looking for truth. &nbsp; we are looking for a reason to reproduce.   -- i only let her have the last word because it was the end of the page. that cunt went a fucked up the entire mood.  on purpose  hah.. we are psychos. it took us like 3 weeks to do that. good job us. i like it tho, i bolded the things that stand out most to me. too much fun.

         and it's just about time for me to get off this roller coaster, there is only so many times that those last couple loops seem to meet your expectations.. after a while there is no surprise in the circling, upside down, going so fast that life seems to fade feeling. the same thing will only get a reaction a certain amount of times.. that last loop before you start all over again.. it's just not intriguing anymore.. it was always worth it.. but it's not good to regurgitate all&nbsp;your memories because of the loops, whorls and speed that this roller coaster brings.&nbsp;     - - then the person on the loud speaker at the theme park, who has been acting as god the enitre time, stopping and starting the ride whenever they have please has just announced as i perpared to get off:   next stop, stability.   &nbsp;        now i just have to fight that temptation to get back on the ride the one last time before i leave the park..        --hope.         life used to be so much easier when..  good-bye only meant till tomorrow  and the fun went on forever..

       and that's just it. the grey point. the spot where you got torn right down your fucking middle. the point where you were so  happy  but you wanted  to be hysterical . the point where your logical side tells itself it's being irrational, and that irrational tendancy is  the only thing that feels right.  you want to use some stupid quote to define yourself. and then you look at everything you have saved and realize you have never ever felt like this before. it's good and it's bad. and it's just everything, and nothing at the same time. it's just a figment of your imagination. some big imaginary joke you play on yourself. and then every word you hear out of other peoples mouths makes your mind regurgitate these memories and you want to laugh and you want to cry and you want to forget it all but never let it go at the same time. you want to give everything while fighting yourself to hold back that one comment you have to say. censor yourself while blowing up the world. yeah thats it, thats the point... the spot i'm at.    &nbsp;  whew. uhm, sorry to anyone who just read that.. stream of chaos.. it's all good it's all wrong. i have been massively neglecting this journal, and i guess this is why, because i can't write coherent sentences about these boring days without going off on these tangents and it seeming like i am on a one track mind. maybe i am. shut up. i think about things that are outside of my head. just not often. shush. i can tell what you are thinking. stop contradicting me. eh, fuck it.     &nbsp;  i miss you sunshine.    i am listening to the nutcracker. i hate the world. no i don't. what the fuck am i thinking out loud&nbsp;for still?? &nbsp;lisa says she sounds like a manic depressive psycho..&nbsp;i think we both do. i wonder if you can adopt imaginary friends. i need one. oh god. i'm gonna stop now.    &nbsp;  -if i told you this was killing me, would you stop?

      i do not really know what my problem is or why i am so deeply moved by a quote from a childrens movie. i can't help it i suppose. i miss thinking in clear coherent streams of consciousness. i guess i do not like other peoples points of view today. i think that what that person said, was a negative conclusion on a person they have only met a few times, and have heard many conversations about. i don't think they should have such an opinion, but at the same time i see how they are just trying to look out for me. but it hurt. i think you should not judge that other person yet, because from all that i know about the both of you, you are almost exactly the same. so maybe you see yourself in this person, maybe you don't like the person you see in the mirror.   No. No, you can't...  STOP.  Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave... if you leave... I just, I remember things better with you. I do, look. P. Sherman, forty-two... forty-two... I remember it, I do.  It's there, I know it is, because when I look at you, I can feel it. And-and I look at you, and I... and I'm home.   Please... I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget.     i understand that your worst is beating the hell out of my best but i can take it, i can take it.  -- forever and always --        Christine...

       every morning that i wake up it still feels like the morning after..  what a roller coaster i play around on.. it's all good, it's all wrong. you can't get through it, you can't get over it. you can't get around. it's like in a dream when you open your mouth to scream and you can't make a sound. you are going down. you are the only one who isn't afraid to keep hugging me when i'm not ready to let go yet. there is nothing like looking at your own history in the faces of your friends. i took that second look, i guess i'm an open book. i didn't intend to hold onto you that long, but i noticed  i wasn't the only one hanging on.  love conquers all. every cloud has a silver lining. faith can move mountains. love will always find a way. everything happens for a reason. where there is life, there is hope. i mean they have to tell you something don't they? i've got all these excuses but i don't have an answer, because your always innocent,  because you're never honest.  it's hard to keep my balance when you look the other way so i'm letting go with every breath I take. so many reasons, i need something more to believe in. the time has come to turn and walk away. through all these changes, mistakes, there was time but now its too late. some things are better stressed when unexpressed, cause silence can be overwhelming. we'll find some way that we can prove you wrong.  i should've known that you were a killer, but now i'm dead.   so what now? - Christine.

      another chapter, in a new book. it will be happy. i promise. i am going to try to not neglect this chapter in my life, it will be well accounted for..  "Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. It comes to us at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arives and puts itself in our hands. It hopes we've learned something from yesterday." - John Wayne.  i found that quote last night, made me all misty-eyed.. among other things.. i like it a lot tho, i think it's true, but no one really ever looks at 'tomorrow' in that kind of a sense..   i need sleep... i should go...      i will always be somewhere being there for you..     with love, - a work in progress.

      today i found out about def poetry jam going on so close to my birthday and made this big thing about it.. and i am determined to go.. and i got all happy and excited and i thought of how perfect it was going to be, especially since it was so close to my birthday.. also that i could afford it if i wanted to.. and then i realized how bad i wanted you to be the one sitting next to me.. i wanted you to get to see what i see.. i know you'd love it as much as i do.. i want you to smile.. i wanted to love every minute of it, love feeling complete.. i wanted it to be you and me, just like it used to be. please say you'll come.. we can make it like last year all over again.. you can't say you didn't have a blast. - Christine.   oh well, apparently nothing.. apparently nothing at all.

      Wackiness: 4/100 Rationality: 10/100 Constructiveness: 4/100 Leadership: 4/100  You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower.  This makes you an evil genius.  You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You  prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide.  Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with.

      tomorrow is just as soon as now, is just as present as yesterday, but farther than my heart can fathom. as soon as one moment passes, we create another, and with that new moment fades the past, and makes the future all the more clear.  <3 Christine..

      i apologize i've been having a breakdown and have found myself not being able to think or write. this breakdown of mine is completely unfounded and so profound because it's unlike any i've ever had or seen before. just random not even crying but not being able to speak and tears just rolling down my face and i didn't care who saw, because i knew that it wasn't really me crying. i think my body is just going insane. i tried to talk to myself, kind of in a what i would say to other people when they asked, and i came to the conclusion that nothing was wrong, but my body was so full of everything that is me, that the overflow was coming out of my eyes. & i guess that makes me completely irrational.  add this to the list i have not started of things that make you feel like  "where you are is right where you are supposed to be"  :  sitting on the beach wrapped in a blanket at dawn on a late september morning.   i'll be going now, i am sorry, i will write  soon.  -- Christine.

      oo love it love it love it. case. missing you.   Standing here looking out my window My nights are long and my days are cold Cause I don't have you How can I be so damn demanding? I know you said that it's over now But I can't let go Every day I want to pick up the phone And tell you that  You're everything I need and more If only I could find you Like a cold Summer afternoon Like the snow coming down in June Like a wedding without a groom I'm missing you I'm the desert without the sand I'm the one without a band I'm a ring without a hand I'm missing you Driving 'round thought I saw you pass me My rearview mirror's playing tricks on me Cause you fade away Maybe I'm just hallucinating Cause my loneliness got the best of me  And my heart's so weak   love it. well.. todays list: waiting for: ricky sal joe brian n dana to get back from the mall. roseanna to get back from ikea. cara to call me after work. my mom to get off. to go to starbucks and be spontaneous. this cd to finish uploading. dustin to e-mail me back... i don't like this list. i hate waiting.  christine.

I'm so cool I have things that say Gucci, But too bad I can't get just one single smoochy, I like to wear my stolen thongs way up in my crack, I also like stealing books about things like smack. I think I'm in love cause every night I fuck this guy, Too bad everyone else in the world just wants me to die. I'm such a slut I love giving lap dances to chicks, And my mouth is poisoned cause I'm always sucking dicks, I said that I was ugly and that's the reality, But I'm a skitzo and I got another personality."

      I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles In our eyes are mirror images and when We kiss they're perfectly aligned And I have to speculate that God himself Did make us into corresponding shapes like Puzzle pieces from the clay True, it may seem like a stretch, but Its thoughts like this that catch my troubled Head when you're away when I am missing you to death When you are out there on the road for Several weeks of shows and when you scan The radio, I hope this song will guide you home They will see us waving from such great Heights, 'come down now,' they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away, 'come down now,' but we'll stay... I tried my best to leave this all on your Machine but the persistent beat it sounded Thin upon listening That frankly will not fly. you will hear The shrillest highs and lowest lows with The windows down when this is guiding you home They will see us waving from such great Heights, 'come down now,' they'll say But everything looks perfect from far away, 'come down now,' but we'll stay...
