      I had another dream about being chased again last night.  There was some sort of trial over a shooting, and even though the guy had the gun in his possession that he used to kill the victim, they couldn't use it, because it was his property.  So a friend and I decided to steal the gun.    urlLink "Weze stolez it"   and I took off running with the evidence hoping it wouldn't go off.  I ended up hiding out in a Domino's Pizza where the suspect and his friends also ended up.  They didn't know, or let me to believe they didn't know I was the person they were looking for. We were watching the domino's pizza guy make those new domino's dots. (Note:  Had kettle corn around 9:30 the night before.)  The night before I had a dream where my aunt had another baby, 21 years after her youngest child.  The baby was a boy, Joseph, with two odd middle names, Stawartz.  This was a very detailed dream.  They brought out pictures of their three oldest to find out who Joseph looked like, I think it was Larry, but he stuck out his tonge like Cory.  Very, very strange dream. (Note: Had an Amaretto Sour around 10 the night before and dined on tootsie rolls before slipping into my peaceful slumber.)

      Things I should have done when the   urlLink crazy guy   asked me out: 1.  Said sure, I'm not busy. 2.  Given him the phone number...what phone number you ask, one of   urlLink these.

      We just had our first real fire alarm after the new ones were installed.  Funny thing was, as the man was say, "May I have your attention please, a fire emergency has been reported in the building..." we all sat wondering if it was real.  Turns out it was, and two fire trucks showed up, one with a ladder, & two cop. The culprit: someone was left their toast in the toaster.  This was way too much excitement for one day!  I think we should all be sent home due to the fact that many individuals will not be able to function properly after this near death experience.   (Okay, near death may be a little over dramatic, but I'll say anything if it'll mean I get to get out of work early.)

      Maybe I'm wrong about always meeting strange guys on the street.  Last week while driving some kid, well he looked young to me, was waving at me from his car, then putting his fingers up to his ears like a phone.  Then again, how was I suppose to call him when I didn't have his number.  Okay so he was strange too, but at least he looked like he took a shower that day!

      So there I am innocently waiting at the bus stop, just waiting to go home, & I get hit on by a crazy man. (Why don't normal people scope me out?) This guys walking down the sidewalk saying hi to everyone. He says hi to me, so I return the hello. Actually I don't think I said hi, I think I just nodded. I don't want to be rude, any of you ever see the Dave Matthews Band video for Everyday? (Basically this guy decides he wants to be friendly to people & give strangers hugs. Some people are mean, and push him & beat him up. I wanted to be a nice person, & while I probably wouldn't hug a stranger, I will say hi, or nod.) This guy sees my acknowledgement stops & comes back to talk to me. Oh dear!! He asks me if I'm in school, where I work, where I'm headed, & where I live. Then asks if I'm want to go on a date.  This may seem innocent enough,   but   he was giving me the hebe jebes! I declined, & he walked away.  One of the guys that works in the same building I work in saw the whole thing go down.  Actually he saw the guy coming & quicly turned around so he wouldn't acknowledge him again.  Apparently the "crazy guy" did the same thing to him last week.  I ask if he asked him out too, he said no...phew!! Apparently he got the creeps from this guy too, but was nice enough to keep an eye out for me in case he did something crazy, which was very nice of him.  Next time I'll have to turn pretend like I'm busy next time he comes around. I don't know, maybe I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill...

      One of the kids on my brothers   urlLink basketball team  , Linas Kleiza, played in the   urlLink Jordan Capital Classic   last night.  I've met him once, actually, he scoped me out & introduce himself to me, what can I say I'm irresitable.  He seemed like an okay kid, definitely plays a mean game of basketball!  I went looking for a box score on last nights game, to see how he did & I found an  urlLink  article   about his performance.  I thought the article was good, praised Kleiza for being a "no-nonsense" player, opposite of LeBron James.  I especially liked this quote,  "There are no frills in his game,"  which I think is a compliment, but the quote goes on,   "and no frills in his personality."  Wow...that was harsh! (& apparently untrue!)

      My friend  urlLink  Sara   & I went to  urlLink  Quaker Steak & Lube   last night for dinner, & honestly we couldn't have picked a better night...for it was Biker Night!  This may be a little know fact, but I want a motorcycle. I'm not sure exactly what kind I want, only that a Crotch Rocket, & scooter (Cory!) are not options, but I definitly do want one.  Driving to Cranberry was honestly a chore, cuz I was trailing four 4 guys on motorcycles.  They seemed to be having the time of their lives, doing Pop-o-Wheelies, & my jealousy kicked in.  Gotta get one, I kept telling myself.  When I arrive at the Lube, there were well over 50 bikes, including the four I saw driving down, proudly on dislplay. I had to really concentrate on driving, wipe the drool off of my face, & reassure myself that soon, that too will be me! And Sara too!!

      It took me four months to finish my last book,  Night   Sins  by Tami Hoag.  Four Months!!  The 10 books I read before that took me at most one week.  Even folks at work were how long it was taking me to read and finish this book.  Why?  I've been asking myself the same question.  Why?  Was it a bad book?  No I quite enjoyed it.  Was time an issue?  No, I do most of my reading on the bus to & from work.  Weather, too nice to read inside?  Nope, big chill here on the eastside.  The problem I figured out is that my attention span is getting shorter & shorter.  I learned in one of my college classes that the attention span of a child is their age plus one.  We'll I'll tell you that even if that were true for older people, my attention span isn't 26 minutes.  I blame this on Sesame Street!   (Now if I can only find someone to blame for my periodic bouts of dyslexia???)

      Dr. Cheng, who doesn't speak English, has given Lucky 6 months to live, which is a lot longer than the 1½ to 2 months the other Doctor gave.  Dr. Cheng was also very eager to amputate Lucky's leg, right then & there. We declined.  So, Lucky got some stronger meds, is expected to live for 6 more months, & is officially 6 years old.  The longer life is definitely due to all the love & attention we've bestowed upon him in the last 2½ months.  And of course, the cake I made for him, the roast I crock-potted for him, & the beer I tricked him into drinking! (Don't worry, he's old enough to drink 6 x 7=42.)    edited to add:    Pops is a very happy man!

      Despite an exhausting Tuesday, I got up early this morning & went out to breakfast with Pops.  Actually I was quite surprise at how easy it was to get him to go.  We've (my cousin's & I) have asked him to go out to eat with us in the past, & he's politely turned us down.  I guess the thought of pancakes, his favorite meal, was too tempting to pass up.  Thanks for going to breakfast with me Pops!!

      I was elated the other day to discover that my house had found favor in the eyes of a mama bird, looking for a place to raise her young.  As I walk out the door each morning & look up, I see a little birdies nest, & hear the flap-flap of the mama bird flying away.  Ah, nature.

      I had an absolutely fantastic Memorial Day weekend, with friends & family!  Here's a brief run down:  Friday:  Fun didn't start till after work! Cherie & Sara came down & we went to the Carnegie Science Museum to see a laser light show to the tune of Tool! Very cool!  Though next time, we'll have to sit further back so we can see more of the screen!  Saturday:  I went to the Zoo! with cousin Ben!  All the animals were out, even a couple of the babies!  Baby elephant, orangutang, & baby ape (or gorilla, I forget which one...)  Sunday:  Uncle Herb & Aunt Maria's annual Memorial Day Picnic/Mikey's Annual Birthday party.  Always a fun time, good eatin', good company, good time!  Monday:  The best day of the entire weekend.  Met up with a couple of friends & headed over to Post Gazette Pavilion for another annual event, X-Fest. The line up was, Godsmack, Staind, Evanesence, The Used, The Donnas, Punchline, Cold, The Juliana Theory, Taproot, Trapt, Seether, Smile Empty Soul, Breaking Benjamin, 12 Stones & Eve 6. Phew!! Granted, we didn't go see them all, but we got the major ones, Eve 6, The Juliana Theory (they played the one song I know, wasn't that nice of them?) Evanescence (rocked!), Staind (just as good as they were two years ago, if not better!) Godsmack (awesome!)  Of course the best part of X-Fest was spending time with friends: Cherie: trying to blow powdered sugar on me! Sara: 30 Wiper, need I say more??? Chad: Bleeping out the Godsmack songs for his brother! BEEP!! Pat: rocking hard to the music!  (Dance like no one is watching!!)    Ahhhh...

      Lucky, I'm convinced, knows English. He knows what's going on.  A couple of weeks after we found out that he had cancer, & was given 1½ to 2 months to live, he became very sick, & we thought we were going to have to put him down for the night.  Pops, wanting to be with his friend, slept downstairs, so Lucky wouldn't have to climb the stairs.  I think Lucky knew something bad was going to happen in the near future, & summoned all the power from Helms Deep, & told himself to get better, which he did.  Lately, due to the deterioating effects the medicine has had on his intestines, Lucky's had some diarrhea.  And unfortunately, he's not been able to make it outside a couple of times.  Plus, he's been getting really stubborn.  Won't come downstairs in the morning to go out.  Won't go out at night.  Two nights ago, it's pouring down rain, & lucky won't go outside.  I bribe him with General Tso's chicken & get him in the kitchen.  He goes outside, I give him another piece & then heads right back for the door.  So, thinking he just didn't want to get wet, I grabbed my umbrella (okay I didn't want to get wet either) heated up some more Tso's, put it on a plate and set in at the bottom of the steps.  Boy was that dog being stubborn that night! He went down, took the chicken & then hauled ass back up the stairs (as  quickly as a 150 lbs. rottweiller can with a bum leg) & back inside.  So Pops stayed downstairs, just in case Lucky had to go in the middle of the night.  He finally did at 4 AM.  Pops has a short discussion with CJ about possibly putting Lucky down.  He reasons that if he's having bathroom problems & won't be cooperative, what more can we do?  Well let me tell y'all.  This dog heard the word, put down, & he cleaned his act up!  Last night, went outside with no problems, probably looking at Pops like, what's the fuss, it's not like I've never gone to the bathroom outside before!!  Humans!! Went upstairs with no problems, came downstairs this morning, with everyone else, & went outside.  I'm telling you, he knew!

      I am never going to a movie again without knowing how long it is.  Last night I went to see the Matrix.  Had no idea what how long it was.  Going on the second hour I started to get a little claustrophobic, if you will.  I swear I started hypervenilating, because I didn't know what time I was going to get out of there! Finally it ended.  I remember the same thing happening when I went to see Braveheart.  Completely forgot how long the movie was when I accepted the invitation to go.  Once is okay, but twice is enough for me to say, never again!!

      Here's the story:  A couple of weeks ago, my friends & I went to   urlLink Sing Sing  .  While there, Nate, was beckoned to the other side of the piano stage by a group of eligible females.  Cherie & I periodically stood up to look over to see if he was hitting it off! Well, the last time I stood up, Chad E. Savannah decided to pull my chair out from under me, as I sat down! I gracefully landed on the floor, on my butt in front of a whole lotta people! (Luckly, the entertainers didn't see, or I surely would have been roasted alive!) Well, I wasn't going to sit by the wayside & let Mr. Savannah get away with that, no siree! So I schemed, & I plotted, & today Mr. Savannah received his first subscription to the gay magazine, Unzipped.  Paybacks a bitch ain't it!  I say he got off easy! I had a lot more Mephistophelian ideas going through this imaginative brain.  So Chad's declared war on me! I caution him though, I've got more where that came from! That was a mere warm-up! Be afraid, Mr. Savannah, be very, very afraid!

      It's taken 25 years for me to finally discover this, to find out the truth about myself...I'm a twin.  Sure people have suspected it before: "Your & your brother look so much a like, you could be twins." (This statement always baffled me...) But back to my revelation, my brother, Mike & I are, in fact, twins.  But not the kind you are probably thinking of, we are what are called Irish Twins.  Irish twins are siblings born less than 12 months apart, my brother & I are 11½ months apart. So that makes us official Irish Twins...

      Ever been listening to the radio, hear a song you like, but miss who sings it?  Yeah, happens all the time. Well there's this   urlLink website   out there that has eliminated this problem.  The idea is simple. You select a city, a radio station, & a time, and the song that was playing along with the artist comes up.  Isn't that great? And it appears as though you can go back at least 100 songs, or more.  This will be great for downloading new songs!

      I find this so strange. The left front buckle on my Birkenstock keeps on coming out, but not enough for it to unbuckle, if that makes sense. I'll put the tab back in & sure enough I'll look down & it's out again.  Don't know why it only does it on this side & not the other.  I will have to see how many steps it takes till the tab comes out. Right after I find out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop.

      I went to the grocery store last night to get a few things. Every single line had about half a gazillion people in it, and since I didn't have a lot, I was looking for an express lane. I did not count, at this point, how many items I had, I just knew I didn't have a shopping car full, noticed a short line & hopped into it. A couple of seconds later, a lady gets behind me. That's all I really noticed, & just I went back to daydreaming about something. Like a minute later, one of the employees comes up and says, "Sorry, I have to do this" looks in my cart turns to the lady who was behind me and says, she has 9 items. I was like, who, what, what's going on? Then I saw the look of disgust on my former line neighbor, & she was asked to step out of the express lane cuz she had too many items, & then she complained that I had too many, too. Sheesh, how old are we?

      So I got these   urlLink Hulk Hands   a couple of months ago, after seeing  urlLink  Shepard Smith  , from  urlLink  Fox News  , wear them on the air. They are really quite fun, especially at Charlie's expense.  I decided to wear them to the airport yesterday when I was there picking up Jonathan.  Do you think I got any looks? Sure did. The security lady pointed me out to the security dude & he started laughing! Actually got a lot of grins from folks, who quickly looked away when I spotted them. Others just chuckled to themselves.  I think now, I can wear them running. I mean, if I can wear them at the airport, I surely can wear them around the neighborhood.  Think of the protection they'll offer me? People will either stay away from me cuz they think I'm related to the Incredible Hulk, or they'll stay away from me cuz they think I'm crazy! Either way, they'll keep their distance.

      Jon arrived at PIT last night right on time.  He was greeted by me, his cousin Ben & his other cousin Mike.  Due to the fact we haven't seen each other in a while, we decided we'd better make signs so he would know who we were.  Ben held the   JON   sign, I held the   SPEETS   sign, whilst wearing my   urlLink Hulk Hands  . Mikey just held the   I AM FAT   sign. He walked right by us looking slightly embarrassed! Don't know why? And dang-it if he aint taller than me...argh!!

      I was taking the bus to work this morning & this lady gets on & sits right next to me. Which is fine, except there were tons of other seats available, including one to her left side. I thought there was an unwrittien law, like in  urlLink bathroom etiquette  that states if there are three spaces, the first to people should occupy the spaces farthest from each other. This lady didn't & at one point I thought I was going to start hyperventilation due to claustraphobia.

      I really don't know why, but I've been remembering a lot of my dreams lately! Earlier this year, I had 3 or 4 dreams about my teeth, more specifically, one of my teeth chipping, cracking, basically falling apart. Had another dream like that last night. Now I have a tooth ache, coincidence? I think not!

      I have had several very strange  urlLink  dreams   lately that I'd like to share with you all! Here they are in no particular order: This one was a couple of weeks ago.  I dreamt that I was Clarice Sterling in Silence of the Lamb.  I was running through the woods, like in the first scene, came upon my boss, then we happened upon a pick-up game of basketball where Dale Jones, a guy I work with, was playing while holding a cigarette.  There were also amaretto sours involved. Also, one of my rugrats players was in the stands & I remember the bleachers having huge holes in them that kids could fall through & I remember catching one small child by the cranium trying to save it from falling.  I know why I dreamt the second dream. I was in the middle ages, apparent because I was living in a castle, & everytime I went to use the little ladies room I would hit my head on the arch door way.  The last time I hit my head I nearly passed out.  And everytime I hit my head the same guard was there watching me.  I dreamt this because Arvydas apparently hits his head every time he bounds up the stairs to talk to his neighbors. Oh & he hit his head on the light, that's always been there, that morning.  Sucks being 6'9" I guess!"  I also dreamt that Michael Jackson decided to sacrifice himself, for whatever reason, by being crucified like Jesus.  Despite efforts by the courts to stop his self sacrifice, he was crucified.  I know there was more, I'll be back!   [no spellcheck, no proof reading]

      I got to play Mom last night as I took my cousins to a basketball game, Ben played in it, while the other three watched (pronounced tormented each other) & took notes.* They won, despite numerous, & I mean numerous bad passes, & lazy fouls (Ben fouled out.)  And  I didn't have to hear some punk kid say that's why we'z the champs of dis league...over & over & over & over again.**    Anyway, back to my story. On the way home we were listening to one of my mix CD's. Mikey wanted to have a sing-a-long so we all sang to Mya's  Ghetto Superstar , Sean Paul's  Get Busy  & Laurel did her,  Back that Thang Up  dance. After failed attempts to edit Eminem's  Sing For The Moment  (which is very hard if all you know is the Aerosmith part) I switched over to my  urlLink Clarks  Mix. To my surprise, Laurel, who's 8 (I think) inquires, "Wait, isn't this   urlLink On Saturday  ?"  SCREECH!!!   (those were my brakes, second & third exclamation points added for extra emphasis)  "Why yes, yes it is!" She then informed me that she liked the song, her friend makes her "listen to it  all  the time. You see she has this Dave Matthews/Clarks mix..." (be still my heart) Meanwhile her older brothers & sisters sat there baffled. So Laurel & I had our own little sing-a-long to  On Saturday :  We're breaking up, you're moving out, on Saturday I'm losing friends, I'm losing face, I'm losing weight So get your things out of my place on Saturday On Saturday, on Saturday, on Saturday All the while Beth Anne sat there singing as well (keep in mind, this is the first time she's heard the song,) Ben   sat there pulling out his hair yelling at Beth Anne to shut up cuz "you don't even know the words, you're saying them a second late," & Mikey no doubt thinking about the Wendy's food that was just out of arms reach in the front of the car.    Kudos to Laurel for knowing who the Clarks are!    ç root beer Time to burn the girl a new CD! I though about inviting her to the concert with us on Friday night, but I don't think I could find her a fake ID in time. Maybe next time.    * Note to self: Rethink the whole having/wanting kids topic.  ** Maybe I should change the title of this blog to cynical mirm

       urlLink Beth  was talking about the lady in her office that she suspects as being a  urlLink Germophope . Well there's this lady that I've seen on my bus a few times who wears a mask over her nose & mouth, like a doctor wears, but not disposable. It actually looks like it's custom made.

      Thank you all for coming to this press conference. I would like to start of by saying that on June 20, 2003, our beloved dog Lucky, was tearfully put to rest. Knowing this was going to happen, I, Miriam ask one Christopher James, to take my camera, which I had placed in his box, and take some final pictures of Lucky. Later on, when I inquired about the camera, he said that a Benjamin Alexander had it. Ben said CJ had it, CJ said Ben had it & that in fact he thought it was Ben's. This has gone on for more than a month as today is July 27th. I hereby announce that the camera in question has been in his possession. The camera was confiscated & placed back in the proper hands, mine. I offer my apology to Benjamin Alexander for accussing him of having it & for doubting that he gave it back to Christopher. Thank You! Are there any questions? No? Thank you all once again for attending my little press conference.

      I was asked the question, if I were to choose a dessert what would be my choice:  Angel Food Cake  Brownies  Lemon Meringue Pie  Vanilla Cake with Chocolate Icing  Strawberry Short Cake  Chocolate Cake with Chocolate Icing  Ice Cream, or  Carrot Cake I chose the Brownies & this is what research says about me: You are adventurous, love new ideas, are a champion of underdogs & a slayer of dragons. When tempers flare up, you whip out your saber.   You are always the oddball with a unique sense of humor & direction. You tend to be very loyal.  Okay, so I lied, my first choice was the Lemon Meringue Pie, but brownies would be my second choice, & the brownies seemed more like me, especially the loyalty part. Lemon Meringue Pie: Smooth, sexy, and articulate with your hands, you are an excellent after-dinner speaker and a good teacher. But don't try to walk and chew gum at the same time. A bit of a diva at times, but you have many friends.  Maybe in real life I would have chosen both.

      Dan & I were riding the Magnum, our very last ride of the trip. Just before we got to the camera, I felt something hit my foot. I thought it was my camera & searched for it, but didn't search to hard because the camera was coming & I needed to pose. So we went over the couple of bumps before hand & snap goes the camera & I tell Dan that I felt something hit my leg, & it wasn't my camera. What was it, his cell phone, which, thankfully, he found. Phew!  So we go down to look at our picture & there's me, Dan & right between us, his cell phone!  Then Cherie & I did a cross park sprint to get our funnel cake!  Blow some sugar on me!  Then we were traumatized by the muffleheads...excuse me while I shiver.  Cherie, ready...ruuuun, heel kick, superstar!!

      I'm going to drink the recommended amount of water that you are suppose to drink a day. I read that technically it's not 64 ounces, but instead you are suppose to drink ½ oz. for every pound you weigh which for me would be, well, that's non of your business.  The thing is, right now, all I drink is water. Occationally I'll drink a coke (or pop, or soda, or soft drink, whatever you call it, in California we call everything coke) or on the weekends something a little stronger, but for the most part I drink water. I know I don't drink anywhere near 64 oz. but I fear if I drink more, no one will ever see me, because I'll be in the bathroom all the time. But still, this is an experiment I'm willing to try. I just have to psych myself up to do it.

      Seriously, if we continue at this pace, we won't be able to do anything without being slapped with a lawsuit. Where is this stemming from?  This guy from New Jersey is suing Disney's Pixar, for $10 million, for using his name. One of the characters in  Finding Nemo  is a sting ray, & is referred to as Mr. Ray, for obvious reasons. Well Ray Yodlowsky, a children's musician, who goes by Mr. Ray, says that Disney stole his stage name & that people are expecting him to perform & the sting ray, Mr. Ray. I can't say anything else, this is just absurd...

      brought to you by Rinatta Paries of  urlLink Thirdage.com    01. If you are a woman who generally pursues men first, stop & allow men to pursue you.   Likewise, if you are a man who waits for women to ask you out, take the first step & ask them out instead. A woman pursuing a man sets up an uncomfortable power dynamic that is difficult to change later.    02. Early in the relationship, stay away from verbal foreplay.   Engage in sexual-type talk only after you know each other well, at least a few months into the relationship. These types of conversations can become the central focus of your interactions, making it harder to experience other parts of your relationship.    03. Don't have a sexual relationship until you are committed to & love each other.   This may seem old fashioned; however, relationships are partnerships. Although sexuality is a part of a relationship, it is not a good foundation on which to build one. If you build your relationship on sex, it will most likely fall like a house of cards.    04. In the beginning, limit your time together.   See or be on the phone with each other in moderation. How is a house built? Brick by brick. How have you developed friendships? Over time. Does an intimate relationship deserve any less?    05. Spend more time courting in person rather than by e-mail or phone.   Electronic communication has an aspect of anonymity & safety. It allows for a false sense of closeness. If this is your primary mode of communication, you may feel awkward with each other in person.    06. Be yourself at all times in the dating process.   Doing so allows both of you to clearly see if the relationship will work. If you are compatible, you will discover more things to like about each other. If you are not compatible, you will be able to find out sooner rather than later.    07. Be clear from the start about how you want & don't want to be treated.   It is better to know how your new partner responds to your boundaries & standards.    08. Be aware of who your new partner is.   At the same time, don't automatically assume he or she will disappoint you in the same ways you have been disappointed before. Give your partner a chance to treat you well, rather than testing to see if he or she will cause you pain.    09. Accept your new partner as he or she is -- or don't engage in the relationship.   If your partner's behavior bothers you but doesn't bother her, you can be sure that this behavior will continue. If you can't accept how your new partner is now, rather than hoping for change, it's a sign that you should get out.    10. Enjoy. Have fun. Connect. Learn.   Dating is wonderful. It's a chance to meet new & interesting people & do fun activities. It's an opportunity for growth. If you do it gently, without jeopardizing your emotional well being, it will add sparkle to your life.

      I read this on a friends AIM profile. I have no idea if the person who wrote this is male or female but I enjoyed it & it gives me hope!    "Girls are like apples on trees.  The best ones are at the top of the tree.  The boys don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt.  Instead they just get rotten apples that are on the ground, that aren't nearly as good, but are easy.  So the apples at the top think that there is something wrong with them, when in reality, they are "AMAZING" There is something to be said for being one amazing apple.....think about it.."

      I left my house this morning & roaring down the street is this late model white blazer, with the front right side painted black. It stops at the 4-way stop & makes a left onto Laurel. But instead of continuing down the street he puts the car in reverse, in effect making a 5-point turn & heads down Laurel in the opposite direction. My question, why didn't he just make a right the first time? The answer: because I was heading down that way. Let me continue:  So this blazer goes to the end of laurel & makes a right, I head left. Wouldn't you know it, the white blazer makes a U-turn on the road & heads back the way he came, the direction I am heading.  There it is, undeniable proof that I am being followed! So if I happen to go MIA, look for a late model white blazer, with the front right side painted black.  And no, my imagination is not running wild, & I resent the implication!

      The power just went off in this here office. I thought, cool! But then again, when you think about it, it's not cool. No computer & no radio/music. And the smell that eminates throughout the office wouldn't leave because there'd be no air conditioning, hence no air circulation. (Not that it works that well anyway, but I really don't want to see how bad it would be if it ceased all together.)  They are expecting strong storms the next couple of days. I like thunderstorms, however I'd like to make a request! Mother nature, if you are listening, could you please hold off until I am in the comfort of my home? That way I can devote my full attention to the beauty & power of nature without cursing. Thanks!

      From Cedar Point to Ben's Birthday party today I probably consumed more food than I do in an average month. I feel so fat right now. I'm considering not eating. Now, my question is, would this be considered fasting or anorexia? I mean really what's the difference? Let's say I stop eating & people start asking me if I'm anorexic, I could look them in the eye & say, no, I'm just fasting.   Please note: I know anorexia is a serious disease...

      I got into a small discussion about double standards the other day. This is a topic I've thought about a lot. It's everywhere,  at work, at school, really everywhere. I guess what stemmed this recent conversation was school. The college I went to appeared to write the book on double standards. Some of the ones I can remember are:   Females had to sign into the dorms after a certain time. This was for protection, or so they say. But we all thought it was to keep an eye on what time people were coming in at night. Honestly, all they had to do was check ID's to make sure that the person entering the building was indeed a student, & since no males were allowed in the buildings, a rapist or someone like that would have had a hard time walking down the hall & not being notice. Though never confirmed, we all imagined what would happen if parents call in asking about their daughters grades & the Dean of Women pulling out the sign in sheets saying, well your daughter seemed to stay out late, she usually signed in after 12 x times a month. (The funny thing is, & this happened to my friend, she signed in a lot of times, but that was because she was in the library till it closed, which happened to be the same time signing in started.) Guys were not required to sign in at all. This leads to my second gripe.  Freshman had a curfew first semester. All freshman were required to be back in the dorms by a certain time, which happen to be the time females were required to sign in. If as a freshman you violated curfew a certain number of times, you got to visit with the Dean. Problem was, guys could enter in any door & women (all doors leading outside were locked except for the main entrance) had to enter in the main door & sign in. So any guys violating curfew would never get caught, but females well, there was really no way around it. Totally unfair in my book.  Intervis is a specific time set aside where members of the opposite sex can visit friends in their dorms. This wasn't the biggest double standard that my college had. Basically for men, if you could find a sign in sheet, hooray, but if you couldn't, no big deal. For men visiting female dorms there was a set procedure. The female must sign in the male guest & escort him to her room. If for they wanted to change rooms, she had to escort him back down to the mail lobby sign him out & a person from the new room had to sign him into her room & escort him up to her room. What a pain it was. And because of this policy, there were no hall "parties" in the female dorms, because no males could linger in the halls. We are here to protect our females. The men can protect themselves." That's what we were told, of course we were also told that if a girl gets raped in a girls dorm, the school would be liable. But if she were to get raped in a guys dorm, well, she was "asking" for it, why else was she up there. I'll stop right there before this ends up being longer than it is. I'll only say, I'm sick of people saying that "she deserved it!"  Women were not allowed to have housing groups (Greek group without the "rush" aspect) & they wouldn't section off halls for the sororities. Whereas men were allowed housing groups & the administration set aside halls for the housing groups & fraternities. No real explanation was given as to why this was, & females are left praying they won't get stuck on a sorority hall. I don't know, maybe I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill, but these (and I'm sure there are more, like the whole fire alarm thing, I just remembered) really got to me. And the college stated they wouldn't discriminate based on sex. I find this a perfect example of a double standards.

       urlLink  Cedar Point   was just way too much fun, again. The weather was perfect, the crowds were minimal & well it was just a good time!  The  urlLink  Dragster   is the newest ride, going 120 mph & is 420 feet high. I left thinking that I wouldn't be riding it because I had heard it was broken. When we pulled up to the park, it was running & I was excited! We headed there first & once we got to the entrance they shut it down & it was down for most of the day. Then to our amazement we saw it running again, & we ran as quickly as possible to the ride, hoping it wouldn't shut down while we were standing in line. I didn't, we rode it, & it was awesome. I don't know how fast our ride was, while standing in line we saw it go between 120-123 mph. The coolest part about it was a sign that said not to be alarmed if the car did not make it over the top. And everytime we hoped it wouldn't make it, but it always did. The next day, I swear they ran it less than 20 times. I hope they find out what's wrong with it. Though of course, the people waiting in line, hoping to get on, kept the other lines realatively short. Maybe it's all part of the Cedar Point Plan...mwhahaha!  Actually they had problems with several rides, none I was on thankfully. The  urlLink  Mantis   broke down, the  urlLink  Wicked Twister  , the  urlLink  Dragster   & the  urlLink  Millenium Force   all broke down at one point, & all are probably some of the more popular rides. Oh well...  Some of the funny moments:   Someone forgetting to get on the ride...  "I don't understand, what's a to WN is..." The shirt read, A drinking town, with a football problem! Oh & the  urlLink  muffleheads   made there appearance last night. What a sight. Rounding the corner & seeing the pavement covered in with these mayfly looking bugs. Sends shivers down my spine just thinking about them.

      The bus ride to work was mighty quiet today. Maybe it's always like that in the morning, I usually have my headphones on, forgot them today, but it did seem unusually quiet. No one using their outdoor voices while talking about personal information on their cell phone & no one even talking with the person beside them. This wasn't so on the ride home yesterday.   I was sitting in the back of the bus yesterday, & this lady gets on, kinda with a pissed off look on her face, sporting an 80's looking ripped sweatshirt. We're driving by the Rita's Italian Ice (??) shop in Squirrel Hill when she stands up & peers out the window. I noticed this because she was practically standing in front of & peering over the guy next to her, & I was thinking, that she was invading that guys personal space, & that I would be going crazy. So she's glaring out the window, then frantically tries to open it. She finally gets the sliver of a window open & she yells out, "When's the last time you fed your dogs!" over & over. The bus starts to move & she notices all these back bus people staring at her, so she starts to explain. "I work in animal rescue, & that sort of thing just sets me off. I mean you could see their ribs, & they're sitting there enjoying ice scream! It's just not right!" I didn't hear all the conversation, cuz I was drifting in & out of consciousness (I was tired) & was listening to either, Devil Went Down to Georgia or Pour Some Sugar on Me. She ranted on till we got to Wilkinsburg. Man, she was passionate about it, she works in animal rescue...

You may have never intentially eaten an insect (my brother aside) but you have probably inadvertently consumed over a pound of insects in your lifetime.  Your insect consumption adds up. Flour beetles, weevils, and other insect pests that infest granaries are milled along with the grain, finally ending up as tiny black specks in your piece of bread. Small grubs & other tiny insects can be found in your fruit & vegetables. Insects are especially common in canned & other types of processed food, & even in certain beverages. It is virtually impossible that you have not ingested insects in one form or another during your lifetime. And it probably did not harm you, but instead did you some good by providing extra protein in your meal!

      I just learned that Jon & I have another thing in common. Not only do we have the same birthmark on our left leg, we both don't like milk, unless it's in our cereal. (I guess we probably could stomach in an effort to help cool our mouths after atomic wings, but other than that, we both think, yelch!)

      A couple of weeks ago, while Arvydas, Frances & I were watching   urlLink The Mask of Zorro     (really I didn't think I'd use this emoticon this much, but it's so fun!) we got into a discussion reguarding the way Antonio Banderas character's brother killed himself. For anyone who hasn't seen it, he shot himself in the chest. If I remember correctly, Arvydas was wondering why he shot himself in the chest, while Frances & I said he shot himself in the heart. Argumentative Arvydas rewound the tape to show us he was right,   but the question I had, was why shoot yourself in the chest, instead of the head, which would cause, i most cases, immediate death.  Well last night,   urlLink The Mask of Zorro     was on again, & I turned to it during that scene. Later I was watching  urlLink   Law & Order: Crime & Punishment   & one of the attorney's said, "People just don't go around shooting themselves in the chest." I don't know, I just thought it was weird. Carry on!

      You are a jerk. I've always been nice to you. Don't play dumb with me, you know who you are. You've taunted me the last three weeks every hour on the hour. But when I go to respond to your taunt, you clam up. What's up with that? If you've got something to say, say it, but don't clam up before I can respond. Frankly I'm tired of it & when I find you, stupid watch, I'll get even!  Where is my WATCH!

      In an apparent quest to learn more about Lithuania, I came across this  urlLink  web page   where you could actually "learn" the language in just 6 easy lessons. I skipped lesson #1 & immediately went to  urlLink  #2   because it contained  Simple Everyday Phrases . The first set are good to know:   Do you speak English, German...?  I speak English, German...  Do you understand me?  I don't speak Lithuanian.  May I smoke? etc. But then they started to get a little weird. Apparently these are common phrases in Lithuania:  You are my little pussy cat/sex kitten/King Kong.  I am your Romeo/Juliet and you are my Juliet/Romeo!  I will die without you!...Eventually.  Do you want to have my babies?  Darling! Take me now!  Give me back the sweater my granny knitted.  My mother warned me about you.  Your hands are like cabbages.  I'm going to Tibet to find myself.  She means nothing to me.  Your neediness is unattractive.  I am a rock. I am an island.  What's love got to do with it?  My cat and I get along fine.  Who's got time for love?  Look! There's a mermaid!  Don't worry. There's lots more fish in the sea.  You are the hottest spot on the beach.  Oh my God. Sausage again! I'm sick of it. Will you join me as I scratch my head...

      That's what they are going to call me. The other day I went out to feed our one cat & two more decided to join. One very friendly one & one really scared one. This morning the scary one came by for some breakfast, hungry enough to come close, but still very cautious. He did let me touch him (her or it) though. I just went outside to give kitty a treat & another cat decided he wanted the food. That's four cats total & all but one aren't mine. No make that 5 cats, forgot about the black & white one. I just hope this isn't a foreshadowing of what i'll be like when i'm older...crazy old lady with the cats.

      While I'm not a huge fan of astrology, it interesting to see how accurate they are. Here is my "personality" based on my birthday, month, day & year. I agree with very little of it, most of it is just like, huh, I'm like that? Maybe it's just my perception, & maybe everyone else sees me like this.  Your sign is that of witty Gemini, the third sign of the zodiac, the sign that is characterized by communication. Geminis are very intellectual individuals, & are forever interested in broadening their horizon - they are eternal students!     Mercury, the planet of communication, rules your sign, & makes you an articulate & versatile person. You are outgoing & sociable, & due to your lively attitude, you are the born entertainer.   Clever & ingenious, you usually get what you want with your charm & wit.    First of the three air signs, you are a dexterous, multifaceted, & flexible individual. As the most diverse & eloquent sign of the zodiac, you crave mental stimulation above all. Your curiosity, combined with your ability to synthesize information, makes you the messenger of knowledge & information.    As a Gemini, you rule the third house, the sector of your chart that describes how you perceive, process, & communicate facts. It also has to do with short journeys, siblings, neighbors, & anything within arm's reach.    Your sign is a mutable sign, responsible for keeping information flowing. You are gifted in adapting to situations & making compromises. Of all the zodiac signs, you are the peacemaker & troubleshooter who actively finds solutions to tricky situations.    Your strengths, dear Gemini, lie in your cleverness, inquisitiveness, & openness to exploring new ideas. Once you have found something that interests you, you proceed with logic & scientific precision. However, as soon as you've consumed a subject, you are also able to switch your focus to a new topic. With your naturally practical & skilled approach, you excel in whatever you put your mind to.    One of your main weaknesses is that you can be shallow & hypocritical in your dealings with others. You can confuse people with your unpredictability & cynical attitude, & they might not trust you completely.   Since your brain works so quickly,   you tend to be nervous, restless, & anxious, which sometimes leaves you highly irritated.    urlLink Wanna try?

      My eyes are starting to get heavy again, so I'm going to try this whole sleeping thing. If that doesn't work, I'll try reading my book.  My book! I had to put it down earlier today because the characters were making me mad. If you are convinced that a professional hitman, trained by the US Government, is out to get you & you are in his house, you don't stand around his house talking about the fact that he knows where you are. And, if you are convinced that the above said hitman knows the hotel you are staying at, you do not (are we paying attention here) I repeat, do not say, we can't move hotels because the girl who got us into this mess just had an emotional breakdown & couldn't handle moving to another hotel. PEOPLE...he's threatened to kill you...RUN!! Run for your lives, don't look back!!! Or better yet, make some coffee & the psycho's house & remember the good old days. (Can you tell I'm tired & cranky?)  Okay, I'm done, going to try to sleep...I am getting sleepy...sleepy...(anyone know if you can hypnotize yourself?)...sleepy...   1 Sheep...2 Sheep...3 Sheep...

      I spend my lunch with two people, Tony & Pam. I usually eat around 12:30, about the time Tony is deep in sleep, then Pam comes in around one. During the war we had some good discussions in addition to our regular "Help Tony" psychological session. I have come to enjoy the discussion, & have learned a lot about what it was like to grove up in the 70's.  Today I got quite the "male" education. Like I learned that the wall opposite the "O" The Original Hot Dog, is called Boner Wall, cuz that's where the guys like to go & look at the females passing by.  I also learned that midday unexpected rainstorms will draw men outside in hopes of seeing some wet T-Shirt & women running for cover.

      I got home from work this afternoon & let Charlie out to go pee pee. I let him back in & he starts walking like he still has to go to the bathroom, so I immediately shoo'd him outside again. He barked to come back inside, so I let him in & he runs into the other room & start dragging his butt on the floor. I guess he ate something he shouldn't have because he had a string hanging out of his bottom & was trying to get it out. Dumb dog!

      My little brother   just got back from   urlLink camp   & he informs me that he & another cabin member have thought up the idea of a Lazy Camp. And when I say thought up, I mean, they thought of everything. I'd suggest something, & he'd say, yep already covered. Obviously the premise of the camp is to be as lazy as possible. Here were some of his ideas:   No talking: before you get to camp, you think of everything you might possibly say, record it, that way you don't have to talk the entire time you are there.  Transportation: Every body gets around with their very own wheelchair, lounge style!  Bathroom: Your lounge wheelchair fits over any toilet, & that's all I'm going to say.  Eating: Feeding tube of course!  Pretty much the only thing you'll do while at the camp is play computer/video games.

      Last weekend was a little slow for me. Didn't do much at all. I sitting here trying hard to figure out how it went by so fast... Thursday I got home from work, packed, drove to Rockville, MD, successfully broke into a car, pushed said car into nearby driveway, watched  urlLink The Mask of Zorro   , successfully fell asleep during  urlLink The Mask of Zorro   , unsuccessfully tried to convince friends that I didn't fall asleep during  urlLink The Mask of Zorro   , went to bed, slept for two hours, drove through Maryland, into Delaware (my first time in Delaware), back into Pennsylvania to St. Joseph's University, then drove back to Pittsburgh. It only gets worse. Once back in Pittsburgh, I was picked up by friends & we headed to the Dave Matthews Band Concert. Went to bed after returning home, slept, got up & went to Kennywood Amusement Park. Left the park to head to Station Square for The Clarks Concert, came home afterwards & went to bed. Man, even remembering it, the sheer boredom returns. And I'm only kidding, it was an awesome weekend!

      I was driving down the freeway with the window down, listening to  urlLink  Seether  , when I hear something hit my car then hit me. I look down & there's this huge fuzzy bee sitting on my shirt. I freak & try to flick it away. I successfully did, but where does it go? Down my short leg. EEK! So I lean on my right side, so I don't inadvertently get stung, till I can safely pull over & get rid of the bee down my shorts! I pulled over got out, did a little diddy to shake the bee out & nothing falls out. So I look back in the car to see if maybe, just maybe, it didn't fall down my short & actually ended up on the floor. I couldn't find it. Not satisfied that it's gone, I get back into my car & take off my shorts. I shook my shorts & out comes the damn bee. Why didn't it fall out when I did my little diddy on the side of the road! Argh!  You know, I just thought of something. I put the bee in the trash in my car (why I didn't just throw it out the window is beside me) & I really don't know if it was dead or not. What if it gets out & hids somewhere in my car from me? Double EEK! I'm going on a bee hunt!

      Yesterday while I was falling asleep on the bus, it broke down. I was listening to my music a little loud, so I didn't hear what the problem was, but when we sat in the same spot for a while I knew something was wrong. (I know, I'm a genius – in disguise.) I was determined to wait till the new bus arrived, but realized that I was on a very busy route & could catch another bus. (See genius comment.) So we are waiting & woohoo, another 61A! – drives right by us, the driver sporting a "sorry I'm full look." So again, me & bus broken down bus compadres, wait & woohoo another 61A – drives right by us, this driver also sporting a "sorry I'm full look." So now I'm getting a little peeved. My foot starts twitching rapidly. And again I wait & woohoo another bus. Damn! 61C, doesn't go by my house. So, we find me waiting again. I was beginning to wish I had a stereo with me, that way all the broken down bus people & I could have a little dance party on the side of the road, but alas I didn't have one.  Finally a packed 61B comes struggling up the hill. This very generous driver, despite being pack, lets us all on; so what if some people are in front of the yellow line! *gasp* I finally get home, ½ later than normal.  This is about the 3rd year I've used public transportation & the first 2½ I was never on a bus that broke down. In the last ½ a year, I've been on at least 2, no make that 3, buses that have needed mechanical attention.

Aye carumba, somebody HELP!!  * very similiar to the disappointed faces Cherie & I sported at the John Mayer concert when we realized it was over & he hadn't played "Neon!"

      Tuesday night, Cherie & I attended the   urlLink Evanescence   concert. All in all it was a good concert. My only complaint, with the actual show, was they drowned out her vocals. Other than that it was a decent show! Very entertaining!  Most traumatizing moment of the night: The guy who was frenching a lady who looked like she was old enough to be his mom, right in front of me.  "Ahh" moment of the night: The guy who took his little sister to the concert.  Funniest moment of the night: The guy who ran up onstage & kissed the lead singer, Amy Lee, on the shoulder.

      The history of contraception...   One of the first-ever written prescriptions for a contraceptive device is a papyrus sheet from Egypt dating back to 1550BC, which describes a tampon made of seed wool moistened with ground acacia, dates and honey.  Despite its primitiveness, the tampon worked in part because acacia ferments into lactic acid, an ingredient in today's spermicides.   Three thousand years ago in India and Egypt, dung from animals thought to possess mystical powers - such as crocodiles and elephants - were inserted into the woman's vagina prior to intercourse to prevent pregnancies.   Women strapped amulets containing mule's earwax, weasel's testicles and a bone taken from the right side of a totally black cat to body parts to avoid pregnancy. "If one takes the two testicles of a weasel and wraps them up, binding them to the thigh of a woman who wears also a weasel bone on her person, she will no longer conceive."   More dangerous contraceptives included the drinking of lead and mercury by Chinese women thousands of years ago, which often led to sterility or death.   The use of a six-sided wooden block - known as a pessary - as a barrier in the vagina was later condemned as an "instrument of torture" in the 1930s.

      I remember thinking as I saw airplanes in the sky how "weird" it would be to see it suddenly crash. After 9/11 it doesn't seem that weird.  This leads me to the dream I had last night. I was living in our old blue two story house on Rising Hill Drive, chilling in the back yard when I saw a low flying plane. Okay, keep in mind this is a dream, one of mine no less, but on one of the wings there was this lady filming something with her video camera. The plane flew around, came back & crashed into the house next to ours. Apparently the plane ran out of fuel, which is why there was no explosion & the only house that had any damage was the house that got hit.

      I attended the Counting Crows/John Mayer Concert on Thursday evening & absolutely had a blast! Despite being an hour late meeting my compadres (damn Pittsburgh traffic) we got in some quality pre-concert tailgating! We dined on Kilbasi, EL Fudge cookies & Smirnoff Ice Black!  While there I ran into (not literally) a couple people from my past. Coach Marhefka & his wife were there, & I have to say, there's nothing more challenging than trying to carry on a conversation with someone, while trying to appear completely sober. Then while in the ladies room I saw Jamie Hoffman. The funny thing is, the last time I saw her was at the Barenaked Ladies concert two years earlier, at the same venue!  The highlight of the evening, besides the concert, had to have been the guys sitting behind us. We were sitting in our seat when we hear, "Where are you guys from?" We turned around & there were three guys sitting there, who we found out were from Canada. They drove 12 hours to come to see John Mayer, & boy were they excited.  Counting Crows played (in no particular order): Mr. Jones, Big Yellow Taxi, Hangin' Around, American Girls, A Long December, Hard Candy, Mrs. Potter's Lullaby, Miami, Omaha, 'Round Here, & Rain King   John Mayer played (again, in no particular order, & might even be missing some): 3x5, No Such Thing, Why Georgia, Your Body Is a Wonderland, Someday I'll Fly, Something's Missing, Come Back to Bed, & '83.

      I'm tired, but I think I've been getting enough sleep at night. Not too much to warrant being tired from  too  much sleep, but enough to where I should feel rested. So I've come up with an explanation to why I'm so tired: I'm not falling asleep, rather I slipping into a comatose state. As we all know, people in coma's aren't asleep, just unconscious. So I believe I slip into one of these comatose states one second before I fall asleep, preventing me from actually sleeping, then when the alarm clock beeps, I'm "awaken" from my comatose state, no more rested than I was the night before.

        Latest buzz: Moth in woman's ear for 4 days   A Scottish woman who heard buzzing sounds in her head is said to be horrified after discovering a moth had taken up residence inside her ear for four days.   The Midlothian woman rushed to the doctor, who initially thought the problem was caused by an excess of wax.   But when a nurse syringed Patricia's ear four days later, the body of a moth oozed out.   At the height of the mystery, Graham says both he & Patricia were at their wit's end trying to figure out the problem.   "The noise was driving her crazy," he told the paper. "It was quite frightening, I looked in her ear & could see nothing. It went on for more than four hours then the thing must have died."   Patricia has since recovered from last month's ordeal, & is now able to joke about it, according to the report.   "People always talk about how earwigs got their names, but I've never heard of anyone getting a moth in their ear," Paul Kirkland, head of conservation with Butterfly Conservation Scotland, told the News.   A hospital spokesman says cases of insects like spiders or flies in ears are rare, but they have occurred, & usually can be removed by cleansing the ear at a doctor's office.

      I was driving the other day & saw a lady who forgot to screw her gas cap back on & close her tank door. I know this can do something to your engine (I neglected to screw the cap on all the way once & had to live with seeing the   CHECK ENGINE   light on till the temperature went over 40? which was several months.) I was thinking, I wish I could communicate with her & tell her that her gas cap wasn't secured properly. Then I thought, hey, I should make signs for not only this particular conversation, but for many others. I've come up with a list:   YOUR GAS CAP ISN'T SCREWED ON!  NICE CAR! TOO BAD THE TURN SIGNALS DON'T WORK!  YOUR TIRE IS FLAT!  GET OFF MY ASS!  YOUR HOT!  NICE CAR!  EXCUSE ME? DO YOU HAVE ANY GREY POUPON?  GRR!! LEARN TO DRIVE!  THANKS FOR LETTING ME MERGE! (People are afraid to let others merge onto the freeway, oops, excuse me, the parkway, here in pittsburgh!)  YEAH, THANKS FOR LETTING ME MERGE! @$#%!

      You make sure that your financial decisions are safe and secure.  You are wary of taking risks and are overly cautious that tends to let golden opportunities slip from your grasp!  Fashion is marketing vice that only the weak fall victim to.  You like to rise above it all, dressing in a way that is your own unique style.  You are a calm person, and a good listener.  You are comfortable with allowing others to take the spotlight and prefer to share in their adventures. You are protective towards your friendships and give your time freely.  You value highly what is important to you.  Some people may find your possessions a little out of fashion, but you don't mind as they appeal to your taste.  A good listener. You are comfortable allowing others to take the spotlight and share their adventures. You are protective about your friendship and ensure the  best for your friends.  You are very considerate.  Friendship is the world to you, and you are friends with everyone.  Be careful, as sometimes this works against you if you are too trusting.  All this according to this  urlLink webpage.

       So what makes a metrosexual man? He's been defined as a straight, sensitive, well-educated, urban dweller who is in touch with his feminine side. He may have a standing appointment for a weekly manicure, & he probably has his hair cared for by a stylist rather than a barber. He loves to shop, he may wear jewelry, & his bathroom counter is most likely filled with male-targeted grooming products, including moisturizers (& perhaps even a little makeup). He may work on his physique at a fitness club (not a gym) & his appearance probably gets him lots of attention -- & he's delighted by every stare. Just wanted to make you all aware...carry on!

        My Alarm Clock...   I come up with these scenarios when I'm sleeping, that usually incorporate my alarm clock somehow. Thursday morning, while my alarm clock was going off, I conjured up in my mind one of those scenario. I looked at the clock @ around 5:30 and thought, I better turn off this alarm clock so my 6:30 alarm clock can go off. So I press the 24-hour snooze button & wait/expect/anticipate the 6:30 alarm clock to go off. At 7:00, the time I'm usually like, eek, I better get out the door, I wake up. I have no second alarm clock, of course, I couldn't have realized that when I was pressing my 24-hour snooze button.  So this morning, I paid extra attention to which snooze button I press & I did real well, untill about 6:18, when I pressed the wrong one & I realized it a moment too late. This is one of those times when the  urlLink CRTL+Z  function in life would come in handy. Don't worry though, I woke up on time!    My Dinner Last Night...   I made this sauce to go on top of some rice, an alteration to another recipe. I made too much, went by the recipe I had, & realized too late, that I am the only one who'll be eating this. And I don't care too much for leftovers. (This is when having a dog is nice...) So I made the sauce, really it wasn't that hard, & then proceeded to make the rice. Christophè was impressed with my rice preparation, but once again, by the time all the water evaporated, or was absorbed by the rice, it was still crunchy. I've got to learn to perfect the art of rice making. Or I could just stick to  urlLink pasta , it's so much easier.    When Men Get Sick...   When men get sick, they become babies. It's quite amusing, though, talking with a male who has been stricken with some kind of illness. As far as they are concerned, no one has ever felt as bad as they feel, & there is absolutely no relief in sight. (Of course no one I know fits this description, this is the synopsis I get from other peoples accounts of the men in their lives that have gotten sick. And that's the story I'm sticking too.)  With that being said, I think I just may be getting sick. I have a headache for three day. At first I thought it was due to the fact that the two times I went running this week, I snorted a gnat through my nose, but yesterday that didn't happen & I still have a headache. And I just have that "ugh" feeling, that I can't explain.     Basketball...   The season is rapidly approaching at a slothlike pace & I can't wait, although, I guess I'm going to have too, there's no choice. My cousin & her friends (my rugrat all-stars) have been inquiring as to whether or not I'm going to help coach their EYBA team again this year & they've assured me that they don't want me as their coach because I buy them Krispy Kreme donuts & chocolate milk, it's because they like me. Even though I'm still recovering from last season, I think I may just help out again. This time though, I'm gonna formulate a plan of attack.  I think that's all my rambling for today...you hope!

      I was told a couple of weeks ago that I needed to get in shape. Let me say how much I admire & love brutal honesty.   So after thinking about exercising & not seeing any results, I figured I better start physically doing it. So on Sunday I did some push-up, sit-up, worked on the  urlLink triceps  & then I ran (some errands). When I could think of no more excuses to prevent me from jogging, I finally bit the bullet & went.  Many times this summer I've "started" running, but, because of the large amount of rain we gotten, I've had to stop after one or two days. (Sugar melts, so me running in the rain is not a good idea. And I'm too poor to buy a membership to a club, so running outside is my only option.) Can you see where this is going? Sunday I ran, Monday it rained. Argh! The rain wins again. Today however, is looking quite nice, so maybe I'll try the jogging thing again. If the weather changes & it ends up raining again, maybe I'll finally take the hint & realize that getting in shape was just not meant to happen.  Back to the whole jogging outside: I'd like nothing more than a ferocious looking dog by my side while I'm jogging, especially now that it's getting dark sooner. I remember one time taking Lucky for a walk around the neighborhood & a guy practically started yelling at me to keep Lucky away from his kids. I was baffled, Lucky was the sweetest dog, wouldn't hurt a fly, then it hit me, he's a 145 lb. Rottweiller, so while  I  know he's a big teddy bear, to others, he's was a big ferocious Rottweiller. Lucky would have been a good candidate for my   Protect Mirm while Running Campaign  , except, well he's no longer with us, he had this bathroom problem & he's was more out of shape than me.  Wait, there's Charlie our 100 lb. Boxer. He's ugly enough to scare away potential attackers, but there's one big problem. Anyone who has ever met Chuck will notice when he's barking at you, he's positioned his back end toward you, so he can bolt at the first sign of trouble. Also, I   walk   him around the block & he's still gasping for air 3 hours later. So, I'm picturing, me out running with Charlie (actually probably by this time I pulling him) an attackers jumps out of the bush, Charlie proceeds to bark in his "I'm gonna bolt" stance, the attacker approaches him, he starts to run, but then is stricken by a heart attack (or faints) rendering him useless. So, unfortunately, Charlie is also not a good candidate, even though, he would be more than willing.  So I'm left with the  urlLink Hulk Hands  idea, getting a new ferocious dog (I'm afraid the Mini Pinscher or Beagle I want won't keep me safe), taking my chances that I won't get attacked, or not go running outside at all. Such a hard decision...

      I just love the way music triggers memories. I’ll be listening to a song & I’ll recall what was happening the first time I heard the song.  For instance, right now I’m listening to Coldplay, more specifically the song Everything’s Not Lost, & the memory that’s has been triggered is driving down to the greater DC area to watch Montrose play Oak Hill at the University of Virginia. I was tired (stayed out late the night before & had a rugrats game the next morning), it was cold (haha  cold  outside going to watch people  play  basketball…Coldplay….okay I’ll stop now) & I was eating Crème Savers, the soft kind.

      It's been three months since we put  urlLink Lucky  down & frankly I miss the little guy! (Yeah I now, he really wasn't that little...) I especially miss him shaking my hand every morning before I went to work, Him lying on his back, paws up in the air, teeth exposed, waiting for his tummy to be scratched, & the efforts he made to greet me at the door when I came home from work, even when he couldn't walk.

      "Here you go hon..." Mike, the guy at the parking lot, use to tell me as he handed me my keys. I've also heard sweetheart, darling, etc. I really don't mind these little names, but I've always wondered, why do I call guys? When Mike hands me my keys, says, here hon, it just sounds weird to say, "thanks hon (or sweetie or darling)" back. I just don't think there are any appropriate generic pet names to call guys. Or are there & I just don't realize it.

       flacÂ·cid   adj.  1. Lacking firmness, resilience, or muscle tone. 2. Lacking vigor or energy  Flaccid was one of the vocabulary words in my 12th grade English class with Connie Cutler. Ms. Cutler was one of those teacher that you either loved or hated. I didn'tparticularlyy care too much for her. On the last day of classes, right before graduation, she made everyone shake her had & look her in the eye, while she said something nice about them. She shook my hand & look me in the eye & said, "Your brother was great!" From that point on, I really didn't care for her. But I digress...  While we were reviewing each of the vocab words, she told us a story about how one of her students remembered the word flaccid. He said that the double c's in the middle reminded him of Connie Cutler which in turn reminded him of the tricep region in her arms, which, as he described, were quite flaccid.  Today I realized it's time for me to start doing some push-ups & tricepexercisess, as my arms have become quite flaccid, & I  refuse  to have arms like Connie Cutler. (Looking at me you'd never believe that I was a shot-putter in college, or that I had, at one point, a lifting  urlLink coach .)

      Every so often in  urlLink The Pitt News  they publish anything that the Pitt Police have responded too. Mostly it reports students who have been caught drinking underage, disorderly conduct, theft, or trespassing. But sometimes you'll read some strange ones:   Thursday, Sept. 11 •4:04 p.m.  — Officers picked up a sick squirrel in a box near the William Pitt Union & transferred it to Animal Control.  Wasn't that nice of them?   My favorite of all time happened a couple of months ago.   Friday, May 16 •7:39 a.m.  — Someone's finger was injured in Posar Hall.  Okay now picture someone calling campus police saying: "I hurt my finger, come help!" Are you laughing too?

      My chariot arrived 15 minutes early, I didn't care, I was ready to leave.  urlLink Cherie  & I picked up our rental (a white Malibu with North Carolina plate) packed up & headed east to Hershey. Evil forces (known as the people who are responsible for putting up road signs, but haven't done so) tried to prevent us from locating our hotel with ease, but we persevered & after touring Harrisburg we were finally able to locate our "castle." After freshening up, we headed out to the Hershey Park Arena to see, for the second time this summer, the  urlLink Dave Matthews Band . My two favorite parts of the show were when he played Granny & the mad scatting at the end of Jimi Thing. (I’m pretty sure it was Jimi Thing.) My favorite part that had nothing to do with the show was the guy interpreting all the songs & having a good time.  The next day we, or should I say, I got us lost in Philadelphia & three hours after our ETA, we got to St. Joseph’s University. Our person of interest was no where to be found, so we headed to our hotel in Horsham, & then went to dinner at the residence of some old college friends.  Saturday, we were suppose to head to New York City, but we discovered that it was forecasted to rain the entire day, so  urlLink Cherie  & I were left with a dilemma. Do we brave out the rain & continue with our plans, plan something else or merely alter them. We decided instead of traipsing around Manhattan, we would just take in a play. We armed ourselves with ponchos & headed out. It rained pretty much the entire 1½ hour drive. Once we got to Liberty Park it stopped raining. We took a ferry to Ellis Island, departed the ferry at Liberty Island & visited with Lady Liberty. We re-boarded the ferry, back to Ellis Island, then finally on to Battery Park. We walked around Battery Park & literally happened upon the World Trade Center Site. It was definitely eerie. Even though we had visited the Flight 93 memorial, the actual crash site was off in the distance, here at the WTC site, it was right there in front of us.  We continued on toward the East River & had dinner near Pier 16. We then walked through Chinatown, trying our hardest to blend it, but I assure you, in Chinatown it didn’t. Our destination was Little Italy, but where it was suppose to be according to the map, in real life, it wasn’t there. So we started to head back when we happened upon the  urlLink Feast of San Gennaro . This event is described as New York City's oldest, biggest & best street festival & went on for blocks. We went to visit Wall Street, saw the NYSE & caught a Water Taxi to take us back to Liberty Park. The eight hours we were there it only rained on us once, at the Feast of San Gennaro. Even though we didn’t see lots of “recommended sites” (Manhattan’s a lot bigger than I realized) I’m glad we decided to go, & maybe next time, we’ll spend more time there & experience more.  On Sunday, we stopped by St. Joe’s to say hi to Arvydas, & then headed home. Along the way we visited  urlLink Beth  in Carlisle, picked up  urlLink Sara  & caravaned home. It was on the way home  urlLink Cherie  & I discovered just how much fun one could have with grapes in a rental car.  That was my weekend in a nutshell…

      I'm starting to think in computer shortcuts. Let me explain. I'll do something, not on the computer, & wish I'd done it differently. (For example, today, I stapled some papers together & then realized there were more papers that needed to be added to the stack.) The first thing reaction, or thought, most people would have is, "I need to unstaple the paper." My first reaction is "That's okay, I'll just CTRL+Z!" (that's the keyboard shortcut for undo last action.) Then I realize I can't just CTRL+Z, I actually have to do it.  Wouldn't it be great, though, to have a CTRL+Z function in real life.

      Vanessa was adopted & brought to the United States from Honduras. I had know of her for a couple of years, through mutual friends, but it wasn't until the sixth grade that we were able to become friends, we had gone to different school up until then.  Vanessa's parents owned a horse ranch with quite a number of horses. At one time there were rumors to be around 80. Her chores daily chores consisted of riding the horses. She wasn't an only child, she had a brother & sister, but she was the only child living at home. At times I think the only reason she was adopted was to help around the ranch.  Because of her schedule, she wasn't allowed to socialize much. We talked on the phone often, but when it came to birthday parties, she'd be invited, but we all knew she wouldn't come. I think in the many years she lived in Temecula she may have gone to one party.  She was always the fasted girl in PE, which contributed to her getting a college scholarship in cross country. She hated her middle name, but we all loved it, Alexis, sounded like royalty. One of our field trips was to Tijuana Mexico & she thought for sure that she wouldn't be allowed to cross back over the border, so at times she would hide behind someone, if a Mexican Policeman walked by.  Her family moved to Weatherford Texas before high school. We corresponded on occasion, but that slowed down.  The summer before my freshman year at college I was on some boring church youth group activity & got to talking with one of the other girls. Somehow we got on the subject of Vanessa & she nonchalantly said, you know she was killed in a car accident. Surely you jest? I thought that because, it appeared as though this girl had a smile on her face. I learned later that she wasn't.  Vanessa had been driving when a dog ran into the road. She swerved to avoid hitting it & crashed into a tree. That's all I know.  Today would be Vanessa's 26th birthday & I just want to wish her a Happy Birthday & let her know that I haven't forgotten about her...

      Some day, our country will track down the rest of the monsters behind the tragedy of 9-11, & make them pay, & I suppose that will make most of us feel a little better. But revenge & hatred won't be why we'll go on. We'll go on because we know this is a good country, a country worth keeping. Those who would destroy it only make us see more clearly how precious it is. ~Dave Barry

      There was this bear stuck up in a tree in Montana or one of those M states. They knew that once they hit the bear with a tranquilizer it would fall, so they decided to move a trampoline under the tree so the bear would land on that. It did & then flew up in the air & landed on the ground! THE POOR BEAR! It was so tramatizing to watch...  And then the guy picks him up like it's a nothing...grrr...

      I bought the new CD last night & totally intended on bringing it in to work with me today to listen to it. It's on my bedroom floor. So much for that idea.  Speaking of CD's, I have a confession to make: I use Kazaa. I stopped about a month ago when the first wave of lawsuits came about. But then that died down, & I started up again, & alas, the lawsuits start up again. I think I have a healthy balance between downloading songs & buying CD's. I downloaded Evanesence's "Bring Me to Life" & I liked it so much I bought the CD, for example. I guess, for me, I'd rather just buy the CD, if I like it, then try to find good copies of songs to download.  But then, I burn copies of the CDs for my friends! How is the RIAA going to stop me from doing that?

      I was exploring blogs at work & opened up one that had recently been published. Of course it had to have a naked lady on it. WHY ME? First it was the innocent Chitty Chitty Bang Band link, now this. It's a wonder I haven't had a visit from the ever so friendly (and I say that with as much sarcasm as I can muster) Nick or Chi Chi (he's a lot nicer.)

      That's what I call the bus I ride home. They seem to think that they need to blast the A/C, nevermind it's been the coolest winter Pops can remember. I still don't think it's gotten above 90° yet they insist on turning the bus into a sub zero freezer. Yesterday I was so cold & shaking so much the lady next to me asked if I was okay. It's colder today than it was yesterday & I forgot my winter coat. If you don't hear from me, check the 61A, I'm there trying to thaw out.

      I'm tired & am taking a nap when I get home. I having a hard time trying to stay awake today. Maybe I'll go hide out somewhere & take a little nap. If Shirley can take 50 gazillion cigarette breaks throughout the day, I think I'm entitled to take a short nap. I'll probably fall asleep on my ride home aboard the artic express.  I'm hungry. I guess grape & strawberry Nerds atop of Rainbow Sherbert wasn't a good lunch idea. Who would have thought. The snack machine has a dollar jammed in it, so I won't be consuming anything from there.  I was in the bathroom today & went to wash my hand so I pushed my scrunchy up to above my elbow, so it wouldn't get wet. I got to thinking I looked liked one of those old fashioned bankers with the white shirts & visors. Those things on their arms that look like scrunchies what were they & exactly what was there purpose?  Hines Ward is starring at me...and he's wearing purple lipstick.  My stomach just did a major growl...  Of my friends that are girls, we each have a different favorite sport: Me, I like basketball (no seriously I do), I'm pretty sure  urlLink Cherie 's favorite sport is football.  urlLink Beth 's favorite sport is the Yankees, I mean baseball. And  urlLink Sara 's is either baseball or hockey, I'm not entirely sure. We are definitely a very well rounded group of ladies.  I just heard Dave Matthews new song "Gravedigger" off his soon to be released solo album "Some Devil" & I got to thinking, what is with band members going solo? Maybe it's been happening all along, & I haven't noticed: Beyonce & Kelly from Destiny's Child, Justin & JC from 'NSync, ::  Maybe they do & I don't know it, but blogger needs a spell checker.

      Last night I met some GCC Alum & friends at  urlLink Bravo Cucina Italiana  restaurant. I wasn't impressed. Apparently they only have two tables for parties of 5, we had to wait till one of the groups occupying one of these tables decided to finish chit chatting before we were seated. End hour #1.  Our waitress comes by, does her little spew about the special & asks if we want any appetizers. We all decline & she takes our drink order. Fifteen to 20 minutes later, I swear I'm not exaggerating, she comes back with our drinks. After she gives us our drinks she asks us again if we were interested in appetizers. Again, we decline, but mention that we are ready to order. We figured it'd be another 15-20 minutes before she returned, again. She takes our order & 5 minutes later finally comes back with our pre-dinner bread & oil sauce. Then we finally get our soup & salad. The lettuce in my salad was brown, like it was several days old. End hour #2.  We get our food, eat, & figure out our bill. End hour #3.  The menu only had like three items on it.  I'll stick with  urlLink Olive Garden

      I love waking up in the middle of the night when my arm has lost all circulation & flops around when you move it, that is if you can move it. Last night was one of those nights. I swear I underestimated myself & swung my arm to get it to move & in the process hit myself. Really, the dead arm thing is hilarious!  But now, my arm hurts.

      I heard that, due to the fire in Escondido, they evacuated the  urlLink San Diego Wild Animal Park . The WAP is a 1,800-acre wildlife preserve, which allows us to view herds of exotic animals as they might have been seen in their native lands of either Asia or Africa. The website says there are 3,500 animals representing 260 species. If you ever get a chance to see it, do so.  Okay, now on to my question: where do they evacuate 3,500  urlLink animals  to? I'm talking Polar Bears, Cheetahs, Elephants, Giraffes, Galàpagos Tortoises, Komodo Dragons, Hippos, Rhinos, Lions & Tigers & Bears, well you get the idea. I honestly don't know.

      Yesterday I went over to the CVS & there was a guy standing out front asking for money. The last couple of times I've given people money, I've been taken for a ride, so this time, I politely declined.  This morning I headed toward the CVS & the same guy comes walking out of the parking lot that's between my building & the drug store. He says something to me, proceeds to follow me, too close I might add, to the CVS, & stand outside the door as if was going to wait there till I came out.  They didn't have what I wanted, so started to leave, when I noticed the guy was still at the front door. I decided to browse a little longer, all the while hoping someone from work was there & I could walk out with him. I spotted someone, but I didn't know him to well & he was taking forever, so I went to looked outside again. I didn't see the guy, so I booked it out of there & made it safely to my building.  What worries me is that I've seen this guy twice in two days & he recognizes me. My imagination always runs wild without any fuel feeding it; it doesn't need anything like this. I only hope I'm making something out of nothing.

      I asked Jon if he was coughing up black soot yet. He said "breathing sucks, but not having trouble, basically can't see the sky."  The news is reporting that these are the worse fires in 10 years. Ten years ago I would have been a sophomore & taking Algebra II with Mr. Rapaport. Rap lived in Murrieta, which is at a higher elevation than Temecula, & he was the one that made the comment that it looked like Temecula was surrounded by fire. I wonder what it looks like now.  I honestly can't believe it was that long ago, kinda seems like yesterday. Jon would have been in 1st grade. I'm starting to feel old.

      I   finally   found a  urlLink visual  with all the SoCal fires marked. Well you can see the Temecula/Hemet fire. Thankfully it's not as big as the others.  Oh & my high school is being used at a shelter.

      Okay, so we just ended daylight savings. So all our clocks were set back one hour. Last week at this time it would have been 3:06 PM. So why does my computer clock say 1:06 PM? I guess someone got setback happy & decided to try for 2 hours instead of one. But you know what, if I end up leaving work late because of it, I'm not going to be happy.  I'd change it but: You do not have the proper privilege level to change the System Time.

      Ha-ha, I crack myself up!  He did say though that he could smell the fires that are ragging all over SoCal. I didn't really get an answer out of him when I asked if they were close, but I am assuming they aren't, if he was still going to school.  I honestly remember there always being a fire on Mt. Palomar at the beginning of every school year. Maybe it was just two or three, but that was enough to make it seem like a yearly tradition. One year, there were numerous fires encircling my little town of Temecula & according to my math teacher, it looked like all of Temecula was going to be engulfed.  I had this dream many years ago that a wall of fire that originated near the coast & was moving east, & was going to eventually burn all of California. (Nevermind California falling off into the ocean, fire was going to be it's demise.) So we got trash bags & started throwing clothes, pictures & whatever else we could save in the back of my dad's pickup & hopped into the car to try to get out of the fires path of destruction.  I pray the fires are put out quickly, that no more homes & lives are lost & the people who started them are caught.

      So they sent around a Memo concerning sexual harassment in the workplace & a link to a course you can take about the subject.  Now the guys in the building know what words are considered sexual harassment & are now throwing "toots" around. They are getting a kick out of it.  "Hey toots!"  I think it's funny! But of course, I know they are kidding.  Sexual harassment isn't funny.

      I'm getting a little annoyed at people who complain that I never call, e-mail, visit, or basically keep in touch, with them. If I don't keep in touch with you, it's for a reason.  If I call you & am always getting booted so you can talk to someone else, I'll stop calling. I figure, if/when you want to talk to me, you will. And, if you never pick up the phone to call me & only talk when I call, most likely I'll stop calling. If I can put forth the effort, you can too.  If I continually e-mail with no response, I'll assume either you don't want to correspond with me, or you are too busy & I'll take the hint & leave you alone. I don't want to be classified as being annoying or clingy.  I'll be happy to visit you anytime. But you have to make an effort sometime, to visit me. And by all means I'm not saying that it has to be a one for one sort of thing, just some effort on your part is nice.  Those of you who know me, know that I am not one to volunteer information about myself  & know that I hate talking about myself. It's just how I am. If you have a question, ask, don't assume I'll let you know, because I won't. I'd rather not say anything, then risk the possibility of boring you with the details of my life. I am able to read loud & clear when something I say doesn't interest you, so, you'll have to forgive me if I wait till you ask. And really, it doesn't bother me. I don't mind hearing about all the things that are going on in your life, I enjoy it, I'm a listener. So please, don't feel bad if you are doing all the talking. It's the fake interest that's irritates me & causes a lump to form in my throat. If I begin to sense that, I'll stop talking.  So, just so you are aware, I'm not going to feed any egos by assuming a fan-like personna & giving you the pleasure of having me contact you & you getting back to me when it's convenient. I'm not going to beg. And I'm not going to buy the "I'm busy" excuse. And I'm not? Really, who isn't?  I really shouldn't even be letting this get to me, but, sadly, I am.  So next time you feel the need to make a comment that I, or someone else you know, doesn't keep in touch, check yourself. When was the last time you picked up the phone, when was the last time you e-mailed or when was the last time you visited?  The sad thing is, the people that need to see this won't. I apologize for preaching to the choir.  Okay, I'm stepping off my soapbox now.

      I, on occasion, feed Charlie the starburst I don't care for too much. His reaction lately has been quite hilarious. He'll throw the little tiny Starburst around, as if it was alive, & then attack it. He'll do this for about 5 minutes, until, he's certain the Starburst is dead.  It really is quite humorous to see a 100 lb. boxer acting like a puppy. I guess, no matter what species, males never act their age!

      And I'm pretty proud that I was able to alleviate the pain quickly. I actually felt it coming on this time. Usually it comes on so suddenly that I leap from my bed in an attempt to get rid of it, or at least minimize the pain. But, like I said, I felt it coming & was able to get rid of it. I was asleep though, so I really don't know how I was able to spare, but I did!

      Just a little bit, because that's all I know. (I hope my facts are correct.) My dad's dad's mom's dad was a constable, Constable Mueller, in Germany before coming over to the United States with dreams of providing a better life for his wife & 4 children. He worked here for a year before sending for his wife &amp; kids. They were over here for a year before my dad's dad's mom's dad, was killed by a train in Corapolis. So my dad's dad's mom's mom was left raising four children & she didn't know any English!   When either my dad's dad's dad, or my dad's dad's dad's dad parent's passed away a friend took my relative in, despite the fact that he was over 18 &amp; I guess kinda adopted him. Out of respect my relative changed his surname from Harper to my current last name. Yep, that's right, my real last name should be Harper, but because of the kind actions of one man, it was changed. I like&nbsp;my last name&nbsp;because it's different &amp; not common at all. It's not even on the US  urlLink census  report.

        When you hear a kind word spoken about a friend, tell him so.  Never hesitate to do what you know is right.  Don't work for recognition, but do work worthy of recognition.  Remember that a kind word goes a long way.  Take some silly photos of yourself & a friend in an instant photo booth.  Earn your success based on service to others, not at the expense of others.  Spend twice as much time praising as you do criticizing.  Seek respect rather than popularity.  Never forget that it takes only one person, or one idea, to change your life forever.  When you need a little advice, call your grandparents.  Teach your son as well as your daughters to cook.  Shoot a few hoops.  Never ignore an old barking dog.  Never criticize your country when travelling abroad.  Keep a pad & pencil by every phone.  Never let the odds keep you from persuing what you know in your heart you were meant to do.  Count your change.  Celebrate even small victories.  Cut your toenails in private.  After going to bed, refuse to worry about problems until the morning.

      I went to my  urlLink cousin's  volleyball game last night & stopped in to say hi to Coach Marhefka & the rest of the SRU basketball coaches. Now I've known Marhefka for years & the other coaches for about a year & they've never done anything to frighten me. However, yesterday, when I was talking to them, I started to shake so hard, my body temperature went up & my voice started to quiver.  WHY ? Did they notice? They had to have, I was shaking that much. They didn't say anything, thankfully, if they did. Thing is, I talked to them after the game & everything was fine, no body spasms, temperature went up again, but that's because it was hot in the office, but my voice stayed normal. Yeah, go figure. Sometimes I'm confused by myself. Once I figure out me, then I'll be able to move on to the opposite sex.  My cousin's team won their game in 5 matches & volleyball sure has changed a lot since I last watched a match.

      Woodland Hills defeated Central Catholic, 49-48, in a overtime thriller. Apparently Central was down & made quite a comeback to almost win the game.  Okay, so I was told that the game went something like this: WH 1st Possession - Touchdown CC 1st Possesion - Interception WH 2nd Possession - Touchdown  So within the first 5 minutes of the game, WH was up 14-0. With five minutes left they were up 41-20 & CC scored 3 touchdowns in those 5 minutes to tie the game. They scored in overtime, WH scored in overtime & decided they were going to go for 2, all or nothing.  The only good thing about the Pitt Game was we got to sit in the Club Seat section with all the State Senators.

      I think I'm going to the Pitt v. Notre dame football game on Saturday, & I have a feeling it's going to be a stellar, fight to the end sorta, game. Last year Pitt lost @ Notre Dame by, I think, a field goal & but despite the loss they pretty much dominated the Fighting Irish in every respect, including penalties, which apparently is what cost them the game. I haven't been to a Pitt game yet this year, so I'm looking forward to it. I know it won't be anything like the Pitt v. Penn State game, which was absolutely awesome, except everyone listened to Walt Harris & didn't rush the field, when the Panthers won. I so wanted to rush the field. Oh & Cherie, they had police on horses!  Last Pitt game I went to was last season. I went with a bunch of friends & family members. One friend in particular had a good time tailgating before hand & called to tell us where to meet him. Conversation went something like this: Scott: We're at gate A. No wait, gate C. Hold on it's gate A. Me: Um Scott, you aren't drunk are you? (Yep me, master of the obvious!) Scott: Maybe just a little. And we are definitely at gate C. The Steelers will hopefully redeem themselves this Sunday in Denver. And hopefully Plaxico won't miss the plane, because he couldn't decide which car to drive. And they better put in my Ward! One of the announcers made a comment last week that everyone drops the ball, except Ward, yet they never pass him the ball! Come the kid has a heart twice as big as he is. Size doesn't matter to him, he'll take on & take out anyone that gets in his way.  The big game though happens on Friday night, Central Catholic Vikings v. the Woodland Hills Wolverines. This is classified as the big game because I actually know someone who is on the team, cousin Ben! Two years ago the two met twice, in the first game Central lost by a field goal I believe, maybe even an extra point, but it was a great game, a definite fight to the finish. The next time they meet was, I believe, during playoffs & everyone was expecting a great game. So we all headed over to Heinz Field to watch & if I remember correctly, Central got spanked. Last year they got spanked, again, this time in the rain & mud. I asked Ben what his predictions were for this year & he said, oh, we're gonna get killed. Way to be behind your team 110% buddy! I don't think they'll get slaughtered, but winning's going to be a fight. Hopefully we are both wrong & Central comes out fighting & they end up ahead by double digits at the half, enabling Ben to get in!  That's all! Are you ready for some football?

      On Friday I was chewing on my nail, when suddenly (do you like the added drama) my hand slipped & I scratched the gum area right below my teeth. It hurt, but I soon forgot about it. Well this morning, it hurts, a lot, & it looks pretty gross too. It's just a tiny scratch, but it's showing me that size doesn't matter.  And I'm not even tonguing it.

        There's nothing I hate more than getting in the shower & having someone decide they are going to do laundry, at that moment. This has happened, to me, on more than one occasion. I swear CJ knows exactly when my brain is thinking, "time to take a shower" & runs downstairs to throw in a load, usually about the time I turn on the water. CJ does laundry every night & lately I've been showering in the morning as to not disrupt his laundry schedule. This morning I get in the shower & as soon as I turn on the shower head, my pressure goes down. I think, Pops must be washing his breakfast dishes or something. Nope! Christoper was doing laundry! ARGH! There's nothing like taking a lukewarm shower at 6:30 in the AM, when it's freezing. And then trying to wash off the soap & conditioner out of your hair with cold water as the water starts to turn cold, is almost impossible. It just makes me mad. If I hear someone taking a shower I'll stop my load or won't start it. CJ uses the excuse, oh I didn't know, sorry. Bull! I gave him the cold shoulder this morning...to go along with my cold unrefreshing shower.

      Really it's my fault though. I thought to myself yesterday, "You know what mirm, you've been running for what a week, two weeks & you haven't developed shin splints yet." I'm not joking three steps later, they hit.  I blame shin splints for the demise of my basketball career. That & the planter's warts, notwithstanding the fact that I sucked too.

      Another  urlLink confession  of mine. My arm span is 6'2" long. I am no where near 6'2" tall. I feel gipped, something else I plan on writing my  urlLink congressmen  about.  Having long arms is no big deal, until you go clothes shopping. I can never find women's shirts or jackets that adequately cover my arms. At times I look like a child that has just gone through a growth spurt, whose parents haven't had time to buy new clothes.

      Pittsburgh is experiencing a budget crisis, much like the state of California. They've had to lay off numerous government employees, have cut police presence after Steeler games & recently, have cancelled the Pittsburgh Marathon. Unfortunately, everyone has to sacrifice something in order to rectify the budget problems.  Another, not so publicized event that the City of Pittsburgh has cut is Summer & Fall. Last year, they gave us about a week of fall & then, pursuant to someone's executive order, the City of Pittsburgh decided they needed to cut that out immediately & then  BAM  it was winter. This year they decided to cut the entire Summer season, which had Spring (showers) running from, what, April till now. Now I hear tonight, it's suppose to get down to the 20's, &  urlLink Ms. Bologna , (pronounce ba-loan-nya, not ba-log-na, (though, that's the way I'll always say it) or the Oscar Meyer way) WPXI's meteorologist, said that we are experiencing temperatures 20° below normal.  I sure hope that this budget crisis works itself out & soon. I missed golfing, I missed my summer tan & I missed being able to slowly acclimate myself into the bitterness of winter. (I didn't miss the humidity though...I'm hoping that the powers that be will never be able to budget that back into the City of Pittsburgh.)

      Last night I purchased my new 2004 Weekly Planner. (I say planner because I can never remember if calender/ar is spelled with an "a" or an "e." They both look fine to me. Same thing with the word grey/ay.) Anyway, I needed to get my planner because basketball season is rapidly approaching & schedules are starting to appear & I need to keep track of when games are & which one's I would be attending. No silly, it wasn't for work appointments or anything like that.  I bought my Weekly Planner at Target & the manufacturer wasn't Cambridge or Mead or something equally ubiquitous, mine was manufactured by Franklin Covey Co. I chose this one because the layout was the layout I had designed when I had it in my mind I was going to make my own weekly planner. I don't care much for the flowers on each page, but they're water marks so I can easily overlook them.  I was flipping through my new Weekly Planner when I notice the help section. Wow, this goes into some detail on how to use your weekly planner & now I've been educated on those ways. Oh & if you want to host a Franklin Covey Workshop go to  urlLink www.franklincovey.com  or call (800)360-1886.

      I innocently saunter into the CVS with money burning a hole in my pocket, & goal in my head: I'm not leaving until I buy something. What I really want is a blueberry muffin from Au Bon Pan, but that's all the way on the other side of Oakland & it's chilly out. So what do I end up getting? candy. I walked out with a bag of Tootsie Rolls & some Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Why do I do this? Now I'm going to sit here & snack on them all day because they are just sitting there, staring me in the face. Why couldn't I have just walked out & save myself the money & the side effects from eating junk food. I'm tempted to put the bag out in the common area so the vultures that are my co-workers can have some excitement in their lives, wondering "who left candy?"  Okay, I have to share this story. Last week someone inadvertently left their bagel in a bag on the kitchen counter. I swear to you, every 5 minutes someone would come buy & make a comment about the bagel. "Whose bagel is that?" "I don't know!" "Why is it there?" "Someone must have left it!" This went on all day! You could tell that these people just wanted to devour it.  OMG!! FREE FOOD!!  I couldn't help but think how pathetic it was that they were that hung up on this bagel. Shoot me if I ever get that way!

Apparently I do & so do you, because this has all the media has been talking about for weeks, & no matter how hard I try to avoid it, they still find another avenue to shove it in my face.  All this celebrity hoopla is having a negative (well not for me, for me it's a positive thing, negative for the entertainment industry) effect on me. I don't go to the movies anymore & I hardly watch TV anymore. They are slowly loosing a viewer.

      According to  urlLink Forbes , Pittsburgh is the pitts for singles:  Sorry, yinz guys (as the locals say). Pittsburgh is the worst city for singles for the second consecutive year. It's not that the 'Burgh doesn't have beautiful neighborhoods, lacks character or fails to include enough french fries with its sandwiches--it's that it does miserably in all of our categories. The job growth is abysmal, the artist population is small, & because of youth flight, it has one of the smallest singles populations. Despite the flood of e-mails we received last year telling us how great Pittsburgh was (& less friendly ones threatening violence), the metro got a resounding thumbs-down on our polls. (Proud locals blamed the poor showing on perfidious Clevelanders voting the city down.) There is hope. It's hip to be square. --Davide Dukcevich    The Top Ten:   1. Austin 2. Denver-Boulder 3.

      Thankfully everyone is okay. My brother was driving, me in the passenger seat & my cousin, Mike, was in the back seat. We were pulling into a parking space when we got hit, driver side rear. My first thought was, "Whose fault was it." Then I thought, we need to call the cops, but they were at the light behind us, so they were there, I swear, before our car stopped moving. Tow trucks were there almost instantly too. I was hoping they were witnesses, but nope.   The cop asked my brother what happened &amp; he said, he switched lanes when there was plenty of room &amp; before he could say we were practically in the parking lot, the cop responded, well obviously there wasn't enough room. Great, the cops already blaming him.   Other than that, the cops were nice.   The funniest part of the night:   Cop:  What's your name sir?   Mike:  Michael C.   Cop:  And your wife's name?   Mike:  My sister, Miriam.   Cop:  And the young fellow in the back seat?   Mike:  Michael C.   The look on the cops face was hilarious.

      Honestly I think the surgeons who performed the numerous plastic surgeries on  urlLink Michael Jackson  should have their licenses taken away. There should have been a point where these professionals needed to sit Jacko down & tell him that they weren't going to do anymore until he was cleared by a psychologist (psychiatrist?). Obviously, there's something wrong with his perception of himself that would make him want to change his appearance so drastically. He should have been referred to a doctor. Instead, the surgeons just gave Michael what he thought would make himself happier. The result: it made him the  urlLink freakish monstrosity  (great description Beth!) that we are forced to look at today.

      I'm going to follow  urlLink Linas Kleiza's  career too. He's another one of my brother's players from last year, like Arvydas, &, like Arvydas, he's also from Lithuania.   I considered not following him, because I didn't want to jump on the bandwagon, so to speak. Honestly though, he hasn't gotten much press &amp; so not too many people know of him.   I like him though, I like his  urlLink style of play . I'm trying to get together with Mikey, so we can practice on his posting up so he can be smooth, like Linas.   And I've met him. Actually, he came up to me & introduced himself, ::cue Lithuanian accent (very similar to Ahnolds):: "You Coach's sister?" I was flattered. I mean, shouldn't  I  be the one introducing myself to him, going up to him, saying congratulations, after his biggest game at Montrose? It made me feel all special. Now I'm not saying he was checking me out. Really, I don't think he'd be stupid enough to check out one of his coach's sister? But it did make me go, hmm. Nevertheless, he was very polite &amp; I don't care what he does off the court, I'm going to be watching him on the court! I think most of Missouri's schedule will be televised, so I'll be able to see more of his games.   What a coincidence, he's also #41.

       Grove City  - First game of the West Penn Classic was a disappointment. The Wolverines took on the Tartans from CMU. The West Penn Classic consist of four teams (three of which one of my family members played on) in two predetermined games: Carnegie Mellon University (my grandfather's alma mater & where he coached for a number of years), Allegheny College (where my dad played), Washington & Jefferson & finally Grove City College (where my brother played.)  First half they look great, but somewhere in the second half they got sloppy, which resulted in numerous  turnovers (22 for the entire game.) Their best player I found out, is out indefinitely due to a fracture in his foot & during the second half, their man in the middle left the game, in what might be a season ending injury, a torn MCL. Grove City lost 62-79. In the first game W&J beat Allegheny 88-78.  The second game was against Allegheny. I did not attend, but my brother did & he said they played real well. The Wolverines won this match-up 82-59. In the second game of the night, CMU beat W&J 60-82. The Wolverines travel north to PS-Behrend, Tuesday (the day it's suppose to start snowing.)   Slippery Rock  - It was not a good weekend for the Rock, losing both games in the Mercyhurst tournament. First game was against host, Mercyhurst & they fell 41-79. Second game was better (score wise) but they still came up short 74-83.   Haverford  - The Fords started the season with a tremendous win over Rensselaer Poly Institute, 70-49. Mike Fratangelo (the player I know on the team) had six points in his college debut & played 17 minutes. In their second game of the weekend, Haverford met up with Whittier. (Hmm, I was thought, when I saw the name, Whittier; as in the Whittier (CA) Earthquake? Yep, this is the Whittier from SoCal.) They came away with another win, in this close game: 78-75. Mike had 11 points & played 32 minutes. Next game Tuesday against Catholic.   Rugrats  - Saturday was suppose to be the day we got our roster for Edgewood basketball, but it's been postponed two weeks. I heard some rumors of who is possibly going to be playing for me:   Returners   Laurel (my cousin) Rachel (Laurel's best Friend) Lucas Maggie   Possibilities   Tyler - This is one of the coolest kids I have ever met. He's got the cutest personality & if you meet him, you'll probably agree. I hope he's on the team, he'll definitely bring some charm to the team & keep thing entertaining. Madison - I think Laurel's trying to get her to play. I met her Saturday & she's a cutie. Jordan - my little Hines Ward player - he was the smallest kid on the team last year, but he didn't let his size affect his playing. Hannibal - Tough player & you gotta love the name!

      I've always said, "If you hear about someone getting hit by a bus downtown, it's probably me." At times I can be a little absent minded & honestly can see myself not paying attention & walking right into the path of an oncoming bus.  Today I got off the bus & headed east toward the crosswalk & waited to cross the street. I had my back to traffic, coming from the west & was looking at the light, waiting for it to turn red. It turn red & I turned south, toward the other side of the street & was just about to step off the curb when a bus flew by me. I was a split second away from being no more.  The driver almost killed me & for what? So she wouldn't have to sit through one light cycle?    Well, needless to say, I was in a little bit of shock & didn't think to get the bus's route or the number of the bus so that I could report it, not that anything would have been done about it.  I hope the driver at least flinched when she almost hit me...  I wonder how many points she would have gotten had she hit me!

      Last night I headed east on I-376 toward downtown Pittsburgh, a trip of less than 7 miles, that usually takes a minimal amount of time. I was in my car for over an hour before I made it downtown. Apparently, a portion of 376 had been closed. Somewhere during my hour of staring at red lights I publicly announced that I  urlLink hated  PennDot.  While returning from my evening out I realized that the reason the portion of 376 was closed was because of flooding from the torrential down pours the day before. My apologies to PennDot for assuming they had something to do with this.

      She's lived a good 18 years!  My aunt thinks she has a tumor in her abdominal region. In the past week, her stomach has gotten really big; it looks like she swallowed a football, sideways.  So Pops told me last night that we need to put her down, because, if the tumor burst, she'll be in a lot of pain.  Can tumors burst? I'm pretty sure they are just abnormal growth of cells.

      Both hit & run, once while I was in the car, the other I wasn't.  The first one was two years ago, outside the Eat 'n Park. After we finished eating, I walked outside the restaurant & there was a guy standing next to my car. He inquired if it was mine, I said yes, & then he informed me that someone hit it & left. He actually witness the entire thing. Kid back up a little too fast, hit the front of my car, got out, said "dude let's leave" & left. The witness got the license plate & called the cops. (He was also on a first date with a girl who worked at a police station, bonus points for him!!)  The second one I was waiting to make a left at a light. The street was narrow (no, not in Pittsburgh?? It's true, my friend) making it difficult for two normal size cars to drive with ease. Well, lucky me, I was next to a truck with a trailer connected to the back. The back tire didn't quite make it past my car & pushed in the front end side & left black marks. The guy stopped, I pulled over, the guy left. Argh. I called it into my insurance company, just so they were aware.  When I got my insurance bill this time around I was a little confused as to why it was 100-120 dollars more, then it hit me: that damn hit & run I reported. Next time I'm keeping my mouth shut. It wasn't even my fault & I get penalized. Nevermind I've never been pulled over, never gotten a ticket & I've never  caused  an accident. Humph!

      I love my satin sheets...but hate how cold they get in the winter. I love water...but I hate having to go to the bathroom every 5 minutes because I drink it. I love my Cap'n Crunch's Crunch Berries...but I hate how they tear the roof of your mouth. I love cooking...but I hate cleaning up afterwards, so I don't. I love reading...but I hate when I finish a book & that's it. I love driving...but I hate driving in Pittsburgh.

      Or her entertainment, but I'm digging the  urlLink boots  she wore during her American Music Award Performance. Now those are hooker boots!   Actually I'd like them better if they were just above the knee...not that I'm thinking of getting any, but if I did. And not paten leather either.

      While heading to the locker room at halftime, passing through the opposing teams student section, Ben got hit in the face with a teabag.  Let me back up here.  Last year Central Catholic got into a bit of trouble for a hazing incident that took place prior to the start of the season. Apparently, one of the varsity players was T-bagged by some of the other players. (If you don't know what T-baggin' is, e-mail me.) One of the hazers, dropped out of Central & went to the public high school in his area, which happened to be North Hills.  Ben's observation: North Hills was throwing teabags at Central, when the kid who was involved now goes to their school.

I watched TV for a bit, then decided sleep was a better activity. I was awaken around 10:45 PM to huge gust of wind & a stuffed up head & I might add, I was a little delusional (I was talking to myself.) I went downstairs to fiddle on the computer for a bit, see if Chuck wanted out, (of course he didn't) see if CJ was home & then headed back upstairs to bed. I was in & out of consciousness till about 1:00 AM, & thinking about things only a delusional person would think about.   At around that time the power went out. Most of the time the power goes out I have no idea, but this time, the entire neighborhood knew, because the electrical fuse or transistor, or whatever it is that sits on top of the telephone pole, blew, not once, but twice, causing a flash of light. I seriously thought we were under attack. (Remember I was a bit delusional.) I alerted the borough & when I hung up, it sparked, exploded, whatever, again. If I was cold before this, I wasn't anymore, I was sweating. (My adrenaline was pumping because I thought we were under attack.) The cops came by, checked things out & left. A little while later, there was a truck next to the transistor thing so I assume it was Duquesne Light fixing it. The power came on about 2. It flickered on & off once more & that's when I gave up on listening to music.   This morning, the wind was still gusting, as I headed down to the bus stop all bundled up. Before I left I turned on the local new & Ms. Bologna said it was 40º out, but because of the wind it felt like 28º. It started snowing by the time I got to my destination & get this, while I was waiting for the bus & as the snow started coming down hard I heard a crack of thunder & then saw a flash of lightening! I've never known it to thunder & lighten in the winter.   Right now it's still windy, but I can see bright blue sky amongst the big white billowing clouds. All signs of our little snow storm have dissipated.

      I just heard a story about a 24 year old who was killed in a car crash November 1st, he was driving a Ford Crown Victoria. The crash wasn't that bad, as the car hardly had any damage. What killed this young man was after crashing, the car burst into flames. Turns out there have been over one hundred  urlLink deaths  involving Crown Victorias, and similar models in the last 10 years, 19 have been police officers! Yet Ford/Lincoln/Mercury continued to make them. Unbelievable.  Check out  urlLink complaints  or  urlLink defects  for your car.

      And I'm getting sick. I hope it's not the same illness one of my co-workers had, he was out for 3 days. I've got plans this weekend!  There should be a cancel button in the elevator. How many times have I pushed the wrong button, out of habit, or whatever, & am forced to stop at a floor I don't want to?  So, Matthew McConnehey rides my bus in the morning & Derek Jetter rides my bus in the afternoon. (Now we know how he can afford to go out on the town four nights a week, he uses public transportation.)

      I've had this urge lately to get my belly button pierced. I don't know why, I think I'm too old & I hate needles. Not to mention Pops would "Rip it out" if he saw it. (He threatened to do this to my cousin. We were able to calm him down, so it's still intact!) Oh yeah & I don't have a flat tummy. I've heard people say, once you do something you can't stop. For instance, a girl I work with got a tattoo a couple of weeks ago & now she wants another. Me, I started with two innocent holes in my ear lobes & now I have 7. I'm afraid that   if   I were to get my belly button pierced I would go crazy & end up piercing everything.  I've even have a good idea for a belly ring. Take a ring shaped like  urlLink this . Make the top ball look like a basketball & make the bottom part a hoop! Clever huh?

      At my recent Birthday Party (86) several thoughts hit me:  A person is lucky if he has a caring family to help him through the rough times. A person is lucky if he has good friends to help him to survive. A person is  very  lucky if his family & his best friends are one in the same. I am a  very   very  lucky person. Thanks to all of you & God Bless!  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPoppi    Pops is the greatest!

         urlLink Chi-Chi's    The number of confirmed hepatitis A cases linked to a Beaver County restaurant outbreak rose to 240 yesterday & the reports show no sign of peaking.  No cause has been determined in the outbreak, but investigators believe it was more likely a problem with food-worker hygiene than a food item that arrived at the restaurant already contaminated.  Hepatitis A virus is contained in feces & an infected person can shed the virus for up to two weeks before symptoms appear.    What part of "Wash your hands before returning to work" didn't you understand? I'll keep the other question/observation to myself...sick!       urlLink Burger King    Recently filed legal papers claim that about 19 workers were fired in the aftermath of employee contamination of food at a New York state Thruway Burger King in Scottsville — incidents that even included urination on food products.   About 19 people “were terminated when the reprehensible & criminal conduct occurring at the defendant’s Burger King restaurant was finally reported by an employee who could no longer sleep at night after learning that the food contamination had escalated from spitting to urination, all the way up to placing lethal poison on food products,’’ allege the court papers, filed on behalf of a Monroe County sheriff’s deputy who maintains he suffered severe gastrointestinal injuries after eating a contaminated burger.     I hope these people are brought up on attempted murder charges: poisoning food? It just makes me sick.       urlLink McCormick & Schmicks Seafood Restaurant    A California woman who found a condom in her bowl of clam chowder has sued the upscale restaurant that served it to her -- saying she has suffered depression & anxiety from the shocking discovery.   "I thought it was calamari or shrimp or something so I chewed one more," Sultan told local KCAL-TV on Monday. "It felt rubbery. I told my friends, 'My God, there's something in my mouth.'"   Sultan said she spit the offending object into a napkin & at first thought it was a latex glove. Then her friend realized what it was.    Apparently some think the condom might have been planted, we don't know, & the depression & anxiety claims from all four of the ladies seem a little out there. Nevertheless, how disgusting! I hope it wasn't used.

      This morning as I was about to head out, I heard what sounded like a small animal on the other end of the attic. Immediately I thought, great, first it was lady bugs, now it's a squirrel or something. I look & noticed a bird had flown into the vent/fan. I don't know if it got out or if it's able to get out & I was running late so I couldn't try to free it, if in fact it couldn't get out. I hope it did.

      One of the things I want to accomplish in my life is building my own house. There use to be a show on TLC that was center around this dream of mine. I watch as they built a typical house as well as a log cabin. I loved that show. It was cool seeing the progress they made week after week. And for the record, I don't want to just have a house built, I want to be there helping out.  The website that I found my dream house on, isn't working. I don't know if it's a temporary thing, but today, when I decided to go visit & drool over my house, it wasn't working. I do have a picture of it though; I saved it before the apparent demise of  urlLink Landforms Design.    Name:   urlLink Palmdale   Stories:  2  Sq. Ft.:  7,395 (I was going to scale it down a little though!)  I didn't think I had the floor plans, but I do:  urlLink Main Floor   urlLink Upper Floor   Why I chose this particular house is simple. There were two things I wanted when I sat down & try to design/draw my dream house; a second set of stairs to the kitchen, like you see in every TV show, & the main stairs splitting halfway up with one half going to the master bedroom & the other half going to the other bedrooms. This has both.  Like I mentioned before though, it does need some modification. I definitely don't need 7 bathrooms, nor do I need to house 4 cars.

        At this point in my life, I don't think I have any traits that I would want to pass on to another human being. Why would I want to risk the possibility of my child not being intelligent, or rather not excelling in any one subject. Why would I want to risk my child having my personality. Why would I want to pass on my weight problem, or my huge thighs, to a poor unsuspecting human being.  Okay, so it's clear that right now, I don't like myself to much, I'm not suicidal though. Some people say they don't want to have kids for finacial reason, but financial situations can change. The things I don't like, about myself, I can't change. I can't change my brain to be smarter. I can't change my metabolism or my weight problem & I can't change the way I look. So right now, I don't want to have kids. Maybe sometime in the future I'll grow to accept the things I can't change about myself & therefore change my mind about having kids. But sadly I don't see that happening.  This scares me.-->

      Yes, it's true I have 28 ladybugs in my bathroom. I didn't mind the first couple I saw last week & attributed them to that time of the year. But earlier today when I looked my bathroom ceiling, I immediately got the shivers when I saw a herd of them huddle together in the corner.  I really hated killing them all, but 28 were too many. If I get the shivers, it's time for you to go.

      1. I absolutely hate waking up with a headache. And no this isn't a hangover headache, it's just a "Good Morning, how about a pounding headache" headache. I'm admitting defeat early too, I already took an Advil.  2. On the way back from the store today an undercover cop pulled someone over. Now when I took Driver's Education & Training (graduation requirements for the state of California) I was told that if you are being pulled over, you pull over somewhere safe & out of the way. Here in PA people just pull over anywhere. Today, the guy decided he was going to block an entire lane of traffic. I understand that maybe he didn't want to appear as though he was fleeing the scene & drive till he saw a better place to pull over, I'll buy that. But here's a solution to that problem: turn on your hazard lights, so the cop know you see him & then drive to a safe and or better spot. And shame on the cop for not saying, "Can you move to the next parking lot, etc." It would be a lot safer for him.  3. Pro-Life Demonstrations. I'm all for demonstrating for a cause or something you believe in, it's one of the things that makes this country great. However you have to be tactful. I really am getting sick of driving down the street & seeing pictures of aborted babies enlarged 1,000% without any warning. I feel sorry for people who have kids in their cars. There's no warning, like on TV, you are just driving down the street minding your own business, & there it is. This picture is horrible & if I was a child I think I might have nightmares.  Hopefully that's all my ranting today, unless the Steelers lose, again. I'm off to make some chicken enchiladas.

       Best Line : Is that the Hunk? I'm not afraid of the Hunk.  Double Take Costume : I could have sworn the kid looked like he was dressed up like a member of the KKK. I'm sure he was suppose to be Casper or another friendly ghost, but the cut out eye holes & the pointed hat, made me do a double take.  P.I.T.A. of the Night : Our neighbors, who didn't come home, but left their dogs on the porch where they quickly got out & ran all around the neighborhood.

      Once when I was babysitting, back in middle school, I conducted an experiment. I weighed myself, did 100 jumping jacks & then weighed myself again. Results: I lost 1 pound. I did 100 more jumping jacks, weighed myself again & lost another pounds. My question is this: if I did 1,000,000 jumping jacks will I loose a pound every 100? Just think, if that's the case, move aside Adkins! There's a new system in town!

      Ever have a dream where something good is happening, like you are about to get married & just as you are about to see the face of your future spouse, your alarm clock goes off.  Frantically you hit the snooze & try to get back to sleep to try to finish up the dream, but it never happens.  Last night I had a terrible dream. A friend of mine died, unexpectedly. It was awful, but the worse part was, I was waking up in the middle of the dream & when I would fall back asleep, the dream would pick up where it left off.  Why can't that happen with the good dreams...

      I was fine when I went to bed last night, but during the middle of the night, I felt the nose start to stuff & my throat start to hurt. Now I'm sitting here & my stomach is churning.  I must look like crap, because Pam just came in & asked if I had a headache.  I hope this passes quickly.   UPDATE  - I must really look like crap because 5 minutes later, Pam came back into my office & said, "You look terrible!"

      Last night was hooker boot night at Tequila Willies. It would have been nice if those wearing hooker boots got in free, but all that happened was some guy walking around pointing out the various hooker boots.  I was one that he pointed out. Now this particular theme night was put on but 96.1 KIIS FM. I have no idea if they were broadcasting live on the air, but I wasn't about to say my name. How many other Miriam are there in the city of Pittsburgh?  For months, if not a year now, we've (Cherie & Sara & I) been saying that we were going to have a hoochie mama night, where we dress up all scanky & see how many numbers we could get. We haven't done it because deep down, we know it's a bad idea, unless we are surrounded by some big guys. But I've put together a list of some not so dangerous theme nights that we engage in:   Goth Night  - we could dress all in all black & then just to throw people, do a dance a la Carlton Banks!  Fashion No-No Night  - We see them all over the place, why not be one of them!  Ghostriders Night  - Ghost riders is Butler's country music night club, let bring the country to the city by dressing up as cowboys & girls! (Nate could wear his cowboy shirt!)  That's all I got now...

      Monday was Facilities Management's Annual Ladies Luncheon. It's nice to be able to talk to people, about something other than work. I was reminded about a story a lady, Betty, shared with us last year. I can't believe I'd forgotten.  A friend had given Betty (not sure if it was for Christmas or for a wedding gift) a nude painting of herself. WOW!  My question is, did her friend expect her to actually display this in her house? Betty only put it up when she was expecting this friend to stop by. Don't know what she did when she stopped by unexpectedly. Otherwise, she kept it in the closet.

      My hair, it's different. I mean, the texture or something is different. I use to be able to pull it back & smooth it down & not have to worry about stray (or dego (sp?) hairs) popping up. Now, I can't seem to get accomplish that.  On the other hand, when I wear it down, it's a lot smoother & bouncy, or whatever.  Hmmm...

      I just think it's hilarious that the city has decided (due to our budget crisis) that they are only going to plow/salt certain roads.  But  if  you  don't shovel your walk-way, the city is going to fine you.  They also fired some police officers, but they've hired someone to look through your trash to make sure that you are recycling. If you aren't recycling (which has been proven to be a waste of money, because the people that need to recycle, industries &  big businesses, aren't) you'll get fined.  I just think it's hilarious.

      For months we've been hearing "Where's Saddam?" & this war's been a failure because we didn't have Hussein. Now we have the big guy, & still no one can be happy. Now I'm hearing:  "Yeah, um, yeah, but where's Osama? Huh, huh, yeah answer that one!" Puh-lease! There is absolutely no pleasing some people. Even before the start of the war we couldn't please anyone. The UN said, meet these requirements, then we'll go to war. We met the stipulations set forth by the UN, but did they stick by their word? NO! They looked for something else.  Funny thing is, the second thing that went through my mind after hearing we caught Saddam was, "I wonder how long till people start complaining." Didn't take long at all.  And now I'm hearing concern for how the Coalition is treating SH while in custody. HELLO! This man had thousands of people tortured & killed with the wave of his hand & we have to make sure that he's not being mistreated. I assure you he's not getting 1% of what he deserves. The military is handling Saddam like they are suppose too.

      Friday, after much hassle & having to leave my office party early, we finally were able to pick up my brothers car from the repair place. All this time we've been waiting for the insurance check to come in, which was supposedly sent last Monday, a check we didn't get until Saturday. Gives new meaning to the word snail mail. Pops sat outside waiting for the mailman & when he finally showed, CJ tells me he almost took his head of, because he was so late. And when he didn't bring the check, woe be to him! All in all everything worked out.  Saturday was my first Edgewood Youth Basketball game, an exhibition game. Last year, many parents complained that some of the teams were stacked with good players & therefore dominated, so this year, they had an exhibition game to make sure the teams were somewhat even & if they weren't they were going to move players around. Well, my team, the tan team, somehow ended up with the player  everyone  wanted, Luke, plus we had a secret weapon, Tyler. The roster broke down to 5 girls & 4 boys. First half, we went up 18-2 before we pulled out the guys & put in all the girls. The other team came within two & second half we went down two points. We did end up winning, by one-point, but I'm confident with the team we have.  Tyler is a hoot! Watching him eat his fries from McDonald's, is a sight to behold! He's such a cutie! Given the opportunity, I think he'd come to a dance party. Rachel's been asking every week when we are going to have another one.  Saturday afternoon I drove to Breezewood to exchange cars. I love when the flow of traffic is 70-75-80 MPH! I only saw one cop & that was on the way back.  Sunday I stay in all day because I woke up to a couple of inches of snow & it was falling steadily! And obviously I woke up to news that Saddam Hussein had been captured. How great was that? I wonder what his followers are going to say/think/do when they hear how he surrendered; not putting up a struggle & ready to negotiate.  Steelers lost, St. Joe's won. They are now 7-0! AL got to play a couple of minutes & had 2 defensive rebounds.  I ate all weekend. Well at least all day Saturday! I hate being stuck inside when there's nothing to do, because then I'll just eat.

      Common sense is rare for some people in my family. I am one of those people lacking in that area.  A couple of weeks ago I wanted to get a $20 gift card, but the only denominations they had were $5, $10, $25 & $50. Can you see where this is going?  "Crap," I said aloud, "They don't have a $20 gift card." So I bought the $25.  About a week later I realize, I could have just bought two $10 gift cards. Common sense, it's a beautiful thing.  Go easy on me...

      All week I've been so tired. Last night I went to bed during Hannity & Colmes & woke up an hour later than I normally & I'm still tired.  This has been my day so far: I've been getting up at 5 AM every morning to do my little workout video. This morning was no exception, except, I forgot to change my alarm clock back to the correct time & woke up an hour later than normal. I'm just glad I noticed sooner than later. I got to work at my usual time.  Walking down (okay I was strutting) to the bus stop I twisted my ankle. No one saw, thank goodness. After the first 20 or so steps I could walk on it fine, but as the day goes on, it's getting worse. Maybe it's the weather & hopefully it won't get worse.  They are calling for 4-6", no wait, 10" of snow tonight. Guess I'm not going out tonight! This morning there was a little accumulation, but it all melted by the time I got to work. It's been a wet snow since then, melting on contact with the ground. So no accumulation yet. School was cancelled for my brother (the one in DC, not California), I think he said they got about 4". Arvydas says there's lot in Philadelphia.  I was curious to see if I had to plead my case with Santa this year, but this is what he has next to my name: "Still very much on nice list, but must continue good behavior. Should eat more vegetables instead of junk food. Was very polite last Thursday! When doing chores, needs to do them as well as possible. Often exhibits good behavior." This is good, I don't have the energy to argue today.  We got the estimate back for my brother's car: a little over 3 grand.  Just got word that the PIAA Championship Football game has been postponed till Sunday. Too bad Central left at 11 this morning & is probably already in Hershey. Man, I feel sorry for the hotel employees, having to deal with two high school football teams for possibly three nights now. Go Central: Beat North Penn.

      That was the response I got from my eight year old cousin (she'll be 9 on Sunday) when I told her someone innocently forgot to say hi to her.  Her vocabulary is better than mine!  I've contemplated getting her a Word-A-Day calendar for Christmas in the past, but thought the words might be a bit much. I'm rethinking that now.  I will have to tell her about Dictionary.com's Word A Day she can get in her e-mail.  Preposterous!

            urlLink Cell-Phone Danger Alert Status Raised       KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)  — A Malaysian man was shaken and scalded Tuesday after his mobile phone exploded beside him while he was sleeping, the national news agency reported.   Mohamed Radzuan Yasin said he was recharging his cell phone and placed it on his bed near him before he took a nap. Three hours later, he was jarred awake by what he described as a small explosion.   "The explosion scalded my buttocks, while there were burn marks on the mattress and the wall," Mohamed Radzuan told Bernama news agency.   "At first I was confused about what had exploded, but I realized it was my mobile phone when I saw it was shattered in pieces," he said.   Mohamed Radzuan, a 40-year-old electrician in Kuala Pilah district, about 50 miles south of Kuala Lumpur, said he had purchased a new battery for the phone a week ago.   He received treatment for the injury at a hospital and subsequently filed a police report concerning the incident, Bernama reported.

Within a span of ½ mile there was: &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. A stalled car in the center lane on the freeway. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. A car accident in the left lance on the freeway. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. A car fire on the right shoulder of the freeway. So instead of getting to class ½ hour early, I got there on time. Phew!

In New York today, where Al Gore was holding a conference on Global Warming, the high was 8°F, that's not including the wind chill!  * cold, ha, what an understatement.

      A couple of years ago Edgewood elected a mayor who stole thousands of dollars from the borough & is pretty much getting away with it, all at the expense of its residence.  So in order to raise the money that was stolen from the borough, officials are making us pay for things that we shouldn't have to pay for.  For instance, I was notified yesterday that I will now have to pay $36 dollars to park in front of my house. True it's not a lot of money. The reason I'm upset is because we were not asked to vote on this. And why should I have to pay to park in front of my house?  Yes, they did hold a meeting, but there was absolutely no reason to be there, because they were going to instigate this fee regardless of anything we said.  Nevermind the cops look away when members of the club (right around the corner from my house) park illegally & make it very dangerous for me to turn off my street. No they just like to target the people that live there & pay the taxes.

      Remember in elementary school when you would make snowflakes out of paper & the end result would be about the size of a paper? Well I use to think that was the size of actual snowflakes. In my mind snow was little, snowflakes were huge & not the same thing. I'm from Southern California, how would I have known any better?  One time, we took a drive up Mt. San Jacinto & my brother, Mike, yelled out, "I think I see a snowflake!" Me, I was looking for something drifting down from the sky the size of an 8½ x 11 sheet of paper. I was so bummed when I never saw it.  It wasn't until *ahem* my second year in college that I finally realized snowflakes & snow were the same thing & that they weren't the size of paper.  You can stop laughing now!

Fri  - Showers 55/51  Sat  - Showers 61/39  Sun  - Showers 43/31  Mon  - Snow Showers 37/24  Storm...  Tue  - Snow Showers 26/8 (ouch, I hate single digits...)  Wed  - Snow Showers 13/5 (Help! I hate single digits even more when they are accompanied by numbers in the teens!)

      Three people I know have been in some type of accident in the last 2 days.  CES: Lady ran a light & he T'd her! Needs a new front end, thankfully everyone is all right. Nelly: Got hit while crossing the street. No broken bones, but is in an air cast for three weeks. CJ: Swerved to miss a car that slammed on his brakes & hit a tree, totaling his car. He's okay.  Can't walk anywhere, can't drive anywhere...EEK!

      I was just about to leave when I saw a clip for an upcoming segment on the news about a guy who proposed to his girlfriend at a basketball game, or some indoor sporting event, & she said no.  I personally have always thought that public marriage proposals were a cowardly. I mean, what girl would say no in front of several, or in this case, thousands of people.  Apparently this girl didn't care.  I wish I could find a link & read the entire story, but alas, I cannot.

      So I was driving Laurel home this evening & she was commenting on the fact that the team hates each other. But, she went even further than my analysis...she commented on the fact not only is it hurting the team physically (they are always beating up on each other, literally) but she made the observation that it's affecting the team mentally.  I was quite impressed with her logic & her ability to explain her thoughts, feelings & opinions so clearly. She said it better than I could have which leads me to conclude that I cannot be related to her.

      I bit the bullet & took my car into Firestone to see what wrong. I got the call back & it was my brakes & rotors.  I've had my brakes replaced twice since I got my car in June, 2001. The first time my brakes went bad I heard squealing coming home from work on a Wednesday & had it in the shop on Friday morning. The second time, my brakes started squealing on a Thursday & I got them fixed the next day. My cousin, who likes to exaggerate, has told me these horror stories of spending over $500 to get rotors replaced, so in my attempt not to have spend that much money I've made it a point to get them in the minute I hear squealing.  This time there was no squealing. I asked the Firestone guy why there was no squealing before my I started breaking into my rotors. He said that a pebble or rock can knock the sensors off & therefore they are rendered useless. And lucky me, this is, apparently, what happened on both of my front wheels.  My next question was, how am I suppose to know when my brakes are going bad if I don't get my warning squeal. He said, when you get your tires rotated they should check the brake pads. Last time I went to Firestone to get an oil change when I wasn't quoted $800, I was told by Firestone that since I bought my tires from them, they rotated my tires for free. They never mentioned my brakes needing to be fixed.  I just can't win.

      I was thinking today about several players that I have seen, in various sports, that have not let size be a deciding factor in how they play.   elementary...  Jordan was a kid on my basketball team last year. He was our smallest player by far, in both height & weight, on the team, if not in the league. He never let that bother him. I noticed this especially when we played at the  urlLink Deaf School . Most of the time the teams we play are about a year or two older, which means, for the most part they are a lot taller. Jordan honestly saw no difference in size at all. If there was a loose ball, he was there diving for it. On many occasions he'd out rebound kids twice his height. The best though, was when one of his shots would get blocked, one of his passes picked off, or if he lost a rebound battle & was unceremoniously thrown to the ground, he would get up with this pissed off look on his face & go after the ball.  (It was adorable.)   high school...  Eugene Jarvis is another individual who will not let his size get to him. At 5'6" tall he was the  urlLink Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's   urlLink Player of the Year . I guess in this instance Jarvis, who plays for Central Catholic High School, his size has been used to his advantage. As a running back his speed & small stature make it easy to get by various defenders. I have to wonder though if he or his parents ever thought, "He's just too small!"   college...   urlLink Jameer Nelson  is a 5'11" guard for the Hawks of Saint Joseph's. According to an  urlLink ESPN  article on Nelson, he was told by his baseball coach that he would never make it in basketball because he was too short. Instead of believing that, he made it is life goal to excel in his favorite sport. Now, he's being looked at by many NBA scout. But will his size affect his play, some often wonder. Yesterday, as well as the rest of the season, should be an indication that it won't. One of his many spectacular plays he got the ball at the baseline, drove to the basket & in the process of shooting was fouled by Keith Butler (body checked more like it) a 7'1" center. He made the shot & wasn't at all intimidated by the height of the defender. This proves he's capable of going up against big men. He also had 9 rebounds.   professional...   urlLink Hines Ward . He's fun to watch simply because he doesn't let his size get to him. A wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers, he never seems worried about getting tackled & often is the instigator. Most wide receivers often run to the sideline once they catch the ball, but I swear Hines would rather have a little contact. He's just a little guy at 6'0" & I've seen & heard some of the hits he taken.

      I have no idea why.  Or maybe I do.  In my opinion its a boy v. girl thing. I've analyzed the situation in my mind & came to the conclusion that it's because they are exiting the "cooties" stage & entering the "I like girls/guys" stage.  But, for fear of being teased by their friends, the boys won't admit they like girls & therefore continue to torment them.  The girls torment because often times that what girls do. IMHO.  It's really getting to me. Instead of saying, hey I should be getting rebounds & or making good passes, they look across the way & say, so & so shouldn't be shooting 3-pointers or so & so won't do this.  We probably have the best team in the league, but we've dropped half of our games because we can't get along.

      I had a dream last night that I went to get a tattoo. The one I originally chose, was a tattoo that said "Merry Christmas."  I later decided that a Merry Christmas tattoo probably wasn't a good idea.  When I finally decided on a Chinese rose tattoo, I decided again getting one period. I can't stand needles!

        Woke up this morning, went out to my car & saw a suspicious white paper on my windshield. "Surly," I said to myself, "that can't be a parking ticket." It was. "What's the point of having a parking permit if they aren't going to check for it." Again, I said to myself.  So I got to work & called. I told the officer that answered that I got a parking ticket even though I have a Parking Permit. He instructed me to call back later, because he didn't have a list of people who had permits.  I called back & told him I had called earlier about a ticket & was asked to call back when the office opened. He didn't do anything. Hmm, okay, I'll continue. "Do I talk to you or the office?"  "What's the problem?" he asked, none to nice. He talked down to me as if it was   my   fault Officer #703 couldn't see my permit, which is place exactly where they told me to put it.    I should tell Pops! He'd give 'em hell!

      Last night was the first night that all streets in Edgewood went to NO PARKING BETWEEN 3 AM & 5 AM. So yesterday I went & got my parking permit & told them that my car was in the shop & I was borrowing someone's car. I was told I'd have to call it in. I went home got the license plate number & called it in.  This morning, there was a ticket on the car. Come on! What's the point of calling it in if you aren't going to check the list?  Reminds me of the time I got a parking ticket & paid for it. Three months later I get a call saying that if I didn't pay an outstanding ticket they were going to increase it from $10 to $350 dollars. So I drove, 1 hour, I was at school, to show them my receipt. The cop guy was real cocky to when I told him that I apparently had an outstanding ticket. That cockiness was gone so fast when I showed him my receipt.  Unorganization, much!

      In an attempt to boost the economy, PennDot has decided to not fill the infinite number of pothole (some are big enough to do damage to a semi!) that are plaguing Pennsylvania's roads & highways.  Their reasoning is simple, by not repairing roads, many drivers will have to fork over hundreds of dollars to repair tires, rims & in some cases bumpers. (CJ's bumper, apparently is being held on by a rope.)  See, it makes perfect sense!  We shall refrain from discussing GM's role in stimulating the economy, one intake gasket at a time...

      Have you ever seen the SNL clip about the IT guy who gets exasperated when people ask him how to do things on their computers? I use to think that click was overdone, until I went to work at Pitt & met Nick, our IT guy.  My first encounter with Nick was to ask him to allow me access on a option on the companies database. Larry, the guy who was with me said, "Nick Miriam Needs to have access to the Funding Report!" "The Funding Listing Report???" He said with a bit of disgust & confusion as if he had no clue what we were talking about. Keep in mind that was the name of the link on the switchboard database. He finally pulled his head out of his bottom & gave me access.  Now I fancy myself as a likeable person, easy to get along with & pretty laid back. I had just switched computers & my e-mail wasn't set up on my new one. So I asked him, "When you have time could you set up the e-mail on my computer!" You'd have thought I asked him to redo the entire Facilities Management database. (Picture a spastic Chihuahua while reading his reaction!) "LOOK, I'M REALLY BUSY RIGHT NOW SO I CAN'T DO IT. WHEN I HAVE SOME FREE TIME I'LL GET TO IT." I have only ever been in one heated argument & even then I made mental notes to myself not to raise my voice & listen & remain calm, not all that hard mind you, see the laid back comment. So I guess heated wasn't the best adjective.  Anyway, it took every ounce of strength not to just slap this guy & scream "CALM DOWN! I SAID  WHEN  YOU GET A CHANCE!" But I remained calm & walked away. Chi Chi, the nice IT guy, came later on & set-up my e-mail.  My second encounter with nick was last December when I started my new job. He decided to overhaul the e-mail system, during business hours. Not the brightest thing to do. Anyway, I needed access to my e-mail account as well as the Work Control e-mail account, this is where I get all the information I need to open & schedule jobs. I got my regular e-mail account set up, but not WC. I made my boss aware of it. Nothing happened. I made Chi Chi aware of it, but since it was a Nick thing, he could do nothing. Meanwhile, I'm getting behind in my work. I complain to my boss again, on the third day & he calls Nick again to tell him I need access. I go back to my office & check the e-mail system & see that it's working, just as my boss tells me Nick is coming down to check it. I was like Fan-static! I get to see Nick. He comes down, mumbling to himself & I told him it was working now. Of course I looked like an idiot, like I had no clue what I was talking about earlier, but I knew he had just given me the permission to access that account, I'm not stupid. He walks away, throws his hands in the air & say, "Humph! Of course it does!"  I literally ran after him, I was so mad! Lucky for him, the receptionist held me back! (Haha, just kidding, I restrained myself.) I let my voice be heard though & complained up a storm to the people who would listen.  The funny thing is, no one in the office likes this person, including upper management. He has had harassment complaints filed against him with HR. He complains about having to help people with computer problems &/or refuses to change things, both of which are part of his job. I wonder why he's still there. Yesterday I was having problems with our database & I didn't contact Nick, I called with Chi Chi. When I hung up the phone I thought, something's wrong here. Nick's in charge, he should be the first person of contact, but no one does.  Get this, his getting his MBA, because he wants to be in management. I really feel for the people who might have to work under him.  I honestly think that SNL clip's author had to have worked in Facilities. And he didn't even change the name of the character for SNL, he kept it as Nick.

      Every Thursday I attend a meeting with the Foreman of each of the trades that I schedule jobs for. Apparently, before the presence of a female, the meetings were very "bad." Since I've been there, apparently, the meetings have been much shorter & the boys, er, men, have been on their very best behavior.  I've been given some suggestion on how to be "one of the guys," none that I have taken seriously. Sorry Bill, I will not "let one rip" during the meeting.  But next week, I think I'm going to start the meeting by having story time. It'll be an educational book, that will also help to ease the tension I have created.  What do you  urlLink think ?

      Waterbuffalos! Don't ask, but it's the unofficial name for the youth basketball team on coach. Why use the generic "tan" team, when we can elicit stares & perplexed expressions with the name Waterbuffalos.   I have a team of ten, 5 girls & five boys, perfect for a perfectionist like me.   At the beginning of each season there is a draft. This is how mine went:   Automatically got Laurel because her dad's the coach. With Laurel came her best friend Rachel. Lauren, requested to be on my team & Maria came along two because her dad was helping out with the younger tan team, another one of my uncle's teams. So right away, I had 4 girls. Then we got Julia, through a process of elimination; she could only practice on Thursdays & that the day we were practicing.   Luke I got with a first round draft pick. Tyler was our "secret" weapon. We knew he was good, but no one else knew who he was & we purposely didn't have him show up for draft pick day. We got him because, we were going to be giving him a ride to the games. (We being, my Uncle.) Clayton we got through a regular draft pick, as well as Josh. Our final team member showed up to practice & said, "Hey, I'm on your team."   I quite enjoy my team, there a lot of different personalities. This is not to say I'm not pulling my hair out during practice because I've heard, "Can we play elimination now?" for the 1,000th time.   The age is an awkward age. I categorize it as the stage where the line between cooties & crushes is crossed. Most of the guys I think are starting to like girls, but won't admit it because they have cooties. The girls, well, I don't think girls ever think guys have cooties, so they just like to pester the guys. This is what I'm up against during practice!   Anyway, one of the concerns I've had coaching a co-ed team in this age group is the physical aspect. I think some of the girls are very intimidated playing with guys & therefore back off instead of taking on the challenge.   I was proved wrong this last weekend. We went up against the Blue team. One of the kids on the team is huge, in both height & weight. I'm talking HUGE! He'll be a good ball player someday, he's already got Linas's spin move down underneath, deadly if you ask me. Anyway, he played in the center & my team was playing a 2-1-2 offense with Laurel & Josh as the bottom two & Rachel in the center.   So Hugeboy is being "guarded" by Rachel & Laurel. Not a good match up & I admit it, but our tallest was needed to keep the offenses guard under control. Given the situation, Laurel did better than I could have expected. Shocked the pants off of me. I'm not saying that she held Hugeboy to 0 points, but she guarded him well.   Trying to get it in the minds of kids, who have been told all their lives not to take toys away from other kids or to steal, that they can fight for the ball & steal it was a challenge I faces last year. After a simple drill, that all changed. After the first couple of games I thought for sure that I would have to revisit this drill, but was apprehensive because I thought for sure the some of the girls would literally be thrown to the ground.   Well during Saturday's game Laurel found herself up against Hugeboy in a 1-on-1 fight for the ball. I thought for sure Hugeboy would win. He didn't! Laurel came away with the ball. Again, shocked the pants off of me! I swear I heard he growl "Back off buster" before he let go of the ball, but that may have just been my imagination. Maybe I'll teach them that next practice...   A little while later, in the game, Rachel had her opportunity to go up against Hugeboy. Rachel has improved so much in the two years I have coached her. She does have a tendency, though, to, when faced with lots of pressure, fall to the ground or sometimes be thrown to the ground. So I immediately thought, this isn't going to be good.     She   came away with the ball!   So my thinking about my "fragile" girls is a little flawed. I was so incredibly proud of them yesterday, actually my entire team. Laurel was the leading rebounder for both teams, she made it look way to easy. Not to mention her & Rachel's fight with Goliath & subsequent win. Josh, while he still only stands in one place, seems to have a good eye for the game & came away with several steals. Josh & Tyler stepped up their game with incorporating screens. And they all played every minute of the game, because we had no subs!   Go WATERBUFFALOS!

      Innocently went to get an oil change for my car & a system flush (or something like that) & they come back saying I have a blown gasket & it'll cost $800 to fix.  Firestone said they've done 10 of these in the last week & that it's because of a poor design in this type of GM engine. The firestone guy (who told me he started out just liking shoes & now has a fetish) said that they had a guy in last week who had a 2003 Malibu, with 18,000 miles on it when this happened.  Beware Stallion & my brother car!

      Imagine if you will being in a room, with no windows to the outside & the power goes out!  Oh & add eight 9-10 year olds to that mix.  Oh & some of them are afraid of the dark! Very afraid.  This is the situation I was in two practices ago. I was observing as my team started a 4-on-4 intersquad scrimmage when the lights flickered & then all was dark.  When something scary happens & there are young girls in the room, what the one thing that always happens? Screaming! So my girls were screaming, hey they were scare & they couldn't see anything. The jerk of a coach that we shared the gym with on Thursdays had the nerve to yell at the girls to SHUT UP! Did I mention he was a jerk.  So the lights are out & no one can see anything & my team is wondering where I was so they could grasp on to an appendage for some security. I used the Indiglo light button on my watch as a beacon to my players & immediately they grasped. Several parents used any electronic devices they had to shed some light: cell phones & laptops.  So with little light we had she shuffled toward the door that leads to the stairs. SHUFFLE SHUFFLE SHUFFLE Julia was leading the way. No one saw the ladder laying down next to our feet & when Julia ran into it, more screams erupted. At this point I have one girl crying, one girl freaking out & one boy cutting the circulation off on the arm of Mikey, the assistant coach.  Me, I was laughing!  Lauren, who had come to practice late & in an hurried attempt to change out of her clothes, had clothes & shoes thrown all over the place. I got to locate them. Tyler, as soon as the lights went out grabbed for Mikey's arm causing him to drop Rachel's basketball. He also had thrown one of his gloves to the side of the court during warm-ups. So when we finally got to the top of the stairs we were already down a basketball & a glove.  After shuffling up the stairs, we did a quick head count to make sure that all the kids had made it up the stairs alive. Everyone had someone there to leave the building with except for Josh, so I volunteered to stay with him, toward the front of the school, till his mom came to pick him up. Everyone else left by way of the back door.  When we got to the front of the school, I swear, I felt like I was in the movie E.T. when the NASA people come into Elliots house & find them laying on the bathroom floor. Except in this instance they weren't NASA people they were the Edgewood, Swissvale & Rankin Fire Departments!  Apparently a transformer blew & as a result a live wire was down in front of the school, so no one was allowed to leave.  And guess who was there: Josh's mom! ARGH! We could have snuck out the back with the others & been home by now! ARGH! Mikey was worried about food, so I presented him with a cookie, that he contemplated rationing.  We listened to the firemen as they secured the situation. They were threatening arrest to anyone who attempted to leave the building! Mikey & I were convinced we could take them on! We had at least one basketball, we could chuck it at them & then run the opposite way! Yeah, we could take them!  We ended up in the auditorium of the school, where there were about 150 people there for book bingo. I at this point, did understand why I couldn't leave, my car was parked away from the live wire, but, I was a good citizen & just waited.  At one point I thought for sure we were going to be put under Marshall law. There were two entrances in the back of the auditorium & I swear, at the exact same time, two firemen came & stood in the doorways. I looked to the front of the auditorium & there was a fireman or two on stage & one blocking the side exit. I just knew we were going to be held hostage.  Finally they let the people who were parked on the side street go. That was me! So we ran to my car, it was cold & Laurel didn't have any pants on. Why this girl insists on wearing shorts in single digit degree weather is beyond me.  When the lights went out, my Uncle was coaching at the neighboring Deaf School & since his car was parked on the street that the live wire was on I knew he wasn't going anywhere, so we headed over to the deaf school to find him. He wasn't there. So we went home. (I should note, that I didn't have my cell phone with me at all. The one time I forgot it!) I called my aunts & she hadn't heard from him. I called Lauren's house, her mom had taken 4 of the players, there was no answer. I called Rachel's house, no answer.  We finally met up with my uncle at his house. He apparently had snuck around & was right to his car when the fireman stopped him & yelled at him for being near a live wire. He made them wait for half an hour till they decided he could leave.  It was a very interesting night!

      Yesterday Pops received a phone call from a friend he grew up with, Evelyn. I guess they were neighbors & Pops dated her older sister briefly. They have kept in touch all this time.  During the course of the conversation, Evelyn told Pops she had a question from her sister, why did he stop dating her? They had dated almost 70 years ago! I told Pops that I think she still had a crush on him!  In case you were wondering, Pops was only 17 at the time & said he was shy & too young.

      1. I put a cup of water in the microwave. I forgot to take out the tube & it exploded. 2. I put a cup of water in the microwave. When I took it out, I put the tube in & I swear (Laurel was there, she can vouch) the water just exploded/shot out of the cup. I thought the tube exploded again, but no, tube was intact.

      There were a couple of reasons I took time off: 1. I had a Friday off so I figured I'd relax the entire week; you know, sleep in. 2. I was gaining weight, despite my best attempts to keep it of. During the second week, I noticed I lost 5 pounds. 3. Sleeping in...did I mention that already.  Now that bathing suit/short season is rapidly approaching (can you believe it's almost April?) I figured I better get back to my routine.

      Stanford lost! That's going to screw up a lot of peoples NCAA polls. Especially Laurel's, she had them losing to Kentucky* in the final round.  * She actually had Saint Joseph's winning the entire thing, but changed it because she was told that she was thinking with her heart & not logically. So she changed it to Kentucky!

      I had a rant about the commentators commenting on the St. Joe's game & I lost it!  I found it...but I guess it's irrelevant now: Okay, so Saint Joseph's lost, bad, to Xavier. It's the talk of ESPN, "#1 ranked St. Joe's looses by 20!"  Yeah, they lost & I'm unhappy, borderline depressed. But I'm pissed off even more about comments that I have heard about the team. Would you allow me to vent, please?  Woody something or other, on ESPN has know   all   along that SJU didn't have a good team. They "had a weak schedule" & "this loss proves they aren't good." Okay, they lost one game, albeit a very important game & by 20, but it's one game. Only one other team in the league has only lost one game. In your opinion they had a weak schedule. What, in your opinion, were they suppose to do then, play half-assed, loose? I can see it now:  Coach Martelli: Guys, we have a weak schedule. So our wins won't mean anything. So just go half-assed. Hell, we'll even have a "Left hand only night"* to ensure we loose! CRIMINY! Instead of berating the team for having, in your opinion, a weak schedule, praise the team for playing their hardest every time they stepped on the court.  A couple of things about scheduling games. First of all, coaches want to have tough games to challenge their players. However, just because I want to play schools like Duke, doesn't mean I'm going to get too. Secondly, games are scheduled every two years. I guarantee you if half the teams in the top 25 knew that St. Joe's was going to go undefeated in the 2003-04 regular season they would have scheduled to play them, just so they could possibly be the team to hand them their first lost. Vitale even said that schools like St. Joe's & Gonzaga don't get looked at by the bigger schools because they are afraid of losing to these unknowns. So enough with the week schedule argument!  There's a tremendous amount of pressure on these athletes to perform great every game, even more to go undefeated. SJU welcomed the pressure & performed well during the season. There were close games & blowouts, but every time they played with class.  These commentators are predicting that SJU will go down the first round of the Big Dance! I can't wait till next week when they can prove them wrong.  Just remember, "The Hawk will never die!"  For now, I'm having a couple for AL!   Haha, I crack myself up. Two of the starters are left handed! Haha! Okay, I'm cutting myself off!

      Have a great day!  My earliest childhood memory was when we went to visit my sister. I was sitting behind my mom, my brother behind my dad, driving up a windy, uphill road. We got to the agency & Claudia showed us where my new sister was. I remember seeing her in a crib, in a room with other babies in cribs. I at some point wondered if we could choose which baby we wanted, but later, I found out we couldn't, not that I minded!

      Did anyone catch CSI last night? Grissom was sent just a head that was found in a small backwards town in Nevada.  They found the body, buried up to his chest in a wooded area. Sap was poured on his head to attracted bugs & his face was cut to attract bears.  Could you imagine?  Other way I do not want to die: - buried alive (I'm claustrophobic) - drowning (had 1 or 2 close encounters) - anything involving torture, like above (I've read to many books) - burning alive  I guess, pretty much if I go, I want it to be in my sleep like my aunt, not screaming like the passengers in her car! Seriously though, I want it to be quick & painless. But then again, doesn't everyone?

      There is nothing I hate more than hearing people chewing their food! It rates up there with dragging your nails on a chalkboard in my opinion.  For awhile now, two other ladies & I would go out to lunch once a week. Recently, one of my male co-workers has joined us. He likes to chew with his mouth open & none to quiet I may add.  Yesterday I was going absolutely batty as he was standing in my office, chewing an apple, a noisy piece of food to begin with, mouth open, making more noise than a fret train!  I was seriously having convulsions.

      Today was bring your son or daughter to work day. My thoughts on this idea: stellar. However, there should be some rules set in place before one brings their kids.  Rule #1: You child must be aware that they are entering a place of business & they must act accordingly. With that being said, children under a certain age should not attend.  Rule #2: If you bring your child, you should not let said child lose to run about the building. You should remind your child(ren) to use their indoor voices.  No, those rules aren't aimed at any particular co-worker in particular; I swear! You're not buying it are you. Here's a brief description of some of the kids I saw:  Will son Will Jr.: First words out of his mouth: I'm the boss today! Will Jr. is in the second grade & wears a size 8 shoe. I repeat the kid is 8 & wears a size 8 (in men) shoe! He was very well behaved.  Ben's son: I didn't catch his name, but what a cutie! He's around 3 & as soon as he walked in he ran over & gave our receptionist a big hug! He was very well behaved.  Tim's son Mike: probably in his early teens & couldn't stop talking about the bomb threat they had at school on Monday. Reminds me of one of those kids who thinks he's clever, but isn't.  Lumping here...the girls, were all very quiet & subdued.    HELL  er's kids: These would be the kids the rules were made for. I was warned numerous times about   HELL  er's kids but nothing could prepare me. When I first got to work, I could hear the shrill screeches of   HELL  er's 3-year-old girl. Then I saw her, running up the hallway, toward the front door trying to get it open; no dad in sight. Older brother, around 5, says, "No you can't go out there, & then opens the front door for her.   Pam immediately gets on the intercom & pages Dad   HELL  er, meanwhile Son   HELL  er, says, "I wanna go in the elevator!"  Okay, I'm stopping there. I really don't want to relive this anymore.

      I just feel like sharing about random people that I have encountered at various times in my life. So here's my first installment of rrp - random person post.  My first job out of college was for  urlLink SchlumbergerSema , at a satellite office in downtown Pittsburgh. The office was in the Conestoga building & right next to it was a paid parking lot. It was in that lot that I met Boris.  Boris, as you can probably tell from his name, was from Russia & I believe had been in the US for a year or two. He was a chemist & was working at the parking lot until he found a job in his field; he wasn't having much success.  Boris was nice. He had asked me to drive my car into work & park in his lot one time. I told him I would & I did, not because he asked, but because I was leaving for vacation after my workday was complete, but he didn't know that. He just thought it was thoughtful of to do something I said I would. And when Ben, Mikey, Jon & I went to the Barenaked Ladies concert after work one day, he saw us off & immediately was a hit with the boys. I enjoyed talking to him daily. He, unfortunately, quit the job at the parking lot because he had been robbed one too many times. I saw him one more time after he quit, at TJ Maxx, that's how I found out he quit.

      Last night I went to see a high school basketball all-star  urlLink game ; & you thought basketball season was over.  More times than I want to count, I have heard athletes, usually when they are involved in some controversy, state: I didn't ask to be a role model. This infuriates me, because, like it or not, asked for or not, they are.  So as I'm sitting watching this all-star game, I'm leafing through the program & come across the profile for  urlLink Anthony Marquis Ivory . Under the "What do I want to be" part of the profile, he responded, a role model! I really liked that!  By the way, Mikey got his autograph & now has a new role model...but not in the respect Mr. Marquis was thinking. If you know Mikey, you'll understand.  Also, one of Mr. Marquis's teammates was  urlLink Churchill Odia , who goes to Montrose, the school my brother works at. Laurel got his autograph, because, he favorite meal is Chicken & rice & Laurel  LOVES  chicken. She can talk for hours about it.

      Senator Kerry graced the campus of Pitt today for his college campus tour.  One of the arguments that Kerry's opponents have against him is the fact that he's been on both sides of a lot of issues. You've heard the quote, "I voted for it before I voted against it."  This is what went down at the rally today: Kerry, standing with former Steeler Franco Harris, is discussing a Steelers game he attended awhile ago. Apparently, he rooted for the Steelers for part of the game & New England for part of the game.  Adding fuel to the fire.  And why would you say you voted for the team the town you are in played against, while a member of that team (albeit years ago) is standing next to you in support?

      I hate politics. Honestly is not part of this game at all.  Too often I have heard, "you youngsters have to get involved." So this year I decided to get educated about the candidates & you know what, screw it!  I really don't care about the petty things things the negative ads dwell upon. I want to know about what you promised in the past & if you got it done. I want to know what you stand for & don't beat around the bush.  But you know what is frustrating me most: the double standards. One political party can say Condoleezza Rice looks like a character off of Planet of the Apes & you don't hear anything about it. But if the other party were to say something similar or not as offensive, you better believe it'll be front page news.  And then I hear people commenting on the comments made about Dr. Rice & how rude it is, but when I bring up the fact that everyone makes comments about Kerry's long face, well, "it's true?" PEOPLE! Listen to yourselves!  It's enough to make me go insane & it's only April. March was absolutely wonderful. Why? March Madness. I went entire weekends without flipping on a news station. But that's over...  So my efforts to "inform" myself have made me not want any part of it. My solution? I'm boycotting politics. Yeah, that'll be easy.

      I guess technically it should be AOLIM for America On-Line Instant Messenger, but AIM is the accepted term in the AIM community.  I have been IMing for about 5 years. It a cool way of communicating, especially for those people, like me, who can't come up with a witty/smart ass/clever remark on the spot: it gives you time to think one up, because the person doesn't know if you've stepped away from your computer or sitting there thinking up something. I also like it because I tend to open up more than if I was face to face with someone.  I use it on a  daily  hourly basis. I enjoy reading people's away messages (even Ben's, who, after chatting with him, will put up a message indicating that there is no one on, so he'll be back later. What am I buddy? Chopped liver?) & profiles.  The other day I was looking at my buddy list & realized something strange: the majority of the people I chat with on a regular basis are 5 or more years younger than me, some are even 10 years or more. And most of them are male. What does this say about me?

      Oh how the weather can change in a week. Last weekend I was riding my bike & rolling up the sleeves of my t-shirt because it was warm. This weekend I'm dodging snowflakes.  I've lived in Western Pennsylvania, on & off, since 1996. I still consider myself new to the area. I haven't worked "yinz" into my vocabulary & still have no idea who Donny Iris is.  What amazes me are the comments from people about the weather who have lived here all their lives. My cousin for example will say, in the middle of February, after yet another snow storm, "I thought we'd seen our last snow!" Today, some lady, while playing dodge the snowflakes with me, commented, "I can't believe this weather. It's spring for goodness sakes!"  Me, having been here for only 8 years know that the last snow fall isn't going to happen in February or March & we will most likely see snow in April! I can remember freezing my ass off at an April track meet, trying to throw a metal javelin, while it's snowing,  hard . And the majority of our meets happened in April & May.  I guess, living in an area for x+8 amount of years (longer than me) doesn't make you an expert on the regions weather. I really shouldn't bash these individuals though, they can't help it if they aren't as observant as me, nor can I judge their optimistic thoughts on the weather.  I'll join them in this respect: here's hoping we actually have a dry summer!

      There were 5 Wednesdays in the month of March, which means 5 classes, right? I attended one class the entire month, but you can't blame me for not trying.   mar-03  - Deadly accident on freeway, freeway closed. Didn't make it to class.  mar-10  - Drive to class. Realized, when I arrived & there were no cars in the parking lot, it was spring break.  mar-17  - Test. Made it to class.  mar-24  - Dentist appointment: procedure is an hour long, which will give me plenty of time to get to class. They decide to get to me when they want to, 45 minutes after my scheduled time. Didn't make it to class.  mar-31  - Drove to class. Class was cancelled.  I give up!

      Yesterday cousin Mikey graduated from middle school. He received various award for participation in science projects, creative writing & so on. But the award that he's most proud of is his "1620" award.  Out of a possible 1620 days of school, between kindergarten & 8th grade, Mikey attended every single one: he did not miss a single day of school.  I should note, his parents, aren't the type to send a sick kid to school either. Mikey's got a great immune system & doesn't get sick, or if he does, it for a millisecond, I swear.  He was also voted "Most Likely to be 7ft. tall."

      The borough sweeps our streets between the months of April & November. The first & third Wednesdays there is no parking on Laurel, & ont the second & fourth there is no parking on Lincoln. Should there be a fifth Wednesday of a month, that's a freebie.  Today, CJ had his car parked on Laurel & noticed the cop ticketing all the cars on the street. He was at CJ's car hen he came out & asked if he was going to move it? CJ was a little confused & said, this is the fourth Wednesday, there's no parking on Lincoln (where my car was parked.) The cop said, no, it's the third.  CJ calls me to make sure he isn't going insane, then goes inside & grabs a calendar & proceeds to show the cop that it is in fact the fourth Wednesday of the month. The cop, said, you know, your right & then resesitated CJ, kidding. He then removed all the tickets he wrote & made a mental note to show dispatch how to read a calendar & count!  CJ also moved my car so I wouldn't get ticketed.

        urlLink Childless couple told to try sex     A German couple who went to a fertility clinic after eight years of marriage have found out why they are still childless - they weren't having sex.  The University Clinic of Lubek said they had never heard of a case like it after examining the couple who went to see them last month for fertility tests.  Doctors subjected them to a series of examinations and found they were both apparently fertile, and should have had no trouble conceiving.  A clinic spokesman said: "When we asked them how often they had had sex, they looked blank, and said: "What do you mean?".  "We are not talking retarded people here, but a couple who were brought up in a religious environment who were simply unaware, after eight years of marriage, of the physical requirements necessary to procreate."  The 30-year-old wife and her 36-year-old husband are now being given sex therapy lessons while the university clinic undertakes a study to try to find out if there are more couples with a similar lack of sex education.   My question is how exactly were they attempting to procreate?

      1. There's a dead bird on our sidewalk. I ain't touching it, I was hoping Pops or CJ would have seen it by now & disposed of it.  2. I'm calling for a world-wide ban on Minutemaid lemonade. I've had two mishaps in the last week alone with the 16.9 oz bottles. First one happened on Thursday, if I recall correctly. I had my Motorola Cell phone, (it flips!) in my bad & I placed a bottle of Minutemaid lemonade in my bad as well. The lemonade leaked all over my phone & now it's not working. Second mishap happened today. Placed my bottle of lemonade on the passenger seat next to me & at the end of my drive it, there was no more liquid in the bottle, but plenty on my seat & my notebooks! I hope you agree with me that this is absurd & definitely poor craftsmanship on Coca~Cola's part. And the fact that I failed to screw the top on all the way, has no bearing on this case!  3. I apologize that I fail to write things of substance in my posts. Thing is, I do have good things to say at times. I have stellar debates & conversations with my co-workers, but when it's time to put it down on paper, I forget what I said, and/or, it gets all jumbled up in my head & comes out as gibberish.  ...I thought of two more things, so bear with me...  4. I hate when I find a new food that I like, that happens to be bad for my health. The culprit this time: DiGiorno's Thin Crispy Crust Four Cheese Pizza. Not to mention Mr. Goodbar!  5. Charlie is still FAT! He's having a bad influence on me. I made a verbal annoucement on Sunday that I would be watching what I ate & eating healthier. Since Sunday, I can't stop thinking about food, especially that damn pizza. I have my trusty steamer, & for awhile I was on a huge, steamed veggie kick. But lately, it's been lacking. But, good for me, this week, I've gotten up every morning to workout. Except this morning. I got up, but I couldn't find my textbook for my final tonight, so I did ¼ of my workout & went book hunting. Okay, so I lied, I looked for the book for 5 minutes, then I laid back in bed.

      Ah yes! "Picksburgh." Yinz are from Picksburgh if… · You didn't have a spring break in high school. · You walk carefully when it is "slippy" outside. · You often go down to the "crick." · You've told your children to "red up" their rooms. · You can remember telling your little brother/sister to stop being so "nebby". · You've gotten hurt by falling into a "jaggerbush". · Your mother or grandmother has been seen wearing a "babushka" on her head. · You've "warshed" the clothes. · I ask you to hand me one of those "Gum-Bands" you actually know what I'm talking about. · You know you can't drive too fast on the back roads, because of the deer. · You know Beaver Valley, Turtle Creek, Moon, Mars, Slippery Rock, Greentree & New Castle are names of towns.

(Example..."you guyses house is nice") · You know the three rivers by name & understand that "The Point" isn't just on a writing instrument. · Someone refers to "The Mon" or "The Yough" & you know exactly what they're talking about. · You remember the blizzard of 1996 (or 1976, or 1939, or...) & remember not being able to go outside because the snow was over your head & you would have suffocated. · Someone starts the chant, "Here we go Still-ers!" & you join in.

      Got to see an early showing of the movie (that comes out on Wednesday) & it was decent. It was definitely comparable to the first & had lots of special effects.  Coming from a person with no attention span, this movie was able to keep mine, so I guess that means it was entertaining!

      Tara, CJ's old girlfriend, was by today, with CJ. I don't think he'll ever learn.  Everytime this girl gets interested in someone else, CJ is dropped instantly & when things don't work out with the new guy, she runs back to him.  Last time she broke it off with him, she said, "I just don't see us compatible in 7 years."  I thought he would have learned by now.

      Friday, June 4, we woke up to insects on the counter in our little kitchen area. After trying to rid them & not succeeding & then them sharing a bed with me we decided to change rooms; the change happened on Sunday.  So we went from the fourth floor of the hotel, on one side to the fifth floor on the other. That was actually nice, we got a new   urlLink view   from our balcony.  So Cherie & were sitting out on the balcony on Sunday evening, waiting to go down to happy hour. It was absolutely gorgeous out, but then again when wasn't it. When our craving for our Banana Jammers couldn't be contained anymore, we decided to head down. That's when the trouble started.  You see, the lock on the sliding glass door in our old room was a lot better & easier to figure out than the one on the door in our new room. When I went out to join Cherie, I shut the door & in doing so, lock ourselves out.  We struggled with the door for a bit, pulling this way, pushing that way, hoping to get the latch to unhook but it didn't work. This is when I had visions of fire trucks having to come rescue us with a big ladder, something I didn't want to happen, much to embarrassing & everyone would get a free show at our expense. So we gazed out over the balcony rail to see if we could possibly see anyone who might be able to help us.  Our help came from a little girl who was one floor down from us, minding her own business on her balcony. Once I got her attention & explained what happened she went to get her mother. She called down & then told us help was on the way.  We waited no longer than 5 minutes when I notice the  No moleste  sign move & the door open. Yipee, we were rescued!  Saturday night, Dateline did a special on hotel security & how safe you as a guest were staying in one. They advised us to always lock our doors with the bolt lock, a chain or one of those latches. So to protect ourselves from would be robbers, rapist & murderers, we did just that. But I had forgotten that we had until the note I stuck in the latch drifted down to the floor when someone from the hotel staff attempted to open the door.  Yes, that's right: we were locked out of our room on the balcony & our rescuers were lock out of our room because we had the latch engaged. We were pretty much screwed! So we attempted again to pull & push the door to get it open. I tried to lift the door off the track, but nothing worked.  Then we felt the windows shake: they were going to try to break down the door. (Funny thing was, the door in our last room looked like someone broke it open & was very difficult to open because of it. I wonder if the same thing happened before?) Anyway, after about 3-4 slams against the door the latch just popped open, leaving the door undamaged & our knights in leather work belts came to rescue us, probably cursing to themselves, "Stupid American girls..."

      Yes, sadly, we lost our second softball game. It was quite an interesting game though.  I personally did not strike out this time. I did however get out at first twice. The events leading up to my second up by far was the most interesting.  I followed Dave, our pitcher who got M.V.P. last time. He got a base run & when he tag the base, he landed on the corner of it &amp; his ankle bent in a way it shouldn't. It was quite disgusting & his face was so pasty white. He left in an ambulance. That was what I had to follow. I at this point decided I really didn't want to run &amp; tag first base & I opted to walk. I eventually went home.  We lost our pitcher &amp; really didn't have a second one, so our "coach" stepped up. We did very well the next couple of innings, then we lost it. Final score: 10-11.  I played second base for half the game & got someone out. Then I got to play right field.  My little brother attended! He saw Dave's ankle, not sure if he saw, or was interested, in the rest of the game, but I was happy he came.    Update :  Dave broke his ankle in two places. He's in a lot of pain, but, thankfully no surgery was needed.

        The spirit of the game ball goes to:    DAVE BROWN  Who pitched a great game!     Honorable mention goes to:    Miriam – for knocking that ball down at 2nd base.  Pam – for being a great bat girl and cheerleader.  Tony – for being ready to play even though he was hurt.  &nbsp;  Not real sure I deserved it...oh well!

      At work, the Grounds Crew challenged Facilities Management to a softball game. Today was the first, of five&nbsp;games&nbsp;&amp; I didn't suck too bad.  &nbsp;  Warming up I got beaned in the shin &amp; I think I still have the ball's impression on my skin.  &nbsp;  I couldn't catch any ground balls to save my life.  &nbsp;  First time up at bat I got a base run (despite my legs shaking from being so nervous) &amp; then ended up going home one or two plays later.  &nbsp;  I apparently stopped a ball from going into the outfield, would have been better if I held onto it &amp; got the guy out.  &nbsp;  Second time up at bat, I struck out. Oh well. The ump was going to let it slide, but I apparently waited for the strike call. What was I suppose to do. (This is the same guy that apparently "wink" at me during a trades meeting that&nbsp; urlLink Paul  decided to let the entire first floor know about. I think he was winking at Paul! Paul didn't like my suspicion.&nbsp;lol)  &nbsp;  We had to go into an extra inning because the game was tied. We ended up winning 13-12.  &nbsp;  Our prize for winning: grounds crew had to buy beer. I didn't partake because I don't like beer, so I drank my water.  &nbsp;     GO     FM  !

      I'm making myself crazy looking at all the puppies; they are just so cute when they sleep in their big old dishes, or when they fight.  They have one mini-pin. First time I went, no one could play with him because he hasn't seen the vet. His poor little ears were still red from being cropped. (I'm not cropping my mini-pins ears, btw.) The last two time he lay in the corner shaking! He was so cute though! I had to resist playing with him because I would go even more crazy wanting one.

      Today, Charlie had a little bit of surgery to remove some problem skin tags & a small mass (probably a tumor) that was found in his mouth.  All went well. Pops was a nervous wreck all day, which is understandable. Thankfully everything went well.  I went to pick Charlie up & he was definitely still woozy. He didn't even acknowledge me! HUMPH! I admit it was a little comical when he tried to get in the back of my car & then climb the steps to the house.  He gave Pops the same greeting he gave me, so I don't feel as bad now. He then proceeded to walk around the house in circles like a drunk man (dog?).  Now we have to wait to get the results on whether or not the lump & skin tags are cancerous.  Anyway, that's the Chucky update!
