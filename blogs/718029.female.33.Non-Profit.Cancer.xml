      May 15, 2002  I got out into the yard to do some work, finally. It's embarrassing how long I've let the flowerbed go out there. It felt so good to dig up some of the weeds and grass and yuck that's overtaken the bed. I even managed to transplant the rose bushes that were foolishly planted along the fence line last year - how we hated having to weed-whack around each and every one of them! Now they are secured within the bed and even the rose bush that Tracy and Sean bought for us when Paavo died has survived yet another winter.   It seems unthinkable that four years have passed since Paavo's death. He was our first Great Dane, and he died at Michigan State when they failed to put him on a ventilator during a biopsy. He was up there to confirm a diagnosis of Wobbler's Syndrome, which is a compression of the spinal cord that causes ataxia in the rear legs, decreased mobility and increasing levels of pain. He was only two years old, and I know that it was a blessing that he died, as the surgery and recovery involved in repairing the spine would've been really difficult - but I still miss him. His almost-brother, Rolf, survives him, but he is also a sickly dog. Rolf suffers from Wobbler's, as well, but his case is less severe and manageable so far. Unfortunately, Rolf is also diabetic and has developed cataracts in both eyes due to the diabetes. He is nearly blind and requires 86 units of insulin daily to keep him from slipping into a coma. Theo, our other Dane, is impossibly healthy. However, he's aggressive and unpredictable and we have to limit his exposure to others. Our years of dog ownership have been nothing if not fraught with peril.  I love my dogs, but I plan to enjoy a year or two of dog freedom after my 'boys' pass on. I've been toying with the idea of getting an Irish Wolfhound after that, given that I understand them to be unfailingly gentle and sweet. If I'm going to have a dog, give me a great big one, thank you. But just one next time - two dogs is too much to handle when I have so many other responsibilities. I'd want to give all of my pets plenty of love and attention, and I can't do that if I have too much going on at one time.   Tonight I once again heard Henry crying after I'd put him to bed. Or, rather, I thought I did. He was, in fact, sleeping peacefully - I'd just imagined his cry. Funny how vividly I imagine the slightest stirring from him. I was told that once I became a mother, I'd never really sleep soundly again, and I have to laugh over how true that is. My ears are always open. We're weaning to formula after nearly six months of exclusively pumping, and it's going well. Still, I am surprised by a sudden sadness over this passage. We could never get Henry to nurse consistently, and I had to work really hard to maintain a milk supply by just using the pump. Eventually, it became too difficult and I had to choose to wean him to formula or spend nearly every waking hour pumping. Even though I know that he will thrive on formula, I feel sorrow and guilt over switching him over. I even tried one last-ditch effort to get him to latch on today, and he cried and writhed until I gave up. I wished I could have a mind-meld with him and explain that this was the only way he was going to keep getting the breast milk he so clearly prefers. So I am down to one pump session before I go to bed, and I watch the number of ounces I pump each night decrease with something approaching grief. There's a part of me that wants to redouble my efforts to pump for him, but I know it's really not feasible. So, another milestone. He grows up and away.   But I shouldn't get overly dramatic. He is such a delightful and cuddly baby. Smiley and stubborn and sweet - not too quick to laugh, but oh, when he laughs. He makes you earn it. He loves to be held and danced around the living room. He holds eye contact with you for so long that you feel like he's seeing who you really are. I love being his mother.

      May 14, 2002  It's come to my attention that some people we know are considering pursuing gender selection for their next pregnancy via sperm separation. This, of course, has prompted a flurry of research and philosophical thought on my part. The family in question currently has one son, and it was common knowledge that the woman really wanted a daughter. I, too, initially wished for a daughter, so I can understand the desire for the child of a particular gender. I also remember how those of us who professed a preference for a certain gender were somewhat vilified by other pregnant women on the internet message boards I frequented during my pregnancy. So, I don't want to come off as overly harsh.   That said, I have to wonder how the elder child might feel upon finding out that his mother and father were willing to go to great trouble and expense in an attempt to ensure that they not conceive another son. How could he not feel diminished? As if having a son must've been such a disappointment that they were going to make sure that didn't happen again. It feels hurtful and shallow to me, somehow. I sit here, typing this with Henry on my lap, knowing now that having a son has been so wonderful that I will feel sorrow should we not have another.  Of course, I didn't know this in the early days of my pregnancy. When the baby's gender was still unknown to me, I tried to imagine what having a son or a daughter would feel like. I melted over the abundance of cute things for little girls and thought about passing on my feminine skills: knitting and cooking and giving yourself a top-notch pedicure. In short, I focused on handing down what I knew how to do. Once I knew we were expecting a son, however, I realized that as a couple, we were in a perfect position to raise a son. We have the kind of household that's naturally boy-friendly: lots of animals, lots of opportunity for outdoor mischief, a laid-back approach to life and a less-than-fastidious way about housecleaning. Heck, we're even rabid video game players! A boy would fit right in!  Indeed, he has. Now he is here and I have a hard time clearly imagining those days of wishing for a daughter. And while I hope that I have the opportunity to raise a daughter someday so that I might have that experience, too, I blanch at the thought of designing a pregnancy to ensure that result. Aside from the risks and expense, I would never want my son to feel less-than for one split second.  And, make no mistake, the expense is considerable and the potential for risk very real. Because sperm separation requires artificial insemination, the likelihood of success on the first try is significantly reduced. It's my understanding that the average AI patient requires three or four tries before they succeed. On top of that, the basic methods of separation are anything but foolproof. One method, known as micro-sorting, is based on the fact that female sperm have 3% more genetic material than male sperm. The sperm are washed in a dye, during which process the female sperm, by virtue of their greater mass, absorb more of the dye. A laser then separates the now gender-identifiable sperm. The risks of mutating the DNA with this process are unknown. In fact, one could give birth to a seemingly healthy child, only to discover myriad consequences later in life - sterility of the child was one risk mentioned in my books.  Another method is potentially less risky but only improves your odds if what you want is a concentrate of male sperm. Based on the fact that male sperm swim faster than female sperm, the sperm are filtered through increasingly concentrated layers of albumin, resulting in a high concentration of male sperm at the other end. But what's left behind is not a concentrate of female sperm, but rather a bedraggled mix of female sperm and slow male sperm. With either method, odds are improved but far from guaranteed.   On top of this, the odds of achieving a female pregnancy are reduced yet again because AI is carefully timed to coincide with ovulation, and cervical secretions at the time of ovulation are more alkaline, which favor male pregnancies. A dubious venture, if you ask me.   But the bottom line is that I'm probably enjoying this philosophical and biological tangent for naught. It seems that there are few doctors engaging in these types of procedures, and most do it only for couples with genetic markers for diseases like hemophilia, which can be passed down only to children of a specific sex. I sincerely doubt these people will ever have the opportunity to give either of these methods a try. At this point, I have to breathe a sigh of relief.

      May 9, 2002  Maybe everything I wrote the other night was bullshit. I don't mean that I think it was bullshit, but that other people might. It only takes an evening news show to demonstrate that a slew of procreating people don't feel as deeply as I do about their babies.  Take, for instance, the fact that my son will never have any doubt that I am his mother and my husband is his father. Nor will he have any doubt that his parents will always be happily married. (Again, piss off if you think that's arrogant or naïve. In our case, it is simple truth.) Nor will he have any doubt that we will love and cherish him every day of our lives and beyond. It never really occurred to me that these circumstances alone set him apart from a vast number of children - perhaps even the majority.  The aforementioned news program profiled two married couples, each with several children. In each case, the paternity of the youngest child was in question because both wives admitted to having had an affair. DNA tests were done, and in each case, the husband was not the child's father. Admittedly, this is gut-wrenchingly sad for everyone involved: the spouse, the child's half-siblings, the child himself. But am I the only one writhing in my recliner over the way the wives can look directly into the camera and say, "Well, we'll just have to keep loving this child and move forward"? Am I the only one so disgusted over this enormous moral failing that will bring season after season of emotional devastation as its harvest? This sort of thing makes me want to bring back the days of public flogging.  Yeah, I'm judgmental. But I also know that the reason so many people can't stand somebody like Dr. Laura is that they don't want to live up to standards of ethics; don't want to admit that they have responsibilities from which they should not be excused; don't want to pay the tab for their awful choices. Belly up to the bar for your shot of obligation, folks.  Eugene works with T, a young man who's just entered his twenties. He and his girlfriend, S, had been dating for about five months when they learned she was pregnant. Although they plan to marry some time after the baby is born, Eugene tells me that T doesn't appear to be too excited about the impending arrival of this baby, who is due any day now. T's busy taking another part-time job at a health club and joining a recreational basketball league, ostensibly to maintain the heart-breakingly good looks with which he's been blessed. Plus, a guy's gotta have his fun, right? When Eugene laughs that playing basketball at 6:00 am three days a week and taking an extra job just for a free health club membership might not be the most realistic additions to his schedule, given that he will be the father of an infant, T just looks at him blankly. Not that he doesn't understand that S (with whom he is living under her parents' roof) will need every spare moment of his time in order to help with this baby, but rather that he doesn't  want  to understand this. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that he's now inextricably and forever linked to someone he's known for mere months - in essence, a stranger. The cynic in me wonders how long such a blissful union can last.  And the reason T and S aren't getting married before the baby is born is because S still wants a big, fancy wedding, which will require months of planning. They both agreed to postpone the nuptials so they can have that wedding, including an extended honeymoon - for which they plan to have someone else look after their child. To this, I say, "Give me a break!" I still believe that conceiving a child out of wedlock should exclude the big wedding, replete with white gown. I believe that from the moment you become a parent, your 'right' to an island getaway evaporates. I'm flabbergasted by the nerve of some people, expecting all of the privilege that, in my mind, should be extended only to those who've done the right thing, at the right time, and in the right order. I'd be checking the "Regrets" box on that wedding invitation with a fat, permanent marker and a decisive stroke. Yeah, I'm old-fashioned.  Add to this the "Oprah Winfrey Show" this past Tuesday - boys and girls as young as twelve and thirteen engaged in oral sex. Have we failed to teach so many children even the most basic lessons of personal dignity? Of moral rectitude? Tracy called me during the first commercial break, needing to issue a long and low moan over the hideousness of what we were seeing.  These kids were beyond brazen, hissing their defiance at the adults with arguments like "It's my body and I'll do what I want." It was nearly comic, how these kids had lived so many years already and had failed to absorb even one iota of respect for the wisdom of their parents. They are utterly blind to the concept of regret, living only in a Perma-Present. No past, no future.   And people wonder why we intend to homeschool our children. As if 'socialization' as defined by modern standards, is anything any sane person would want for their offspring. I'd no sooner put my child in a randomly chosen group of children than I would wash an expensive white garment in a load of cheap red clothing. Thanks all the same, but we plan to limit and hand-select our children's friends. Does that make me elitist? Fine. Call it whatever you like, but my kid's not playing at your house unless I know you and your kid inside and out.  So, my baby already enjoys advantages unknown to countless numbers of his peers. And, make no mistake, they are advantages. How sad for those other babies, denied what we should all secure for them before they are even a gleam in their daddy's eye. Assuming they even know whom daddy really is.

      May 7, 2002  I kept waiting for some magic moment to start this, and just tonight I realized that the lightning bolt was never going to arrive. If I kept waiting for it, this period of my life would slip right through my mind and heart as if through some cosmic colander. I've always needed the tangible record to retain the intangible sweetness of life.  The other thing that held me back from beginning was my need to start with something truly important to say. Something meaningful, perhaps even profound. Sadly, this isn't forthcoming. The unadorned truth is that nearly everything I have to offer is plain common sense - so plain, in fact, that it should be apparent to everyone already.   So, let this (whatever *this* is) be whatever it will be. I can't change what I have to say any more than I can change the fundamentals of my person. And, hey, I like me. Perhaps you will, too.  My son, Henry, is exactly five months old tonight. By this, I mean whole calendar months and not that wacky way new mothers have of calculating their child's age in weeks. I swore I'd never do that to innocent bystanders, and have been mostly able to keep that promise, except in the earliest, delirium-filled weeks of motherhood when the temptation to answer the question "How old is he?" in not just weeks, but days, hours, minutes was overwhelming. It was simply because I couldn't seem to get my grey matter around the fact that he was real, and outside of me, and he was my own child. This moment of realization had indeed been the proverbial lightning bolt, and it occurred at the moment of his birth. It seemed entirely natural to count the hours and minutes since my world had begun to spin on an entirely new axis. The H-Axis.  This new gravitational force is just now beginning to feel all right. I'm getting my sea legs for motherhood. Henry sleeps reliably. He eats regularly and with overt smacking sounds that make my toes curl with enjoyment. Even as his face is frozen with grief in that long, silent moment before he really lets loose with the waterworks, I am drunk with the goddamned cuteness of it all. Oh, oh, oh - did you just see him there? Did you catch that? I am holding my breath during these moments, and only once it has passed can I exhale. And those real tears sliding down his perfect face: I have to kiss each drop away. I could ignore these no more than I could decide to cease blinking.   So he's perfect, and I'm so lucky I could spit. I didn't have a single moment of anything approaching post-partum depression, and I will boldly admit that I have no significant worries about my competence as a mother. Perhaps this only reveals the hugeness of my folly, but I don't care. I'm smart, and compassionate, and honest and kind. I married the kind of man other women can only dream of finding, and we still love each other as much, if not more so, than when we were eighteen and falling in love. We are Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers when it comes to our values and our goals, gliding along to the same rhythm. We haven't had to master the art of compromise simply because we are virtually always in total and perfect harmony. Piss on you if you don't like hearing this, but that's pretty much the way it should be. I wouldn't have considered bringing a child into this world had we not been properly set up for it. A pox on you who've handled the sacred with your shitty hands and lousy intentions.   Not that we're perfect. Heck, no. But we do have standards. And we don't repeat big mistakes. My way of keeping the biggies from resurfacing is to keep my regrets handy. Regrets, I've had a few. Look at the easy way out through the lens of regret and it doesn't look so appealing any more. But I digress.  There's nothing at all subtle about motherhood. It hits you like a freight train with a full load. Some women have the preparations begin early, in the form of a difficult pregnancy, but I don't believe even they feel the force of it until that baby is born and in their arms. In fact, it takes weeks for you to tally all the ways that the Motherhood Express has rearranged you. Let's look at a few:  You will never look at a child the same way again. No matter how compassionate you thought you were prior to becoming somebody's mama, you can now look back and see your former self as the old snapper turtle you were in relation to this new, mewling, blind, premature kitten you've become. The abject horror with which you will absorb any report of cruelty to another child, any child, is enough to set you physically reeling. I've been a true crime buff all my life, and reveled in forensic anthropology and crime-solving television shows. Within a couple of weeks of Henry's birth, I'd decided I'd earned the privilege of having the satellite TV turned on again. I'd seen one too many episodes of "The Nanny" at 4am with only the local channels to keep me alert while feeding the babe. What a mistake. That first night, I tuned in to one of my favorite true crime shows. A young mother and her 16-month-old baby had been reported missing after what appeared to be a burglary. It was later determined that the woman was strangled to death in her home and the perpetrator had buried the body of the woman and her sleeping (but very much alive) baby together in a grave deep in the woods. I was a wreck for a solid week thereafter. I promise you that as horrified as I would've been to hear such a thing before I became a mother, I was infinitely more traumatized, disgusted, appalled, furious and utterly uncomprehending of such evil as I held my newborn son. I'd take one look at him and my tears would roll hotly down my face all over again. Or, I'd hear that the child of a loved one was ostracized at school: kids would get up from any lunch table where he chose to sit. My God! How could anyone be so cruel to another human being? How could we allow it? Is this what we are? You are forever changed by the arrival of your child - your most precious possession, your biggest investment, your hopes and dreams, your great love - now moving about in a world full of peril and savagery. These same desperate feelings come bubbling to the surface at the mention of anybody's baby in harm's way. After all, that could be my baby.  You set aside a lot of manageable, shallow concerns in favor of gigantic, important, life-altering stuff. OK, so maybe this one isn't universal. I seem to know a fair number of parents who aren't wading out into the deep, necessarily. But a whole laundry list of stuff that had previously occupied a fair to middlin' amount of my mental energy seems patently ridiculous, now. Perhaps it is not to my credit that my standard for personal appearance has dropped to "At least I'm clean" for public occasions, but I am pleased with the way these matters have fallen away from me. The time spent debating the relative merits of bangs or the readiness of my wardrobe for the upcoming season is now spent developing relationships I deem necessary for Henry to reach his potential as a human being: church groups, volunteer groups, homeschooling groups. I am eager to form and demonstrate the very qualities I wish for him, in the hopes that my example will be the best mold. And so, I reach. And in order to reach for that, I've gotta let go of this.  You cannot stop thinking of your child. Really. It's impossible. The stream of consciousness goes something like this: "OK so what should we have for dinner tonight gee I wonder if the baby's gaining enough weight and getting good nutrition you know I'm so lousy at my own nutrition I should really get my shit together don't want to inflict my food weirdness on this perfect new little person I want him to always be sated to get all of what he needs and a little of what he wants too but how should I go about..." In the past week alone, my husband has heard me ask him about the baby ("Where is the baby? Do you have the baby? Is he sleeping? In his crib?") no fewer than three nights, even while I am dead asleep. He knows I am sound asleep, but I still insist he answer my questions. So he complies, and the very nanosecond my queries end, my snoring resumes. Or, I leap out of bed having dreamt that I rolled over on Henry and suffocated him - even though Henry has never slept in our bed, not for one second. The fact that I know the very idea to be absurd when I am awake does nothing to quell the fears in my dreams. I cannot drive anywhere without thinking "I did put him in the car, right? He is here, right?" no matter how recently I, myself, secured him in his car seat. Maybe this one diminishes with time, but my gut is telling me not to bet on it.  Of course, there are myriad things I could add to this list, but they're smaller - not so omnipresent, you know. Like how your body image changes irrevocably. For some people, the utilitarian nature of pregnancy and motherhood are fraught with negatives, but I happen to disagree. In this endeavor, I finally found something for which to praise my physical self. My body could hardly be considered the envy of women anywhere, even before the advent of pregnancy. So, naturally, I had slim hopes for an improved self-image. But, amazingly, my assessment of myself roared to life during pregnancy. I learned that while my body was not made for the display of a bare midriff, it was indeed made to carry a child - and do it nearly effortlessly. (A running joke with a close friend was "Broad shoulders...broad hips...good breed stock", which we grunted in a guttural, faintly German accent, after which we giggled helplessly.) While a beloved family member with a physique to make Barbie jealous was puking her guts out well into her sixth month of pregnancy, I had sailed through on tranquil and gorgeous seas. I was born to do this, and, dammit, I was grateful for that. These days, I am far less consumed by form and far more concerned with function. What a delightful transformation.

      * Me! I� 'm Michelle, thirty-one years old as of July 2002. Before I say one word about myself, please refer to my all-time favorite quote: "Do I contradict myself? Very well, then - I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes." - Walt Whitman. Now that you've heard my disclaimer, we can proceed.  I hate attaching one-dimensional terminology to myself so early on, but here's a brief summary:   I am increasingly conservative with age, anti-abortion, pro-death penalty (Whoops! Not any more! See November 2002), pro-firearms. Are you a raging liberal? You'll find little to feel warm and fuzzy about here. However, I am utterly stumped by anyone who pledges blind and unwavering allegiance to any political party. I vote all over the map.   I am a hard-core environmentalist and consider recycling and composting among my favorite hobbies. I am an animal-lover who has tried many times to go vegetarian, but failed miserably.   I am a practicing Catholic who returned to the poor parish of my childhood and I relish the community I've found there. I was chosen to sit on Parish Council this year and joked that they should really perform background checks on people before they go nominating people willy-nilly like that.   I have an utterly filthy mouth and am trying hard to curb my colorful euphemisms - but you will surely see them peppered throughout here. If profanity offends you, move on.   I am a rabid fan of Donald Roller Wilson's artwork (www.donaldrollerwilson.com) and hope one day to be able to afford one of his prints. I love anything from the Modernism movement from the 1950s. Our house is a great example of Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonia concept. It's amazing - a real one-of-a-kind. We bought it directly from the original owners a year after I wrote them a letter, asking them to keep us in mind should they ever decide to sell. They did, and we are the proud caretakers of this strange time capsule of a home. It has a flat roof, original cork tiles on the floors, and no painted surfaces in the house - it's all brick, rare wood veneers or glass walls. The ceilings are all tongue-in-groove slats crossed by giant redwood beams. Barring any major lottery wins, they will carry me out of this house in a body bag before I ever move.  I knit and draw and write, both professionally and for pleasure, as hobbies. I used to work for one of the Big Three automakers but left after several years of disgust and drudgery. I took a year off, began to work at my vet clinic for fun and promptly got pregnant. It was the only job I have ever truly loved. I have degrees in Business Administration (the great "get-a-job-for-sure" catchall degree) and Spanish. If I had it to do over again, I don't know what I'd study, but it surely wouldn't be that.  I share my life with:  * Eugene, my dear husband of seven years as of June 2002, thirty-one years old as of February 2002. He is one stellar human being and I aspire to be more like him with each passing year. He is patient, kind, honest, compassionate and hard-working. I've been with him since October of 1989, when he was a freshman in college and I was a sophomore. He was so cute that I hunted him down like a coon dog and I've been in love ever since. He wore a Morris The Cat watch that his mom had gotten for him by mailing in cat food labels and I knew he was the one for me.  * Henry, our first child. Born in December of 2001, he is the light of our lives. At nearly eight months old at the time of writing, he amazes and delights me every day. He is an incredibly pleasant child, with a great sense of humor and a streak of determination a mile wide. For many years, I thought I would be childfree for life - but then I read Danielle Crittendon's "What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us" and I changed my mind completely. I stay at home full-time to care for Henry, and I look forward to having more children.  * Rolf and Theo, our two fawn male Great Danes. These are cherished pooches, let me tell you. Rolf suffers from Wobbler's Syndrome (a spinal compression condition that limits his mobility), diabetes and bi-lateral cataracts stemming from the diabetes. He was five in July of 2002, and this summer will be his last. His health has been declining for some time, and we don't want to put him through another winter. Of late, I cry nightly over our impending loss. Theo, on the other hand, is absurdly healthy. He was four as of May 2002, and he is fat and sassy. And I do mean fat - he gained fifty pounds this year to top the scales at nearly 184 pounds! But he is also incredibly muscular and not a canine with which to mess. The UPS man nearly wets his pants every time he has to drop something off at the door and sees Theo going ballistic on the other side of the door. Theo's diet commences as soon as our insulin-dependent Rolf passes away - we have to keep food available at all times for Rolfie-roo.   * Claude and Dodi, our feline brother and sister mischief team. The only cats I've ever known to come when called to both family and complete strangers. Claude, in particular, is well-known as a *kitty-whore* to our buddies at the vet clinic for his outrageously affectionate temperament. Dodi is every bit as sweet, but she has an - ahem -inappropriate elimination problem. Which is to say that every now and then she pees somewhere that's dreadfully inconvenient. Our interim solution is to keep Dodi largely sequestered.   Let's see - what else should you know, going in? I have some reservations about keeping this journal and deciding with whom to share it, among people I know in 'real' life. I'd like to be able to write honestly about everything, but I wonder about the wisdom of doing so, given the likelihood that someone, at some point, will discover that I keep this journal and want to read it. I'm still working this out as I go along.  So, let's get started, shall we?

      July 31, 2002  I'm up late tonight, trying to get some work done on a baby sweater I'm knitting for Kim, my close friend and our veterinarian. Her first baby is due August 21, 2002, and they won't let her go beyond that date because she is an insulin-dependent gestational diabetic. I have kept her in my prayers that her baby is happy and healthy and that her GD disappears like a bad memory after delivery. I remember telling her how she'd miss being pregnant, once her baby was born and she found this difficult to believe, early on. But she told me recently that she now understood what I meant, and that she was downright wistful over the approaching end of her pregnancy. Dem hormones, dey're a powerful thing.  I saw on the news today that two teenage girls who'd been kidnapped in California this morning were recovered safely and their kidnapper was shot and killed. I told Tracy that a person couldn't ask for a happier ending. Tracy, who is anti-death penalty and regularly harangues me about my blood lust, laughed and joked that I should really write for Disney, what with that fairy tale, chipper tone. I took her friendly snide commentary as a compliment (as she knew I would) and said again what a delight the whole outcome was. One fewer scumbag to clog the courts and endanger prison workers. Good riddance, you son of a bitch. I hope they're making up a bed of nails for him in Hell.   The Elizabeth Smart case still boggles me. Where is that child? Surely she's dead by now, but my God - how must her family be getting through the days? I feel most for her little sister, and I wonder what kind of therapy the upcoming years hold for that poor child. I would happily volunteer to execute the perpetrator with a dull butter knife, given the opportunity.  I know that as a Catholic, I should technically be anti-death penalty, and believe me when I say I do give the matter regular thought. But as the daughter of a retired inner-city police officer, I have also known well the true circumstances of public servants in the line of hard-core criminals. I simply do not believe that it is fair to ask anyone to interact with especially dangerous criminals who are really just wild animals. I believe that an individual forfeits their 'right' to draw breath when they commit a violent act against an innocent victim.   Another thing on my mind has been the phenomenal PBS series "Frontier House". I've seen it twice now, and I get something new out of it each time. The latest personal revelation for me has been my change of heart regarding Karen Glenn. The first time through, I thought "What a shrew!" But upon further reflection, I've decided that, for me, she is the most compelling and complex person to participate in the project. The Clunes barely register above the *detestable* tick for me, in the end. I could see why Karen couldn't stand them, quite frankly.   When Karen talked about her sadness and insecurity over her "plainness" in the face of the other women whose domestic skills she perceived to be so much superior to hers, I melted for her. I wanted to reach into the TV and tell her to shake it off - the feeling of being less-than in the face of glossy superficiality. Seeing Adrienne Clune back home at her palatial estate in California, trotting through the cavernous interiors of her 'home' in marabou-trimmed mules, made me want to hurl. Yet I understood how Karen feels inferior in the face of what society calls femininity. Women are supposed to be soft-spoken and sweet and glamorous, and Adrienne Clune embodies that dubious notion of what makes a woman desirable. Women aren't supposed to be brash, or moody, or difficult, or opinionated.   But it was Karen whose children made me want to weep for joy - not the Clune kids, smuggling in makeup and prancing around in their skivvies. And every time Karen vented, I had to agree with the truth of what she said. I wanted to shake her husband Mark and tell him to be a MAN, already - give his wife the loving support she so desperately needed. Wrap your arms around that porcupine, you idiot! Underneath that spiny exterior beats the proverbial heart of gold. I don't think Karen would ever have ascended to those heights of bitchiness had Mark agreed with her valid complaints and helped her find a way back into the positive spirit. That's what marriage is about, for crying out loud! If somebody would just give in and be the first to support their spouse, even when they felt like backing away, half of these failed marriages would survive. But everybody's so quick to assume the "Harumph!" posture - which does nothing to elevate the situation. Karen probably felt like she was talking to the wall, with nobody to really hear her. But I heard her, loud and clear. I'm sure she's probably received the brunt of critical comments about the show, and that appalls me. In her vilified place, I'm happy to nominate:  Gordon Clune - what a creepola. Why is it no surprise to me that his children were smuggling in contraband, given that their parents cheated and dragged in a spring mattress in the dead of night? Sorry, Gordie - that's not the "pioneer spirit" - that's just fraud. You may be considered a success in the modern age, pally, but you're dead out there on the frontier. And don't give me any sass about the newlyweds being the real highlight of the show - they were still floating on their marshmallow cloud of freshly-wedded bliss.  Karen Glenn was the marrow on that piece of meat, and that's that. Give me a strong, brash, 'plain' woman any day over any of those others.  OK, I should turn in. I still have some chores tonight - miles to go before I sleep, so to speak.

        August 28, 2002    Jerry Seinfeld has written a children�s book about Halloween � and the oh-so-imaginative title? �Halloween.� Gag me with a lead pipe. For all the tens of thousands of wonderful, heartfelt classic books for children in all age categories, why does this piece of shit have to take center stage in the kid�s section of the bookstore? Before you snarl �J�accuse!� in my direction, I actually read the book the whole way through tonight. I gave the matter the appropriate respect and benefit of the doubt, so hush up now. Mama�s talkin�.  It�s written like a stand-up routine for adults, waxing nostalgic about Halloween from a kid�s perspective. The problem is that it�s only mildly funny (a too generous compliment, to be honest) when you�re an adult looking back on Halloween nights spent trick-or-treating. It�s a kids� book written by someone who has no idea how to write for children. I guess this was very evident to me because I�ve recently finished a book entitled �Dear Genius: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom�, which is a collection of letters both from and to (but mostly from) the great UN. She was the Children�s Department Editor of Harper�s - the very first influential publishing figure in children�s literature, beginning at a time when no one considered books for children very important or artful, much less �literature�. Her influence can be seen in just about every major child�s classic you could name. Reading that book has done me a world of good � it�s helped me be able to spot a core emotional truth in the books I choose for Henry, not to mention making a list a mile long of classics to add to my �Must Have� list for our home library. And let�s just say this stupid Seinfeld book did not cut the proverbial mustard. The only thing that stinker was cutting was a giant hunk of Stilton or Limburger.  But, hey � Jerry Seinfeld�s a celebrity! A big star! Of course, we�d want a book by a Big Star for our littl�uns! It�s full of nifty caricature illustrations of a wee Seinfeld and it even has a CD of the Big Star reading his very own text! Whoop-dee-fucking-do. When are we, as a collective society, going to shake off this tremendously stupid idol-worship? Could anything be lamer? Seriously. Give it some thought and try to tell me I�m wrong. What a waste of time and energy and emotion and money. Go learn to bake bread, sew a quilt, grow tomatoes, fix a carburetor. Anything � just do something other than watch Access Hollywood while you thumb through In Style, OK?  OK, that�s enough ranting for now. I have plenty to be happy about, anyway. Eug is on vacation and I actually got stuff done today: weeded a front shrubbery bed, did some laundry (and folded a veritable mountain of clean clothes), typed up a spreadsheet of clothing to be donated this week, including estimated values, and picked up some extra storage containers to pack away some of the little clothes Henry�s outgrown. They were on sale at Target, so I bought a bunch of them, figuring I�d fill them up eventually. I bought a different color than the ones I have now, so that I�ll know just by looking at them that they contain kids� clothing. I know it�s going to get me all hormonal and misty-eyed, packing away the stuff H has already outgrown. Wondering if I�ll get another little boy to wear some of this stuff again. A little Linus.    Tomorrow the weeding and yard cleaning continues, plus some mending. I hate mending. Now that I refuse to iron anything, mending has taken the top spot on my �Most Loathed Chores� list. (Really � I never iron. I won�t buy or wear anything that requires ironing. Life is too damned short. Besides, I have not only embraced my inner slob, I have her in a death grip, which precludes wearing anything with a crisp line.) I promised myself I would mend two things, and be done with it. Then I can walk away feeling like Queen of All I Survey.  Parish council meetings have started, too. Have I told y�all how cute our priest is? I mean cute as in precious, not cute as in hottie � that would be inappropriate. Although he   is   a fine looking young man, make no mistake (I�m married, but I�m not  BLIND ). But he�s just the sweetest thing, and it�s no wonder everybody adores him. He�s the kind of priest where you get bummed just thinking about him ever leaving, because you know his poor replacement would pale in comparison. The council meetings will be fun and informative, to be sure. Sister M., our resident nun, is in attendance, too, and her presence alone makes me hum like a contented lap cat. Five minutes with that woman and you know there�s not a mean bone in her body � goodness is just comin� off her in waves. So, it�s another thing on my To Do list, but it�s also a good place to be. And it�s a great excuse to bake things I shouldn�t have hanging around the house � yet another reason to look forward to doing my Catholic duty, heh heh.   Another thing to be happy about is Super Mario Sunshine for the Nintendo GameCube. We�ve been waiting for this game since last November, and now it�s finally here! Eug and I have been playing like we�re both thirteen-year-old boys with nothing better to do. I�ve soaked up enough time with the game already so that the theme music is embedded in my brain. I suppose this is technically fiscally irresponsible of us, given that we�re only about halfway to being able to afford a $20K roof, but I don�t care. I remember vividly being pregnant and wondering when they�d actually release this game. Now I�ve got it, and I�m going to love every minute of it. Our kids are going to have years of humble pie served to them in the video game department before they ever get good enough to rival the years of experience of their parents. A little humility will be good for them�  OK, other than that all is well. Henry is getting cuter and cuter � his hair is kinda curly (courtesy of his Auntie P), and he�s pulling himself up into a full-fledged stand, too. Crawling is old news by now, and his two bottom teeth are all the way out. He�s both independent and a snuggler, and he makes me all gooey inside, even still. In fact, I think it�s intensifying. Heaven help me.

        August 25, 2002    Well, I saw three movies this weekend, and the desire to contrast two of them is just overwhelming. I watched �In The Bedroom� and �The Sweetest Thing� on Friday. I wanted a flick fix, so I figured I�d get a girly movie to watch in the afternoon before Eug got home. Then when I went to return both movies last night, I popped in to browse and found myself bringing home two more: �Storytelling� and �Big Night� (which I have yet to watch).  We�ll get �In The Bedroom� out of the way right now. A quiet, desperate little film. Sad and messy subject matter with sincere performances. Recommended, but it�s a downer, so consider yourself forewarned.  Now, let�s talk for a bit about �The Sweetest Thing�, shall we? I admit that when I rented it, I was not expecting fine filmmaking. My standards were, I thought, more than reasonable. I wanted a cute movie with a few laughs. I required no plausible plotlines, nor scintillating dialogue. Just the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy, OK?  What I got was surprisingly vile and unfunny, and I�ve been looking forward to breaking down my incredibly negative reaction in writing. Mostly for my own benefit, if you must know. Feel free to skip on if you�re bored. Let�s see � where to start? Maybe with the writer of this piece of shit � she�s a real hipster, lemmee tell ya. One of those Ariel Gore, cooler-than-thou types. �Sex In The City� wannabe. Got the picture? Good. The DVD had bonus materials that included the most self-congratulatory interview of this turd of a woman that I have ever seen, bar none. She went on and on about how �nobody�d written a script that showed how women   reeeeeealllly   talk to each other, that was intelligent  and  funny, blah blah blah�. The director and actors were saying things like �Finally, someone�s written a film that tells it like it is!� My eyebrows nearly jumped off my face by the time I�d seen a few minutes of this dross. How did she find so many people to jack her off with a smile on their faces? Gee, sister, if it�s all the same to you, I�ll speak for myself � you�re nowhere near to telling my truth.  So, OK, we have an annoying author who thinks she�s written Pulitzer material�but what about the movie, Michelle? It�s crass and one-dimensional. Cameron Diaz plays Christina Walters, a self-centered, arrogant whore who leaves scores of men bitter and full of self-doubt after even brief interludes with her �fabulousness�. The filmmakers actually think they�ve created a likeable character in Christina, but the farty reek of guttersnipe trash is coming off this chick in waves. In one of the opening scenes, we see Christina shaking her tail feathers on the sidewalk in broad daylight, walking up a San Francisco hill on her way home. Like all super-cool chicks just dance for no reason, right? In staggering, ankle-breakingly high heels and tight pants. While talking on their cell phones with their bestest girlfriends. (Side note: When will Cameron Diaz wear something other than low-slung hip-huggers in a movie? That look will be oh-so-dated in record time, I promise you.) And of course everyone just loves her � we have a requisite shot of an old broad who tells her to keep on keepin� on, just so that we know how Christina inspires love and lust in even casual bystanders. Even female casual bystanders. Even old, female casual bystanders.   So there�s the arrogance, and I hinted at the whole whore thing. Every female character in this movie spreads like room temperature whipped butter, but isn�t that just FUN? Isn�t that just LIBERATING? Gosh, we�re JUST LIKE THE BOYS! Girls need to sow those wild oats, too, ya know! Kaff, kaff � hack, sputter. These characters are waaaay beyond the age where this seems like remotely a good idea. Even  teenaged  girls generally know they�re giving away something valuable, but they�re too powerless to know how to say no when they think a boy�s attention validates their worth. A grown woman, graduated from college and living on her own, should�ve been able to pull her head from her loosey-goosey ass by now. I wouldn�t consider a woman of that age who hadn�t figured out that giving it away for free was an incredibly bad idea any kind of a girlfriend, to be honest. Certainly everyone�s made mistakes in life, but if you�re too stupid or too buried in denial to know that they are, in fact, heinous errors in your judgment, then you and I probably won�t relate. Oh, there�s the token ending where the girls   do   want something more substantial in a relationship, and I know that�s supposed to make it all hunky-dory, but it doesn�t. The rampant, easy sexuality is obscene and off-putting. And definitely not funny � pathetic is more the word.  The thing that bothers me most about movies like this is that I imagine dumbass parents everywhere allowing their teenaged girls to see shit like this (long before they�re old enough to walk into a theater and see it alone). Girls who are going to walk away wanting to be just like the �cool� characters in the movie, where everything turns out all right, and you�re sought-after and slender and on the cutting edge of fashion (because that�s what matters, right?), and you don�t get venereal warts (or worse), and Prince Charming doesn�t hold it against you that you�ve slept with half the city before he ever arrived on the scene, and life is just one long, risqu� joke until you decide to settle down and you have no regrets about the way you�ve conducted yourself. Young people today are increasingly stupid, and I�m afraid young girls are perhaps the most vulnerable in this way. They�ll never know they�ve been sold a bill of goods until they�re forty-two and they look back on their carefree, callow youth and liken that abortion they had because �it just wasn�t the right time to have a baby� to drowning a sack of kittens in the river. They�ll wonder what they could have been if they�d spent more time in their thoughts and less time in the mall. They�ll look with new, hard eyes on everything they�ve done and said and realize that they did, in fact, toss away much of what was good and true about themselves with both hands.  And they�ll know that they should have behaved very differently and the culture at large will be only partially responsible � the rest of that burden they�ll have to carry alone, I�m afraid. And any adult woman who won�t admit that to you younger women is lying to you and herself, period.  So I hated the movie because it glorified everything I find so dangerous and tedious and useless about women in modern society. End of story.  Now, �Storytelling� was a different matter altogether. What a powerhouse. Todd Solondz, the excruciatingly nerdy guy who masterminded �Welcome To The Dollhouse� and �Happiness�, has put together another exercise in emotional torture. That�s the thing about his movies � he manages to be both cartoon-y and extraordinarily genuine and painfully grotesque, all at the same time. It�s really quite a marvel. It�s a brief movie, with the option to watch either the R-rated version or the unrated version, which delighted me thoroughly. (I�ve been wanting to see �Requiem For A Dream�, but Blockbuster only rents the edited version. Why would I bother? Give it all to me � I�m a grown-up and I can take it, gosh durn it.) After seeing the unrated version, I imagine that some footage of a very explicit sex scene was probably cut to make the R-rating, but here again, the brutality of the scene would be compromised by a kinder cut. You�d lose something in the translation.   Anyway, I don�t want to say too much about �Storytelling� except that perhaps if The Criterion Collection releases it, I�ll buy it. I hope I have the kind of children who grow to be young adults capable of seeing a film like this and having it inspire intelligent discussion. It�s one of those movies that covers so much territory, and it does so with deft, small touches. For example, a moment where a character making a documentary film asks a pair of teenagers if having a nice car is important to them after they�ve made fun of his car. The girl�s response is heard but not seen before the quick cut: �Well, duh.� Mmmm. I don�t want to fuck this up with my attempt to talk about it. It�s too grand for me to do anything but diminish it. Very nice stuff from what is obviously a tormented man. Way better than the Daniel Clowes� �Ghost World�, and I liked that, too. Still, nothing can touch �Crumb� for genuine, tortured greatness.

        August 23, 2002    Sorry it�s taken me so long to update the site. I�ve been feeling exhausted and disheveled. My sleeping habits have been lousy at best, and every day I�m operating at a lower and lower efficiency. Ugh. It�s all I can do to keep myself from sleeping when Henry naps, because if I do, then I won�t sleep at night.  Speaking of Henry, he�s growing up so fast. For some time now, he�s been pulling himself up into a kneeling and then standing position. You can just tell he thinks he�s so cool when he does this. The downside of this newfound ability is that when you combine it with his incredible �mama�s boy� temperament, you get a kid who can�t be put down for two seconds before he�s climbing my leg and squawking like a wounded buzzard. He may as well be grafted to me, he�s so attached. He is simply fiercely determined to get what he wants, when he wants it. And what he wants these days is me, 24/7. God help me.  So, Nicolas Cage was on Regis and Kelly this morning. I saw a few minutes before I had to turn off the TV for greener pastures. Am I the only one who thinks the Nicolas Cage/ Lisa Marie Presley wedding is the creepiest union in recent history � so creepy as to make the Lisa Marie/ Michael Jackson thing seem relatively normal? I mean, is it not patently obvious that this one-note actor only wants his shot at fathering the grandchild of THE KING? How many movies has Cage done with his not-so-subtle Elvis homage? (Not the easiest thing to do when you�re as bald as a bocce ball!) He even did his best Elvis singing voice in �Wild At Heart�. Nic, shake it off. You�re not THE KING. Should you and Lisa Marie have a son, do him a favor and squash any desires to teach him to hip-swivel or to comb his hair into a duck�s ass pompadour, OK? It�s not right to put your twisted fantasies onto the narrow shoulders of a small child. Behave yourself, fer crissakes.  Speaking of odious celebrities, I wish I could go six months without seeing Carnie Wilson on TV, crowing about how she�s STILL NOT FAT AGAIN! How freaking gross to have surgeons make you a thumb-sized stomach as a last-ditch effort to keep you from killing yourself with food. Never mind the fact that she�s encouraging all kinds of people to have a dangerous surgery � one which is totally unnecessary, given a modicum of self-control, and one which can and does have fatal consequences for unsuspecting and vulnerable people. Besides, I�ll never forget about hearing that gastric bypass surgery makes you smell very, very bad for a long time. Major eeeew factor.   I�ve noticed a few more commercials that drive me batty lately. The first one is an old standby pet peeve: bad grammar. I think it�s for orange juice, and it�s trying to achieve this bogus down-homey feel by listing all of the wonderful things moms do�as in �Here�s to you, mom, for (fill in the blank)�. One of the things rattled off is �Here�s to you, mom, for getting us waked up�. FOR GETTING US WAKED UP?  Fucking A, they�re not even TRYING any longer! Does that sound remotely correct to anyone? How does this shit get approved, is what I want to know.  The other thing that bugs me about commercials lately is the way they LIE THROUGH THEIR SLIMY TEETH. The L�Oreal commercial for Lash Architect mascara with ridiculously computer animated eyelashes, for example. No way in hell I�m buying that product for this egregious commercial sin. I don�t care that they have a little disclaimer at the bottom � it�s still irresponsible and stupid of them. We�ve now taken real women, starved them reed-thin, lit them with more care than an operating room, made them up to within an inch of their lives, airbrushed their imperfections away and then animated them for that extra oomph! Say your prayers, people � Armageddon might be just around the corner. Another lying commercial is that Cheer commercial that starts with �Does this look black to you?� The premise of the spot is that Cheer keeps black clothes truly black�so they do a split screen to show you a really dark black, thereby revealing that what you thought looked black at first is actually a washed-out grey. But if you keep your eyes plastered to the first side of the screen as they reveal the �true� black on the right, you�ll notice that the color on the left gets  noticeably lighter ! Cheat! Cheeeee-eat! I smell a cheat! You might just as well be a whore as be an advertising agency worker, from a moral standpoint. It�s six of one, half dozen of another.  Before I leave you, I will counter my complaints with my new commercial favorites � of course, one has to be the  urlLink Dancing Dude  (his name is  urlLink Vaughn !) in the Kmart Joe Boxer commercial. The other is the Vanish toilet bowl cleaner with something called Acti-Scents commercial. It�s the one where this goofy music is playing and the little girl tries to go into the bathroom, but dad�s just stunk it up. Mom puts one of these contraptions in the toilet, and fresh air and easy breathin� are once again restored. Something about it makes me crack up, every time. I told you I was weird.

        August 18, 2002    Can anyone explain to me why some people don�t floss? That has to be the grossest thing, bar none. All of you non-flossers and part-time flossers need to pick up some good quality dental tape and GO AT IT. I don�t care if your gums are torn to shreds that first time and you think you�ll never get the taste of blood out of your mouth � take it as your punishment for being so incredibly disgusting. I mean, why not just quit wiping your ass? It�s such a nuisance! Just do your toilet business and pull �em up!  Flossing should be done   at least   once a day. And if you�re not flossing, it�s a safe bet that your tongue�s a bacterial breeding ground, so make scrubbing it part of your routine, too. I�m not going to gently encourage you by telling you that flossing will help you keep your teeth into your old age, or that once you do it regularly it is not painful, nor inconvenient. I�m just going to tell you what a freaking slob you are if you haven�t picked those tidbits of last night�s chicken dinner out of your choppers yet. Ugh. Go floss. Now. Don�t come back until you�re done.  Another thing that�s bugging me lately are all those oh-so-PC comercials with the tagline �The More You Know�. Tonight a no-name actress soberly informed me that I need to be careful not to tell ethnic jokes around my children, because even jokes teach hate. If anything makes me want to bust out into gaudy caricatures of ethnic stereotypes out of sheer defiance, it�s shit like this. Let me do a little jive talkin� and watermelon eatin�. Perhaps the �Lazy Latino� napping under a sombrero or the moustache-twirling, pasta-eating Eye-talian. It�s the same reaction I get when I see those �Truth� commercials with all the clever teens performing their open-your-eyes, anti-smoking pranks. All I want is a carton of high-tar filterless coffin nails after one of those fucking spots. It�s not that I disagree with whatever they�re trying to tell me, necessarily, but rather that I refuse to be told what to do or think or be or want by some faceless entity that wants to mold me into a convenient, pliable package. Fuck you. The world is more interesting with slightly demented old men who grab the asses of diner waitresses. I   want   the surprise of hearing the guy who�s trying to sell me a lawn mower bust out with something totally un-PC, like how �the Orientals always expect to be waited on first, no matter who was here before �em.�  I much prefer the world where people are out with all their quirks and prejudices and hang-ups than one where everybody keeps it all locked inside behind thin smiles and non-threatening, carefully chosen words. Go ahead and make that blonde joke, you putz! I don�t need some TV commercial to shelter me from the fact that some people are always going to think less of me because I am (fill in the blank). Female, Caucasian, Catholic, Blonde�whatever. I can take it, fer crissakes! Just be ready for me to do some dishin� out, too.  Now, before you get your panties in a twist, let me state my 21st century disclaimer: I do not encourage anyone to engage in stereotyping other human beings or doing anything that so obviously causes cancer. But why is it so hard for us to accept that stereotypes exist because so many people literally bring them to life, leaping off the page in vivid Technicolor? For example, I hold women to a higher standard because I am a woman. Nothing enrages me more effectively than to see some dumb broad with nothing more to offer the world than a peek at her fake tits. I went looking for an old work incident that I was certain I�d written about, but I was unable to find anything on the subject. It was a true incident where a co-worker had come back from an automotive union meeting (read: boondoggle) with photos of all the old coots pawing some dumbass woman on the beach. Picture Donatella Versace with melon-sized implants in a bright yellow latex bikini. This woman dressed herself like a piece of meat, allowed strangers to grope her in broad daylight, and removed her top for pictures   in exchange for a couple of drinks and a side of cheese sticks  . I would happily execute that woman myself, for lowering the standards of expectation for all women everywhere in such a singular fashion. And don�t give me any bullshit about how her actions don�t affect me. Those perverts came back from their trip with still more �proof� that women are to be treated like nothing more than a place to put your dick, and their crappy treatment of any woman who crosses their path is further reinforced and strengthened. I did and do pay the price for little Miss Side O� Cheese Sticks. Anyway, I wish I could�ve found my original writing.  But my little trip down memory lane did yield some laughs. I have a few files left of old work-related rants, and some of them are priceless. Well, at least to  me  they are. They give you a little flavor for how I was dying a slow, agonizing death at Ford Motor Company, and give you a giggle at the same time! Let�s see if you agree:    * This one�s kind of long. Some names have been vaguely changed to protect even those who don�t deserve it.    �I can hear Steve over the wall right now, bragging to some poor bastard about his spawn. Apparently, Little Stephanie or Stefanie or Stephany or however they spell the child's name is, in fact, a genius! I know, you probably thought your kids were smart - but she's far more advanced - trust him on this one. And, (Surprise, surprise!) she really loves her dah-dah. She walks all the way down the stairs and across the living room all by herself to greet him when he comes home from work,   and she's only two months old!    OK, OK�so I 'm exaggerating a bit on this one, but I swear that's exactly how he comes off. If only Buzz were here so they could get into a "whose-dick-is-bigger" contest over it. Then the fur would really fly!  Speaking of Buzz, I always knew he was an idiot, but until he sat across the half-wall from me, I would never have guessed what a dyed-in-the-wool moron he was. His bullshit factory is on a twenty-four hour shift, and he's been this way for so long that he actually believes the lies he tells. Unfortunately, behavior like this is not unusual in humans - most of us know at least one person who engages in such self-deception. What makes Buzz a rare and exotic specimen is the outlandishness of his fabrications - he really goes all out! According to him, he's a martial arts expert, a successful businessman on the side, a personal friend to celebrities, overseer of several volunteer efforts, a firearms aficionado, an experienced hunter and guide, and all of his closest buddies are rich ("They're younger than me and they're multi-billionaires!"), powerful, masculine men. In reality, he's a thrice-divorced loser whose several children will probably spend decades in therapy resolving their cosmic issues with sharing his chromosomes. The gold mine is in his choice of detail, as they reveal more about him than he could know. For example, the celebrities with whom he hob-nobs are not the Brad Pitt variety. No, he hangs with the Ted Nugents of the world - and, suddenly, his low-class core is open for the entire world to see. Your heart could break for how pathetic his fantasy world is, if he weren't so goddamned irritating.  The subject of people who, by all rights, deserve your sympathy and compassion but lose it by virtue of some other character flaw is rather timely. It was just yesterday when I narrowly escaped a menacing cripple who tried to run me over on her motor scooter smack dab in the middle of the office. No fooling! Now, I know what you're thinking - "Michelle! Such horrible talk I simply cannot condone! I highly doubt a poor   handicapped   person was seeking to mow you down in front of witnesses! Your imagination is running away with you!" Nevertheless, the truth remains. Elle is apparently without the use of her legs, which necessitates the scooter. She's of indeterminate age, somewhere between thirty-five and fifty, and she wears these tinted glasses that further obscure her expression. On one level, she seems incredibly bitter about her paralysis. She is, for instance, incapable of uttering three sentences without drawing your attention directly to the fact that you can walk and she can't. (And, no, I'm not exaggerating this time - I think I've proven that I can admit it when I am, so trust me, damn it!) But then there's this other element of perverse glee over her predicament. She likes watching your discomfort when she twists every conversation around to the subject of her disability. It's her way of making you foot the bill for her rotten luck, I think.   Of course, her other tactic is that fucking scooter. She's always hauling ass down the hallway, darting out of doors wearing the slightest hint of a smirk. I think it's because she'd like to make the rest of us scooter-bound, too - and I don't give a rat's rear if you think I'm evil for saying so. I'd like to nickname her "Wheels" and call it loudly and jovially across the building. Everyone makes the same face the instant she comes up in conversation - the "That bitch!" expression, so I'm not alone. She came tooling into the office the other day, looking for the plant manager. She pointedly steered herself into the door and sighed dramatically upon finding the office empty. Since Deb and I are practiced in the art of paying no mind, she was forced to interrupt our conversation to be acknowledged (although interrupting without apology was certainly not a difficult stretch for her). She bypassed animated in favor of agitated from the get-go, babbling in indignant tones something about a corporate project to get handicapped lifts installed in vehicles for customers at every assembly plant, and as part of the deal she was supposed to have our plant personnel install one in her personal vehicle! This was utterly preposterous - how could company resources be used for personal property? While it wasn't as though I hadn't heard stories like that before - cars being fixed, carpenters working on people's houses on company overtime and what not, it seemed to me that these things had happened 'under cover of darkness', so to speak. This broad wanted the plant manager's blessing to do the job right on the floor! Deb made repeated attempts to stem the flow of her prattle by asking, simply, "Do you want to speak to the Plant Manager?" She shoo-flyed these efforts - she was going to make us pay the standard bill! She'd see to it! We weren't going to get away without a healthy dollop of discomfort, or, by God, her name wasn't Elle Everly!   But I digress - the point is, I think my disdain for this manipulation must've been as apparent as it always is, because she began to monkey with the controls of her hell-cart. (She should call that fucking thing "Christine", if you ask me.) She would fiddle the control stick forward. I took a few steps back to be polite, thinking she wanted a better angle to speak to Deb. She took back about half of the distance she'd advanced. Again, she zips forward. I made no effort to disguise my irritation as I retreated yet again. This continued for about five or six tries, her with the two-buzz-forward-and-one-buzz-back, until I am literally behind Deb's desk. It is then that she smirks and announces "I'm not going to hit you. You keep backing up like I'm going to hit you." I wanted to reply "Disappointed, aren't you?" but it was Deb who nailed her: "I'm telling you, if you hit her she'll hit you back!" I could breathe again.�    * This is one that I made a transcript of, because it�s actually a couple of phone messages. A brief intro: We all had to attend one of those awful business off-site team-building, money-saving bullshit sessions, and by this time, my patience for such things had long disappeared. I had called my life-saving buddy and co-worker, Deb, to rant�and she laughed so hard that she sent my own messages right back to my voice mail so I could hear just how enraged I sounded. I had to record them, and I think they come off pretty clear, even in boring old print.   � Message #1  Deb says: Hi - I just wanted you to hear this (laughter) because you'll probably forget the mood you were in by Monday, so I just want you to listen to this, OK? (laughter) Maybe you won't, maybe you'll remember it, but I just want you to hear it, OK?  Michelle says: I just want you to know what I have just endured - I just sat through an   hour   of these motherfuckers like Cannoli and Trollovich and Buzz and Trollski talking about how   change   has to start with   them   and they're   committed   to making XYZ Operations a   great   place for people to work and all of this fucking bullshit like that. I - I'm telling you, I could feel my humanity ebbing away as I sat there. So brace yourself - I don't know who's in your group, but let me tell you, prepare yourself to have a truckload of shit crammed down your throat. I can't even believe my�ah�I�my brain is still functioning. I swear to God, I'm so fucking bitter I can't even stand it. Fucking brainwashing - they might as well hire the Scientologists to conduct this fuckin' review. I'm not even kidding. (Sigh.) I'll call ya later. Bye.   Message #2  Deb says: Hi - Here you go again - you have to hear this�these are like Kodak moments - (laughter). I have to capture them. "Rolf had shat upon himself" (laughter). Oh, God! That baby's lookin' better and better in'it? Hold on - here we go again�  Michelle says: The saga continues! I got home at shortly after 11 to find that Rolf had   shat   upon himself and was covered in it and so was the room. I - I'm telling you, I can't fucking win - it's getting to the point where it's�it's�it would be funny, if it were happening to somebody else. So, anyway, I call Eugene in desperation, asking him if he can come home and help me and I spent in excess of the hour cleaning up shit. There's no way I can tell [the plant manager] this because, you know, it�ll sound so stupid and I'm gonna have to endure his nasty look or snide comment when I walk into this fucking nightmare late! Can you believe this shit? Aaaah! All right� Have a wonderful weekend I hope I do, too and�ah� I'm sure I'll talk to you. OK? Bye.�    * OK, last one and then I�ll close this monster blog post. Sorry for the unfinished nature of these rants, but I often wrote only what I could in a few minutes before I had to do something else. Back then, I had to strike while the iron was smokin�.   �It's the second to last work day of the year, and this place is half asleep. L, the union president and G, his 'second-in-command', just showed up to make their presence known to J, the new plant manager. They met on the threshold of J's office and L and G looked exactly like a couple of poorly-dressed Mafia goons, muscling their way in as the little Englishman backed up. It seemed a harmless encounter, but if body language were a wrestling match, the union just scored big time.  Adding insult to the injury of my boredom are the lilting sounds of Celine Dion from over the partition. Apparently, she's everything she is because someone loved her. I find myself wishing that the person in question could be held criminally responsible. Perhaps if she hadn't been loved so damned much, I wouldn't have to hear her "If-It's-Worth-Doing,-It's-Worth-Overdoing" school of singing. Certainly she's not the only popular female singer guilty of using song as merely an opportunity to show us exactly what her vocal cords can do (never mind if all those histrionics and acrobatics are appropriate for the song or the occasion), but she and Mariah Carey are in a dead heat for most annoying chanteuse of all time.   Here we go again - people wandering in because they want something. They shuffle over to Deb's desk (still occupied by Peggy), and, upon seeing it vacant (Peggy's out entertaining the troops, to be sure), shuffle over to me. It's a testament to the strength of my bitchiness that each and every one of them hesitates before they approach me. I'm the first woman they see, and I'm blond (which apparently makes me more approachable, according to the statistics I read last night), so they figure I'm fair game for their incredibly dumb questions. I don't know who first said "There are no dumb questions", but they were wrong. There are as many dumb questions as there are dumb people to ask them. I have great peripheral vision, so I never have to look up from what I'm doing to see them clearly. I can stare at my monitor and relish every second of their apprehension as they decide whether or not they want to approach someone like me, who's giving off "Go Away" vibes in tidal waves.   They always approach. Not once has anyone thought about it, then turned away. (Perhaps it's not such a testament to my bitchiness, after all?) Their query is usually secretarial in nature. Their mental equation must go something like: Woman + Typing = Secretary. Do I know where someone is right now? Can I tell them how to get to room so-and-so? Is the meeting in this conference room or that? I usually answer their question for them. If they're here to ask for their check, and Deb's not at her desk, I'll get it for them only to save her the hassle of getting it for them later. The sooner they're out of the room, the better. But since Deb's been on vacation, I absolutely refuse to answer any questions on Peggy's behalf, even the ones to which I know the answer.  Peggy - ah, Peggy. In a class all by herself. She's one of those pathetic women who define themselves solely on their appearance; who pride themselves on their inability to complete any task, no matter how basic, because they think it makes them all the more fetching to the male animal. She told us one day that a man in the plant had informed her that "you could be in Playboy, if it wasn't for your face". It was clear that she had missed the insulting nature of this comment entirely, and she was telling us in that voice she uses to kibbutz with the girls. The tone of this voice implied that she was disgusted by all these men who only think about sex, sex and more sex - but what she really wanted us to get was how tirelessly the men pursued her, how desirable she was and how they'd "eat the corn from her shit", as one such suitor had apparently told her. It was a two-faced approach, remarkable in its transparency and the tragic ineptitude with which she acted out the drama of it all.  Except for when duty called (i.e., a man walked up) and she had to be flirtatious, Peggy's face was usually sporting a surprised yet strained expression. I always thought the grimace was borne of the clothes she strapped on. They were all painfully tight - I couldn't even imagine how she found the strength to get dressed every day. I could barely bring myself to put on anything with a discrete waist, and here she was - cinched, pinched and nailed down! Her skirts stopped four inches or less from Every Man's Land, and they were generally accessorized with a wide, stretchy belt. Blouses invariably contained  fat shoulder pads (which was supposed to make her waist seem tiny, but they really just emphasized her lower stomach pooch that comes with babies and/or middle age), some of which were designed with cut-outs over the upper chest or back (the better to see what color bra you're wearing, my dear!). These blouses still buttoned at the neck, lending a kind of dog collar impression that smacked of bondage. Her thin hair was teased into a spider-web chignon. Every atom of her seemed to want to wail in discomfort. She represents everything that drives me crazy about men and women. The fact that she's a nice person at heart only makes it worse.�  That�s all for now. There�s more, to be sure. Maybe I�ll even post it. Lord knows I�ve been waiting to get it out for years, now. Committing it to paper was not enough to salve those wounds. Anyhoo, be safe and practice excellent hygiene, kids. Or don�t, you freakin� grosser. I don�t care. That is all.

        August 15, 2002    Yesterday, I drove up the freeway to return something to one of the shops at the Howell outlet mall and also to buy Henry some new jammies (size 18 months!) for the fall. As I was leaving, I realized that I hadn�t eaten all day and I was dangerously hungry � as in, road rage hungry. So, of course, I pulled into the fast food drive-through and ordered some junk food. As I waited for my turn to pay, I saw a man approximately my father's age come out of the rear door carrying garbage to the bin. He was an employee there, in full fast-food uniform and there was something about him that made my whole heart go out to him. I don�t know if it was because a man his age shouldn�t be working a job like that, or if it was because he smiled at me when I stopped to give him a clear path to walk back and forth to the trash bin, or if it was because he was still dignified even as he carried enormous dripping bags of God-alone-knows-what to the bin. I just gripped the wheel and asked God to bless him in some big way.   I have moments like this fairly often, and on more than one occasion Eug will joke that he can�t take me anywhere, because you just never know if I�m going to get misty-eyed for no apparent reason. For example, I can�t bear to see very old people eating a meal by themselves. It could be Scrooge himself for all I know, and the reason he�s alone is strictly by choice � but that makes no difference. In my heart, he�s eating alone because his beloved wife has died and the kids all moved far away. Bill Knapp�s is the worst for this � there�s always some hopelessly cute golden-oldie eating their little bowl of potato salad all by their lonesome.  Another thing that always gets me is to see an obese person doing physical activity. I always say a little prayer for them that somewhere in their heart they might feel that there�s one person out there who�s not laughing at them, but rather cheering them on. There was a woman in our old neighborhood that was 350 pounds if she weighed an ounce, and she used to get outside and do some gardening. It was a crazy yard, but she put a lot of effort into it and it clearly pleased her. When I�d see her out there, bent over the flowerbeds by necessity and knowing that 9 out of 10 people were laughing at her expense as they drove by, I�d muster all the love and warm fuzzies I could and try to   push   them out to her. She lived alone, but she seemed a vibrant woman with many friends. I didn�t know her, but if I remember correctly, she was a physician of some sort. It�s funny how you can be proud of someone you don�t even know.  We had dinner at Eug�s parents last night, and when I tell you she made the best chicken I have ever eaten, I do not exaggerate, much less lie. I�d lent her some of my Cook�s Illustrated issues (including the current issue, which is where she got the recipe � it�s on your newsstands, now, people! Run, do not walk!), and she made what I believe is called �Pan-Roasted Chicken�. Lord have mercy. I am something of a fried/broasted/etc. chicken connoisseur, and this was the tastiest stuff I ever ate. I could�ve left a little poultry graveyard on that plate. (Sorry, Mary Beth!)  Today I made it over to the yarn shop and managed to escape for under $30 � but just barely. I almost went wild � yarn is simply so intoxicating, and the good stuff is costly. I have so much waiting to be knit that the last thing I need is more yarn, but that still didn�t stop me! I only bought enough to make a hat, though. So sue me.  When we came back Henry was totally wiped out and ready for a nap, and I went flipping through all of my nine channels. That vile Jerry Springer was on and in the second or so as I flipped past, I saw one of those Springer lackeys motioning for the audience to stand up and cheer. I wondered who in their right mind would ever watch the show, much less sit in that audience�and let�s not even speculate on the people who occupy the stage! What happened to dignity? I�d have to have a total lobotomy before I�d stand up and cheer like a moron at the wave of some goon, just for the cameras. Compared to the average modern human, I�d say even the lowest primates are far superior in intelligence.

        August 13, 2002    I was driving through Royal Oak today. I am not exaggerating when I say that every single person I saw who was waiting to turn out onto Main Street was a young-ish man with a Caesar �do, wire-rimmed glasses and a goatee (complete with soul patch). I shit you not. It was a bad joke come to life. I actually saw  four  of these losers, and they were all driving Beetles or �cute-utes�. I was embarrassed for them.   But I finally went into a shop I�d be interested in for some time, and it turned out to be Temptation Central. The store is �Shine� on Washington Street in Royal Oak, for those of you in the know. I could�ve easily walked up to the counter and said �One of everything, please.� They had this gorgeous, plain, opaque glass vase in the most luminous shade of Barbie doll pink and girly, kitsch-y dinnerware and swanky glasses and funky bags and pretty little pieces of jewelry and modern doo-dads all over the joint. I was in heaven. I went in because I knew they had these incredible picture frames and mirrors in retro-fun decoupage for Henry�s room. They�re made by Dolce Mia, I found out. So I went home and logged on and found their web site ( urlLink www.dolcemia.com ). They don�t sell much on the �net directly, but I called to ask for their catalog. I�m thinking I�ll get at least one little frame. Shine also had these out-of-this-world cute baby bibs in the funniest retro fabrics you ever saw from a company called Kidcosmic ( urlLink www.kidcosmic.com ). (Isn�t it amazing what you can scope on the �net? How else could you hunt this stuff down? I had no idea who made �em when I started looking, and within five minutes I had my answer!) Unfortunately, Kidcosmic has a looong way to go on their web site � no ordering functionality as yet. I suppose I should feel badly for scoping out Shine and then doing my own research, but if I can save a buck or two on something, then I�m gonna do just that.   We also re-mortgaged today. What fun! Patti (our lender) makes it so easy � she�s super-efficient and always spot-on. We never have to worry when she�s at the helm. We got rid of our PMI, got a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment (by nearly $100) and a fat check in our hands, to boot! We�re hoping that we just mightmightmight have enough to re-do the roof over the house. However, that remains to be seen. What a dream that would be�  The other thing that�s been on my mind is a treadmill. I am so close to buying one, but I am trying to hold back. I�m occupying myself with research and comparison shopping. It�s one of those tricky purchases � you don�t necessarily do yourself any favors by buying what seems like a deal, price-wise. I wish I had the scratch for a PaceMaster or a True, but even a Keys seems out of my league. I am nearly about to settle for a marked-down floor model Reebok. Unless I can triumph over this insane desire to exercise. I feel like blobitude is breathing its hot, stinky breath down the back of my neck, and it nearly has me in a vise grip. This may be my last chance to escape, is what I�m thinking.  Another stupid thing: We are so excited about the impending release of Super Mario Sunshine for the Game Cube here at Chez Michelle. It�s supposed to come out at the end of this month, sometime � release dates are conflicting. If you�re expecting to hear from us at the end of the month and you wonder if we�ve built ourselves a hermitage, just remember that we are probably deep into Mario Fun. We�ll call you back when we�ve come down a bit from the video game high, OK?

      August 9, 2002  I just have to kvetch and moan for a minute. Why can't people stay away from using words they don't understand or know how to pronounce? Case in point: "voilá". It is NOT pronounced "WAH-la", for crying out loud! It's "Vwah-la"! See the V? Good - now say it. Thank you. And "forte", when used to refer to a person's strength or specialty, is NOT pronounced "for-tay". It's simply "fort". And it is  never  spelled with an accent. OK? Tattoo it on your palm, if need be. Thank you.  Another thing I need to get off my chest - what is it with friends who expect the world on a platter and don't give a damned thing in return? I know someone like this. For example, she attended the baby shower of a friend (which was hosted by the same woman who'd given her a shower) and complained vociferously about how this woman's shower was nicer than the one the hostess had thrown for her. Of course, it was all said in a half-joking tone, but it was clear that she was anything but kidding around.   I saw her last week and she harangued me about anything and everything. She does all of this in front of a large group of friends, too. I had the presence of mind to remind her that the last time we got together, she was 25 minutes late and I still bought her lunch! Then she hears that I�m knitting something for a friend's baby and she grumbles that I never made a pair of baby socks for her kid. The nerve! This woman conveniently forgets that I bought her a very nice gift for her shower and she never gave me a damned thing when Henry was born - not even a card! I get so sick and tired of people like this - they're never satisfied with what other people do for them, but they never consider for a moment what little they do for everybody else. Fuckin' A.  Anyway, I'm incredibly busy these days. We're re-mortgaging our house, and it actually looks like we'll pocket over $11,000  and  have a monthly payment that's the same as or less than we have, now! I think we're going to have the garage re-roofed and stash the extra dough in a CD to earn some interest to do the rest of the roof next year. (Fingers crossed.) Home improvements are sorely needed here. I would love to forego all the bullshit holiday gift-giving - and expensive greeting cards, for that matter. I probably spend $150 a year in cards. That could pay for a new window! And our house needs everything - new roof, new windows, new fence, new wall furnaces, new carpet - and maybe even furniture, someday! Yeah, right. That's not even considering the fact that we may need to add on to this house if we have another child. God alone knows what that would cost. Eep.  So, money's on my mind. And, yes, I bought a Lotto ticket for tonight's drawing. I can never resist the lure of just one ticket - $1 seems a small price to pay for the chance to dream of what we'd do with some extra scratch. I've been thinking of ways to earn some money without compromising Henry's care, but I'm at a loss. I've been doing some writing for the vet clinic, but that's in exchange for vet services - which we certainly need, what with our menagerie. If you have any ideas that don't involve illegal activity, let me know.  And, by the way, that awful Granholm woman did win the primary. I wonder how many Posthumus campaign signs I can fit on my lawn?

      August 5, 2002  So, Jennifer Granholm is running for governor in our home state of Michigan. God help us. That woman will take credit for anything and everything, most for which she deserves none whatsoever. But she's well-coiffed and manicured, and she looks so *chic* in those black and white TV ads! You just  know  every numb-nuts, know-nothing young female in the whole goddamned state is going to want to vote for her. I can only hope these same idiots don't bother to get off their Gen-X asses to vote in the primary tomorrow. Should David Bonior get the Democratic nod, I will have concrete evidence that there is a God. On the other hand, this would put me in a real pickle with regard to casting my vote in November. Dick Posthumus is kind of a dolt, and from what I understand he was all but groomed from the get-go for the governor's office from way back when. Too bad he didn't learn more in those years of Lansing's Finishing School. But, I am anti-abortion and all the Democratic trumpeting about a WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE makes me want to hurl. I'll have to see where this race goes as the months pass.  Kim had her baby yesterday, too. Finally! Poor thing spent 3 days on Pitocin before they finally tried a cervical gel to get things moving. Then, BAM! Jacob David was born at 10:15pm. And I got to see every single thing! Tracy jokingly wondered if I was going to pass out, but I swear it was the most fascinating thing I've ever seen. She was the epitome of grace under pressure, and I admired her more than I've ever admired anyone. She and Dennis will be singularly excellent parents, and I'm so excited that Henry has a new best buddy. We decided that since every single one of our friends has cranked out a boy in the last year and a half, that we'd get them all matching jerseys with their number being the day of the month on which they were born! So far, no repeats! What a group picture that'll make - Alexander, Hunter, Henry, Jacob and Bradley...and who knows how many more will being showing up in the months to come.  I've got to get back in the exercise habit, toute de suite. I was going along so well, for a while there. I want to get back some muscle tone before I get pregnant again and lose any shot at identifiable stomach muscles forever. Of course, this only reminds me of someone who gave me the unsolicited advice to do "100 sit-ups every day" and then proceeded to lift her shirt to show me just how toned she was after the birth of her sprog. Ugh. Thank God for Eug, who jumped in to remind said person that I am stronger than any woman he knows, and that he'd prefer not to pick a fight with the likes of me...hence, concerns about my muscle tone by others are needless and laughable. Hey, I'm peasant stock. I'm built for the long haul.  My main concern these days is generally what to cook for dinner. Henry is at the point where baby food no longer appeals all that much, and I promised myself that he would grow up in a home that generated fond memories for life of his mama's home cookin'. The challenge for me is to learn to cook things that don't require a full stick of butter in everything. I like my recipes  beyond  'down home'. I did, however, make a couple of smokin' peach pies this week. God bless the good folks at Cook's Illustrated magazine. They really know how to lay it out.  Speaking of magazines, I'm worried that one of my favorites has gone the way of the dodo. It's Echos magazine, which is devoted entirely to all things Modern. I will shed copious tears if it's a thing of the past. Where will I find all those glossy images of things over which to lust and drool? How will I scheme to spend the winnings from the lottery I'll win someday without a visual aid?   I'll keep my fingers crossed, but it's not looking good. This probably warrants some online research.  Well, good night, all. I've been up way too late as it is. Henry is a ruthless taskmaster, and I'd better get at least 4 hours of sleep if I am to meet his tireless demands for attention and schnoogling.

        September 8, 2002    I have embraced domestic insanity with both arms as of this evening. For those of you who may not know this, I live in a house with no basement and no attic. With two bedrooms that were considered generously-sized back in 1960. With one full bathroom. My house seems to sprawl all over the lot, but it�s deceiving, because what you see from the street is exactly what you get. There is nowhere to hide anything in this house.   So, the addition of the treadmill was a big deal. It now hulks in my living room like some kind of modern art � but of the ugly variety. (No jokes along the lines of �What other kinds of modern art are there besides the ugly kind, Michelle?� See? You�re so predictable.) And I have all this baby shit all over the place, and until I�m done having kids, I know that stuff isn�t going anywhere. It could be YEARS before the Exersaucer goes away! Playpens, high chairs, toy boxes, diaper pails, and plastic toys galore! Then comes stuff like potty chairs and the spring-y rocking horse and who know what else. Now, pile homeschooling on top of all that, and I could have all of the aforementioned, plus stacks of textbooks and art and science projects everywhere! I won�t be the least bit surprised if we wedge a piano in somewhere in the next five years, to boot. Holy shit. And don�t tell me to stow it in the garage. There�s  already  stuff stowed out there.  Anyway, I�m not even done. Tonight we put two more giant objects in the house, and while I am amused and excited about the addition of both, I am also more than a little perturbed by the loss of empty spaces. Emptiness is very soothing to my soul, and this new agitation brings challenges in coping. We�d decided to take an enormous old drafting table that was going to be discarded from Eug�s work, because we thought it would be a good thing to have for projects and weird stuff. The catch is that it�s bigger than my kitchen table. I mean, it�s HUGE. We re-arranged the breakfast nook to fit it in there because the lighting is so nice for it, but now that it�s there, I realize how out-of-scale it is. The other thing I realize is that there is a strong possibility that I will be fifty or sixty before I ever have the furniture I imagine having in that space� and that�s if I�m lucky enough to ever have it. All my visions of  urlLink tortoise-shell bamboo-esque Roman shades  and the  urlLink round Noguchi table  and the  urlLink Eames molded plywood dining chairs in ebony stain  will have to wait, presumably for decades. A girl could get depressed if she stopped to really think about it.  Oh, and the other thing we brought in? Our neighbor across the street was throwing out an old, beat-up  urlLink Eames lounge chair and ottoman  � well, it could very well have been a beat-up knock-off, truthfully. The poor thing has been re-upholstered and bastardized so many times that it�s hard to tell exactly who made it and when. But I nearly peed my pants when I saw it sitting there on the curb and didn�t breathe again until I had it safely in my garage. There were holes in the upholstery that Eug wound over with black electrical tape, and he also made a few other repairs to it. I always wanted one of the real chairs from Herman Miller, but I know that this is the closest I�m going to get for a long, loooong time. I am not ashamed of my garbage-picker status, though. Hey, sometimes people throw out cool stuff.  Eug and I had a couple of laughs I wanted to mention this weekend. One was about those hair color commercials with Sarah Jessica Parker. Have I mentioned this before? Probably. I just cannot for the life of me figure out who considers this woman attractive and why. Not like everyone has to be drop-dead gorgeous, but I get the feeling she�s held up like some paragon of loveliness. Very curious. Anyway, there�s her big mug on the TV screen when Eug walks in and says �You know, she�s like the female equivalent of Bill Maher, looks-wise.� I laughed hard enough to rupture something. He follows that up with another quick hit: �I mean, she makes you wanna say �Why the long face�literally!�� My husband amuses me eight ways to Sunday, I swear.  The other thing we were cracking up about are those stupid stickers that people put on the back windows of their trucks (they�re always trucks, I think) that show the cartoon strip character Calvin (of ��.& Hobbes� fame) pissing on something. Of course, in the original image Calvin was doing no such thing, and I�m sure poor Bill Watterson must be praying nightly to Yahweh or Jesus or Allah or Whomever that: a) People everywhere don�t think he had anything to do with the production of those things. b) Eventually, the image will become so tired (as if it hasn�t already) that the numbskulls that buy �em will knock it off.  But, anyway, I mused that somewhere, some guy is telling everyone he meets that HE was the one who made the first �Calvin pissing on�� and it�s driving him crazy that there�s no way to prove he�s the originator. I speculated that he�s probably some frat asshole who put the image on a Sigma Delta Whatever tee shirt to commemorate their Oktoberfest �89,  which was a really rockin� beer bash, duuuuuude  � and then saw the same image turn up on a sticker two and a half years later, crowing to all his cronies about how    he  should be the �Calvin pissing on�� billionaire, duuuuude!     Which just goes to show that timing is everything, really. And it�s time to go to bed. Sweet dreams, y�all.

        September 6, 2002    Yeah, yeah � I know. I haven�t updated this page in eons. Tough noogies � life is busy with a nine-month-old. In fact, Henry gets his pictures taken today � technically one day shy of nine months old, but close enough. He�s going to wear his snazzy �Great Dane Academy� tee shirt and jeans. We are, if nothing else, a  casual  family.   Life has been very good these past two days, as contrasted with the weeks before. I felt terrible and knew I was in poor health � bad nutrition, bad sleeping habits, bad everything. Then I had the shopping equivalent of an epileptic seizure and we bought a treadmill. I�ve been hoofing it religiously every day and I wind up drinking a ton of water (even a Coca-Cola addict like me can�t slurp down soda after a sweaty workout!) and falling asleep with no problem. Ugh � exercise is the answer to my problems? You�ve gotta be kidding me.  I remember when I was young and I couldn�t even conceive of bodily aches and pains, wrinkles and getting old. I thought I�d always look and feel just like I did then and that I could mistreat and neglect myself any old whichway and I�d be fine. And back then, that was true. Not today, kiddies. I�m old, and getting older.  Of course, taking care of yourself doesn�t mean you have to go   nutso  . I have no idea how thousands and thousands of women can justify spending all that dough on dumb crap like a new face lotion with copper (give me a break), or �Kinetin� (huh?) or whatever. I was at the mall yesterday with some mama-friends and their little baby boys, and one of them stopped in Origins to buy something. She did that the last time, too. It blows my mind � why would anybody spend more than three or four bucks on face cleaner? I know I have a different POV in this department, given that I worked in a cosmetics buying office for a brief period, and I know that the cheap stuff is the exact same stuff as the expensive stuff, and even the cheap stuff is only going to make you  think  you�re combating the inevitable. Go ahead and spend $50 an ounce on Chanel goop, but it�s no better than Oil of Olay, and even O of O is wildly overpriced. You know what the most effective moisturizer is? Crisco. No shit � it�s totally hypoallergenic and the choice of burn ward physicians everywhere. Women should really picture themselves flushing handfuls of money down the toilet when they buy that stuff. They�re just hapless victims of effective advertising. Why not just lace yourself up into a whalebone corset � you�re in bondage, but you just don�t know it.  My personal ideal would be to eat healthfully, drink tons and tons of water, get at least 8 hours of sleep every night, exercise every day, take a quality multivitamin, exfoliate with a good, nubby washcloth and gentle soap, smear some Vaseline or Crisco on my dry or wrinkly patches, and, of course, FLOSS. I should probably print that on a 3x5 and have it laminated and stuck to the bathroom mirror or something. Tattoo it on my palm, perhaps.  Today was a whirlwind, but I did get my workout in already. Henry got his pictures taken in a long, drawn-out ordeal. They took the pictures, but for some reason only 1 of the 5 came up on screen when it came time for me to order. Supposedly, those pictures were still in their system somewhere, and they ordered me some of each for free. But they still had to take more shots so I could actually have some photos from which to order. It took forever, and Henry was wiped out by the time we were done. Phew.  Then we snagged a quick lunch on the road so I could swing by the parish to drop off some Barbie dolls I bought for the Doll Booth at the Fun Fair this year, and also to pick up more raffle tickets. You know what makes me cringe? Reading about the $75 million Catholic cathedral in Los Angeles that was just completed, and knowing that our parish can't scrape together enough to pay the electric bill. All over SE Michigan, there are parishes that are not only thriving, but overloaded. Witness Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak� my God, that place is packed. And, sure, it�s gorgeous � but is THAT the point of going to church? Personally, I prefer the more humble surroundings to get in my spiritual groove, and I would love it if a few of the extra families at some of these parishes would move on into ours. The Shrine doesn�t need another fresco renovation, or gilt-encrusted fountain - but we need to repair the crumbling structure and make the place fully handicapped accessible! Please, people! Given the choice, seek out a POOR parish! And for crying out loud, get off your lazy ass and go to church. Time�s �a wastin�, and you  need  a measly hour a week to think about what you should improve and to ask God�s grace to help you do it. On yer knees, lame-o.  I had the weirdest dreams this morning � ever wake up in the middle of the night with a couple of hours left to go before you have to get up, and when you go back to sleep you have the most vivid dreams, plus you remember all of them? That�s what happened to me this morning. I only recall part of it, but I was collecting money from a group of people I didn�t know to tip a waitperson, and I had this gigantic wad of cash in my hand. The next part I remember is being nearly the last one in the restaurant, and a waitress there was advising me to get out soon, because there was a creepy drug addict guy working in the kitchen, and I didn�t want to be locked up in the joint with him after hours. And then, as a weird aside, she said �And whatever you do, don�t sleep with him!� to which I replied, flabbergasted, �Did you?�  She nodded and when I asked what would possess her to do such a thing, she told me that she thought the gnarled, prominent network of punctured and collapsed veins in his arms were sexy. I don�t even want to know from which dysfunctional part of my psyche that one sprang. Eeew.  So, we�re off to dinner at the in-laws� tonight. This weekend should be mostly work around the house. I don�t want any obligations � just home time. That�s all for now � my knitting is calling my name.

      October 2, 2002  Sorry to beat a dead horse, but man, oh man are we circling the Great Cosmic Toilet Bowl in the middle of some gigantic flush. There's been a bunch of stuff I've been meaning to write about for some time, now, and tonight I have both the energy and the catalyst. The motivator was a woman who lives in the neighborhood attached to mine - I met her for the first time tonight. She attended a city council meeting regarding a proposed re-zoning, and a group of us got to talking.  Anyway, she somehow came around to the subject of teenagers - one of those "Oh, just you wait!" dumbasses who thinks that because she has wild animals for children that everybody else will, too. The things she'd say would make the fine hairs on every part of my body stand up - things like "If they're going to go off and drink when they're underage, what can you do?"  Umm...what can you do? Well, for starters, if they're old enough to kick out of your house, give them the boot and see how a dose of real life works. OK, I know...that's your baaaayyyybeeee, and it's hard to think about kicking your kid out. But if you can't bring yourself to expatriate them, why not make life mighty uncomfortable under your roof so long as your rules are being intentionally broken? How about making them get a job and garnishing their wages? Taking back the designer duds you bought for them? Or the keys to that sport ute you got a cheap lease deal on? Why is it so fucking impossible to say no?   I have an inkling of how hard it is - and I know it's only an inkling. But already Henry has a will of iron, and I get a kick out of having to refuse him. I actually kind of enjoy it. He totally sasses me - pushes me away when I drag him away from the electrical outlet or whatever, and howls angrily when I  keep  him away if he chooses to return to the forbidden item. Tough noogies, kid. You're going to be denied a whole lot more than that.  My take on my own upbringing is this: my parents were tough, and that was good. But they could've been a whole lot tougher, and that would have been better. I think they were just too pooped to pop by the time I came along. Sure, I benefited from the increased flexibility in some ways, but what I really needed was for someone to pull the plug on some of my hijinks a whooooole lot sooner. Not that I hold it against 'em - they did the best they knew how to do. They didn't have any crystal ball.  But, having been a difficult kid in many ways, I have a very clear idea about what I needed that I didn't get. And I hope to apply it in ways that will benefit my children and their individual temperaments. I'm just literally blown away by how freaking permissive the modern parent is. It's no fucking wonder these little shits in my neighborhood drive by at 1am in cars nicer than anything I will ever own, blasting the bass so loudly that the dishes in my cupboards rattle...and I can hear them rattle from down the hall. I find it incredibly pathetic and hopeless that the word "wholesome" should seem so quaint these days.   Eug summed it up by joking about an incident we'd seen the other day: teenagers hanging out at the pizza joint in the mall. One says to another "Hey, look - there's your dad!" The teens call out as the father approaches: "Bob!" Not " Mr. So-and-So"....just  BOB . Jesus Christ on a popsicle stick. As far as they're concerned, Bob's not an authority figure - not someone to be respected, just a 'cool' dad who probably says things like "I know they're going to ( insert dangerous or immoral behavior here ), anyway, so I'd prefer that they do it in my house while I'm there." Ay yi yi. Parents like Bob give us the heebie-jeebies.  According to recent discussions I've had, some people seem to accept that teenagers surfing porn is "normal". Not that teenagers having the desire to look at forbidden stuff, particularly of a sexual nature, is normal - but that having a teen actually surfing porn constitutes understandable behavior. Not a genuine cause for concern. Ummm, no. Show me the porno site on the internet that doesn't portray women as merely a whack-off tool. A repository for jizz.  I think my kid being exposed to that stuff prior to the age of...oh, say - 25...is a major cause for concern. You may think your kid is some kind of stalwart character, but I have news for you. That shit affects your malleable youngster.  So does everything they see on television, but the modern parent is too lazy and selfish to make the necessary sacrifices to prevent their kid from seeing this slime. Eug was watching a Scooby Doo cartoon with Henry one recent Saturday morning, and there was a promo for Will & Grace reruns. In it, Will and Grace prattled on about how many nights a week they were 'getting it' - a tongue-in-cheek reference to the frequency that the reruns would be aired. He thought, "Does THIS need to be on at 8:30 in the morning during a Scooby-Doo episode?" We long ago canceled our cable TV, and now I realize that I need to tape  everything  we want to watch during Henry's waking hours and watch it later - or, if it's something I might want to watch with him, screen it first. And always fast-forward through commercials. I think commercials are particularly insidious. Read six issues of Adbusters, cover to cover and tell me if you don't suddenly agree. I dare ya.  Go on and tell yourself that this little bit here and that little bit there doesn't really matter - your kid will still turn out all right. But define "all right" while you're here, would you? Will your kid understand what true commitment to another human being entails, or will they be so jaded after seeing every episode of Friends in syndication eight times that partner-hopping is the status quo? Will they manage to escape their teens without having knocked someone up? Will they pursue both a career and lifelong education with gusto, knowing that life holds infinite mysteries and seeking to discover as many as possible in the years allotted to them - or will they graduate college - if you're  lucky  - with a sigh of relief, looking forward to requiring as little effort as possible of their grey matter in the years to come? As in, "Eeew - Newsweek. Where's a People magazine? I like them better." Yup, we should know we're in deep shit when most people consider Newsweek challenging reading.  You don't have to go back more than your own generation. Think back on your own childhood era and examine what was expected of you: morally, intellectually, and spiritually. It was a hell of a lot more than we expect of children today.   I may seem like a freaked-out fundamentalist to some of you, but I see most of the world as happily swimming in shit. "C'mon in, Michelle - the water's fine once you get used to it!" No way. I may have to go to a great deal of trouble, but while my children are growing and forming themselves into who they'll be, I am going to shield them from as much filth as possible. I know that they'll have to see the 'real' world at some point, but hopefully by then they'll be well on their way to being a formed person. And I will use the growing exposure to the world at large as they age as opportunities to discuss the morals and values we have formed over the years - something my parents were not equipped to do with us.  Like it or not, I will set the bar high. Like it or not, my kid will reach.

      November 10, 2002  An incredible amount in my life has changed since I last wrote, and to be honest, I have been avoiding updating this site. I think it's because I just don't know how to express it all.  First of all, we are expecting our second child, which is nothing less than thrilling. I'd taken a test on October 21st when I was already about two weeks late, but the result was negative. I resigned myself to the belief that my body was again malfunctioning and settled in to wait for another two weeks before calling the doctor with a request to bring my cycle to a forcible halt. Ten days later, curiosity got the better of me and I took another test...and got that second pink line. Have you done the math yet? Ten days later means that I found out I was expecting this child on Halloween! How that bodes for my maternal future, I don't know. I tend to seek the humor in all things, and you can bet I think this is funny. Have you done the other math yet? That means that my two children will be just over 18 months apart! This is a source of both significant apprehension and significant amusement. How I will manage remains to be seen. Obscenely, I remain self-confident. Probably just another indication of how deep my river of stupidity runs. I haven't had my first doctor's appointment yet, but an online calculator told me my due date is June 16, 2003. We'll see.  The next thing is that we are going to euthanize Rolf on December 2nd. My sweetest pup is crumbling under the weight of his afflictions, slowly but surely. I have cried for so long for him. Years ago, when he had one of his front toes amputated to the wound that would not heal. Then I watched the onset of the Wobbler's Syndrome that crippled Paavo. Not as swift this time - it happened far more slowly for Rolfie. I still do not know if that makes it more merciful or less so. The rapid loss of forty pounds before my eyes that reduced him to skin and bones, which preceded the diagnosis of diabetes. The struggle to get his blood sugar under control and to find the level of insulin his body could manage. The growing milkiness in his eyes, which meant that his vision was nearly non-existent. A brief hope that the cataracts were operable - and damn the expense. I recall the day spent seeking diagnostic tests. It was a frightening experience for Rolf, and one that I wish fervently I could rescind. He struggled with the smooth floors of the specialty hospital and bore the suction cups on the surface of his eyes with sweetness and dignity - even though I know he could never possibly understand why I would permit such a thing. He endured it because I was with him, and now I feel I could never have earned a love so great. He got that foot wound on his 3-toed paw months later. It showed up overnight - the result of an external wound that grew into an abscess, I believe. Dr. Mary didn't want to amputate again. Said he couldn't afford to lose another toe on that foot.  She'd cut away the tissue again and again in the hopes that a fresh surface would cause his body to heal. His care regimen was unbelievable - constant bandage changes and wound cleanings. Enough medication and mega-doses of vitamins to fill not one but two peanut butter sandwiches at a sitting. When he began to refuse the peanut butter, I made him melted cheese sandwiches to hide the pills. When he refused that, I launched a last-ditch effort to continue the meds. Liverwurst. Mayonnaise. Tuna salad. Anything I thought he would eat that would hide those pills. There were simply too many to feed him forcibly. And when he refused it all, I cried and cried and gave it all up. And his foot healed...healed like there had never been a wound at all. And so it went for almost a year, now. Just a slow downhill. The assistance he requires every day to get up and go outside, even. I know I have to let him go before much longer, and already I may have waited too long. So we picked a day, and it marches toward me, business-like. I have to go about my everyday life, still. I do the laundry and unload the dishwasher, and I coax Rolf to eat. I run the vacuum and I pick up toys, and I give Rolf his insulin shots. But I also tell myself "Your dog will be dead soon - what does the laundry matter, Michelle?" I try not to let tears blind me to the fact that he is still here, for right now. I give him love and attention. I whisper my secrets and my apologies to him. I remind him of my messages for Paavo. Most of all, I beg him to visit me in my dreams: whole, sighted,   running  . I pray that the moment the plunger of the needle has depressed, he will already be healed. Lord, he is deserving. Surely You must know this. I have felt guilt over the relief I know I will feel when the burden of his care is lifted. I have cried for years for him, and for myself. And I know I will cry even in the years to come. Never has it been more obvious that there could never be another like him. He will be missed for all my days on earth.  So, it's hard. A real emotional roller-coaster. I had many other things to write about, but they can really be condensed into one thing: the deepening of my Catholic faith. During the last month or so, the topic of the death penalty had been on my mind. I picked up a book written by a woman who lost an adult child to murder. Her book was a plea for mercy. The same week I felt called to pick it up, I read in the weekly parish bulletin a quote from the Pope. It went along the lines of " I shall not tire of repeating this to those who thirst for vengeance: No justice without peace, no peace without forgiveness ." I sat there with a deep frown etched into my face. I must've had that someone-stuck-a-turd-under-my-nose expression, to be honest. Here it was, in plain language. The simple truth that to call yourself Catholic meant that you must embrace every life, no matter how thorny. And so I let it go. I wrapped my brain around the concept that the taking of a life, under any circumstances, is never acceptable. It is vastly overstepping the boundaries of our fallible humanity. It is not our choice to make, ever. And a wave of something indescribable washed over me.  Then I decided I should at least get one measly jolly out of having to give up my blood lust. Hey, I'm human. It happened while I was on the phone with Tracy, the Anti-Death Penalty Crusader herself. We were talking about politics and abortion when she mentioned the difficulty she was having with being anti-abortion in cases of rape or incest. I countered with "Wait a minute, little Miss Sanctity O' Life...how do those cases justify the death of an innocent? Why does the baby have to pick up the tab?" She smugly responded with "OK, I'll give that up when you give up your belief in the death penalty!" And so I said, "OK - deal. I give up." The sputtering on the other end of the line was simply delicious.  Another facet of this whole topic took place today. I attended a service at a Methodist church, which was an enlightening opportunity. To see how others worship together made me appreciate the abject beauty of a Catholic Mass, even in a parish with a wallet as thin as ours. I was especially surprised to learn that they do not partake of Communion every time they gather. When I asked my friend about this, she told me she was grateful that they didn't do so, which really aroused my curiosity. She explained that Communion made her uncomfortable - that though she sees herself as a spiritual being, she does not see herself as sufficiently 'Methodist' - or any other denomination - to partake in Communion. And while I understood, my immediate reaction was one of sadness and longing for her. I chose to embrace the faith of my childhood, and it wasn't until   after   I took that step that I felt the warmth of the return embrace. I wasn't sure of anything when I did it, and only by the process of walking directly and purposefully into the deep and unfamiliar waters and aligning myself publicly with a faith I could name, did I feel that connection which she admittedly lacks. And so hearing her speak was almost like hearing my own voice from the past. All I could think was that I hope she   chooses   that space - and in so doing,   finds   the space where she will feel that belonging, because it is a beautiful thing. St. Bernard of Clairvaux once said "You would not seek God or love God unless you had first been sought and loved." So I pray that she feels sought and loved as God's own child.  Anyway, a Catholic Mass is truly a lovely thing. The ritual is so meaningful for me. The blessings, the greetings, the shared prayers that we all simply know by heart and do not recite from a written page (although I still mess up things I've recited all my life - so maybe a cheat sheet isn't such a bad thing). The three readings: first, second and Gospel readings, all delivered from the podium - but the homily is delivered from among us by our beloved and engaging priest. The petitions we recite and ask together that the Lord hear our prayer. The simple fact of getting down on your knees for me is HUGE. That physical gesture of utter humility. The liberal use of incense and candles and water and oils. The feeling that when I am among the priests and deacons and nuns of our faith, I am among truly holy people - people who have made great sacrifices to do even greater things. To be used for greater goodness. To put service to others above all else. I think that kind of selflessness frankly unnerves and irritates most people today. And Communion - everything that is - taking Christ's body and blood into your own. Not just a symbol of it, as the other denominations would have me believe. How can you remain unchanged, when you take it all in? Christ seeks and finds me. I am so grateful.

      December 3, 2002  Rolf died yesterday. We euthanized him at home. I think it was almost noon.   I awoke to snow on the ground for the first time and felt like it was a small gift. Rolf loves the snow, and we wondered if he would live to see it this year. We had spent the weekend plying Rolf with treats and attention, and had been rewarded with his presence in the bedroom for the last three nights. For those of you who do not fully understand Rolf's condition, his trip down the hall to the bedroom is a very big deal. His Wobbler's Syndrome makes it difficult to keep his rear legs steady. He slips and slides. His blindness makes him even more unsteady and unsure of himself. But he came, anyway.   A couple of weeks ago, we had put in a supply of Dentabones - his favorite - one for every night left to him. He would get his 'bone' right before we went to bed. We'd hear him at the end of the hall, enjoying his treat. But once it was gone, he would softly cry because he could hear us down the hall and he wanted to be with us. Most nights the desire to sleep in the same room with us was not as strong as his fear of making the trip. But those last three nights, he came.  On Sunday, we also picked up the three tastiest bones we could find. One was a cornstarch 'velvet' cheese-flavored bone for a whopping ten dollars that turned out to be a bargain at twice the price. He ate that bone with gusto and left orange shards of it everywhere he laid. We spent Sunday in kind of a slow stupor, knowing what was coming but not really believing it and certainly not wanting to talk about it. There were people who tried to reach out to us, but it was really the last thing I wanted. Even someone who loves us dearly cannot begin to imagine how huge a hole losing Rolf has left. I have spent years preparing for his death, but now that it has come to pass, I want to scream angrily at anyone who would look at me and say "He's so much better off." No one can reach us with words, and I am tired of platitudes that ring falsely to me at a time when I feel very much abused by God Himself. I would have given ten years of my life to give Rolf one really good year - just one fucking year. The bottom line is that I don't know that he's better off - I just know that he's   gone  .  I guess I will drown in this for a while. I know Eug is, too. Yesterday morning he was coming from the shower and something about the look on his face made me stop and hug him - and to my shock, he began to sob uncontrollably. So we cried and hugged and rode it out. Then I took a bath and sobbed some more. We spent the last half-hour before Kim and April and Janet came feeding Rolf an entire loaf of King's Hawaiian Bread. I snapped pictures of it, feeling kind of grotesque for doing so. I had wanted to take pictures of Rolf the last few weeks and I could never bring myself to do it. Then, suddenly I am snapping pictures out of desperation, trying to hold on to something happy. I could never bring myself to photograph Rolf with Henry, because to have a marker of the time that will pass - to know that Henry will grow up so quickly and the picture would serve as the indicator of how many years we have passed without Rolf - it would make me very melancholy, I think. Maybe I should have done it anyway.  April came with Alexander in tow and Kim and Jacob and Janet followed shortly thereafter. We put a catheter in Rolf's front leg and then April went to watch the babies while Eug and I held Rolf's head, kissing him. Kim pumped the two biggest vials of blue barbiturate I have ever seen in my life into Rolf's vein, and he was gone. Just like that. He twitched and spasmed for a few minutes afterward - the last movement I saw was the trembling of his lips - but his heart had long ago stopped beating.  Eug and I broke down sobbing again and I honestly felt like something in me was dying right along with him. I had whispered to him in the seconds that preceded unconsciousness that he was a   good boy   and that he should go get Paavo, now.  And I try to imagine that the angels and saints welcomed him for the wonderful soul he is. I try to imagine the cataracts lifted from his eyes and his body made whole and frisky and puppy-ish, again. But what I see right now in my mind's eye is his body terribly limp and quiet, and his jowls sunk into his open mouth as he lay on his side. In a way I cannot believe we went through with it, and even though I know there was no better path, I know Eug and I both wish in a small way that we had not gone through with it. Because now we are on the other side of it, and this is a cruel place.  We loaded his body onto the stretcher. No one would let me carry him because I am pregnant, and I acquiesced. But there remains a part of me that wishes I had, because I feel like it should be me to carry him as far as I can. Eug and Henry and I drove him to the clinic to be picked up by the crematorium, and Eug and Sheila carried him into the clinic. I followed and knelt to kiss him a few times before I turned away. Eug trailed behind me and I stopped and turned back to him. He was struggling to get it under control and failing, and so I caught him up in my arms and hugged him fiercely again and all I could think to say over and over and over again was "We did the right thing." And for a few seconds we stood in the snow of the parking lot, him sobbing and me clutching him, scared for the power of his grief - while Henry watched perplexed from his car seat.  I get so upset at moments that I am on the verge of puking. These moments come utterly without warning. As we came home yesterday, I opened the door from the garage to the breezeway and saw Rolf's face as clearly as if he were truly there. And why not? He'd been there just a scant three hours before, looking at me (or rather, in my direction - his blindness was almost complete, I feel sure) inquisitively as I gathered up the extension cords from the leaf blower. He peered into the garage and wondered if I was up to something, and of course, I was. And when I saw him there but not there, I stopped and cried a really ugly, noisy cry. The kind that other people are embarrassed to witness.  And so I came home and I began to clean. I justified it by saying that I didn't want Henry to get hold of any of the velvet bone shards, but it was really because I couldn't stand to look at it. I felt so fucking grief-stricken that I wanted to grind my face into the blood he'd left on the rug. Instead, I picked up the fur we'd shaved from his front leg and put it in a baggie. Then I folded up the mountain of rugs we'd bought to keep Rolf from slipping and carried them into the other room to be washed. How incredibly strange it is to have a smooth, bare floor. It accentuates the emptiness of our house, now.   Eug asked me last night if I thought our own lives would go by like that - blink, and it's over. You get to the end and it's all a blur. I don't have an answer.

      January 1, 2003  Huh. How 'bout that. A whole new year.   It's sort of hard to think about following up the post where your dog dies, and so I've been thinking about posting but pretty much doing no more than that. It's been an eventful month, though, so I don't want to let some things slip away.  For example, Henry started walking! I think it was December 19th when he took his first steps. I thought it would be a fluke, but he did it again that day several more times - just a few shaky steps. In the two weeks or so that has since passed, he has transformed himself into a walking machine. He barely crawls at all, now. He still tumbles and falls, but he has even given up most of the time previously spent tooling around the house at breakneck speed with his walker! Amazing. He still yanks out the walker when he's dying for a thrill, but spends most of his time focused on mastering upright steps. He has this stiff-legged walk that is something straight out the Night Of The Living Dead, to boot. Soooo funny.  Let's see - what else? Well, Henry and I came down with a heinous case of the stomach flu these past couple of days. It was outrageous. My mom had it, and so did Eug's dad, and we thought maybe we'd dodged a bullet, but on Monday the 30th, Henry woke up from his afternoon nap covered in puke. He continued throwing up every 30 minutes or so until about 5:30 that night. Poor kid - he had no idea what the hell was happening to him. He would not let me put him down for even a second. Then, the next morning I came down with a full-fledged case. Let's just say that with this particular strain of the flu, the river flows north  and  south. Today I feel better, but I am down a whopping seven pounds since Monday morning. I am trying to gently re-hydrate. Thank God I don't have another OB appointment for three weeks or so - he would have my head on a platter if he sees any weight loss.  Christmas was nice. It snowed like crazy and made everything so beautiful. We got a bunch of nice things for Henry and plenty of fun things for ourselves, too. Our Christmas present to each other was a cheap but wonderful sofa for the TV room. It's basically three pieces, with a long chaise on one side and a short couch-like attachment that forms an L shape. Then, there's an ottoman that fills in the L, making a big square. It's almost like a queen-sized bed with a couch back. Theo has already made himself so at home on it, it's ridiculous. You'd swear we bought it for him! But we thought it would be a good family sofa - we can all cuddle together and watch a movie, and we don't really care if anything happens to it along the way. Ah, the beauty of cheap furniture. It's taken me a few years, but I am learning.  Our weight loss plan for Theo has begun, as well. He's down at least 10 pounds - I took him to the clinic for a weigh-in last week! He was just under 175 pounds. Our interim goal for him is 150, but he might need to be closer to 140 to look perfect. We'll see when we get there. Too bad I don't have someone controlling my portions - maybe then I'd be looking good, too.  A tidbit of something that's been bugging me: baseball caps on women. Ladies, hear me now: It's not a good look. It was briefly popular with sorority girls in the late 1980s - they'd pull their hot-rollered ponytail through the back opening and wear it with a big sweatshirt and turtleneck. Remember? Sure you do. It was a stupid look then, and it's even more stupid now. The ONLY occasion where it is acceptable for a woman to wear a baseball cap is   when she is actually playing in a baseball game  . There are no exceptions to this rule. You do not look sporty and cute. You look unbearably stupid, and I'm embarrassed for you. So cut it out.  Two other things: One cannot "grow" one's business, or anything else for that matter. One can nurture something in the hopes that it will grow or thrive, but to use "grow" as an active verb is just plain wrong. Despicable grammar. Yuck, I say. Also, THERE IS NO SUCH WORD AS "PREVEN TA TIVE". The word is simply "preventive". Take my word for it. PREVENTIVE. Simple as pie.  In other news: We have an ultrasound scheduled for January 21st, and I'm assuming we stand a very good chance of finding out this baby's gender (whom we've nicknamed "Dos") then! I thought we'd be waiting until mid-February for sure to find out. I don't know quite what to think. It seems like just yesterday when I found out we were having another child. It just doesn't feel like enough time has gone by to find out who this baby is, yet. This pregnancy is moving faster than I ever thought possible. Which I guess can be considered a good thing, if you factor in the incredible pizza-faced acne I am enduring every moment of every day with this kid! I have certainly had my share of zits before, but this is ridiculous. I'm starting to look like a 'before' picture in a ProActiv infomercial.   My pregnancy cravings for tacos have returned, as well. I'd love one right now, but I am still in the "Food? Eeew, gross!" stage of this flu. Sipping water is even a challenge, even though I know I am well past the danger of actually being sick. Still, I wonder if Taco Bell is open on New Year's Day? I've gotta think of something to do - all the football on TV is enough to make me insane.  That's all for now. I'm sure I will feel up to properly ranting in the near future, so stay tuned.

      February 7, 2003  I guess I could apologize for not updating in so long, but what would be the point? It's not like I'm really broken up over keeping y'all waiting. Let's just move along.  I am still consumed by my desire to be the Domestic Superwoman. I find myself yearning for so many hobbies and activities - all of a Martha Stewart bent - that I'm beginning to see myself as a tad loopy. However, I will not let a little mental instability stand in the way of my dream! I picked up a class schedule for Jo-Ann's tonight and have decided to take two introductory quilting classes, plus a soap-making class. I know it'll probably just be a glycerin-based soap, but it'll be a good start to learning to concoct and cure a "hard", lye-based soap. Call me a freak, but I always wanted to learn to make soap.  And don't cock your head at me because I mentioned quilting. You don't see me as the quilting type? Well, that's probably because you're picturing traditional quilts, which of course I dislike. I'd read an article eons ago (OK, I admit that it was an old issue of Martha Stewart Living...you can quit yer guffawing, now) about a woman who did the funkiest abstract quilts, and I knew I wanted to do just that. But since I know nothing about designing and cutting and piecing and all that crapola, I have to learn with the rest of the schmucks. After years and years of knitting classes, gaining confidence and learning to tackle damned near anything without the help of a teacher, now - I'd kind of forgotten what it's like to be the dolt who doesn't know her ass from a hole in the ground. I suppose I'm about to get intimately reacquainted with that feeling.  And I still want to do a little bit of work on the flowerbed this year, although I am smart enough to keep my plans very, very low-key. A couple of additions. A few tomato plants and some potted herbs. My only pipe dream is to grow some of these creepy grey pumpkins for Halloween fun. AND YES, THEY HAPPEN TO BE MARTHA STEWART SEEDS FROM KMART, SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP, NOW? Nobody likes a smart ass, you know.  On top of all this, what do I catch myself lingering over lovingly in Borders tonight? An issue of  Fine Homebuilding , with its glossy photos of detailed explanation. Saints preserve us. Now I'm aspiring to be Rosie the Riveter. I really need to learn to take things one at a time. Well, at least you won't catch me taking any "One-Stroke" painting classes to learn to smoosh acrylic paint pansies onto terra cotta pots and window boxes. Even I have my line in the sand.  Maybe I am trying to keep busy to focus on anything but how lousy I feel with this pregnancy. I am on a hair-trigger gag reflex. Henry and I were in TJ Maxx today and I had to pee so badly that I knew I could not ignore it. So I found the ladies' room and strolled Henry in with me. It didn't smell great, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary, public restroom-wise. However, I was barely able to escape without puking on my shoes. Barely. And it doesn't even have to be a gross smell or taste or anything that gets me going. I was all hormonal last night, thinking about lost loved ones like Rolf (of course) and a co-worker I particularly adored who died a few years back, and all of a sudden. I am gagging and choking and so close to hurling that I was amazed that I got it back under control. I will not be at all surprised if the child I am carrying is a girl, because this pregnancy is soooo different from the first time around.  In addition, I am having serious misgivings all of a sudden about a repeat cesarean delivery. I was basically of no opinion on the matter for all this time, and now I really feel like I do not want to be cut open again in the worst way. I do feel like my doctor is subtly pushing me toward having another c-section. Hey, why not? It would certainly be more convenient (and profitable) for him! Plus, Kim told me she's pretty sure Providence is re-opening the Birthing Center in NOVI! Which would be ridiculously close to home. I'm going to try to make all the calls to the insurance company and whatnot tomorrow and begin investigating my options. I'll be perfectly happy to stick with my current doc if I decide on a c-section, after all. He was incredibly competent in that department. It's just that if I elect for a cesarean this time, then I cannot choose anything but a cesarean after that point. And being the control freak that I am, I never like the idea of choice being taken out of my hands.

      April 13, 2003  With each passing day, I get closer to having my personal motto printed on tee shirts and bumper stickers: "People: Ya Gotta Hate 'Em". Really. Sometimes I find myself shaking my head and wondering just what the hell is wrong with 9 out of 10 people. People seem to do and say all kinds of things that I find downright incredulous. And you know me - there isn't much I wouldn't be willing to say.  Anyway, I lit into Eug today because he never pipes up when I'm taking shit from someone about Xanthe's name. Now, he adores this name as much as I do - and has, on many occasions, been unwavering about choosing it even when I am feeling a little vulnerable. So it's not like I chose the name and he's just along for the ride. And I'm more than happy to bite back when one of my friends or family puts their foot in their mouth when it comes to the name we've chosen for our daughter. But would I like him to speak the fuck up when it's HIS family conducting the harangue? You betcha, goddamnit. Otherwise, it just looks like this is aaaalllll my doing and pooooooor Eugene is at the mercy of his crazy wife, again. Fucking A.   And you know, if we'd chosen one of those fucking names like Caitlin or Brianna for our kid, nobody - not even the oldsters - would bat a fucking eyelash. BUT WE PICK A NAME THAT'S BEEN AROUND ABOUT A THOUSAND YEARS LONGER THAN CHRIST AND PEOPLE CAN'T GET THEIR FUCKING GREY MATTER AROUND IT. Hay-zeus. Crack a book once in a while, people. We didn't just make this name up out of thin air, like "Colton" or some such shit.  Yeah, I know what you're thinking: "Hey, if you want to stray from the beaten path, then expect to hear some comments." And that would be fine. Polite comments or inquiries? Bring 'em on. But just as I cannot imagine myself saying to someone who's chosen "Emily" or "Connor" in a droll, sarcastic tone "Gee, that's original! How long did it take you to think up that one, Einstein? Put a lot of thought into the whole thing, I see, huh?" I have a hard time digesting some of the commentary to which I've been subjected without experiencing a little heartburn. I just would not do that to someone, no matter how awful I thought their name choice. If they like it, more power to them. Just don't piss on me for my choice.  OK, whatever. Like I should be surprised. I dislike 9 out of 10 people, so why should their opinions on this subject come as any surprise to me? If anything, it is affirmation of all that I hold dear. Fuck you all and the nag you rode in on, too. But God help my husband if he doesn't pipe right up the next time I'm taking shit from his side of the family. OK, Crazy Pregnant Lady Rant is over. For now.

      March 5, 2004  Yes, it's been a YEAR since I have done anything with this blog. This fact simultaneously amuses and embarrasses me, because I actually enjoy keeping this journal. But life with two very young children keeps you hopping, especially when your youngest still isn't sleeping through the night and you've been sick - very sick - no fewer than five times in the last three months. In fact, I have spent about three sick days for every day I felt well. I am so tired, and my resistance is so low.  Anyway, I've spent the last couple of months stripping away the extraneous in my life, or at least trying to do so. I have disconnected myself from a number of things that were taking up bits and pieces of my time, and I am finally feeling some much-needed freedom as a result of making some hard choices. I have given up so many things that were enjoyable but non-productive. For example, I'd been a member of an online group of mothers since before Henry was born. Nice group, great women. I have what I consider to be three genuine, off-the-board friends with whom I speak regularly as a result, so this was what anyone would consider a great investment of my time. At least, up until recently.   I realized that the people to whom I was really attached were either part of my regular or semi-regular phone calls...or they were no longer part of the group for various reasons. I was left with a bunch of nice people with whom I felt no strong connection. No commonality whatsoever - in personal outlook, politics, spirituality, parenting, etc. The fact that I was the polar opposite of the vast majority of the women who now comprised the group made me wonder just why the hell I was expending so much energy to try to connect there, especially when being the odd one out often meant being browbeaten with the equivalent of a verbal baseball bat on occasion. Combine this with the fact that so much of what really meant something to me - homeschool preparation, home repairs and improvements, financial matters, creative endeavors (including this journal) - were being left utterly undone...well, it made me realize that my soul was withered and dry. Spending even fifteen minutes posting in response to others' minutiae was too much when I, myself, was directionless and empty. I needed to regroup, desperately and immediately.  Still, there was a tiny problem. I had stupidly volunteered to create the message boards the group now used when our last board owner decided to move on (smart woman, LOL). And I knew that there was no way I was going to hand over the boards I had created because there was no way to secure the personal information used to create the boards if I did. So I did everything I could to atone for this fact in advance: created brand new boards and wrote help documents for the next person(s) who'd lead the new urls. In essence, all that would have to be done is for someone to pay to make the new boards ad-free and open the fucking doors. Which was way more than anyone who'd owned the boards before me had ever done when they left...and you know what? I still got shit on by some people. One person in particular for whom I had prayed every day for the last several months was unusually callous. Fucking unbelievable. C'est la vie.   But in a way it was lovely, because any residual regret or sentimental feelings I had were washed away completely. After I shook it off, I had a good, long laugh over the 'friendships' I thought I had. It really reminded me of myself as a teenager - how many times had my family told me back then that the friendships that I swore were so meaningful and permanent were, in fact, fleeting and transient. I railed when they told me I would not so much as recall the names of the people who were life and death to me then. Now I smile wryly and realize that this is a natural cycle in life. You are immersed in something, and if you are very lucky, you may keep one or two good things from that time. But you WILL move on in the vast majority of situations.  And so I move on. Having felt so overwhelmed and unhappy of late, I am beginning to feel some relief as a result of doing these difficult things. Just sitting here and writing for the first time in so long is incredibly liberating for me. Last night I scheduled time at day care in the rec center for Henry and Xanthe - three days next week, each visit for two whole hours. Two hours to work out thoroughly, thoughtfully, and intensely. Two whole hours for ME. I might even get a long hot shower! Two hours to get my life back on track with each dumbbell lift, heh heh.  And now I realize that I haven't even told you about Xanthe. Beautiful Xanthe Celeste. My God, she's so lovely. How I got so lucky is beyond me, but my kids are just adorable. Yeah, yeah - it could be hormonal, but I'll stand by that statement to my dying day. My kids are exceptionally good-looking AND sweet, LOL. She's a talker and a giggler and a shameless flirt. She's a round-headed beauty queen with huge, mysteriously-colored eyes and a mega-watt smile. She has a temper and the ability to make you take her seriously. She's a little sweet potato of a child, slow on the development of mobility compared with her brother. She's in no particular hurry, my daughter. She's grabby and charming and focuses in on what she desires with the frightening precision of a laser beam. She is the hot glow of the sun and the cool radiance of the moon. She is a Popsicle on a July afternoon. As I wrote in her journal today "You are my daughter. I am so lucky." That says it all.

      April 27, 2004  The good news is that I'm sitting here eating a Frosty. The bad news is that it's the only bright spot in a truly horrid 24 hours. Henry started puking again last night and the poor kid couldn't even keep down a sip of water. So back to the doctor we went this morning. She thinks he has rotovirus, which gives me first class heebie-jeebies because of this tidbit I read about rotovirus: "The virus is spread through oral contact to fecal material, and is common in child care environments." Even worse, here's more information about the virus: "These symptoms usually last for 3-10 days. But even if the symptoms have subsided or improved, you should consider your child contagious for 10-12 days after the onset of diarrhea." I will feel physically sick, myself, if any child we've seen recently comes down with this.  Another irritating part to all of this has been the prescription for antibiotics the first doctor gave on the visit a week and a half ago. This means that I've been exacerbating the diarrhea problem with these stupid antibiotics that have done nothing to make him better and everything to make him feel worse. Please, God, don't let Xanthe get this. I don't have any gas left in my tank for that.  And, make no mistake, I am still so tired I could cry (and occasionally do). Xanthe sleeps now, but the great cosmic joke is that now that she's sleeping, Henry isn't. Yeah, yeah - I know - you're sick of hearing me whine that I did not have one night of uninterrupted sleep from early June of 2003 through late March of 2004. But, damn it, it's true! I'd like to see how YOU feel after a year like this.    My other thing for the week is that I am making a silly birthday party hat for Dan and Nicole's little girl, Emma. She's ONE as of this Friday! Woo hoo! The hat is coming along nicely - I'm sure I'll post pics on the family board when it's done. It's a bit of satin-y pink marabou-trimmed fluff. Very fun project, with the upside that I am learning all about adhesives and what works and what doesn't. I'm going to try and finish the majority of it tonight because otherwise it won't be ready in time.  Let's see, what else? Not much, really. My life for the past two weeks consists of foul bodily excretions and the cleanup related to aforementioned excretions. I'm going to show y'all some mercy, then, and just shut my cakehole, now.

      April 23, 2004  TGIF. Really. Knowing that Eug is home for the next 48 hours is like a tall, cool drink of water for my parched soul. This week has been just so hard because of all the illness floating around our house. But Henry seems to be doing a wee bit better. At least he's eating. It may only be about 20% of what he normally eats, but it's something.  Tonight I am updating  urlLink my Amazon Wishlist  with all kinds of nifty things. Everyone should have an Amazon wishlist. It makes life so much easier for your loved ones. The trouble is, mine is a bit clogged with homeschooling hoo-ha. I suspect it probably will remain so for years to come. Ooh! And I just found out tonight that the  urlLink Kidcosmic Website  now has ordering functionality! If you want REALLY cool baby stuff, go here. Swanky doesn't begin to describe it. Just don't get the  urlLink Sushi Dress  for Xanthe, 'cause she already has it. (And, NO, I did not pay that much money for it. I think I got it for $17 off eBay, so untwist yer knickers.) OK, it *is* really expensive stuff. But the bibs are so freaking cute and vaguely affordable. Sort of.  Talking with Heather tonight, I learned that Google now owns Blogger...and that all kinds of weird searches can result in people finding your site. Heather rattled off some of the referring URLs that led people to her blog and had me pissing my pants with laughter. Shit like "fat woman small boy in bed honey". There are some sick motherfuckers out there. Another good reason there AIN'T NO FUCKING WAY my kid is getting on the internet. NO. WAY. IN. HELL. Tell me what you need to find, and I'll load the page for you and then disconnect. End of discussion. Anyhoo, I did some Google searches and indeed found my site pop on various things. Too funny.   You know what I find funny? Hearing slang used by other people (or even weirder, in the media) that you have never heard another person use - save yourself and friends who adopted it after hearing each other use it. I have no idea where I got this, but I have long used the word "schnoogle" in place of "cuddle" or "snuggle". Apparently other people use the word "schnoogle"  urlLink the same way . Who'd 'a thunk it? Also, "wackadoo", meaning some crazy or freakish person. Now, in recent years I've heard this one  A LOT . But years and years ago, I never seemed to hear it. From whence did it spring, I wonder? Along those lines, Eug was teasing me the other day because as we were checking out at Costco, I told Henry to "scootle your boodle", meaning, move your butt. Eug cracked a smile and reminded me that "we're in public, for crying out loud". I don't see anything wrong with using my weird-speak in public, so long as the person to whom I am speaking understands me (and Henry is long since familiar with requests to scootle his boodle). "Where's the harm?", I say. Embrace thine eccentricities.

      April 22, 2004 - early afternoon  There's something about pouring yesterday's leftover coffee into your "If you can't eat it, smoke it, or fuck it...you may as well throw it away!" mug while still wearing your pjs at noon that really summarizes my life. Tiptoeing around the kitchen, trying to catch the microwave before it beeps because both kids are sleeping but Henry could wake up any time. Motherhood requires stealth. Motherhood also requires time management, which is downright pellucid to anyone who's already a parent. When I was a non-parent, I used to look with disdain at what I thought were half-assed mothers schlepping their way through the day. "Tsk, tsk," I thought. "Can't they even make themselves vaguely presentable for the rest of us if they're going out?"   I think I earned a whole world of bad juju with pissy little thoughts like that, and I am now paying the tab. I know now that it takes a Herculean effort to even get outside the house with children in tow, much less look snappy while doing it. All you really want is to go to the fucking grocery store without some just-married twenty-something looking at your food-smeared clothing and your hair haphazardly pulled through a scrunchy with contempt. All you really want to do is wipe that someone-stuck-a-dog-turd-under-her-nose look right the fuck off. But then you take a deep breath and recall that  you were that girl,  and not so long ago.  Motherhood is about running into the grocery store at 10:45pm because you couldn't leave the house all day because of sick kids...and finding that it closes at 11:00pm. You make the mad dash for two gallons of milk, a honkin' bunch of bananas and some ground beef for tomorrow's dinner. Of course, you have no real plan for the ground beef, but there's gotta be something you can make with hamburger and pantry stock, right? Motherhood is also about calling your neighbor down the street, because you know her kids are sick and she's trapped - and you're going to the grocery store and you want to know if you can get anything for her. Yup, that only comes from another mom. And more specifically, a mom of young children, too. My wonderful neighbor did just that for me this morning. I think the irony for me is that during the years of my life when I had the most free time and disposable income to be generous, thoughtful, selfless...I was pretty much anything but. Now that I have virtually no free time or disposable income, my mind constantly runs to thoughts of and for other people, including people I barely know.   Anyway - Henry seems a little better today. Warm, but not the kind of upsettingly hot he's been since Sunday. No appetite, though. I hate that most of all. I'd better run. I need to figure out what the heck to make for dinner. If anybody knows what to do with ground beef in a pinch, let me know.

      April 22, 2004  Just one quick thing. Tonight, as I'm walking down the hall, I happen to see a minivan in my driveway that I don't recognize. At first I think it's just pulling in to back out and turn around, but OF COURSE I had to stop and watch because it is well known that I am mildly crazy about any strange person or persons hovering around my house. My warning to you? Keep on movin', noseypants. Remember, I've got a one hundred and eighty pound aggressive dog to take your ass down, if need be.  So, anyway, I'm watching this unknown vehicle in my driveway and they are just taking waaaaaay too fucking long to back out. Then I see that the front passenger is POINTING A FUCKING CAMERA AT MY HOUSE. Or, more specifically, at my tree. My magnolia tree. OK, it *is* magnificent. Gigantic. In full, poetic bloom. But still. Is it me? Am I crazy that stuff like this makes me want to run out the front door screaming "Aaaaiiiiieeeeee!' and wielding a hatchet? I got my undies righteously wadded up and marched out there just as they were pulling out. I hollered "Excuse me!" but either they didn't hear it or they were saying to each other "Oh, shit! Go...GO!"  Really - am I nuts? How weird is it to have some stranger snapping pictures of your house? And don't tell me I should be flattered, either. Fuck flattery. MYOB, I say.  Anyway. Cross your fingers that Henry feels better tomorrow. This fever just won't go away and stay away.

      April 21, 2004  Aaaahh. Sleeping babies and a giant cup of coffee. Pure luxury. So Henry is still sick as a dog, poor kid. The one nice thing about having a sick baby is that they tend to sleep a wee bit more during the day. Now, the trade off for this is usually that their nighttime sleep is piss-poor at best, but things could be worse. The thing that's driving me nuts is computer-weirdness. I'm going to have Eug reformat the whole fucking Windows drive tonight and start from scratch. It's all just so mysterious - why am I getting the blue screen of death sometimes but not others? What does "Inaccessible Boot Drive" mean, exactly? Sometimes my connection works like a charm and other times it just coughs, sputters and dies. It's making me unhappy, damn it.   I'm also feeling like such an amateur at so many things. Take web stuff. I've come a long way (baby), but I'm still really nowhere. I would love to be able to do so much more with this page, but finding the time to learn entirely new skills at this point in my life seems unlikely, at best. I imagine that I will have a smokin' blog when I am 55. That's also right around the time my house will be pristine and all of my fabulous knitting projects will be finished in a timely fashion.  Speaking of knitting, I have some phenomenal projects to finish. One is an   urlLink Adrienne Vittadini sweater   that I just love and I know I will wear constantly. It's so close to done, I can taste it. So close. But. Not. Done. Ugh. The other is a (pardon me, but there's no other word) shitload of Noro's Oimochan in the most gorgeous variegation - sort of like the colors of a flamboyant sunset. Plus, it's super-DUPER-bulky, so it's got that comic effect. I'm going to make a huge, shapeless sweater/coat from it. Yum. I tried to find a decent pic of that, but I'd have to take one myself and upload it somewhere. Yet another thing to figure out. I have umpteen message boards on Network 54, but I can't use any of my realm space there to host pictures that are accessible to the outside world, apparently. This stuff is probably painfully simple to the rest of you out there, but it's still a struggle for me to understand and I AM NOT ASHAMED! (giggle)  OK, that's all for now. If anyone wants to take pity on me and clue me in on computer-related guidance, feel free. Until then, I will just hobble along as much as my stumpy little legs will allow.

      April 20, 2004  First things first: Best pizza ever? Jet's Hawaiian Deep Dish. Crispy bacon bits, perfectly thin little pieces of sliced ham, and gorgeous pineapple. Yum.  Now, for today's observations. I realized tonight that one of motherhood's main components is audial endurance. After a day in my pajamas (two pair of them, actually - one was christened with vomit by Henry early in the day) spent mostly doing laundry and dosing fevered children with Tylenol, I was worn fairly thin. I was folding laundry in the hallway as Henry and Xanthe hung out in the living room. Henry had requested - and received - his zillionth viewing of Thomas The Tank Engine videotapes for the day, but only because the poor kid was so sick it was breaking my heart. Xanthe was lolling about on the living room rug, surprisingly happy for her paltry entertainment. Then, for whatever reason - perhaps just the sheer joy of the sound of her own voice - she started hollering in short bursts. Sort of a flat but determined "Uuuuhhhhhhhhh" sound. Henry responded by shouting something that sounded an awful lot like "I'm NOT!" They repeated this cycle for no fewer than fifteen minutes, I swear on my life. She would make the weird noise, and 'Shouty McYellerson' would respond with an indignant "I'm NOT!". I finally stopped what I was doing to go watch the spectacle and laugh at them - and also at my plight as a mother.   Speaking of plight, I'm researching motor skills delays in infants because my pain-in-the-ass pediatrician wants me to take Xanthe to a neurologist. Why? Because she's content to lie about rather than expend energy toward the business of crawling or standing. My gut tells me my kid is just lazy (remember, this is the child who snapped the frame of her bouncer seat in two because she used it right up until it could no longer support her weight and her constant, wild bouncing), but I'll be damned if I'm not a wee bit worried, nonetheless. Doctors. They can drive you crazy. I'm not taking her in to see a freaking neurologist, yet, though. I mean, give me a break. If she hasn't made any progress by her first birthday, then perhaps. But until then, no dice.  I always thought I was too tough to be easy game for the blather of doctors, but apparently not. Ugh.   I must report a bit of brilliant analysis Tracy observed about my person the other day. I informed her that I was sitting down to dinner, and when she queried me with regard to the menu, I replied that dinner that night consisted of some previously-cooked elbow macaroni, mixed with some canned peas and sprinkled with parmesan cheese after a brief spin in the microwave. Once she got over her laughter, she sagely remarked that I "have the palate of a toddler". Oof! Hit in the gut with a dead-on truth! And one that had never before occurred to me, either! She's totally, utterly, completely right, though. I loathe the weird, the spicy, the ethnic. I want everything covered in gooey cheese. Among my favorite foods I would list things like grilled hot dogs and cookies and Lucky Charms. My idea of sophisticated eats is a Steak Burrito Ultimo from Baja Fresh. So sue me.  So my goal for tomorrow is to grocery shop, assuming the kids are well enough to withstand the trip. I don't need milk so badly that I'm willing to risk another public puking (but thankfully that one happened in the pediatrician's office). Henry appears to be feeling better tonight, and the real test will be whether he makes it through tonight without his fever rising again. Time will tell. I also want to do a little paperwork tomorrow. I have to set the bar laughably low these days, especially when anyone is sick. I feel particularly accomplished on any given day when I manage to put on street clothing, even if I do not leave the house. I may brew a big pot of coffee for myself tomorrow. If that doesn't give me a kick in the ass, nothing will. :^D

      April 15, 2004  Eug was heckling me tonight. You see, I needed to run to the grocery store for braunschweiger and milk - and according to Eug, this was a combination of things that was both gross and laugh-out-loud funny. (For what it's worth, I needed the freakin' braunschweiger because my buddy Amy had a brilliant suggestion to feed little pieces of wheat bread smeared with 'da braun' now that Xanthe is fierce about only feeding herself, thankyouverymuch. Besides, I couldn't very well keep feeding the child Cheerios and canned green beans forever, now could I?) Anyhoo, this devolved into a conversation about the kinds of things, in combination, that would surely result in raised eyebrows at the grocery store. Such as: braunschweiger, beer, and Glamour magazine. Cow's feet and douche. Pickles and toothpicks. Etc. Feel free to e-mail me with your suggestions for gross combinations. If I get any good ones, I'll share them.  The other thing I am still laughing about is a little snippet from The Simpsons. It's the episode where Homer and Marge go out drinking and Homer crashes the car. In an effort to avoid losing his license, he plants an unconscious Marge behind the wheel to make it look like *she's* the boozer. When everyone in town thinks Marge is a drunk after she goes to jail for drunk driving, there's this scene where the Simpsons are at church in line for communion, and as Marge takes the wine, old Mrs. Skinner says something like "Hey! Leave some for the rest of us, alkie!" But the thing that keeps making me howl is what comes next - Otto, the stoner bus driver is behind Mrs. Skinner and says (in inimitable Otto fashion)   "Yeah! Don't Bogart our Lord!"   It may or may not surprise you to know that I do a dead-on Otto impression, and I can't keep myself from repeating this line ad nauseum. Even Henry is getting in on the act!  I'm still struggling mightily with my weight. I was doing so well - lost 15 pounds in the six weeks from January to mid-February. Had muscle tone, energy, pride, you name it. Then I got the stomach flu and it wiped me out for a few days - followed by a bad cold, and then another, etc. What a mess. Now I cannot seem to find the strength to pick up the pieces and move forward. Ugh. Eating junk, not drinking water, yadda yadda yadda. In fact, hang on - let me go grab a water.  That's better. Now, let me ask you this - what's up with you people who don't read? Seriously, what do you  do , anyway? I mean, I watch TV. I lounge around. I play video games. What I'm getting at here is that I know how to waste time with the best of them. Plus, I have two children in diapers, OK? And I still read as much as I can because I think I would  die  if I didn't have something that I'm currently reading - no matter how long it takes me to finish a book these days. Eug surprised me with a couple of things from my Amazon wishlist today: a creepy little vintage children's book still in print for some strange reason, and John McWhorter's book about the degradation of the English language in speech, print and music. I am drooling just thinking about getting into that one. Isn't reading like something your body cannot live without? You non-readers. I just don't get you. A house is not a home without staggering stacks of beloved books hither and yon, damn it. And like I've said before, reading People magazine does NOT count.   All right, that's it for tonight. Sleep tight, Faithful Friends.

      May 28, 2004   Such  a productive night! I have been rolling on a caffeine high all day long. Delightful. I had a massive workout, managed most of a snazzy red, white and blue pedicure (the only thing appropriate for a Memorial Day weekend – I am nothing if not a patriot), got some housecleaning done, ate well, entertained company all day long, and still have a few chores up my sleeve before the night’s over.  But let me get to my inspiration for the evening. I picked up Tom Perrotta’s newest book, “Little Children”. Tom, I hope you don’t get pissed at me for doing so, but I had to quote the very first paragraph of the book in its entirety:   “The young mothers were telling each other how tired they were. This was one of their favorite topics, along with the eating, sleeping, and defecating habits of their offspring, the merits of certain local nursery schools, and the difficulty of sticking to an exercise routine. Smiling politely to mask a familiar feeling of desperation, Sarah reminded herself to think like an anthropologist.  I’m a researcher studying the behavior of boring suburban women. I am not a boring suburban woman myself. ”  Now, let me first say that I know already that I will love this book, as its author penned the novel from whence sprang one of my very favorite films, “Election”. So I know he’s brilliant, talented, et..cet..er..aaahhh. But…  Ouch, goddammit. Right on the heels of that gut reaction comes the “And fuck you and the horse you rode in, Mr. Perrotta. With a three foot lead pipe, how ‘bout?” For crissakes, he just summed up my blog…hell, my   LIFE  …in two fucking sentences. My life, that is, minus all the sweetness.  And so what if we suburban moms have all the scintillating conversational sparkle of week-old ginger ale in a bottle with no cap? Like the rest of you assholes don’t bitch about the same old shit, too? It’s just that your brand of yackadoo is made from different ingredients. So, harumph, I say.  Anyway, I wanted to share it because even though it stings mightily, it   is   awfully clever.   Last thing for the evening is something I’ve thought about before. It’s for all you wacky atheists out there. My question for you is this: Why  not  believe in God? Really, why not? Nobody knows for sure one way or the other, so why would you willingly choose to stand on that side of the fence, I wonder? I mean, let’s say all of us simpleton believers are, in fact, wrong. Death is the end and all that. Nothing after the last breath. The worst thing for believers, then, is that we go all the way up to and  through  that moment both calm and happy. If there’s nothing beyond, then we don’t have any idea that we’ve been duped all along, ‘cause we’re dead. But we go right up through the last second in a pretty positive, anticipatory state of mind, hopefully. If you were an avowed atheist, wouldn’t you just face that moment with grim, gritted teeth and not even the tiniest glimmer of glittery hope? What fun is that? And what if you’re wrong and there  is  a God, but he decides to un-invite you to the party since you were such a turd right up ‘til the end? Like he’d decide to  let  you be right and have no afterlife, if you were so hell bent to believe it? Atheism. I see no advantage whatsoever. Pick a faith and have some fun with it, folks.

      May 19, 2004  I'm convinced that the reason people who happen to be parents generally look so - um -  wizened  compared with their non-parent peers is the fucking sleep deprivation. If parenthood has a religion, that's it. Thou shalt not sleep. Ever. Xanthe didn't sleep through the night until she was over  eight months old . Go on, my childfree friends. Grin yerself silly. I understand. And even now that she sleeps, the kids still get sick and the circus begins all over again. This week Henry has an ear infection, and last night my night went something like this:  Xanthe goes to sleep at 8:45; Henry at 9:15pm.  We go to bed at 11pm.  Xanthe cries at 12:30am. I am so out of it that I pick her up and nurse her back to sleep. I thought it must've been 5am, I was so disoriented. Otherwise I would've made the little goober cry it out.  Henry starts hollering at 2:30am. I go in because Eug was up with him the night before. He is feverish. I change his diaper, dose him with Tylenol, get him a sippy of milk and sit on the couch with him in the darkened living room watching "Colonial House" on PBS for 20 minutes before I put him back to bed, hoping that the Tylenol has begun to kick in to reduce the fever.  At 4am, he is hollering "MAMA!" again and again at top volume. A command rather than a request. He doesn't sound too upset, so I decide to see if he'll zip it eventually and fall back asleep. I wait about twenty minutes, during which time neither Eug nor Xanthe awaken. Amazing. No go on H falling back asleep. He continues to holler intermittently until he is reduced to a very anxious, high-pitched cry. Very sad, indeed. I haul my keister out of bed again and get him. This time we sit in the very dark living room with a sippy but no TV for ten minutes, just calming down. His hair is wet with sweat and he leans his head on my shoulder so sweetly that I'm glad I got him. But I am oh, so tired.  At 6am, Xanthe awakens. I nurse her and she is crabby and looking like she's going to stay awake. I respond with "Tough noogies, kid" and plunk her back in her crib. I am NOT getting up for the day at 6am. Especially not after the night I just had.  At 7am, Xanthe makes it clear that she's ready to rock and roll. My only saving grace is that Blue's Clues is on TVO, and I can squeak in an extra 20 minutes of half-sleep on the couch while she gazes with rapt attention at the screen. And the AAP recommends that children under two watch NO television? And I recommend that they kiss my fat ass.  Anyway, before I forget to write about this, something else is happening to me in recent years. I'm getting to be more of a wuss about all kinds of things. For years, I have loved things like extreme roller coasters and true crime and horror movies. Now, the thought of getting on a roller coaster makes me think nervously "But what if something goes horribly wrong?" You'd think that I'd get  more  reckless with each year closer to inevitable death, and not the reverse. Seems like if there's any time to be cautious, it's when you're young and you have many a decade in front of you if you're careful and a little lucky. But, no. I'm beginning to remind myself of an old hen with a nervous disorder, and it's a little unsettling when I look at myself objectively.  The true crime stuff is very disturbing to me, now, too. I think I've written about this before, so I won't belabor the point. But the thought of someone hurting my family makes me both very, very angry and very, very sick. I have probably spent way too much time thinking about it, but in the event that I am ever the victim of a crime, I have already braced myself for how I would want to react, in the hopes that in those seconds, I will kick into autopilot and KILL WITH MY BARE HANDS THE UNLUCKY SON OF A BITCH WHO'S TRYING TO HARM ME. Or die trying, and right there. No way is somebody getting me to go anywhere - and I don't give a shit if they threaten my kids. I'll take me chances right then and there.  Then, there's the horror movie stuff. I used to LOVE these. I still go see them all the time, but now it seems I enjoy them less and less. We went to see the remake of Dawn of the Dead, which was very well done. But there's one scene that really keeps  bothering  me. In the beginning, a husband and wife are sharing what will be, unbeknownst to them, their last normal night on earth. They have no idea that the zombie plague is sweeping the world. They awaken to the little girl next door at their bedroom door. The husband sits up sleepily and, seeing that she appears to be injured, goes to her. She lunges for his neck and chaos ensues. The result after a few tense moments is that the wife escapes through the bathroom window to her car (highly implausible, especially given that she somehow instinctively grabs for her car keys) and tears off down the street. It's actually a really great scene, because it takes one of those oh-so-normal McMansion neighborhoods and peppers it with fire and blood and fear and violence. The safe and everyday juxtaposed against the what-the-fuck-is-going-ON-here. But the part that I cannot get out of my head is the scene as she drives away, with her now-zombie husband hauling fucking ASS after her on foot, wanting to take a bite out of her. You see him through the rear car window, trucking like he's running an Olympic  sprint , for God's sake, and without so much as a sniff in another direction to warn you of what's about to happen, he   swerves   and in less than a second he is just *on* some poor clueless guy standing on his lawn watching it all go down. It was just so fucking fast and so brutal that I have been creeped out by that image ever since. I have no idea why I should be so bothered by what I can logically admit is a very clever execution of a very effective scene. But bothered I am.  So I'm getting old and turning into - yes, I gotta say it - a pussy. Not like I was ever jumping out of airplanes in my youth, but that's just it: I was never that bold before, and now I'm retreating into my shell like an elderly turtle. An elderly turtle with a wicked temper, too.   OK, before I go and seeing as how I already mentioned it: Are y'all watching Colonial House on PBS? I love these series. I intend to torment my kids by making them watch every episode when they are older. (I also intend to enjoy their eye-rolling when I remind them that they should be grateful for the embarrassment of riches they enjoy in this life.) I asked Eug if he'd ever go along with it if I wanted to apply for one of those things in the future. He looked wary but could obviously see the zeal in my eye. Figuring that it's a safe bet that I'd never be sufficiently organized to get the application in on time, he agreed that he'd do it. Then he grinningly speculated that maybe we could get on "Cave Man House" and he could drag me around by my hair all day. What a smartass I married.  Anyway, before I forget: For those of you watching Colonial House, can I just say how fucking obnoxious it is to see all these dumbass people on the show who don't want to observe the Sabbath, or cover their heads, or whatever else was called for in Colonial Times. Hello? You signed up for the experience, god damn it. Leave your modern whining at the door and shut your cakehole. LIVE THE LIFE AS COLONIAL PEOPLE REALLY LIVED IT. Isn't that the fucking point?

      May 16, 2004  It took me a while to even figure out what today's date was, I am so out of it. I was going to write about the fact that Eug's wonderful sister had an ovary removed that turned out to be cancerous, but I just erased everything I wrote. Believe it or not, it is just too personal and painful for me to talk about in this journal. So let me just ask any of you who might read these words to send up a brief prayer for her, even if you don't know me from Adam and you sure as hell don't know her, either. Please. Thank you.  I have fallen so behind on everything that the cavalry is coming tomorrow: my mother! Thank God. Maybe I will get the kitchen table cleared off while she distracts the spawnlings. I don't know how it happens - the pile of crap that takes over. Every time I get the table clear, I swear I will keep it that way. I allow nothing to rest on its surface for more than five minutes for approximately three days, and then... Well, then I get busy. Or lazy. Or distracted. And soon the one thing I left there is joined by another. Ad nauseum. At the end, I'm shoving stuff aside with both hands just to clear enough room to set my salad plate down. So that's on my list.  I fell in love all over again with our house tonight. There's nothing quite like seeing it from the backyard on a nice, warm day. It's fucking stunning, spread out over the near-acre we have and I'd have to spend at least $600,000 to find something that I could honestly say is cooler. Or maybe more. When I see my house like that - through those love-struck eyes again - I know there's no way we'll ever move, no matter how I kvetch and moan. Some lucky son of a bitch is going to get this house in about sixty years, and by then it'll be even cooler. Maybe I'll get to leave it to one of my kids, who will probably have to pay off the others handsomely for the privilege.  I have also decided firmly on a name for another daughter, should we be blessed with one. It takes some thinking, you know. You can't give Xanthe's sister a name like Jane, for heaven's sake. But for some reason I am reluctant to post the name. If you really want to know, e-mail me and I'll share. I have no idea where I'll put all the offspring, but more and more I am pining away for two boys and two girls. Scary, huh? I should have my head examined. The name for the boy is also decided - at least if you ask me, it is. Eug is going to have to lobby long and hard for something else, and I don't think he can think of anything else for which to lobby that determinedly.   I did some more garage-sale hunting with Nicole on Saturday, and I had such fun again. We had to take my two spawn because Eug was working all day, but even the kids were fine. There was one sale where a little boy of about eight years old was selling brownies for 30 cents each, so I bought three and gave him a dollar for keeps. Then he shocks me by handing me these eee-nor-muss hunks of brownie (with his bare hands, which cracked me up because the childfree me of yore would've gotten all oogy over that and now I'm like a pig rolling in slop when it comes to germ exposure, so I can't rightly get my undies in a wad over a bare-handed brownie pass) that turned out to be so freaking delicious. I really wish I had gone back to give him a couple of extra dollars by way of thank you. Maybe I could've figured out how they made those brownies - a recipe? A mix? It haunts me. I also got a cute little girl's sweater for 75 cents - and it was Gap, and in perfect condition. AND it was striped! I love that.  I was getting a little crazy again over all the things we need to do to this house  before  we even get to stuff like adding on bedrooms - much less FUN stuff like a pool. But then I had to stop and remind myself that we are on a fifteen year mortgage, and as they say on the road construction signs: "This short-term delay will bring long-term relief." Our payments are significantly higher, but we're knocking down like principal on our mortgage like a motherfucker. I actually printed an amortization of our loan so I could highlight each payment as we made them and giggle as I watch the balance drop like a stone. I even have a special pink highlighter I use for the task.  Heck, it feels like we re-mortgaged yesterday, but it's already been a year. I'm sure I will blink and we will be five years into it. And with an interest rate like 4.75%, you'd have to give me a pubic wax with hot lava before I would give that up. Our kids will be going off to college, and we'll just then be adding on rooms. Come to think of it, maybe that is the way to go. After all, I am the woman whose once-gorgeous leather couch now smells unmistakably of vomit - and it sure as hell wasn't Eug or I who puked on it! So it's probably better that we live with the leftovers until the kids are gone. Then when I remodel the house, it won't be so easy for them to move back in, heh heh.

      May 6, 2004  I had so much fun today. I went trucking all over town with Nicole and the kids, hitting garage sales hither and yon. Picked up a couple of Hanna Andersson outfits that I'll probably sell on eBay. Ha ha ha ha! Sell on eBay! SELL! Hoo...hee - hang on a second. That means I would need to get my shit together and actually list something, right? Whee, that's funny. OK, someday. When I have my shit together. Hee hee hee. Oh, the perverse giggling over that could go on and on.  It's actually hot in here tonight. I think this is the very first night that we won't turn the furnace on all night. A seasonal milestone. We saw "Lost In Translation" tonight. Bill Murray is so incredibly likeable. Other than that, the movie was a bit of a snoozer. I mean, Scarlett Johansson was luminous, of course. But, so what? It's one of those movies that you feel like you  have  to like, or else people will think you're a tasteless slob. Still...yawn. OK, it was fine. Whatever.  I'm getting into oddball eBay searches. One of my favorites is to search for anything with "pink" and "retro" in the auction title, which currently led me to enjoy a search on melmac dinnerware, and more specifically, some oddly appealing Texasware speckled bowls. Some are just ugly, while others - well, they speak to me despite their ugliness. And I lost an auction the other night for this fabulous little girls' dress with a print of the oddest, funniest fucking sock monkeys you ever saw all over it. I sniped it like a good eBay soldier (and manually, because I'm an old-fashioned girl that way), but some bitch was just willing to pay more for the fucking thing than I was. Dammit. I still want it. I hate to lose.  I actually made dinner tonight, too. Shrimp sautéed in garlic and butter over pasta. With a salad of spinach, mushrooms, cuke and carrots, too. Swear to God. I know it's shocking, but I would not lie. After dinner, I had the overwhelming desire to sit down with my stack of Cook's Illustrated and waste time perusing recipes. Mmm.   Did you know that pudding pops are back? Yup, found them in the freezer section the other day. They're not as good as the originals, but you should have seen Xanthe perk up after she got her first taste of one. She actually hollered at Eug every time he wasn't ready at the nanosecond she wanted more. My kinda girl.   So help me out, here - I've been feeling like I have to call in all the shit that I've lent people   eons   ago that they obviously are in no fucking hurry to return before I forget who has what and when I go looking for it next year, I won't know what the fuck happened to it and it will keep me awake for no fewer than three long nights. I mean, if you borrowed the book, movie, CD - whatever - a YEAR ago, you're not getting around to using it. So give it back, fer crissakes. That's really a huge pet peeve of mine: making the person from whom you borrowed something ask for it back because you've had it for-fucking-ever. And let me say openly to everyone: if *I* have something of yours for too long now, I have actually forgotten that I have it. Please ask for it back from me before an embarrassing length of time passes and when you  do  ask for it back, I will be mortified. Hey, I just had a thought! Maybe I should take my own advice! What a novel approach! If I could just remember what everybody has, now...  Still haven't come up with anything cool and smaller than an MBUD stroller for Mother's Day gift ideas. I already have two massage gift certificates that I haven't used yet. Jewelry is out of the question, because if it isn't the size of a substantial ice cube, I wouldn't want it anyway. If laser hair removal were perfectly permanent and affordable, maybe I'd have my armpits done. Wouldn't that be AWESOME? Hair-free pits. No red bumps from shaving, either. Ah, to dream. But that doesn't exactly bespeak mother-love, as far as gifts go. In fact, I think hair removal is something that one must buy for oneself, now that I think of it.  Henry really cracks me up and makes me proud. (Xanthe's too little to be anything but rib-achingly adorable right now, which she accomplishes in spades, so no worries there.) Today when we were out, he was doing his little ident-a-machine thing. He spots a backhoe cruising down the street, and he says sweetly from the third row "Look, mama. A backhoe! Look at the backhoe, mama!" And I feel this totally out-of-proportion, ridiculous pride. It's like a drug! I can see how some parents get really obnoxious and out of hand in a hurry. You've gotta really keep yourself in check and try not to get a giant helium balloon for a head. Why I should be geeked that my kid can identify all this truck-train-tractor stuff, I don't know. Truthfully, I'm sure it's all normal behavior for an almost two-and-a-half year old. But I dig it all the same.  OK, if you have any good ideas for Mother's Day gifts that Eug can get for me, send them along, kids. Modernmotherhood@hotmail.com Thanks a bunch.

      May 3, 2004  I am back! Yes, the good me, the amazing me - the  real  me is back. I didn't manage to wake up at 5am this morning (I was awake until around 2:30am), but I still got up and followed my nutrition plan and hoisted myself on the treadmill for over 45 minutes (3.75 miles, 420 calories). I'm going to do my upper body workout with weights as soon as I take this little water/blogging break, too. The thing that always irritates me is how good I feel when I live the way I am supposed to live. Why, then, is it so hard to maintain? When I was six weeks into Body-For-Life, I felt incredible. Better than I had ever felt, and not just because I was losing weight and was on an emotional high. No, I could see wild changes in my body, even underneath the fat I still had to lose. I could see weird and wonderful curves taking shape in my arms. I had energy and stamina. My mind was clearer.   Even now, after more than two months off the wagon, I can still hoist Henry around and carry him indefinitely without feeling tired or achy - which Eug can't do. The muscle tissue is still with me. Diminished, perhaps, but there nonetheless. The body is a wondrous thing. So, starting today from the beginning, I will finish my first twelve weeks at the end of July. I don't really want to talk about my goals, but then maybe I should. The thing is, I don't want to have any personal conversations about what I'm doing. I have trouble discussing these things in person and doing so sometimes has strange emotional effects on me. So I guess I won't say too much more other than that I feel good to have done something today that makes me feel proud of myself. Enough said.  Now, let's see - when last I left you, illness was still afoot in our household. Thankfully, everything appears to have passed, but not without a trip to the ER for IV fluids (which deserves its own full-fledged rant, but I don't feel like dredging up all those feelings again). Henry is his charming, energetic self again. Xanthe looks bright-eyed and bushy-tailed once more. Eug and I feel great. Heck, if anybody wants to get together with us, you'd better speak up before the next wave of germs hits us!   There is one funny thing going on, though. By funny I mean strange - but in a perfectly normal way. Yes, you read that right: strange in a normal way, LOL. Henry is going through some kind of a fear period. He has anxieties about things that never bothered him before. He was walking with Eug through the Target parking lot yesterday (holding hands, of course) and he would get really nervous and yell in a very upset tone of voice at any nearby car - like he thought they were going to run him over. Nothing Eug or I said made any difference. He was genuinely worried. Then, he had a full-scale freak-out when our Terminix guy (hey, it's part of life on a slab foundation - it's you vs. the bugs) showed up and was walking around the perimeter of our house. Poor kid. He was wide-eyed and shaking, just like something out of a horror movie. I tried to be comforting but at the same time upbeat and friendly to show him there was nothing to worry about.   And Xanthe's making mobility progress! She sits like a champ for loooong periods of time, contentedly playing with toys. Best of all, if you give her something REALLY exciting to do, she will stand against the side of the couch, bathtub, etc. Whew. Thank goodness, I say.   I'm also thinking of getting a ridiculously expensive double stroller, because I can no longer stand what I've got. I told Eug I would be willing to sell off everything but the single Peg Perego Milano XL *and* consider this purchase good for both Mother's Day and my birthday gifts, unless I make at least $200 at the family garage sale this year. Can't say as I blame him, as the stroller I want is a whopping $545.00. But I am sick of having eighteen strollers for everything. I want one that does it all, and with no shitty squeaky wheels, broken plastic parts or seats that don't recline for sleeping children. I want quality and durability. And that, my friends, means the range of choices is indeed narrow if you're talking double strollers. Since I have learned the hard way that the ONLY way to go with a double is a side-by-side, but you still need your SBS to be no narrow enough for everyday use...well, that narrows it down even more. Which brings us to... urlLink The Mountain Buggy Urban Double!  Yes, I want it in the chocolate color, too. Yummy. I'm still of two minds about the fact that it doesn't have that whole front bar with cupholder crapola for kiddies. But we'll see. There's good reason people flip their lid for this contraption.  That's it for now. Thanks for stopping by.

      June 28, 2004  I can hardly believe what I wrote earlier today, given what I face now. You see, we are euthanizing Dodi late tomorrow morning. It was hardly a planned thing, obviously. I went into the workroom tonight to start a big clean-up effort that would precede stowing a number of things there in preparation for the party and to make the room especially comfortable for the critters, given the stress of having strangers in the house while they are confined to one room.   It didn’t take me long to discover that Dodi had been peeing outside the box again. It was pretty recent – probably over the last few days – and so it hadn’t built up to where I would notice it until I actually got close to that end of the room. After all, the litter boxes are in that room, so the smell wasn’t anything abnormal, even though we keep the boxes as clean as possible. After all, we were hoping to prevent this from happening.  Dodi’s been peeing outside the box ever since she was a little over a year old. I don’t know if the move from our townhouse to the first house we owned tripped something in her, but she started by peeing on piles of laundry if you left them on the basement floor. OK, no problem – I just won’t leave laundry on the basement floor. Then it was plastic bags. We had her medically tested every which way and tried various supplementation and dietary measures. Then we move to a new house and there *is* no basement. She accelerates and pees in carpeted corners. The final straw was when she peed on our bed. We moved her to the workroom that night. She spent a lot of time in a Great Dane wire kennel with a litter box and a cozy bed. We hoped that she’d re-learn to use the box and only the box. It seemed to work, and she got the run of the workroom again. We were hoping to open up some of the rest of the house to here again. She seemed to be getting better.  Until tonight. Tonight made it clear to us that there’s no solution; only an ugly decision. We could wait, but we’d only be further prolonging the inevitable and her life is a paltry shell of what a kitty deserves as it is. When I called Kim, it felt so fucking awful to be telling her that we needed to say goodbye to Dodi. Dodi! My God, Dodi – it should, by all rights, be Theo. Not my little tabby girl.  But as Eug said, losing Dodi means gaining Claude. To the very best of our knowledge, Claude doesn’t have any litter box problems, and having Dodi sequestered means that he spends the majority of his time with her, keeping her company. They are littermates, you know. Brother and sister. My first babies. Claude will have the run of the house again. But I imagine if the choice were his – self-centered little cretin though he is – he’d still choose his sister.  And so I have failed her, and I will carry her mewling self into the clinic tomorrow. I will hold my kitten and say goodbye and tell her I’m sorry I couldn’t fix that stress she was feeling. And even though I’ve done my absolute best, it’s still nowhere near enough. The universe conspires against me, I feel. I can tell you with a straight face that I know no one who loves animals more than me. As much, OK. But not more. So in these moments of unattractive self-pity I wonder why God couldn’t just ease the fuck up, a little.   Sheila, I know you’re not here on earth with us any more. But I’m betting you hear me right now, so I’m asking you to be waiting for my little kitten tomorrow. It’s nearly a year since you took your own life, and I miss you still. I know she’ll be in good hands with you, honey. You were there to bear Rolf away from me that last time, and I want her to be with you.  What should you know about Dodi? Well, she was born on Super Bowl Sunday in 1995. We were desperately searching for kittens at the end of that March, having no idea that there is a sort of ‘season’ for kittens and we weren’t in it. Hence, the kitten shortage everywhere we looked. We saw an ad in the paper for “exotic six-toed kittens”. (We had no idea that a polydactyl – or extra-toed kitten – was actually a sign of inbreeding, ha ha.) We called and someone who sounded very, very stoned told us that he ‘thought they were all gone’. For some reason, I asked him to take my phone number, even though I never in a zillion years expected that this higher-than-a-kite individual would actualy relay the message. But a few days later, we got a call at almost ten at night from the woman selling the kittens. She had two left, she said. We were already in bed for work the next day, so I asked her to hold them ‘til tomorrow, even though she said we could come out that night, if we liked. I hung up and knew right away I’d never be able to sleep. Eug and I got up and drove into a rather desperate part of town with sixty or seventy dollars, I think. Took them both because there was no way we could leave one. And so she came home.  Dodi got locked out of our house accidentally when she was a wee little kitten and she stayed right on the porch. We’d left for the day and when we came back we realized that friends had inadvertently let her out the front door. There was one sad little poop on the porch. She shot past us once the door was open and was never lured outside again, no matter how great the temptation.  Dodi would have us both in helpless laughter over the way she could stand upright on her rear feet for prolonged periods of time, batting at a toy, or even just being curious and getting a better look at something by standing up.  Dodi is a dusky greyish-brown tabby with a creamy spotty tummy. She mews in response when you call her name and purrs within seconds of petting her.  Dodi’s front legs curve ever-so-slightly. We even had her x-rayed when she was little to make sure there wasn’t a problem. There wasn’t, so “L’il Bulldog” was instantly added to Dodi’s list of nicknames.  Dodi has one ear that gets dirty and one ear that stays clean. No one knows why.  Dodi has green eyes the color of sea-glass and a white chin with fur that’s just a tiny bit longer than the surrounding fur.  Dodi’s name means “beloved”. So perfect.  Dodi loves me still. God help me, for I don’t deserve it.   urlLink    Beloved Dodi&nbsp; urlLink

      June 28, 2004  So I really did throw my back out. I had to go to urgent care Sunday, where I met with a compassionate and reasonable doctor who promptly prescribed an anti-inflammatory and a muscle relaxant and had me back in the car in under 15 minutes. Dreamy! I was even feeling a little bit better a few hours after the first dose. The   twang   is still there if I move too freely, or in the wrong direction, but I can manage. Thank God, because there’s less than two weeks before the party, and this is one mightily crappy time to have an out-of-whack back.  I stopped by my sister’s house to make sure everything was A-OK while they were on vacation and came away with a major case of pea-green envy. You see, they just got new carpeting. Vast expanses of brand-new carpet. It looks so nice, so pristine, so NON-smelly…and here I sit in my super-funk office with carpeting that should be a matter for the state health department. You think I exaggerate? I swear on the heads of my children I do not. Theo’s not the only reason my kids really don’t come in this part of the house – the pure germiness of these horrid rooms is right up there on the list, too.   Anyway, I’m there in her house, rolling around on the soft floor with my sweet baby girl and shriveling up with bitter envy all the while. It’s going to be  years  before I get to re-carpet, damn it. Theo’s too dangerous to give away and too sweet to euthanize, so he gets to live out his life like a furry king on my sofa that I got to enjoy for all of about 3 months before it was too dog-ified even for me and wait for the occasional leftover hot dog or high chair tray to lick down. Plus, he gets the prime window seating right alongside the front door where he gets to scare the living shit out of everyone who approaches. (Good dog! See my “I don’t like strangers…” post a while back.)  Anyway, lucky for Theo that I love his tootheriffic, troublesome ass. Claude and Dodi, too, for that matter. But after they’ve all graced our lives for as long as God gives them, I am going to sweep into these rooms with all the authoritativeness of Evita Perón and launch a re-do worthy of HGTV. New windows, new doors, new carpeting – even new walls in some cases. New, new, new. Never mind the fact that all this is a solid eight years away IF I’M LUCKY. I’m dreaming now, damn it.   Speaking of dreaming, I saw on the way home today that the Big Game is up to $220 million. Must. Buy. Ticket. Just one, mind you. But, oooooh. The idea of all that money makes me…in the words of one of my favorite TV shows, “Strangers With Candy”…”as moist as a snack cake down there”. Seriously – just imagine all that dirty, dirty money. Somebody hand me a napkin – my drool faucet just won’t shut off.  OK, I’ll quit being gross now. I wish I had some new pictures to post, but I really don’t. I’ll try to take some of the party, at the worst. Those should be more visually interesting than the run-of-the-mill photos I usually take, anyway. I know I had other – probably more interesting things – to write about at one point, but maternal senility has whisked them away. So I’ll just pipe down now and wish you a happy afternoon.

      June 24, 2004  What a lovely day. I just got in from doing some weeding while the kids nap. (See? Naptime’s the BEST.) I’m trying to get the yard ship-shape for the party, but when I finally stood up from weeding, there was a nearly audible *twang* from my lower back. Ugh. I was able to stretch out a bit and make it better. Well, mostly.  Note: The following may not make a very interesting blog post for most of you, but I’m writing it to help people who may find themselves in my current situation: with a child who’s developmentally delayed and they don’t know if they should be worried or not. Whenever I search on stuff to help ease my mind, I find people asking my questions, but no answers. So I’m going to try to follow Xanthe’s development in a bit of detail in the hopes that someone doing a search might find this, and find it helpful.  So I made the appointment to have a neurologist look over Xanthe. (It's scheduled for August 10th - the soonest available.) Brief rewind: the pediatrician’s been after me since she was about seven months old to have a neurologist take a look at her, but I have resisted. The reason the ped wants her assessed is because she’s not moving at the expected pace for a child her age. It all goes back to so many things. When Henry was a tiny baby, we struggled to get him to sleep anywhere but his bouncy seat. He was about eight weeks old and I’d seen some blurb about babies needing tummy time every day, and I thought “Oh, shit! We aren’t doing that enough.” So I popped him in his crib on his stomach to work on those muscles while I stood right outside his door, folding laundry in the hall. Less than two minutes later, I suddenly realize he’s quiet. I look and he is faaaaaast asleep. He took a two hour nap that day, which was unheard of. I battled my internal misgivings and began putting him to sleep on his stomach – all the while hovering over him like a lunatic. The AAP’s got us all convinced that if they sleep  once  on their stomachs, they’ll die of SIDS right then and there. And until he learned to roll over hither and yon with ease, I continued to worry. I’d try to put him to sleep on his back, but he would lose his little baby mind and I could see how tired the poor thing was…and, well. You know. So Henry was a tummy sleeper, and he was comfortable being on his stomach even while awake. He learned to log-roll everywhere by the time he was five months old, was crawling by seven and a half months, was standing and walking with a walker by ten months and walking all by himself just after his first birthday. Pretty average.  Xanthe’s a different story. She was fine sleeping on her back, and so sleep on her back she did. (Well, sort of - remember, the kid didn't sleep through the night until she was eight and a half months old. Aren't you tired of hearing that by now? Heh heh.) And while she got tummy time, she admittedly got less of it, just because I was afraid her brother would squash her (some days accidentally, some days on purpose). She dug her bouncy seat in that same rabid way that Henry did, and used it until she literally snapped the frame in two one day from her wild-ass bouncing. We started practicing an independent sit pose with her approaching six months, but she wasn’t going for it. She was content to sit in our laps, but not by herself. This bothered my pediatricians and the nagging began. Then, for one brief week around seven months, she was sitting by herself just fine. It was delightful. But at the end of the week, whenever you’d plop her on the floor in a sit, she’d immediately   fling   herself backwards in protest. This went on until she was about eight and a half months old. Then, finally, she consented to sit again.  Since then, she’s developed a few skills – she obviously sits like a champ at eleven months, and has no trouble reaching forward – even way forward – in her sit and then righting herself again. She even pushes against the floor with her hands to change the direction she’s facing in her sit. She can get herself down to a laying position from a sit without conking her head, too. So she’s got torso control.  But here’s the thing: the child will NOT stand, much less walk. I take that back. I have seen her stand willingly on a few occasions. Back when she was nearly ten months old, Eug stood her alongside the bathtub and she bore her weight on her legs (while leaning slightly against the bathtub) and watched with abject fascination as the water ran into the tub. She refused to repeat the performance, though. (Stubborn? LOL- You bet!) She’s also been seen standing bolt upright in her Jumparoo, even though she generally just hangs out in it and swings to and fro. The last time she stood willingly was when I showed her the contents of a drawer that was just high enough that she couldn’t see in when she sat on the floor. I would hoist her to a standing position, but if she wouldn’t bear weight on her legs, I’d let her plop back into a sit. It didn’t take long for her to figure out that the only way she was going to get her paws in that drawer was to stand. And so she did – a bit shakily, listing to the side, but both feet were firmly on the floor. I had one light hand on her side to make sure she didn’t fall over abruptly. Again, she refused to repeat the performance later that day or since.  I practice playing the game where I say animatedly “One…two…THREE!” and pull her up to her feet, but often she will either only put one foot down, or most of the time neither. The child must have abs of steel, because you’ll be holding her in midair by the hands only and she’s got her legs at a 90 degree angle to her body. What are those called…Roman sit-ups? The Roman chair? Yeah, that’s it – the one where you have your forearms braced under the pads and you lift your feet up as high as you can. Xanthe’s got that one  down , lemmee tell ya.  And so a friend made some innocent comments yesterday that made me finally decide to make the appointment. I guess other people are really bothered by what she can’t do at this age. Meanwhile, I am a tightly knotted ball of mixed feelings. When you’re in a position like this, you feel  everything . You don’t want to ignore something that needs attention, especially if there’s the smallest possibility that it could be serious. But you don’t want your child to be unnecessarily labeled by a well-meaning  doctor who’s determined to  find  something since you've paid good money for an assessment. You don’t want to turn down assistance that may help your child grow and develop, but on the other hand, you don’t want to push her, either. You don’t want to be a parent who buries her head in the sand, but you’d also like to allow your child the freedom and grace to move at whatever pace she’s comfortable with. (Which is, in a nutshell, exactly why we’re homeschooling. So I’m particularly sensitive to allowing a child to have as much control as possible over both the direction they move and the pace at which they choose to take it, especially at such a young age. Should a one year old have to feel pressure?) But on the whole, I think an assessment will be the right thing at this point. I was content to give her a few months and see what happened, but she’s still my little sweet potato, so I will have her poked and prodded, after which I will report back to you all. Hopefully, good will come of it – for us and for anyone out there who might be seeking the reassurance I needed and never found. :^D

      June 22, 2004  Who’d have thought that an e-mail of a monkey with a penis growing out of her head - named Naughty Betty, no less - could make a girl so darned happy? (Boy, *that’ll* get me some appalling search hits, I’m sure.) You see, I got an e-mail from my favorite artist in the universe…Donald Roller Wilson. (Warning: Dial-up users should not attempt his site, IMO. You’ll be sitting there scratching your ass until the cows come home, and lucky to have half of one of his paintings loaded on the screen.) For the uninitiated among us,  urlLink Roller   (as he refers to himself) paints these incredibly surreal scenes in incredibly realistic detail. They often contain dogs, cats, or some variety of monkey/ape/chimp, etc. They are haunting and gorgeous and comic and downright thrilling, and if you don’t agree, you are a tasteless schmuck. (What can I say? I get defensive when someone critiques my great loves in life.)  Anyway, this is not the first e-mail I have gotten from the source of all artistic goodness, but it is the first that is vaguely pornographic. I’m not going to say much more so as to leave a lip-smacking air of mystery, but let me state for the record that I did not send the first e-mail (there would be something boorish about that, to my way of thinking), nor will I go on pestering the man. After all, he’s got cool shit to paint. Still, though - sigh, swoon. What else could a girl want besides an occasional lascivious bolt from the blue from one of her heroes?  But back to my everyday drama. I was a housewife on poor man’s speed today – coffee. Every day I drink it makes me wonder how I ever lived all these years without it. It’s like…well, it’s like plugging yourself IN, fer crissakes. Henry is still occasionally uttering the words “damn it” with alarming accuracy for a two year old. Just every now and then, and always in perfect context. I put on my best stern face and say gravely “Don’t say that. That’s not nice.” The first time I replied in said fashion, he seemed to absorb the gravity of the situation, or so I thought. But then about a week later, I hear him mutter “Damn it!” followed immediately by “Don’t say that. That’s not nice.” The poor kid’s got my genes, clearly – he’s already talking to himself.  Grammar pet peeve of the day: misusing the word “enormity”. Enormity means something along the lines of “a great evil” (too lazy to get the dictionary – just trust me on this one). It does NOT have anything to do with size. If you want to talk about how huge something is, you’ve gotta pull out something like “enormousness”. And if that’s too unwieldy, then just say “huge”. Or “gigantic”. But save the word “enormity” for discussions of Hitler, OK? Just another example of people trying to use a fancy word to sound smart and ending up sounding dumber than a box of hair to anyone who bothers to crack a fucking book once in a while. Stick with what you  know  you know, OK?  Speaking of reading, I hate it when I wind up digging a book that a bajillion people have read, only I wind up reading it eight years after everyone else does and nobody wants to discuss because they’ve all forgotten the salient details by that time. OK, OK – let me just shut up and tell you what I read:  The Nanny Diaries . Maybe the highbrows out there will sneer, but I found it engrossing. In addition, I’m prepared to march on Washington for legislation that would permit the public caning of any ‘parent’ even half-resembling those in the book. Work of fiction, my ass. Give me their names and I’ll send a thug to greet them as they step out of their limo.   Hmmm. I must be a little aggressive tonight, by the sounds of my writing. Like I’m just scrapping for a fight. A by-product of caffeine? Crabby over that $450 bill I had to pay for Henry’s emergency room visit back in April? Perhaps. I really should hit the hay, because I have a ton of shit to do tomorrow, although I can’t recall what any of it might be right at the moment. Maybe someone could leave me a little poem in the comments. Something friendly to take the edge off me. That would be dreamy.

      June 16, 2004  I need to ask you something: When you’re walking into a store like Target and a cart is…oh, let’s say less than 20 feet away from you…do you grab it and walk into the store? If not, why not? Why would you not bring a cart in with you on your way, especially if you don’t have to go out of your way to get one? Why would you wait until you get your ass in the store to grab a cart?  I posed this question to Eug and in inimitable Eug-fashion, he replied “Maybe they want a fresh one.” In mock-exasperation, I retorted “There ARE no fresh ones, you idiot. They’ve all been used a bajillion times.” He countered “Maybe they just got a shipment of fresh ones in.” Me: “They didn’t just get a  shipment  of new carts.” He: “Well, maybe they just sanitized all the ones inside.” I said “Now you   know   that didn’t happen.”   Anyway, really – why don’t you people grab a cart? Don’t tell me you go in and only need a hand-basket, either – that has to be 10% of you, max. And don’t tell me there’s not one close by. There are – you’re just not looking. Grabbing a cart means fewer carts in the lot to clog up the works and lower prices for everyone because Target doesn’t have to employ so many lackeys to bring them all in every hour. Oh, so that’s why you’re walking on by – to stimulate the economy? Yeah, riiiiiight.  So I bought a sweater tonight that made me think of a rather intimate bodily observation of late. It’s this comic-bright rainbow striped sweater from…Target, of course. I was afraid it was too distinctive and people would take one look at me wearing it and say “Oh! That’s from Target, isn’t it?” But then I realized that: a) I am hardly a fashion plate with a standard to uphold. b) I do not give a shit what people think of me. c) I love stripes. A LOT.   So I put the sweater on at home for one quick moment before I give the kids a bath in order to assess it once again (as in, “Am I too linebacker-ish to wear such a loud, horizontally striped sweater?”) and I realize that the eye-popping colors in the sweater and the order in which they appear really, um…draw attention to the chestal arena. Major boobage, even without cleavage. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, of course. (Unless I get sick of people talking to my chest. Women included – I’m betting those stripes have the power to hypnotize even us straight gals.) All this brings me to my observation for the evening. (I have a point, I swear.)  Nursing this long has left my nipples in a state of permanent semi-erectness. (OK, I guess I have TWO points! Ha! I crack me up.) Notice I didn’t say “arousal”, because after a year of nursing there is nothing arousing about the ol’ milk bags. At least not for me, anyway. I’m sure Eug has a different take on the matter. So, the combination of the NNR (New Nipple Reality) and the op-art stripitude made me burst out laughing. Problem is, I really like the sweater. I want to keep it. I just dunno if I have the cojones to wear it in public and watch parents hush small children as they point and stare. (Ha, ha! More ‘point’ references! I’m a *hoot* tonight, aren’t I?)  Some other stuff I wanted to jot down: I was doing some of my patented insanity-cleaning this weekend, in preparation for the big shindig in a few weeks. I was kind of amusing myself by scrubbing every minuscule crevice of the high chair. I was taking it to the limit – had it torn apart, was going at it with toothpicks and Lysol wipes and you name it – all in an effort to avoid tackling a larger project. But then, that’s what being a lazy perfectionist is all about, right? I could be proud of this ridiculous little task that I had completed to perfection. What else mattered?  Then I remembered a story from my youth. One of the friends I had in college and a person for whom I will always have an unmitigated fondness is Steve Grover. (Steve-o, if you ever see this, drop me a line, buddy.) I met Steve when he began dating one of my girlfriends, I believe. We all just fell in love with him in a total big-brother kind of way. (But Steve was a handsome devil, too. Don’t think that just because we loved him platonically that he wasn’t a charmer.) Anyway, Steve’s parents had had him when they were older, so by the time Steve was a young adult, he often had the homestead to himself as his parents were away – vacationing, I think. Anyway, there wasn’t a thing Steve wouldn’t do for you if you were in a jam, and so when I got a call from him wondering if I could come over and help him clean the house before his mom got home, I didn’t hesitate. We went about picking up and cleaning up, and I found myself doing the dishes at the kitchen sink. The blender was dirty, and so into the soapy water it went. I was having an IMPOSSIBLE time unscrewing the bottom of the blender. It was stuck, and mightily so. I think my cursing and sweating attracted Steve’s attention.  Steve said “Whoa - what are you trying to do there, Missy?” with genuine bewilderment. I said “I’m trying to get the blender apart so I can clean it!” He said incredulously “It doesn’t  come  apart, you nimrod!” For just a second, he gave me pause. Did he have some kind of weird blender with a fixed bottom? Then I took my rightful place in the pantheon of knowledgeable housefraus-to-be and shot back with certainty “Of COURSE it does, you nimrod!” And at that moment, years of accumulated crust on the bottom of that blender gave way. I held the separate pieces aloft for Steve’s inspection. “Well, I’ll be damned…” he mumbled.   When I asked him how it was possible that he never learned that a blender came unscrewed to be cleaned, he informed me that his mother never used the blender and had always made him do his own dishes. Hence, he assumed it was one big, fixed contraption. He then informed me that the fossilized yuck I was seeing on the blender parts was the result of an almost-daily milkshake habit he’d had for years, starting in junior high! I still get the heebie-jeebies over that. Steve, if you’re out there, I hope you’re treating your blender right.  OK, one last thing in an already-too-long entry. I read this piece of abridged poetry in a magazine and it was so lovely yet melancholy that I had to save it, somehow. Instead of hanging on to the stupid scrap of paper, I figured I would simply type it here to share. Hopefully the author is forgiving of things like minor copyright infringement. After all, my heart’s in the right place. Here it is:  The Fare by Molly Peacock  When I popped your pincher clip-on earrings in a plastic bag with your perfume and pushed it into the hands of the mortician, I never thought I’d hear your words from the coffin, “Take my earrings off! I’ve had them on all day, for God’s sake!” But now you’ve had them on five days – and the sharp stab of a femininity you couldn’t stand for more than two hours in life is eternal – you’ll never relax. Oh, please, do it for me. I can’t stand the thought of you pained by vanity forever. Reach your cold hand up to each ear, and pull, and hear the click of each clasp unhinging – this effort could take you days, I know…I know you’re dead. But let it be your last effort – to change my mistake and be dead in comfort. Rest…rest…let the earrings go. They’ll fall like tokens to the bottom of the casket, return fare fallen to the pit of a coat’s satin pocket.  Maybe it's weird that that appeals to me, but I say that poem is the verbal equivalent of watching little ripples in a still surface of water move gently away from you. Peaceful. Wistful.

      June 11, 2004  I love naptime. There’s no other word for it than “delicious”. OK, so now I can tell you what I won on eBay the other day – oh, hell – why don’t I just show you?  OK, I haven't yet figured out how to use the Photoblogging thing to post inside an entry, so I'll add the dress pictures above. More proof of how I struggle to get even these paltry scraps published for you. Let's try this:   urlLink    Cutest. Dress. Ever.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Cutest. Dress. Ever. Backside.&nbsp; urlLink     Eeee! My muddled attempt worked! Isn’t it the cutest thing you have ever seen in your life? OK, maybe you think you’ve seen something cuter. Fuck you, you’re wrong. Just nod and smile when I’m out on a limb like this, OK? I know, I know - it's a little costume-y, and not really *me* at all, but for some reason I fell totally, irrationally in love with it. That dark blood-red fabric with those lillies. Hoo. When I called Tracy after the auction ended, she answered the phone with “Well, congraaaatulations…” to which I replied “Technically, you don’t  know  I won the dress.” She shot back with “I didn’t just meet you ten minutes ago, you know.” Touché, ma soeur.   Anyway, Ray Charles died yesterday and I had a good long boo-hoo session over it last night. I loved that man and always will. Between the loss of President Reagan and now Ray Charles, I’ve got a major case of unattractive sniffling. I’d like to put on some of my RC collection, but I’m afraid I will just sit and bawl. Especially over anything like his rendition (and the best version ever made, it is) of “America The Beautiful”. See, I’m getting all weepy. Must change subject.  OK, how’s about this for a transition: Heather and I have long joked about the searches people do to arrive at our sites. Heather’s had some real doozies, while mine have been limited to poor SOBs searching for answers to their inaccessible boot drive problems. But I got a really good one just the other week – somebody searched on the words “pellucid knickers” to get to my site! And it was on the ARABIC version of Google’s web site, too! Good Lord! I’m not even sure I know what they’re looking for when they’re hunting down pellucid knickers! I mean, why not just type “see-through undies”? (Oh,   that   should get me some mighty funny search hits somewhere down the line, I’m sure!) I take this as further proof that the Muslim culture is mightily repressed. Hell, I’m a  Catholic , too. We know all about repressed.  So we’re having a giant party on the tenth of July. I know what you’re thinking: “Wait, that date is vaguely familiar…Hey! Isn’t that Xanthe’s birthday?” Well, yes. Yes, it is. But it just worked out that way. You see, we’d been missing a bunch of friends and family we don’t get to see often enough, and of course we’re total deadbeats about having parties in the first place because I am admittedly such a giant, inept DUD of a hostess, and we figured that the 4th of July would be a great time – not too far away, but not too close so we could get ready…but then (I’m going for the longest run-on sentence, ever, in case you were wondering…how am I doing so far?)  we also figured that it’s already mid-June and people probably have plans for the holiday. So we did some spot polling and found that if it wasn’t the 10th, it would have to be, like,  August . So it’s a belated Fourth of July party. The upside is that it’ll *feel* like a big to-do for Xanthe’s first, and that will make Eug’s wonderful mama happy, I hope. So if you’re reading this and you’re coming to my party, YOU ARE STRICTLY VERBOTEN TO BRING BIRTHDAY GIFTS. I will keep a special container of potato salad out in the sun all day on the 9th just for anyone who brings unauthorized presents. Don’t push me, people.  And it’s going to be a humongous party, by the sounds of it. Eug was teasing me about it last night after I got off the phone with a dear friend who I haven’t seen in *ages* and who will probably be able to come to our party. He smirked and said “Adding to your already GIGANTIC active circle of friends, are we?” When I expressed indignation, he insisted that I have more friends than any human being he’s ever known. Which is probably true and possibly why I do such a shitty job of keeping up with all of them and why I occasionally even have to divest myself of friendships. He went on to hee-haw that we’re lucky a whole bunch of my friends don’t live within driving distance, or we’d have to take out a loan to feed everybody! I should be flattered, but I just feel heckled. Which wouldn’t be so bad if I had something about which I could heckle him. But, as usual, I am drawing a blank when it comes to return fire.  OK, gotta go. Gonna try to squeeze in some weight lifting before the spawn arise. (“Arise, spawn, ariiiise!”)

      June 7, 2004  I got a massage tonight, and it was heaven. Heaven, I tell you. Hot oil and heating pads and calming music and strong hands. For an hour! Followed by an ice-cold bottle of water, which I think is the nicest finishing touch on the part of the masseuse. So, needless to report, I’m in a good mood.  I don’t have my shmancy new stroller yet, and I’m getting a wee bit antsy. Tracy, ever the smartass, asked me if I’d won the Lotto when I told her I bought one. Don’t worry, there, best bud – if I ever win, you know you’ll KNOW it, because I’ll pull up in something chauffeured to take your ass shopping. Speaking of shopping, I am going to bid on what has to be the most precious thing ever sold on eBay. I’d give you a link, but I am suspicious by nature, and until I have this sucker in the bag, I’m not publicizing, OK? Don’t take it personally.  I got 99% of the shrub trimming done in the front of the house and now only the top of the tallest shrub, which must be cut from the roof overhang, and some marginal cleanup remain. Of course, in the days and weeks preceding the annual shrub-cut, the “bush trimming” jokes were flying fast and furious around the ol’ homestead. Our humor has never been highbrow, sadly. And procrastinate though I might, when I actually get around to doing that chore, it feels good, because you spend a long time wielding the electric shrub trimmer like a poor man’s Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and it’s vaguely cathartic. I thought for a moment that I should have Eug take a picture. It seemed like a good thing to maybe kick off some photo-blogging.   Of course, even during tedium, my paranoia is in full-gear. I was bent over pulling a weed and a car drove by, ringing with laughter. Now, they could have been laughing about *anything*. I know that. But in that nano-second, I had this vision of myself looking like the bent over fat-ass wooden cutouts that old people and hillbillies seem to favor as lawn decoration. It almost spoiled the high I was getting from maniacal, non-stop work. If that sounds weird to you, it’s because you haven’t been a stay-at-home mother, have you? Full-time SAHMs know exactly what the fuck I am talking about: the giddy thrill of working on something for which you can see tangible results (anything that meets this sole qualification, even cleaning toilets, fer crissakes…) without being encumbered by small children and their excrement (“MAMA! I’m pooooopy AGAIN!”). You just never want to stop, because then you know it’s back to that time-has-no-meaning quality of days that you’re experiencing 99% of the time.  Let’s see, what else do I have to tell you? The house in Brighton was interesting, to be sure. That glass hallway was stunning, if in need of some repair. But ol’ Lois (the original owner of our current home) was a card-carrying member of the Olympic Housecleaning Team, and our house still enjoys residual benefits from her hard labor. (No thanks whatsoever to me, I assure you.) And seeing another house that was not quite as well-cared for really brought the appreciation for our own back into sharper relief. And then there was that ri-DI-culous rosewood floor. Gak. The house is overpriced by about 65K. If it were priced at 270-275K, we’d have to weigh it seriously. But not at $339,900. They are clearly smoking some very good crack up there.  But our house is better suited to a pool, and anyone who knows me knows that this is my great lust in life. And a pool would be the shizzle in our backyard. Sadly, those awful McMansions behind us would preclude any possibility of skinny-dipping. So maybe the Brighton house would be better, after all. That’s it – buy a house based solely on which would make a better nude swimming site. I am the very soul of practicality, no?  Heather and I were talking about the mirror images of each other that we are, in many ways. She is wildly liberal and describes herself as agnostic on more than one occasion, while I…well, you know. I am the opposite of those things. But your feeble attempts to pigeonhole either of us into neat little stereotypes will fail,  ma petit cochon ! We defy easy description, my counterpart and I. Let me get back to the most recent example: issues of nudity. We were discussing being naked in front of your kids and bathtime and underwear and nudity in general. For a raging liberal, Heather is surprisingly…modest…in this arena. I…well, I am the opposite. And, par for the course, we had both our points of total agreement and polar opposite disagreement in the never-to-be-forgotten, should’ve-been-included-in-a-book thread on underwear preferences (which I just had to take 20 minutes to seek out and re-read from our old boards – so funny). Heather, I have to thank you again for giving me terms like “yoni” and “free-bushing”. God damn, (…kilogram, how do you figger, I don’t wanna be called yo…) you make me laugh.  Enough for tonight. Gotta snooze. More later, loved ones.

      June 3, 2004  Happy Anniversary to us! Nine years of marriage today, people! Believe me when I say that I thank God every day of my life for my husband. He is simply the most awesome man on the planet, and for some inconceivable reason, he’s in love with   ME  . Go figure.  OK, before I forget – have y’all noticed that you can leave comments under each post? See where every single entry says “0 Comments” at the bottom? Well, you can click that “0 Comments” and it’ll take you to a screen where you can leave a comment about the entry. You know, just a little something to make me feel loved, sniff sniff. If it’s not too much trouble…  We’re going to look at  urlLink that house  on Saturday, and I have this mild feeling of panic about it. Sort of like I’m really hoping not to love this house. Is that weird? Probably. But I’m very possessive about my current (and super-cool) dwelling, and I can’t imagine handing the keys over to anyone else, damn it. But then I imagine that these people probably feel the same way, on some level. Anyway, like I said – it’s highly unlikely that this will be a house to make me pack my shit. But you never can tell.  I’m finally selling off a bunch of stuff on eBay, too. Been meaning to do this forever. I just have too much stuff for a house with absolutely no storage, and the one place I store my shit is the workroom, which is probably going to become a bedroom in the near future. So something’s gotta give. We are parting with some things that we genuinely like, too. Eug has given me the green light to sell some of his rare and fabulous toys from his childhood, and I have decided to part with a few of my sentimental favorites, too. But for right now I am getting my feel wet by listing some smaller things, until I get the feel for the selling aspect of things. I really wish I had some temperature-controlled storage, but I don’t and that’s that.   My book collection is starting to seriously outgrow my shelving, too. I had put myself on a bit of a hiatus from book-buying for a while, but I’m back in top form, LOL. And the homeschooling prep doesn’t help matters any, either. Maybe I’ll get Henry a carpenter mentor early in life.  That’s all for now – make my day and leave me a wee comment, OK?

      May 31, 2004  I tore through that Perrotta book – finished in in something like fifteen hours, and that included one night’s sleep (albeit a shitty one, given that I couldn’t put that book down). It was a fun read. Not great literature – more like a good, sarcastic ‘beach read’ with some clever turns of phrase. The characters were such fucking sleazeballs, though. Part of me gets the feeling that this Perrotta guy thinks that everyone’s a closet scumbag of this caliber, and that we’re all just hiding it in one fashion or another. Everyone who’s not an adulterer is portrayed as having a stick so firmly up their ass that they have no poetry whatsoever in their soul. Even the panty-sniffer comes off better in this book. His ‘heroes’ and ‘heroines’ are utterly devoid of any nobility at all. It’s disconcerting – it seems the author thinks that people are almost  incapable  of moral rectitude and an enjoyable life, simultaneously.   I also noticed the oh-so-typical Catholic-bashing present in those teeny, tiny ways. Any mention of Catholicism – no matter how tangential – is always firmly connected to spectacular moral failings. The lurid descriptions of the priest who runs off with Mrs. So-and-So. Let’s not forget the vivid imagery of how Mrs. So-and-So would open her mouth suggestively for Communion and give the altar boys – and obviously, the priest, too – major boners. It’s just so fucking OLD, already. Talk about a tired-ass theme. UPBRINGING IN OR CONNECTION TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH CAN ONLY RESULT IN A TWISTED PSYCHE AND UNUSUALLY DEPRAVED BEHAVIOR. WHEN THE STIFLING WEIGHT FINALLY BECOMES TOO MUCH TO BEAR, SAID EX-CATHOLIC WILL THROW OFF THE MEDEIVAL CONSTRAINTS OF AN OUTDATED ‘FAITH’ AND PURSUE ALL MANNER OF LECHERY AND DEBAUCHERY WITH THE SINGLE-MINDEDNESS OF LANCE ARMSTRONG IN THE TOUR DE FRANCE.  Right? Isn’t this what every fucking book, news article, talk show, etc. would have us believe in a million subtle, tiny, terrible ways? Puh-leez. I KNOW the Church commands me to love you, but first let me say “Fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you.” There. I feel better now.  Let’s see, what else? I’m reading Ann Coulter’s “Slander” (and her other one, “Treason”, will be next). Talk about a book to give a liberal a hemorrhage! Delightful. God bless her. I haven’t had so much fun reading a political book in eons, much less read one that filled me with   hope!   I’m digging it, needless to say.  Henry’s going through nothing short of a verbal explosion. You should hear this kid talk, now. Wow. He puts together the most amazing and creative thoughts. His latest thing is to give me a kiss followed by a description of said kiss. So, if he’s just eaten a peanut, I get the kiss followed by the words “A peanut kiss!” If he’s a little drooly around the mouth, it’s “A gooey kiss!” You get the idea. Where he got the idea to do this, I dunno. But it clearly gives us both great pleasure. He’s identifying the rarest forms of heavy-construction equipment, ever. The kid can ID a grader, a paver, an excavator – anything! – a mile away and with only a second to glance at it. We drove him by some spots where we knew there’d be heavy equipment today and taped him chattering away about the “MACHINES AT WORK!!”, as he always hollers.  Xanthe is doing this funny thing where she’ll gesture for things she wants you to do to entertain her. One of her favorites is the bubbada-bubbada-bubbada you can do with a finger and your lower lip. So when she wants you to do it for her, she’ll do it ever-so-briefly and then, literally, NOD in your direction. Like “OK, now, your turn. And make it snappy.” She does this with all kinds of things, like silly head shakes and raspberries, etc. And she is so fucking cute I could DIE, sometimes. She is just so lovely. So sue me – I’m puffed-up over my spawn and I can’t help it. She’s just cool. She’s managing to scoot on her back all over Hell’s half-acre, but still no attempt to crawl, stand or…God forbid!…walk. But I’m still content to wait and let her move at her own pace.  I’ve got that house-hunting itch, again. We’re going to check out a house on Saturday. Want to take a look at it?  urlLink Here it is!  Now, chances are this is NOT the house that would get us to move. See all those ‘recent updates’? I have a feeling these people thought they were doing a good thing by tearing out some old (and probably really fucking cool) stuff and ‘upgrading’ it. I’ll bet they think they’re going to make a tidy profit, too. But the house is too weird to be even remotely mainstream – I dunno if you can tell, but there’s an entirely glass hallway that links the living part of the house to the bedroom(s) part of the house – sort of like walking through a giant terrarium. Nature all around you, and nothing but some glass between you and it. So, it’s weird, and weird does NOT appeal to most people. Now, see that goofy, lacquered-looking wood floor in the living area? That’s rosewood. Now you *know* that wasn’t cheap. But do you also see how shitty it looks in the context of that house? It should be in a waaaay more traditional setting. So what you have is people who have no feel whatsoever for the architectural components of the house making ugly design decisions, and expecting the potential new owners to just shit their pants with delight over their lousy taste. One more example – the bathroom faucets are all wrong. Did you notice? They’re gold, first off, Wrong, wrong, sooo wrong. And they have that totally colonial look to them.   So here’s what I say: Beyond the possible fresh coat of paint (unless it’s sloppily applied – leave it unpainted if you’re going to do a half-assed job, OK?) and some neutral carpet…if you’re going to put your house on the market…PARTICULARLY if your house is unique, architecturally-speaking…do us all a favor and leave well enough alone. I can guarantee you that the new owners would much prefer to update old kitchen cabinets, bathroom fixtures, flooring etc. with their OWN choices and pay a little less for the house. Unless you’re in one of those ugly McMansions. Then I don’t care and you can do whatever the fuck you want. But leave the cool houses alone, for crissakes. I don’t want to pay for your ugly-ass rosewood floors that look like they belong in some wanna-be-upscale steakhouse. Still, I’m afraid I’m going to fall in love. I’ll keep you posted.

      July 25, 2004  When I say that I am busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest, I know what you’re thinking. It’s OK, I’ve even thought it about myself sometimes. You’re thinking “Oh,   come on  . You’re a stay-at-home mother. How busy could you possibly be? You have all fucking day to get your stuff done, little missy. You’ll find sympathy between shit and syphilis in the dictionary, thankyouverymuch.”  Like I said, I’ve even thought it myself sometimes, when I am feeling particularly low and discombobulated. I look around my chaotic household with the tangible weight of failure visible on me from 50 yards. I start sentences with “If only I did ( fill in blank with anything related to faddish time-management trends or stimulant ingestion ), I could get things straightened away around here.” And then I go on treading water…barely.  So what exactly am I doing all day, anyway? Well, my first instinct is to say I don’t know or mumble something like “oh, the usual…” and trail off because I’ve stopped looking at the most mundane, everyday tasks as what they are: work assignments. For some reason, I don’t get any credit hours for those courses. Feeding The Children 101 is actually a 5 credit hour course, with lab! I won’t ever say with a straight face that I do any of the domestics well, much less with anything resembling elan, but g*ddammit, somehow they get done, even if it’s just half-assed. By me.  I was looking over my list tonight of the stuff I have ahead for the week and it flashed on me that I really wanted to blog about this because sometimes I get the feeling that the people I love wonder just why the hell I can’t seem to manage to remember to send a birthday card, or haven’t returned a phone call in three weeks, or when I am going to accomplish any one of a thousand little tasks other people have outlined for me. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re thinking, “It’s just this one little thing! Why can’t she pull it together to be able to do this one little thing?!” What they’ve forgotten is that I have a growing throng of people that expect (and in some cases, rightly deserve) certain things from me. Add up all of their “just this little things” and I’ve got a homework list quite literally a mile long.   My list tonight is part grocery list, part reminders, part weekly schedule. I jotted down an unholy mish-mash of stuff to purchase tomorrow or later in the week. In fact, I just remembered one more thing we’re nearly out of as I typed those words and scribbled it on my list: cotton balls. I took a quick look through my Eating- for -LIFE cookbook and added the ingredients for a couple of recipes that should take Eug and me through a few nights’ worth of dinners. Then I have to think about what the kids  will  eat versus what the kids  should  eat. This alone is worthy of a chapter, but let’s just say that in the pantheon of timeless maternal struggles, this is right up near the top. OK, so I’ve compiled a rough list that should do the trick. To that I add the things I have to get done this week, preferably tomorrow, truth be told. I have at least five overdue thank-yous for very nice things we have received from loved ones that absolutely deserve a proper acknowledgement. I am a *big* believer in a proper thank you. Major high priority – and it’s killing me that I have a batch undone for, like, three weeks now. Ugh. Money to deposit in Xanthe’s account. It’s sure as hell not accruing any interest waiting to make the short trip to the credit union. Double ugh.  OK, next thing – gotta get laundry done. This is another thing I can do while losing some sleep to blog – hover over the laundry. Poor Eug will have nothing to wear to work if I let it go. The machines are humming as we speak, and I really need to stay up late enough to get the batch that’s currently in the washer out so I can hang it up to dry tonight, rather than waiting until tomorrow to hang them, because it’s all of Eug’s work clothes and they take a while to air-dry. And while I’m sorting tonight, I see a pair of Eug’s work pants that have a seam coming apart. I need to mend that before it’s a goner. Oh, the mending! I have a pile of it that has been waiting for my hands’ attention for months. I try to sneak in items here and there to mend, but wait…I have to take this one to the fabric store to get some thread that will match, because everything I have is so off-color it will look like a hillbilly patch job. I put it in a plastic bag and toss it in my car, so when I finally get to the fabric store four months later, hopefully I will remember to bring that particular bag – of which there are always several in my car – in with me to match. Then there’s the items that if I don’t mend NOW, my kids will outgrow them in a blink. Needless to say, the items in the mending pile that are intended to grace *my* back may never see the light of day again.  Marching past a few items on the list, my eye lands on “sort kids’ clothes”. I received two giant bags of wonderful hand-me-downs for Henry from my sister-in-law, as well as two giant bags of clothing being returned to me that I had lent to her for her daughter that is now outgrown and coming back. These will all have to be sorted and put into storage, which happens to be at the back of my workroom, which is sort of my substitute basement. Just moving the stuff in front of the storage containers so I can get to them will take fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes that will have to happen when the kids are napping or Eug is home, because this is on the end of the house where my aggressive dog lives and my kids aren’t freely allowed. So unless I want to leave them unattended, that will have to wait. And wait it has! The bags have graced my hallway cabinet for over a week, already. The workroom itself is in desperate need of a thorough cleaning. A lot of stuff got haphazardly stashed in there before the party, and it needs to come back out and be properly put away or handled.   As far as my schedule goes, I am taking the kids to see my sister and her kids tomorrow. They haven’t seen their cousins – outside of the party, and that’s hardly ‘quality’ time – in at least six weeks. I haven’t seen my sister one-on-one since her surgery for mass removal from her breast, for God’s sake. I’ll have to bring my dumbbells and literally do my workout as we talk, because even if we stay for just a couple of hours, the kids will sleep on the drive home (damned car rides always do that) and I will have no nap time during which I can accomplish something outside their presence. I’ll need to somehow get the grocery shopping done with two (by then) cranky kids in tow and come home to placate them with something while I cook. After the kids go to bed, I have a walking schedule with my neighbor Jen that takes us out right after the kids go to bed M-W-F. My doctor wants me to lose weight, and as God as my witness I WILL. The right way. The hard way.  Tuesday morning the Terminix man comes bright and early. The carpenter ants are unusually lively this year. I want them to D-I-E. My bug man tells me that he’d really like us all to leave the house for a couple of hours while he does his thing, ‘cause he’s breaking out the big guns, toxin-wise. Um, OK. I guess I can take the kids out for some fresh air and exercise at the park. (Which means I will be packing the car the night before with umpteen sippy cups, changes of clothing, sunscreen, blankies and diapers because I will be in a mad rush to feed the kids breakfast, change them out of their pjs and carry them out the door before the bug man comes at 8:30am, which is the only time he could squeeze us in.) Not such a bad thing – that’s always on my to-do list, anyway: Get The Kids Out And About For Healthful Childhood. Except that Xanthe is at the age where she’s not happy sitting in your lap and she is still a long way off from figuring out how to crawl, much less walk. So park time will consist of soothing Xanthe while Henry lodges himself in the sandbox and refuses to come out. I will extricate him by force when it is time to leave and dodge the flailing limbs in an attempt to buckle him into the stroller. He will magically deposit exactly three tablespoons of sand in both the stroller and his car seat, despite my attempt to shake him off thoroughly.   Wednesday this week calls for my lower body workout, which requires a visit to the Rec Center (trumpet flourish and a choral Hallelujah, please). My sole sane spot. Let nothing get in the way, and nobody’s gonna get hurt. I don’t wanna have to hurt anybody, here. Oh, and I have to remember to schedule a portrait sitting for the kids – Xanthe’s first birthday pictures are overdue. (Want to imagine what a fiasco that’s going to be? Wrangling them into clothes they must not wrinkle or soil and THEN TRYING TO GET THEM TO SIT STILL AND SMILE?) Thursday I have to go up to my parents’ house to help them with the family garage sale, and that’s going to take the whole day, because they’re almost an hour’s drive (one way) away. Plus, I’m dying to dig into some more homeschool prep and get Henry doing some art projects this week, as he’s really taken a shine to the bathtub crayons and fingerpaints he got from his Auntie P for Christmas lately. More planning and prep, even if it’s just clearing a safe spot for him to fling non-toxic paints at a big piece of craft paper. Oh, yeah – and aren’t I supposed to clean house somewhere in all this? My sink has a funny smell and the carpeted rooms haven’t seen a vacuum since the morning of the party…now more than two weeks ago!  What else – things I need to sell on eBay, hair bows I need to practice making so I can maybe bring in a little extra income around here, exercise that needs to be done, books that need to be read to the kids, writing that needs to get written in their journals and baby books, bills and paperwork that need to be done, budgeting anew so we can maybe add on a bathroom to this house one day and giving Theo the little bit of extra attention he desperately deserves in the last few months of his life…these are but a scant few of the things tattooed on my mind. I’ve given up on the photo album project. Old pictures piled in shoeboxes, still in their envelopes from the drugstore developers…waiting to be slid into photo albums in some semblance of chronological order. I’ll think about that when the kids are gone and Eug has retired.  As for some of the pissy thoughts, there’s nothing you can think that I haven’t already considered myself. Things like “maybe you shouldn’t homeschool if you can’t rightly pull it together a little more neatly than this…” and “gee, maybe all this time you spend blogging could be put to better use!” Fuck you and fuck you, too. God help you should you dare say that shit to my face. Think it all you want - just don’t go thinking you’re original. Like I said, I’ve already considered my avenues for improvement and I believe myself to be pretty decent in the objective self-critique department. As far as homeschooling goes, it is not  a  goal. It is THE goal. I will drop  you  before I will drop it. And blogging is something I pay for in sleep hours, if you must know. I happen to have a physical need to read and write the way some people have a need for insulin injections.  I think I once again need to scale back. Set some ground rules, as it were. This is why I constantly try to keep people from sending us cards or gifts. It simply means that I will have to reciprocate, and I’d rather forego the cards and whatnot if it means I can cross one more thing off my list and my budget. I chopped off a few things to streamline my life a few months ago, and it helped. It hurt some people, but in the end I simply had to put them at the bottom of the priority list. I need to simplify my relationships above all and get people used to the idea that their most fulfilling contact with me may very well be through this blog! (LOL – OK, you assholes. I know this is hardly a news flash for some of you.) The job thing is getting a lot more complicated, because the kinds of jobs I could easily get that would conform to my schedule pay very nearly nothing at all. This means that I am going to have to invest some training hours in a more creative route - leaving me with even less time for niceties, unfortunately.  I could go on writing like this endlessly, I’m sure. Let me end this diatribe with a simple warning: Never assume a stay-at-home mother…or any woman holding a household together, for that matter…isn’t working her  ass  off to keep it all on track. One day she might drop what she’s doing just long enough to bite your fucking head off, tootsie pop. Excuse me while I go empty the washer, now. And if you want to meet for lunch, I’m thinking I’m open in about twenty-eight years.  P. S. One unrelated thing: Tonight I saw what has to be one of the most mangled misspellings, ever. Some poor sonofabitch was trying to write “Etch-a-Sketch”, but their oxygen-starved brain could only manage “ech escech”. That is so stupid it is actually drooling. Scary!

      July 19, 2004  I’ve been dying to write all weekend, but I was busy. Plus, I turned 33 this weekend! Not that we make a big hoo-hah out of birthdays around here, though – it was just a relaxing day spent with the family. My Mountain Buggy Urban Double stroller in chocolate brown arrived and that fucker is   silky smooth  , let me tell you. I never thought I could say with a straight face that a stroller could be worth $549 AND a nearly two month wait…but it is. It’s not a flashy stroller, but oh my goodness is that s’umbitch functional. Hoowhee. So that made my birthday happy, indeed. Henry even got a glimpse of the MBUD in the back as we were getting in the car and he let out a long, contented sigh as he cooed “Aaaaaahhhh! It’s my stwoh-wer!” We did go out and give the new wheels a spin by checking out downtown Northville and browsing in the kiddie consignment shop. Is it pathetic that what makes me happiest on my special day is getting a stroller and a few new clothes for the kids? Yeah, that’s what I thought.   I thought I’d give you guys an update on the kidlets today, since technically my blog *is* named Modern  Motherhood . I keep meaning to write to the kids in their journals, but instead I write here. (I started a journal for each baby when I first found out I was pregnant with them – true to form, Henry’s has about four times as many pages full as Xanthe’s does. The subsequent children get shortchanged, of course.) Perhaps the kids will be content to read the tale of their youth in these pages…once they’re old enough to read all my cussing, ha ha.  Xanthe, for all her developmental delays, is just starting to move and groove. She is now log-rolling with ease from stem to stern, which has me heaving a huge sigh of relief. To see concrete progress in the mobility arena feels sooooo good. Plus, she has this new move when she’s sitting up – it’s sort of like she’s using an invisible Sit ‘n’ Spin. She does a 360 simply by moving her legs. It’s kind of funny to watch.  And, OH! Is she fierce! (Deb, you cursed me when you laughed that having a girl would kick my ass. Don’t think I’ve forgotten or forgiven, either!) She’ll be sitting there, concentrating for all she’s worth on something, and God help you if you should distract her. She will, with evident disdain bordering on disgust, swat you away with intent to maim. Her pissy button is on a hair-trigger. She’s been even worse since we quit nursing completely. Her last night of boobage was July 15, 2004. I didn’t realize then that it would be her last night, but circumstances dictated that it would be the end. This was very good, because not knowing that it would be her last night meant that I didn’t get all stupidly sentimental about how she’s growing up and all that bullshit.  Anyway, it turned out to be her last night because the little shit kept biting me! Not that she’d never bitten before, mind you, but this was different. You see, I had her cut down to one last nursing session right before bed and possibly one during the night if she woke up at the butt-crack of dawn and I was desperate to get her back to sleep with a minimum of fuss. Nothing else. So I’m nursing her that night, and the little sucker bit me for all she was worth. I hollered at her so loudly that she stopped, but unlike other times when she has either laughed in the face of my pain or burst into noisy tears from fright, this time she just stopped and looked so still and serious that for a moment I saw a glimpse of my beloved daughter as a grown adult. Just for a split second on that solemn face.  That night she did wake at 2 or 3 in the morning, and I, only 20% awake, whipped out a boob so I could get back to Dreamland ASAP. And before she even latched on,   she bit me again!   That’s when I *knew* she was ready to stop nursing for good. Not so much for the pain of biting me, but if she, probably only 20% awake, herself, bit me as her first instinct rather than latched on for comfort and sustenance, then it most definitely was time to move on.   Anyway, it’s also a very good thing because I’d been reading about how nursing longer is tied to developmental delays for some children. (All you breastfeeding Nazis can suck my left tit if you get all huffy over the thought that there could be *any* downsides to nursing.) It’s basically that for some babies, the act of nursing when it’s really no longer the main source of nutritional sustenance can keep them…well, more  babyish . They’re not as inclined to get up and grow up, as it were. (And you can suck my right tit if you think I’m some kind of crazed, pushy, oh-my-God-my-kid-won’t-get-into-Harvard mother. I’m not. I want my children to develop a skill when  they  are ready for it, not when I or someone else wants them to.) So it’s the right time for us. I did my AAP-approved one calendar year. Now, where do I go to get my fucking gold star or the tee-shirt that announces to the world that I’m a better mother than the rest of you? Ha! Just kidding. I hate those ‘Mother Superior’ types.  In short, my little Xanthe Celeste is frighteningly like me. Except cuter, thank goodness.   Henry is going through a phase where everything about him is L-O-U-D. Alarming decibel levels are the norm in our home these days. He’ll burst into what passes for song in his mind with no warning or provocation. It can really give you a scare if you’re driving, let me tell you. No amount of shushing seems to be taking effect. Of course, when the hollering seems more intentional than accidental, in he goes for a time-out. I will not have a boor for a child. The world is already full up with boors.  But then he is also charming and suave with an ease that frequently raises my eyebrows. He is navigating the seas of flirtation and finding himself an accomplished sailor. Last night after I had put Xanthe to sleep and there was some available real estate in my lap, he cocked his head to the side and said, most saucily “Do you want to schnoogle me, Mama?” You bet your sweet bippy I do, little guy. Mmm, mmm.  We’ve got a very relaxing routine, our family. We generally come home and, unless the kids are wildly past their bedtime, we’ll run a hot bath and get them both scrubbed and jammi-fied. Then I schnoogle Xanthe on my lap with a sippy and some books for a couple of minutes. She goes down to bed, and Henry moves over from papa’s lap to mine. Luckily, Eug does not take this personally. He understands that a woman’s comforts can be quite alluring. Plus, I have a midsection built like a pillow. Climb aboard.  Anyway, I should tell you about two nice little things that happened to me yesterday. I had misplaced a wad of cash and checks Xanthe had received for her birthday. I vaguely recalled putting them “somewhere safe” before the onslaught of the party, but the particulars of that location were no longer in the database, I’m afraid. I looked all day long with increasing anxiety. Finally, at the end of the night I was folding laundry in the hall, praying to Saint Anthony and Mary and Christ Himself for mercy and help. I was just meditating on Christ, and His benevolence…and I got this shiver down my back. I stood bolt upright and thought “God? God! Did I put it in the Bible?” Sure as shit. Don’t tell ME there’s no God. I never put stuff in the Bible, either, so I can’t believe I remembered. I honestly don’t even recall the act of putting it in there in the first place. Of course, I swore I heard God’s voice say only  half -jokingly to me “Well, if you’d only crack the Bible a little more often than once a month, Michelle, maybe you’d have found it sooner!” I believe God is a bit of a smartass and it only makes me love Him more.  I also had another intuitive moment last night. We had stopped by Borders for the first time in a while. I had filled out an application for a job there a few weeks ago, and not surprisingly, that fact came to mind as I browsed. I suddenly thought “Wouldn’t it be funny if I was in here shopping while someone at the store was calling my house to leave me a message about a job?” Sure as shit. In fact, I have to finish up now so I can call her back and let her know that yes, I am  very  interested in a job. As always, I’ll keep you posted. Wish me luck!

      July 15, 2004  &nbsp;  It’s been a banner day, for sure. I had a bazillion things I wanted to talk about, but I’ve either forgotten them already or decided against grousing about them. But I have a delightful new web site to share with you:  urlLink Now and Zen!  It’s a bunch of the funniest t-shirts I’ve seen in ages. I hunted this website down because our local chi-chi department store has a bunch of these t-shirts in kiddie sizes with the cutest sayings. I bought one for a friend’s baby’s birthday that says simply "Trust me. I do this all the time." The web site doesn’t seem to have much beyond adult size tees on plain white tees, though. Bummer. My favorites are the ones that say "I’m the man from Nantucket" and "If we aren’t supposed to eat animals, why are they made out of meat?" C’mon – you   knew   I was a sick bastard. There’s no pretending otherwise.   Now let me ask you this: What’s up with this ridiculous fashion trend to have pants that are way too long for you that flare out at the bottom…and then wear them with heels? This is a cheeseball ‘70s nightmare, folks! I know what all those dumbass fashion pages say: "It  elongates  the leg!" No, it doesn’t. It just makes you look like you have no idea where to take pants to get them hemmed. This ‘look’ has been around way too long, now. It must die soon, for the good of mankind. Besides, the feet of all the lamebrained fashion victims out there must be  killing  them.   Not that I think my ‘look’ is any better. No, no. In all honesty, my profile is more and more Weeble-esque these days, a sad fact made only more plain by my insistence on wearing capri jeans that snug up around my rotund midsection and narrow down unflatteringly near my vein-ridden calves. I know this; you don’t have to point it out. Sheesh.   I think I’m all out of lowbrow observations for the evening. Best wishes to all of my faithful blog friends!

      July 8, 2004  The most horrific thing happened to me tonight while I was cleaning for the party. I was cleaning Henry’s room top to bottom – much more than the usual dusting, vacuuming and change of bedding. This was more of a Full Scale Assault cleaning. My eye landed on his cloth diaper pail and for some reason that is still a mystery to me, I opened it. Now, allow me to explain: I have not cloth-diapered in   eons  . Hence, I have not given the cloth diaper pail any thought in   eons  . I stopped cloth-diapering when I was newly pregnant with Xanthe, as I was on a hair-trigger gag reflex, and I have never looked back. Oh, I toy with starting again, but it would have to be with Baby #3. You see, after less than 12 hours wearing disposables, Henry lost his mind when anyone tried to put a cloth on him. OK, I exaggerate – it wasn’t 12 hours. But I did try to pick up cloth diapering again after Xanthe was born and Henry really did nearly lose his mind. I’m sure Xanthe would have the same reaction if a wad of cloth were to grace her bum at this point.  Anyway, I’ll bet you can guess what comes next. Someone…and I truly have no idea who it was…dumped a dirty disposable diaper in my cloth diaper pail. It never occurred to me that someone might do that, because to me, a cloth diaper pail looks *nothing* like a receptacle for disposable diapers. It’s even lined with what is basically a big, waterproof tote bag so you can take the dirty cloth diapers right to the washer in the sack. And said tote bag liner is PURPLE! How could someone think that you throw a disposable in there?  Now, if your mind hasn’t already ambled down this path, consider this: I have no fucking clue how long that diaper was in there. My pail has a tight seal, and so I truly never smelled a thing. Obviously, no one else ever did, either. My best guess is that sucker may have been growing organisms since the  last  party we had, which was for Xanthe’s baptism…  in November!!    And given that what I saw when I opened the lid would be the blue ribbon winner in any science fair competition (and Pfizer might want to sample some of it for their labs, to boot), suddenly the mystery of our constant, relentless illness all winter long becomes potentially clear. Hmmm…could it have anything to do with the HUMAN EXCREMENT growing unchecked next to my son’s head as he slept with only a thin wall of plastic to contain it? OK, OK…I realize the illnesses could’ve come from a lot of things. But it does give me pause. It also made me vow on my life to become not only a better housekeeper, but a more  suspicious  housekeeper. A Housekeeping Detective, if you will.  So the party is upon me and I have to skedaddle. I will be back with pictures for your amusement, I promise.

      July 4, 2004  How do you know when your child is too familiar with fast food establishments? When you’re reading the board book “Freight Train” by Donald Crews to your child, and said child insists on calling the author “McDonald Crews”. I find this highly amusing. So sue me.  Speaking of fast food (which I perpetually type as  fats  food on the first go – how’s THAT for a Freudian slip?), my Marshmallow Mom blog will be really moving again come July 12th. That’s when I am throwing myself back into the BFL race. So if you’d given up hope of me ever getting off my fat ass and doing something, don’t count me out yet. I really can’t wait to get back to weight-lifting. My arm muscles are still with me, and I get a giddy thrill out of imaging them getting ever more prominent.  We went to a party at Kim’s house yesterday and had such a fabulous time. I thought Henry would outright refuse to leave. You see, Jake now has a super-cool playground set with a giant…drumroll, please…sandbox in it! Henry thought he’d died and gone to heaven. The kid needs a sandbox, but all those affordable plastic ones are rather tiny. Henry would be happiest living on the beach, truth be told.  It’s funny how that plastic toy shit becomes thinkable after you have kids. I swore on my own head that I would not have that crap in my yard. Then a bunch of it was *given* to me, and so I rationalized: “Well, at least I didn’t  pay  for it.” Then you see how much fun your kid has with that stuff, and the next thing you know, you’re eyeballing things like  urlLink this  and wishing you had a buttload of money to blow so you could watch your spawn climb in and out all day long. It’s scary, I tell you.  Anyway, I’m just procrastinating by hanging out blogging. I really should be cleaning. Off I go.

      July 3, 2004  Yes, they really are. Now, I hardly pretend to be Einstein. Certainly there are folks out there who reveal handily that I am woefully under-informed on a wide variety of subjects when compared with a genuine intellect. But, really – is it too much to expect that every adult know the difference between “accept” and “except”? If you don’t readily understand the proper place to use the words “insure”, “ensure” and “assure”, then you need to crack a fucking book more often. Contractions, punctuation, word choice and basic grammar may bore you to tears, but wouldn’t you rather be bored for the short time needed to study hard and grasp the concepts instead of having people rightly think you’re a chucklehead for the rest of your life? Obviously, a whole bunch of people disagree with my take on this. Perhaps ignorance really *is* bliss.  So Henry was outside today, playing in the sprinkler and sporting a Speedo bathing suit (a hand-me-down from his cousins who are avid swimmers). He wasn’t too keen about wearing it, at first. He kept asking for “mine cozy pants” because he’d just skinned his knee that morning. At one point I must have referred to any of his comfier pants (read: sweats) as “cozy pants”, because he’s latched onto that something fierce. He believes cozy pants have the power not only to comfort, but to  heal . So naturally, a skinned knee called for cozy pants. I proceeded to ignore the requests in a chipper manner, because I had a concrete  need  to see that little butt in the Speedo before he outgrew it. And so outside to the sprinkler we went.   Now, I’d love to share pictures with you but then I thought about all the sick motherfuckers out there, and so I’m going to post the pics on my home forum. Those of you who know me either already have the link or you can feel free to  urlLink e-mail me  for the link. If I know who you are, I’ll be happy to share the family pics. So, go check ‘em out, ‘cause they’re a HOOT.  OK, we’re off to a fun party today. I dunno why, but I am strangely calm and yes, even lazy about preparing for my upcoming party. Call it over-confidence. Or maybe   I’m   the dumb one, after all.

      July 2, 2004  I’m not even going to spend a half-minute dwelling on sadness, OK? So let’s just move forward. My house is beginning to really shape up for this party. I will make it my mission in life to share some before and afters of my office in this post, because you simply will not believe it. (However, I will say that my office was and usually is the biggest shitpile in my house, bar none. So any cleaning effort I make will tend to have dramatic results.)   urlLink    Ugh.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Ugh, Part Deux.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Busy, but neat. Anybody wanna build me another bookshelf?&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Aaah. Much Better.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Emptiness = Loveliness.&nbsp; urlLink     See? And that’s *with* the crapload of stuff in the corner that I’m going to list on eBay after the party. (I will hide said crapload in the workroom the day of the shindig, mais bien sur. So you’re not even seeing the final cleaned version.) My invitees are really going to think I’m June Cleaver reincarnated, but you and I will know the sordid truth, won’t we?  So far I know that 53 people are coming at some point during the day for the festivities, and I’m very excited. Thankfully, I talk to most of those people regularly, so I was able to ask point-blank if they’re coming. But if I’d had to rely on the old RSVP, I’d still be scratching my head wondering if I was going to have 2 or 200 show up. I’d like to piss and moan about how people don’t have the common decency to RSVP when asked, but I also know that I am right up there with all the other deadbeats when it comes to RSVP’ing to someone  else’s  event. Hence, I shall be casting no stones.  And the uber-gross doggy-fied sofa went out with the trash today. Hallelujah! That thing was a toxic nightmare. Plus, the TV room looks huge now. We’re going to set it up with video games galore for the older kidlets coming to the party who are too cool for stuff like kiddie pools and sprinklers.   And did I tell you I finally acquired the china I’ve been wanting for over ten years? Go  urlLink here  to check out the retro fabulousness of it. If you click on the little picture, you can see a close-up of how cool it is. I am now the proud owner of 12 cups and saucers, 12 bread plates, 12 salad plates and 8 dinner plates. So I need 4 more dinner plates and a few accessory pieces. The one I really want is the  urlLink 3-tier serving tray . Cool, no? I scooped it up on….where else?…eBay. And for a very nice price, too.  Oh, and my stroller is  almost  here. The cozy stroller inserts and the tire pump arrived today, but…sniff, sniff…no stroller. It’s shipping straight from Mountain Buggy, so who knows when that fucker will arrive. But I’ll take a picture of the sproggen sitting pretty in it and post it for your amusement.   Also of note: I have developed two new verbal tics. I can’t seem to stop myself from uttering the words “Good Lord!” at every turn. I was actually conscious of the fact that I was using it a lot and wondered to myself from whence I must’ve picked  that  one up. But I like it. It suits me, somehow. Second, I’ve taken to calling my son and my husband “Bub” or “Bubs” an awful lot. This perturbs Eug on some small level, to which I reply “Tough noogies, Bubs.”   OK, I should be in bed. Good night and Happy 4th to all of you.

      August 6, 2004  Henry’s manners are really coming along. He’s getting so much better at proffering a “please” or a “thank you” without having to be prompted, and it tickles me to see it happening. Of course, getting him to say it around other people is still an uphill battle, mostly because I think he just gets shy. But there’s nothing sweeter than when I get something for him and he replies “Thank you, mama!” in that enthusiastic baby voice of his. It just curls my toes with the sheer delight of it.  Not to imply that he isn’t a full-on toddler, of course. He is, like I previously mentioned, incredibly LOUD these days. Plus, he’s added reckless climbing and various  stunts  to his repertoire, all of which makes the popping of gray hairs on my head distinctly audible to anyone within a 50-foot radius. So far it has not even occurred to him to try to climb out of his crib, though – a fact for which I am incredibly grateful. I do not look forward to the day when I will have to implement a time-out without the handy-dandy baby cage that the crib can be.  He’s also ridiculously fascinated with my breasts. I could better understand this if I were still nursing Xanthe, but I’m not. (Hallelujah!) Because we so frequently bandied about the term “boobies” in front of him, he felt eminently comfortable using it. But then, somehow, “boobies” became “boo-boos”. He’ll point to my chest and say, “You got boo-boos, mama? You got boo-boos?” Yeah, yeah – laugh it up. It’s a real hoot when we’re standing in line at Costco and he outright fondles me while announcing loudly “Mama’s got BOO-BOOS!” I’m trying to be nonchalant while everyone in the vicinity is stifling fits of giggles.  Another hysterical thing: the other day I was sorting through Xanthe’s huge pile of shoes. (I can’t help myself – I buy ‘em cheap on clearance at Target and from the consignment shop in the hopes that I will never again spend $45 on a pair of Stride Rites only to have my kid outgrow them a scant two months later. Once was enough for that lesson to sink in.) So he’s watching me sort by size and he picks up a snazzy pair of hot-pink suede boots and says, “These boots are GORGEOUS!” Good heavens! My son is well on his way to being a metrosexual.   The good news for today is that I’m back in the swing of selling on eBay. I sold two things in a matter of a few hours, and I have more listings going. I love eBay – it’s so much cooler than having a garage sale. Yes, you have to pay listing fees and final value fees and Paypal fees. And, yes, I never seem to get my shipping charges right and I tend to lose a buck or two there. But you still get more than you would if you had a garage sale and had people trying to haggle you down on a $2 item. eBay – it’s the wave of the future!  Xanthe is really picking up the pace on her locomotion, by the way. She’s added a butt-scoot crawl to her bag of tricks, in addition to the already-present log-rolling across the room and the move we like to call “The Invisible Sit & Spin”. We’re still keeping her neurology appointment on the 10th, but it’s more so that I can have the neurologist look at her and declare her fine and dandy so I can march back into my pediatrician’s office with a smug “I told you so” look. She’s saying “mama” and “papa” when prompted (although actually she’s long been calling for me with an urgent “mamaMaMaMAMA” with no urging whatsoever), and I swear I heard her do a dead-on mimic of Henry’s “OK!” just this morning. So my little girl is cool  and  cute.  My dearest friend in the world, Tracy, told me today that three kids are plenty for her. Harumph, I say. I was goading her with a chant of “F-O-U-R…Rah, Rah…Go Team!” this morning, but she only dug her heels in. Party-pooper. Even waxing sentimental about how little Leo would never know the joys of a brother didn’t get her to budge. She reminded me that she could wind up with three girls and one boy, rather than the neat two-and-two package I’ve envisioned. She insists that once I cross the threshold of thrice-over insanity, I will feel likewise. I’m afraid she’s probably right, damn it. I wonder what the fates have in store for me. Hopefully, another girl for the simple fact that Xanthe’s kick-ass wardrobe will see more than one spin on the merry-go-round.  On that note, Paula informed me that she’s waiting for me to say that I’m pregnant again “any day now”. Hoo, boy. I’m gonna have to take a rain check on that one. After all, fitting into my Barbie doll dress will be nigh impossible next summer if I’m heavy with spawn. And even if I could zip it up, the hemline would be all askew and silly-looking, LOL. But I do have to get thinking on the subject because I ain’t getting any younger.   And the indignities of aging are certainly nothing to take lightly. With all this working out, I find myself hobbling about the house like a geriatric ward resident some days. Plus, how many slices can my abdomen take without giving up the muscle-ghost entirely? As it is, I think I could hold a pencil or two under the poochy flap I’ve got going, now. (Go ahead and shudder…I won’t take it personally.) I’m going to be living proof of whether those workout tapes from “The Firm” live up to their guarantee.  Perhaps I should start a betting pool on various facets of my life. When will she announce the next pregnancy? Will she succeed on the fitness quest? Will she ever get her book finished, much less published? If you’re interested in wagering, let me know. Maybe I could rake in more dough that way than I ever could on eBay.

      August 1, 2004  I need to tell you something I find amazing, but in order to do so, I have to make a confession of sorts. Let me just get it out and be done with it: I still have my childhood security blanket. And, yes, I still drag it out every now and then to sleep with it.  A bit of personal history and trivia: I have, for as long as I can recall, been a blankie snuzzler. My first blanket was actually a ragged piece of satiny binding from a larger blanket. I named it “Sniff” because I was most fond of holding it to my nose and inhaling like some laid-back glue-sniffer. I remember like it was yesterday the day that I lost Sniff #1. My mother and I were making a trip to the Livonia Mall. I was probably somewhere around the age of four or five. As we were getting out of the car, Mom asked me if I didn’t want to leave Sniff in the car. After all, she said, I might lose him somewhere. (Yes, Sniff is a ‘him’. That’s kind of gross, now that I think about it.) I scoffed at her. Lose Sniff? Are you mad, woman? I would no sooner loose my grip on Sniff than I would give myself an Indian burn. (My poor mother was probably just trying to save herself the embarrassment of walking through the mall with a child holding a ragged piece of blanket to her face like a senior citizen toting an oxygen mask.) So in we went.  Well, I’ll bet you can guess what happened. Sure enough, I lost Sniff. Panicked and crying, I trudged back into the mall with my mom to retrace our steps. But we never did find Sniff. That night, I woke my mother bawling from a nightmare I’d had in which a nasty janitor was sweeping up Sniff with a giant push broom. I must have been as pathetic as a child could be, because my mother hauled one of her nicest blankets – one that had been a wedding present – out to console me. At first, I wasn’t about to accept this awful substitute. After all, this was a whole, big blanket and not a handy little piece of satin to stroke and whiff. But, wait…it  did  have an interesting little tag to pick at on one corner. And it was extremely soft with yards of satiny binding. I took it grudgingly and my mother must've heaved a sigh of relief to have placated me somehow.  So Sniff #2 became my new constant companion. He has accompanied me everywhere throughout my life and endured endless manhandling over the years. To say he is now threadbare is a gross understatement. The fluff of the entire blanket is long gone; now it is a mere flat weave of thin threads, torn in spots where I actually put my foot right   through   it in my sleep. It has been stitched awkwardly by my own hands at the sewing machine when I was barely a teenager. In recent years, it remains folded to prevent further damage…so much the better for me to preserve this rather grotesque form of comfort for a thirty-three year old woman. And while the current sorry state of Sniff is my justification for never washing him, I must also admit that I was never fond of Sniff being washed in my youth, either. (Again, my poor mother. The clean freak that she is, she must’ve suppressed innumerable shudders of revulsion over my skanky blankie.) But Sniff isn’t Sniff without his characteristic musty smell.  (Here I have to stop to add a particularly funny, if gruesome, anecdote. In the year that Eugene and I were first married, we had the unfortunate idea to attempt to toilet-train our cats. It was actually working – Dodi and Claude had undergone careful and deliberate days of litter box modification, culminating in the brief triumph of witnessing Claude hop up on the edge of the toilet and take a poop right into the bowl – I swear on my children’s lives that this this is gospel truth. But Dodi was NOT having it, and she was growing ever disenchanted with the project. The following night was a very unhappy one for wee Dodi, and she howled so much in the bathroom where they were ensconced that she got Claude all riled up, too. Eug and I laid in bed that morning and decided to abandon the quest altogether. So I arose from bed to sneak into the bathroom with the intent of giving the kitties their normal litter arrangement back by way of apology. As I opened the door a wee crack, Claude shot past me like a bullet, pounced on my pillow where I had piled Sniff and right next to where Eugene was lying and unleashed a torrential downpour of cat whiz before I could even take two running steps in the direction he’d gone. The bedding was immediately whisked down to the washer, and as I stood worrying over Sniff’s trip through the sudsy waters, Eug came down to console me. He took a peek inside the washer and immediately bent double laughing. Gasping for air, he said through hysterical giggling “OH…MY…GOD. Sniff is….BLUE! All these years I thought the color of that blanket was actually gray-green!” I assumed a wounded, harumph postured as he scolded me “Honey, you have GOT to wash that blanket once in a while!” Men. They just don’t understand.)  OK, I’ll stop now so as not to gross you out any further. The point I am trying to make is coming up. It stands to reason that now that I am a mother and unrepentant blankie snuzzler myself, I am a staunch supporter of comfort items for my kids. It delighted me to no end to watch Henry take comfort in rubbing his face on his blankie from earliest days of infancy. (And to ensure that he would never feel the sting of loss of *his* blankie, I purchased no fewer than ten of the same little blue fleece Kmart Martha Stewart blankets he’d come to favor.) But the best part is this: he has the exact same habit I have of pulling the edge of his blanket through his fingers repeatedly that I do. Mind you, he’s never seen  me  do this, so I can only assume it’s some sort of weird genetic inheritance. What an incredibly strange way to see yourself in your offspring. I tell you.  Anyway, I know it’s weird. But I still love my blankie, and I love that my little boy and, increasingly, my little girl, too, are blankie aficionados. Excuse me now, I’ve got some snuzzlin’ to do before I turn in.

      May 31, 2004  Overall, it was a very nice and productive holiday weekend. I have no idea whether I gained or lost weight, however. I’m not counting on a visible weight loss, because I have been…shall we say…a bit  lax  on the BFL eating plan. However, it can also be said that I have been doing double-time, workout-wise. In that arena I am kicking ass.   But, anyway. I wanted to write about how weird it is to see muscles under my skin. Like an out-of-body experience, I assure you. I look down at my arms and see actual curves from certain angles. Now, don’t get me wrong – no one’s going to mistake me for Linda Hamilton in “Terminator 2” just yet. But I can actually see the wee little changes, and it cracks me up.  My workouts lately have consisted of an hour on the treadmill, six days a week. 20 mins of sprints, 20 mins of incline, and 20 mins of fast walking. And I sweat like a prize-winning hog. You should see it – I’m drenched inside of ten minutes. I think I read a long time ago that that’s a good sign. I blast through four 16.9 ounce bottles of water in the hour, easy. Then I’m still doing my weight-lifting three times a week, too. I went to the rec center today, and this cute middle-aged woman asked me about using the upright row machine – how it worked, what muscles it targets, etc. I had to laugh – someone asking ME about a weight machine? I’ve come a long way, baby.  I remember that first morning back in January, when I had to go in there at 5:30am into the …gulp!… free weights  section and do my thing. I was terrified. It’s the un-friendliest area of the gym to newbies. But once you just forget about everybody else and do your thing, after a while you can even march in there amidst the obnoxious teenaged boys and tune them and their dumbass banter right out. It’s amazing.  So my goal for this week is to really try for the six small meals per day and nothing else. No improvising, no substitutions, etc. I think it would really make a difference in what I see on the scale if I could stick to it. After all, with all my monkeying around with this plan, I’m beginning to think I’m going to have to admit that what I’m doing is not BFL, but rather my own thing. Which wouldn’t be the end of the world, but then I’d have to change my header for this blog, LOL.  But I can say this: already my pants fit differently. My stomach is merely poochy, and no longer *obscenely* poochy. It may not mean shit to you, but it’s a mighty big deal to this old girl. :^D

      May 28, 2004  OK, I didn’t stay off the scale. It’s been a wacky day. I had my oatmeal and two pieces of turkey bacon this morning, followed by several cups of coffee throughout the day and one spoonful of tuna mixed with mayo. That’s it. And it’s 4:40pm.  It’s mostly because I had tons and tons of company visiting today. Nicole and Emma were here all day, and the Posa family was here for a good long stretch, too. Very fun stuff. But not conducive to exercise or eating.  So I’ve kind of used today as an opportunity to re-acquaint myself with strong feelings of genuine hunger – just allowing myself to really  feel  it. I’m sort of a detached observer at this point. I feel a little weak and flighty, but I’m also kind of enjoying it, in a sick way. Yes, yes, this is hardly a ringing endorsement for a sensible approach to weight loss, I know. But in a way it IS good for me, because I am so out of touch with what real hunger feels like and allowing myself to experience the physical cues that tell me to eat. I eat constantly, so how would I know what hunger feels like?   I called Eug and asked him to bring home a chef salad from Bellacino’s for me, which will be perfect. A little Atkins-esque and very filling. Then I’m hoping to hoist myself on the treadmill and have the energy to follow it with the upper body weights workout I still have to do. I didn’t even set my alarm this morning, because I was so sleep-deprived this week. It was a good plan. I actually got an almost perfectly uninterrupted eight hours of sleep, and when you count all of my snooze time, it was closer to nine hours. I awoke refreshed and happy. So happy, in fact, that I had an almost Stepford-like morning. (On a tangent, how stupid is it that they’re remaking that movie? The first one was perfect.) I got the kids fed, the dishes washed, the laundry going – all I needed was an animated bluebird to sing on my shoulder and a floofy dress, replete with an organza apron.  Oh, and I did have my thousand-calorie burrito yesterday, but that was it for the night. The overall total for the day was probably in the neighborhood of 1800 calories, I’m guessing. Not awful. Not great, but not awful, considering the hour on the treadmill. Anyway, I enjoyed the hell out of that burrito, and I don’t regret a mouthful. I’m going to try to keep it lean and mean tonight after that chef salad.   One last tidbit: I got something cool done last night. I have a corkboard in front of my treadmill, right? With stuff on it like my minute-by-minute aerobic sprint workout guide, and the success stories I ripped from the BFL journal, and a picture of “Winged Victory of Samothrace” from the Louvre (the goddess Nike, of course) and the smiley face stickers I peel off and put on each day of the calendar when I work out. But last night I got a few inspirational pictures from my old magazine stash of some women in alarmingly good shape and made the whole corkboard into more of a nifty collage. Plenty to contemplate whilst jogging. It looks really good. I’m almost looking forward to my workout tonight for that reason alone…

      May 27, 2004  Well, the scale this morning made me ever-so-briefly pissed. Then I reminded myself that I need to stay off the stupid scale every five minutes. I was bone-tired, even though my sleep was fairly decent. (Fairly decent for the parent of young children, that is. Everything’s relative.) I was kind of dozing the morning away on the couch until Jennifer called and unknowingly threw me a bit of a lifeline. She wanted to know if we wanted to go to Costco.  My first instinct was “uh-uh”. Henry was still sleeping, Xanthe was lolling about, I was in my pajamas, and she was planning to leave in half an hour. I have no idea why I decided it would be a good thing, but I did. I told her I’d be out of the house by 10:05 and meet her at 10:30. I threw my clothes on and got Xanthe dressed. Then I woke up Henry and got him ready and popped him in the car. Knowing I had to feed him, I drove through Burger King, because he’ll eat the little round hash browns.  The good news is that getting out did me a world of good, because it just got me moving. The kids had a great time and I was able to plunk them both down for a nap not too long after we got home. They’re sleeping, still. I got myself onto the treadmill and did over sixty-two minutes and a total of 4.25 miles. (20 minutes of BFL sprints, 20 minutes of incline work, and 20 minutes of just brisk walking at 4.0 mph.) So I feel good. I may try to do a workout tape a little later.   Dinner’s a stumper. I would love to snarf down a steak Burrito Ultimo, but that’s NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY CALORIES. Good Lord. This is going to take some thinking. I don’t have the ability to run out to the grocery store with sleeping kids, and by the time they wake up, it’ll be too close to dinner to run out. Yeah, yeah – I know. I should’ve planned it last night. But last night was a fog, I told you. A big ugly downer.  Anyway, I’m going to try to spend a few minutes doing the positive visualization thing. Me. In a size eight. Hmmm. I’ll let you know how it goes.

      May 26, 2004  OK, so I’m not really writing this on Day Three. It’s actually Day Four, but I was too bummed and overwhelmed and tired to write yesterday, even though I really wanted to. It’s just that by the time I had a moment to sit down, it was late and I knew I should really be in bed. So I went to bed, instead.  Day Three was kind of shitty, truth be told. I did pretty well in the morning – I had oatmeal, if I recall correctly. Then I made the mistake of starting in on the ‘yogurt’ raisins I bought for Henry (which are essentially candy). Then my mom showed up with oatmeal cookies studded with milk chocolate chips for Henry – a big container of them. I silently cursed her kindness, because I knew that spelled trouble for me. Anyway, I went to see the doctor and learned that I was down a whole whopping three fucking measly pounds since last November when he saw me last. God. Damn. It. Of course I had my blood drawn again, so it remains to be seen if my cholesterol has improved any. After the fabulous result from the scale, I’m not holding my breath for good news in the bloodwork department, either. I’m also going to have a stress test to be on the safe side, since I’ve been achy and tired of late, and I’d rather not drop dead of a heart attack if at all possible, ha ha ha.  Needless to say, this was a giant downer. I came home starving because I hadn’t had a mid-morning mini-meal and I was waaaay late for lunch, and so I wound up wolfing something like eight or nine of those cookies with a couple of big glasses of skim milk. Then there were some yogurt raisins, and probably something else I’ve blocked out. I was really on a roll, so I stopped myself the only way I knew how: I made a plate of the leftover broiled chicken and steamed broccoli and ate it. I could’ve kept eating those processed carbs until midnight with no stopping me, but one big plate of solid food stopped me cold. I could not even entertain the idea of another bite.  I did have dinner – a hodge-podge salad with turkey bacon and greens and red pepper and mushrooms and croutons and whatnot, and I was pretty good after that, I think. (How pathetic is it that I can’t remember for sure, right off the top of my head?) Oh, and I forgot to mention it but I did get up at 5am to do my lower body weighted workout. It was hard, very hard. I know I’ve lost a little ground on the thigh ad/ab machines. I used to be able to lift more weight without conking out. I didn’t do all of my sit-ups, though. I was really shaky when I got back from the rec center and I managed 22, total. About a third of what I should do, I think. I told myself I’d do them later and never did. (Shocking, I know!)

      May 25, 2004  First things first: Have you noticed that you can now add a comment on any of the posts in my blogs? Look at the bottom and click on the “x# comments” and you can then add a comment of your own. No need to register or anything – anybody can do it. Just comment away! (Nice comments are especially appreciated.)  OK, so I didn’t make it up to work out first thing this morning, either – Xanthe was doing her “up all night” routine again. But I’m going to workout when they nap, come hell or high water.   I wanted to write about one little thing that has been huge in helping me to realize how much I needed to regain my health. You see, in BFL, you’re asked to take a few pictures of yourself. In a bathing suit or something similarly revealing. From the front and the back. Now, you may be thinking “Oh, there’s no WAY I would ever do this. I know how I look!” But are you sure?  I call it: “reverse anorexia”. Meaning no disrespect or lack of compassion for people who suffer from any eating disorder, I use the term ‘reverse anorexia’ to mean that you are, in reality, much fatter than you think you are. You may think you’re a trifle  zaftig , sure. But alarmingly overweight? Non, non mignon.  Take my word for it: once you see those pictures, you will be   aghast   at how fat you are. The strangest part for me was realizing that the pictures I took fully dressed, and in clothing I thought flattered me, were waaaaaay worse than the pictures I took in a bathing suit. Maybe it’s because not too many people see you in your bathing suit, but everybody sees you in your regular clothes. And you look like *that* in them. Eeeeew.  So I swear by taking those pictures. Get your digital camera set up on a tripod (or the top of the dresser, even) if you can’t bear to have someone take the pics for you. But, for God’s sake – do it. There’s no substitute for it. And believe me, you probably have no idea how you really look.  I didn’t get to do the Buns of Steel tape yesterday, but I did everything else: the treadmill, the crunches, the upper body weighted workout. I managed to avoid the late night snack danger zone, too – but it probably has more to do with the fact that I don’t have much good snack food in the house. Would I have been successful with a bag of tortilla chips in the pantry? I don’t think so.  Food-wise, I’ve been good today. Had breakfast of water, egg substitute and oatmeal, then some Kool-Aid with Splenda, then some coffee. Then just now I had some low-fat cottage cheese, about 1/8 cup honey roasted peanuts (total splurge), a big glass of skim milk and a Myoplex Lite bar. I feel good, but sleepy.  Today I’ve done my crunches and went for a long, fast walk with Jennifer. Now I’m about to hop on the treadmill, since I just got both kids down for a nap. I would soooo much rather be taking a nap, as I am exhausted from these last few nights. However, duty calls. Wish me luck.

      May 24, 2004  Well, I *was* up at 5am today – but I didn’t get to go to lift weights. Xanthe was up crying all…night…long. I was up with her in vain attempts to soothe her. I took her into the doctor’s office, even though I felt like a crazy woman for doing so, because we have been in there almost constantly of late. But thank God I did because she has a nasty ear infection now, too. So at least I know she has a reason for being so hard to handle. I don’t know why knowing what the problem is makes it easier to be patient, but it does.  But, anyway – with such a lousy start, you might think I floundered, but I really haven’t! When we were up at 5am, I was literally starving. So I ate a few ounces of cheese (I figured some kind of protein would take longer to digest) and drank a bottle of water. Then, at around 9am I had plain ol’ oatmeal with skim milk and Splenda. Then we ran to the doctor’s office, then I had a cup of coffee and spent a little while at Jennifer’s. When we came home, I put my workout clothes on  first  and then put the kids down for a nap, because I never know how long I’ll get, so I need to make every second count. I had four spoonfuls of low-fat cottage cheese because I was starving again, too.  I hopped on the treadmill and did my twenty minute sprint plus a little extra (went for two minutes at a 10 incline this time – so hard!). Then I did a bit of my upper body weights workout and listened to Xanthe howl. I wondered if she’d go back to sleep, but no dice. So I got her and soothed her after a while and the poor thing fell asleep on the blanket I’d folded in the middle of the living room. Then I quickly finished my upper body workout and did my crunches, too. The only thing left that I’d like to do today is the “Buns of Steel” workout tape, minus the warm-up. God knows I’m already warm.  I’m hoping to grill some chicken and have a huge salad for dinner, followed by a nutrition shake as my last mini-meal. I feel good today, oddly enough. Of course I’m really tired, as I think I got less than three hours of sleep, and all of it was interrupted. But hopefully we’ll all sleep a little better tonight, and I only have to hit the treadmill first thing tomorrow morning. Anything else is gravy. Philosophically speaking, that is.    Little steps. Baby steps.

      May 23, 2004  Just checking in with a workout update. I got my butt on the treadmill and did just under 47 minutes, 3.25 miles and 354 calories, total. It was an interesting workout. I had a pattern established for the 20 minute interval BFL aerobic workout from my first time around. For those of you unfamiliar with the BFL pattern, it’s essentially four five minute sprints, for a very effective workout in 20 minutes flat. You have “intensity levels” that you strive to achieve, rather than set speeds. A level five intensity is described as carrying a bag of groceries up a flight of stairs, while a ten is an all-out effort that you probably couldn’t sustain for long. So last time, my level 5 was 3.8 mph; my level 6 was 4.0 mph; level 7 was 4.5 mph; level 8 was 5.0; level 9 was 5.5 mph and, of course, level 10 was 6.0 mph. Today I found that I could effectively eliminate the 4.5 mph stage and sustain a 5.0 for two straight minutes. I did the standard 20 minutes, then I took the speed down to 3.5 mph and cranked the incline to a 5. Whew! I kept that up for fifteen minutes and then I needed to take it down to a zero incline (but I did bump the speed back up to 4.0 mph).   Anyway, not like I mean to provide you all with a microscopic view of my workouts, but the incline was interesting. I even did a minute and a half at a 10.0 incline, and that was brutal! You could feel a not-unpleasant burn right up the back of your legs right away.  Eating’s been good so far, but the day’s young. I snarfed down half a light yogurt and made myself some oatmeal with protein powder. Not exactly easy to eat, but it sure does stick to your ribs. I think I’ll go make some coffee now and check in with you later.  OK, I’m back. It’s almost 9pm and I’ve done pretty well today. I had some cottage cheese and about five “lite” canned peaches after my workout, followed by a lot of coffee (with “lite” fake creamer and Splenda), followed by a Wendy’s Taco Supremo salad (major splurge, but filling) and a diet Pepsi, and now finally a sugar-free popsicle. Not bad.   But the real test is coming up: getting to bed early and falling asleep so I can get up at 5am to lift weights. My alarm is set and my workout clothes laid out. But will I sleep after all that coffee and so many weeks of late bedtimes? Probably not. But I still have to haul my keister out of bed tomorrow, come hell or high water.  The thing about first starting a diet of some sort is how foggy I feel at first. Just…disoriented. I think that’s where the caffeine seems to really help. It’s as though it propels me forward when I might otherwise curl up on the couch with a big bag of tortilla chips, followed closely by a nap. Oh! And I ordered a new stroller! You wanna talk splurge? Oh, my. The Mountain Buggy Urban Double. In chocolate. (If I can’t eat it, at least I can push it.) I can’t wait to get it and plunk the kids in it for walks. I hate that squeaky piece of shit I have now.  Something else I did was to go through my half-finished copy of the BFL journal and tear out the personal profiles I liked best. My absolute favorite is Pam Brown. You should SEE how this woman transformed herself. (She’s Day 50 in the BFL journal in my copy, in case you’re looking.) Of all the women in the book, she speaks to me. I put her right in the middle of the corkboard that hangs in front of my treadmill. Right at eye level so I could stare at that amazing progression throughout every workout. Another woman in the book, Diane Robertson (Day 82), also blew my mind. She went from a Size 18 to a Size 2. Yes, a TWO. Now, this touches on something I wrote earlier: how small am I, really, underneath all this? My guess is that I could surely be a 12. Maybe a 10, if I were really busting ass. But what if, just maybe, it’s smaller than that? I can’t even wrap my brain around TWO. I have enough trouble comprehending a size 8.  Anyway, I’m using this blog as kind of a BFL journal substitute. I think I’ll actually perform better using a forum like this rather than the journal, as I’ve always been one to want to direct the conversation rather than follow someone else’s lead. I’m insufferable that way. Plus, then I felt no guilt over cutting up my half-used BFL journal for inspiration.   Tomorrow’s really my first official day of the 12-week challenge. (I just did today as an exercise in self-flagellation, heh heh.) I’ll be sure to let you know how it goes. Now I have to go occupy myself with bedtime preparations, because that urge to snack is comin’ on strong.

      May 22, 2004  It’s Saturday night and I decided to keep this blog as a way to keep me honest about climbing back on the Body-For-Life bandwagon. I am almost 33 years old with cholesterol of 252 at last check and I’m completely out of gas. I have a two and a half year old son and a ten month old daughter and I’ve spent the last six months in a never-ending germ war. As the cliché goes, something must be done.  I had started Body-For-Life at the beginning of the year, when everyone on earth starts their self-improvement attempts. I was six weeks in, feeling nothing short of incredible and fifteen pounds lighter when I was hit with the stomach flu. I’ve been struggling to pull it back together ever since then. I’ve gained back ten of the fifteen I lost. And even though I’m bummed to be back at square one, I’m glad in some ways because I’ve learned a thing or two about what I need to succeed.  I need to do my workouts at the butt-crack of dawn, no matter how tired I am. Otherwise, they simply will not get done. I attempted to rationalize my way out of this from a thousand different angles, but the truth remains. I must be up at 5am for the mornings I need to go to the gym and at 6am for hoofing it on the treadmill at home.   I need to have a ton of bottled water already really cold in the frig or I don’t drink it. (And did you notice that it’s “frig” and not “fridge”? That’s because “refrigerator” does NOT contain the letter “d”.) In fact, if the water supply dwindles, I am virtually guaranteed to drink zero water and plenty of something caloric.  I need some accountability. Hence, this blog. My goal is to report faithfully, and to use it when I might otherwise go astray. Plus, I think it would be interesting to track the progress of a total jellyroll such as myself. Me, who’s never played a team sport in my life, who was always picked last for anything athletic (and with good reason), and who subscribes to the “Why stand when you can sit? Why sit when you can lie down?” philosophy – what will this process be like? I find stuff like setting goals for weight loss fascinating when I ponder the fact that I’ve been overweight for a very long time. Is it even possible that I could wear a size 6? I have no clue. So, I’m just going to schlump along and set a very reasonable thirty pound weight loss for my first goal.  So, here we go. I’m going to update with more specific information later, but for now I just wanted to introduce myself and share the love.

      June 22, 2004  I know, I know. I suck. I really do. I have written nothing because there is nothing to tell. I have done nothing, except grow slightly more enamoured with my big butt. I may change this blog to an ode to my giant ass, in fact.  OK, OK. I haven’t given up utterly. But I’m not exactly travelling the straight and narrow. I’m tired and I have a party coming up, damn it. All hands on deck, you know. Working out takes a way-back seat and all that. I just didn’t want you to think I’d DIED or anything. But you probably knew otherwise, and guessed intuitively that I spent my nights up too late on the computer and my days in a housework frenzy, right? Right. I’m glad I didn’t worry anyone.  Anyway, it’s as though I’ve got the words “Oh, who gives a shit?” tattooed on my brain. They’re etched onto the glass through which I see the world, and I seem to be making it my life’s motto. (Previously, my life’s motto was “People: Ya Gotta Hate ‘Em.” I’m still so tempted to sell t-shirts with that slogan. I think I already have about twenty buyers lined up, in fact.)  That’s all for now. Short and sweet. I’ll be back to either whine some more or bray about my minuscule accomplishments. When I’m inspired, that is.

      June 11, 2004  Sorry to have been such a deadbeat about updating. I have been no better and no worse than usual, which, while not awful, ain’t great, either. But I do have fabulous news to report: my cholesterol numbers are in! My ‘before’ numbers came from mid-November, while my ‘after numbers were from sometime mid-May – so almost exactly six months. My total cholesterol has dropped from 253 (originally I thought it was 252) to 188!! My triglycerides dropped from 197 to 93!! My LDL dropped from 152 to 111!! And lastly, my HDL (or ‘good’ cholesterol) dropped from 62 t0 58, but it’s a small drop given the overall huge drop I took in total cholesterol. And besides, my HDL is still way higher than most people’s. So, how cool is that? Every one of my numbers is in a perfectly healthy range.  I’ve decided to do a little two-week stringent dieting to kind of kick-start me again. The thing is, BFL works so fucking well and every time I’m getting really hungry, it’s time to eat again. So it’s a genius plan, if you ask me. I have no idea why I feel the need to do anything else, but I do right now. The SBD cookbook was just too damned fishy for me. There’s no way I’m cooking that much seafood. I don’t really like it, and besides, I’m not rolling in dough.  My neighbor Jen is doing SO WELL on Weight Watchers. I am just so proud of her. But then, she  is  working her ass off. Literally, ha ha! (Oh, I slay me.) The woman gets up at the butt-crack of dawn to work out the vast majority of mornings…which is what I used to do and need to do again. It felt good to be up on that moral high ground, heh heh.  So, anyway – you’re probably going to be getting some mighty cranky posts from me in the next few days. Like I said, I don’t do diets well. Snarl…

      June 3, 2004  Day Eleven, if you’re keeping count. At this point I am in the…ahem…  valley   portion of this journey, emotionally speaking. And I certainly don’t mean a peaceful valley. Mine is more like a mudpit below sea level. I bought the South Beach Diet cookbook yesterday for more menu ideas. I’m wondering if I really need to do something hard-core for a couple of weeks to get my eating straightened around, as I am really floundering in that department. I didn’t get a chance to eat anything today until 2:30-ish (I know, I know…HUGE mistake) and then I was feeling pretty sick. I had a little salad of greens, some red pepper, a sprinkling of cheese, and about 2 tsp. of ranch dressing. Then I had a Stouffer’s Turkey Tetrazzini entrée, followed by a big glass of milk and a fat handful of mini Oreos. I feel full, but it was too late to stave off the headache that’s hanging over me like a black cloud.  I did manage to get on the treadmill and do 1.8 miles of sprints in 22 minutes (200 calories, according to the readout, but who knows how accurate those things are). I promised myself I wouldn’t do any more than that on the treadmill, because my knees have been squawking a bit over all the running I’ve been doing, and God knows the last thing I need is an injury.  My stress test is scheduled for Monday, but there’s a possibility it will be delayed, I just found out. I almost had a heart attack when I saw it was the DMC calling because I thought it was the doctor calling to tell me my cholesterol was showing no improvement and that I was in deep trouble. With each day that passes I get a little more hopeful that my cholesterol has shown improvement, since he told me he’d call if he had bad news – but if the news was good, he’d just drop me a note in the mail. So I’m hoping for a letter one of these days.  I really want to do something like a no-refined-carbs-whatsoever two week boot camp, because I think it would do me good in the long run, but I really don’t know if I can handle it. On top of that, my husband might divorce me, and with good reason. I’m not a pleasant dieter, try though I might to keep my chin up. On the other hand, I think I’m a prime candidate for insulin resistance, if I’m not already. Hmmm. This requires some thought. I may have to seek out a BFL support group.   So cross your fingers for me, or better yet - leave me a happy comment at the end of this post. I could sure use one.

      July 27, 2004  Well, I got on the scale this morning according to plan and I was a half-pound HEAVIER than I was Saturday morning. Son of a   bitch!  . This was not a fortuitous start to the day. I had, quite literally, nothing in the house for the kids’ breakfast so on the spur of the moment I decided to haul us all out of the house for a Burger King breakfast. Yes, that included me. I didn’t go hog wild or anything, but as we all know, you can eat half of a tiny fast food sandwich and gain five pounds. Then I took us to the grocery store (after a brief detour through the kiddie consignment shop, where I found an *awesome* Hanna coat and matching snowpants in perfect condition for a  song !) and brought the kids home. Gave ‘em a snack while I unpacked groceries and put them down for a nap.  I soooo did not want to work out today. All I wanted to do was either lie down and sleep, or lie down and snack and watch TV. Sometimes I think Heaven will be a place where you can do everything you lovelovelove to do all at once, in which case I will be snoozing, snacking, reading, knitting, shopping and playing video games simultaneously. Joy overload.  But of course after the BK beginning, how could I  not  get my ass on the treadmill? I wanted to do a full hour, but when you feel like shit, it seems awfully idealistic. So I thought I’d take it in chunks. Twenty-minute chunks, to be exact. I’d already decided to pass on an incline workout, so I thought I’d do nothing but my 20-min sprints. After the first set of sprints, I was sweating like a slippery pig but feeling that happy, warm-all-over-but-not-exhausted feeling. I stop the treadmill to get a new bottle of water and breathe for a while. OK, I can do another twenty minutes. Back on.   Somewhere around Minute 33, I thought I was going to die. I hated every step of it and told myself “Fine – just finish the forty minutes and you can call it quits.” I got to the forty minutes with nothing less than enormous effort. I chugged what was left of my second water bottle and relished how good it felt to NOT be running. Now, excuse me if I get too personal here, but by this time I really had to pee. So I mosey on over to my little water closet (or, as we like to call it, “The Shitter” – named so because it’s just a tiny room with nothing but a toilet in it, LOL) and I’m sitting there, actually feeling the blood thrumming through my veins. I can *hear* my heart beating away in there. Sweat is rolling off me in wee rivers, and I just feel so…good. Not quite the high I had on Sunday, but a facsimile of that yumminess, to be sure.  So I say, “OK, I think I can do one more round. I’ll just take a one minute breather after each five-minute sprint.” So that’s what I did. My workout today was all sprints: 61:08 minutes, 4.75 miles and 536 calories. I am very pleased. I think the reason I’m stuck, scale-wise, has a lot more to do with…ahem… feminine  things than it does with any lack of effort on my part. Meaning that in a week or so I should probably see a big change. So I need to just have faith in the process.  Besides, maybe in a little while I’ll be rewarded with a visit from The Whoosh Fairy. I can’t remember where I read it, but apparently The Whoosh Fairy is the fairy that visits you after you’ve been stuck on a plateau forever and, suddenly, you are several pounds lighter in one fell swoop. My only question is: What should I put under my pillow to encourage a visit from The Whoosh Fairy? Feel free to comment with creative suggestions. I'll try 'em all and see if any work.   BTW, the Barbie dress is mine. I’ll post a pic of it when it comes. :^D

      July 25, 2004  Good heavens, I think I had something akin to a spiritual experience while working out today. I know it’s my free day, but I skipped my workout yesterday *and* indulged in a big dinner of my mom’s cabbage rolls and mashed potatoes. So I had to do something to atone. A tone ! Ha! I’m so punny! Hooo…heee. Don’t mind me, apparently I am just experiencing the ‘runner’s high’ I’ve always heard about.  Anyway, I’m dragging my feet and finally I realize the day is going to get away from me if I do not get my ass on the treadmill NOW. I yank some running clothes on and grab five new CDs for the disc changer. I’m a couple of minutes into my sprints when I realize it is feeling downright eee-zee today. Hmm. Maybe I’ll bump up each level of my intervals two tenths of a mile in speed. I’m still rolling with ease at the end of my twenty minutes, so I segue right into my incline workout and brutalize myself by taking that up a few notches, too. I am  still  feeling good, so I decide to take it for a full hour and do some more sprints once the incline workout is over. Final tally? 62:08 minutes, just over 4.5 miles and 522 calories. Not too shabby!  I was tired as hell by the end of it, but I squeaked in a few quick shoulder raises with some very light (3 lb.) hand weights and 60-odd crunches. And I feel ridiculously good. Not even the kind of “Oh, look what I accomplished even though it sucked doing it” kind of good. No, I mean just a pure physical yummy sensation. Gee, whiz! I think I’m beginning to get it.  Of course, it never hurts to have funky tunes. I need good, loud music by which to run. I have been thinking about making mixed CDs for myself and my friends for workouts for  EVER  , now. I think tonight I will have Eug set me up to rip some tunes into mp3s and then I can burn ‘em to CDs for me and anyone who wants one. I’ll let y’all know when they’re finished. I think I have the optimum running setup at this point: a treadmill at home, a corkboard right in front of my face loaded with inspirational stuff, a calendar right next to the corkboard so I can record my workout details and give myself a fun sticker for every day I work out (you’d be surprised how effective it is to look at the calendar and see all those smiley faces…of course, now I’m out of smileys and have moved on to glittery lipstick lips instead), and a good stereo…all in a room far enough away from sleeping kids that I can crank the volume with no reservations.  So Tracy tells me that she will no longer speak to me if I don’t buy the pink dress. She located it with relatively little trouble and informed me that if ever a garment was the physical embodiment of my soul, it would be that. So unless it goes too high, I’m going to bring it home. When it gets here, I’ll share a pic. Oh, and Saturday’s scale showed another half-pound gone. I’ll take it. One more half-pound and I’ll hit the fiver mark.  Free day’s been good so far. Like I said, I started my free-for-all a tad early. After the cabbage rolls repast, I also came home and had a couple of handfuls of potato chips and a huge glass of skim milk right before bed. Yikes! But this morning I awoke and I went to breakfast with Eug and the kids and enjoyed every bite. Eggs, hash browns, toast, ham and even a few stolen bites of pancake from the kids. I did have a  diet  pop, LOL. Then we ran some errands, came home and I had one can of regular Coke before my workout. I don’t know what tonight will bring, but I’ll try not to set any records for gluttony. I’m thinking ice cream is in my future.  OK, that’s all for now – I knocked back four sixteen ounce bottles of water during my workout, and let’s just say if I sit here writing any longer, there’s going to be a call for cleanup in aisle four. Ciao! (Ha! More puns! Can you stand it?)

      July 24, 2004  So I’m up way too late tonight, but I felt like blogging about something that happened this week. It should be no surprise to anyone when I tell you that I am currently smitten with a dress up for auction on eBay. The surprising thing is that the dress would be for   me  , not my daughter. Well, assuming I could ever fit into it, that is. The dress in question is described as a size 8, you see. Not exactly in my current neck of the woods.  Anyway, I’m eyeballing this dress and wondering in this tiny little spot in the deepest part of my heart if I could somehow get there. I don’t exactly lead the life of a socialite, so my available venues to trot that puppy out would be limited. The dress is pink and very retro 50s and sweet, so I’m thinking maybe a summer wedding? Where else would I go? It is tea-length, with floaty layers of Bazooka pink georgette skirt under an ivory bodice that is dotted with teeny-tiny pink velvet bows, even all along the narrow straps. Kitsch with a Kapital K.  Then I remember that I have a wedding next summer to which I will be invited. One whole year. Hmmm. I tentatively broach the subject with a few of my nearest and dearest in a very roundabout way. I feel sheepish; I need opinions. The dress is giggled over and described in innumerable amusing ways, and it is almost universally declared that the dress is indeed “Michelle”.  But there’s always gotta be a sourpuss in the group, doesn’t there? Enter two people whom I love dearly, husband and wife. I share dress details with wife who informs me via e-mail that said dress is “a lovely dress…  for BARBIE!  ” OK, sure. I have a sense of humor. And she wasn’t the first person to observe that the dress was 1950s Barbie-esque. Now for the kicker. When I called said loved one to jokingly moan about the lack of support, the male half of that married equation hollers from the background “You’re too OLD! Get over it!”   What a fucking drag. Do I think I’m nineteen? Of course not. But am I too old to wear a kitschy retro party dress that bares nothing more than my arms, shoulders and some of my back? Is bubble-gum pink off-limits for anyone over the age of seven? Am I such a freak to want to have a little fun? Go on, you can tell me.  The little joke has provoked a lot of thought in me. Is what I view appropriate and even wonderful dramatically out of step with what other people view as appropriate for a person my age? Am I some kind of laughingstock? Of course I’m different. But I didn’t suppose that what was different about me was different in a  bad  way.   The more I think about it, the more I think I may have to get that dress. I may never wear it, but I think I have to give it a whirl. I think it’ll look fabulous if I borrow my mother’s retro pink rhinestone necklace and earrings and get some funky pink shoes. And anyone who thinks I should just tone it down can take a long walk off a short pier. I may be old, but I’m not dead. And to whom it may concern: I’m not going to give up playing video games, either.

      July 22, 2004  OK, I got through my workout today. The scale, for the curious among you, did not budge this morning. The exact same number I saw Tuesday. Technically, this is good news, because at least I have not experienced an upswing. But I was really hoping for a tiny downswing. So, I’m an ingrate today.   But back to my workout. I gave it a little extra oomph today, doing both the sprints and the incline work for all I was worth. Forty-nine minutes, just over 3.25 miles and, according to the treadmill’s computer, 330 calories. My eating still leaves a ton to be desired. I ate nothing all morning save for two of the french toast sticks I made for the kids’ breakfast, and then when Jennifer and the kids and I all went to Costco, I bought one of their scrumptious spinach salads to chow while the kids noshed on hot dogs and pizza. If I hadn’t done that, I may have attacked my own offspring for their food. So I ate maybe a little less than half of it and had a diet pop.  I have no idea what to do for dinner, exactly, but I did buy some decent food at Costco, so I think I’ll be able to pull something together for everyone. Then I am going to snuggle in on the couch to watch Big Brother (so sue me – I like terrible TV) with a giant bowl of dry, air-popped popcorn with a liberal sprinkling of seasoned salt.  Tomorrow’s a luxurious day at the Rec Center again. I’m going to eke out every ounce of effort from myself for that lower body workout and then take a looooong, hot shower – God and offspring willing. I want to be all wobbly-legged from muscle exhaustion when I walk out of there.  My next scale day won’t be until Saturday morning. I think I’m on a good rotation: hop on the scale Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Not long enough away that I behave badly and then dread getting back on, and not on so often that I obsess over every fluctuation.   I’m just wondering what happened to my favorite fitness magazine: Energy for women. It was the best! But I haven’t seen an issue since February, I think. Bummer. I think I should stay away from magazines, because so far I’ve only had two big favorites, and both have gone belly-up. But this is probably only yet another indication that I am significantly out-of-step with the rest of the world…and if you know me at all, you know that it delights me to be so. :^D

      July 21, 2004  Eating some form of protein, I’ve found, is the only way to put out a blaze of eating. I can be grazing like a madwoman, and the only way to bring that train to a screeching halt is to have a solid portion of meat, egg, dairy or something equally substantial. The need to consume just sort of dies after that.  Thank God, too, because the quality and quantity of groceries in this house is pitiable. I just haven’t had the wherewithal to plan, shop for and cook any meals, and my eating is suffering mightily for it. Today’s lunch consisted of cottage cheese with drained fruit cocktail, reduced fat cheddar melted over a handful of Fritos Scoops and a Myoplex Lite bar and a big glass of skim milk. Pathetic. That Myoplex bar was the only thing that saved me.   So I made up for it by eating very, very lightly for dinner: one small cup of Wendy’s chili and a diet Pepsi. I did my weight-lifting this afternoon and just now came back from an hour-long walk with Jennifer. We’re planning a M-W-F schedule for nightly walks…and what incredible timing! I *just* now got home and the rain that threatened our walk but never materialized is now pattering on my roof. Apparently God approves of my nightly exercise and waved off Mother Nature for a little bit.  Anyway, tomorrow is a scale morning for me, and I’m trying to go into it incredibly…empty. I weighed myself Tuesday and I was down a full four pounds from when I started, and this was   after   Sunday’s Eat-a-Thon, too. I would be happy tomorrow just not to have moved upward from that point. Anything else is gravy.  On our walk, Jennifer was talking about a phenomenon with which I am intimately familiar: psychological scale games. Apparently I’m not the only who tends to think of weight loss in increments of ten pounds. So wherever you are at one point: the 70s, the 40s, the 10s…whatever increment of ten you happen to be in when you start…when you get into a  new  ten pound range, you say to yourself “I never want to see that number again. I never want to go back there.” You used to be a 60s girl, but now you are a 50s girl! NO RETREAT!  Anyway, I’d have eight more pounds to lose to officially be in a new ten pound increment. It’s a ways off, but oooooh – when I get there, it will feel so very, very fine. We’ll see what the scale says tomorrow. I’ll be choosing my cartoon ‘Unky Mood’ based on that number, I can assure you. Look to my cartoon mood tomorrow for the skinny! (Ha! A punny double entendre! I crack me up!)

      July 19, 2004  Has someone ever told you that flat-out lie? Perhaps you received it in some feel-good-about-yourself, rah-rah-sisterhood e-mail? Well, let me tell you that is *such* a load of horseshit. Perhaps Marilyn was a  1950s Size 12  (or 14, or whatever bullshit your particular version of the urban myth is trying to spin), but in today’s garment industry she would be absolutely no bigger than a Size 6. Maybe she’d have to let the boobage area out a bit, but trust me on this one. I have seen the woman’s most famous dresses in person, and no more than eight inches from my face, and she was teeny-tiny. A wee, dinky little hourglass.  I write this because of the utter ridiculousness of the feel-good sizing of modern clothiers. I say this even though I  obviously  benefit obscenely from said sizing policies. The problem is that by burying our heads in the sand this way, our incredibly fat asses are on very prominent display. Never mind if the label inside says 10 or 12, girls.   So I had a very good weekend. Saturday was indeed very hard, but I got through it by skipping dinner in favor of an enormous bowl of air-popped popcorn with a couple of icy Diet Pepsis while we watched   Badder Santa  , which was nothing short of hysterical. It was the dirtiest and funniest movie I have seen in ages. Directed by Terry Zwigoff and screenplay by the Coens, so you KNOW it’s the shizzle. We may actually buy it, it was so amusing. Plus, I’m hot for Billy Bob. Angelina was a fool for picking the kid over him. And I say that as a devoted mother, LOL!  Anyway, I got to Sunday and combined my free-as-a-bird food day (positive) with paperwork that had been neglected for months (major negative). Even a breakfast of peanut butter cookies and milk could not prevent a crabby outburst on my part. We really have to try harder to keep the desk clean. I’m beginning to get carpal tunnel from turning over new leaves.  But I got through the mountain of paperwork and felt good about myself. I had a major pig-out over the course of the day, simply because I didn’t want to get to Monday and feel pissy about not having taken full advantage of my first Sunday. I honestly think the first week is the hardest. You wonder if you’ll EVER get to your free day, and then once it comes, you’re surprised by how quickly it arrived. I was raring to go this morning, too.  In fact, we’ve had a great day already. I did my lower body weights at the Rec Center and I didn’t get a call over the loudspeaker to come to Kid Quarters once! I even got to take a long, hot shower, dry off in the sauna (say SOW-nah, not SAW-na, g*ddammit) and change into street clothes before picking up my happy kids! Yay! As far as food goes, I could’ve been more responsible. I kind of like Mondays to be very, very lean to make up for Sunday’s excess. So far I have consumed two cups of coffee, two small Wendy’s chilies, a large Diet Pepsi, one of the kids’ chicken nuggets (I was starving to death and I can’t eat chili while I drive) and two small saltine crackers (see aforementioned). That’s it. I’m going to have a small dinner and stop eating early, too. If I get crazy before bed, I’ll have a big glass of fiber drink to take the edge off. I’ll let you know how the scale’s lookin’ tomorrow.

      July 17, 2004   I am fighting a supremely bad mood today. I hate Saturdays when doing Body-for-LIFE because you are so close to that fucking free day, but you’re still on the g*ddamned plan. Plus, it’s the   weekend  , for cryin’ out loud. On top of all this, I didn’t do my workout yesterday (well, I did 12 counts of shoulder presses and then…nothing) and it’s bringing me down.   Yes, I did my workout today. I even did it first thing when I woke up and on an empty stomach, just like I’m supposed to. Heck, I sit here sweaty as I type this. But let me be honest: I loathed every nanosecond of it today. The thoughts running through my mind were downright murderous, I was so pissed off. I finished my reps of shoulder presses just now and am going to try to knock off the upper body weight-lifting today just for the sake of principle.   I don’t know why I should be in such a bad mood, either. A conservative estimate shows that I lost at least 2 pounds this week and probably more like 2 ½ - which is all the weight loss anyone should be looking for, if you’re expecting it to actually be  fat  loss and not water loss. Multiply that by twelve weeks and I’m looking at 25 pounds or so gone. How cool would that be? But, still. I’m on a hair-trigger.   Plus, my fucking stroller isn’t here, yet. I highly doubt it will get here today like the FedEx website led me to believe. Wait – I take that back! I just checked the website again, and   it’s on the vehicle for local delivery! My stroller approacheth! Eeeeeeeeeeeee!   OK, I feel better. I’ll get my super-duper Mountain Buggy Urban Double today and put that sucker together. That should distract me sufficiently to get me through one more day.   One. More. Day.

      July 15, 2004  Hoo! What a   fierce   workout! Fifty-five minutes on the treadmill, hauling ass! Call me a bad mother for delaying one kid’s naptime ridiculously so as to get them both to sleep at the same time…I simply don’t care. To have this time to myself is ESSENTIAL. I did my sprints followed by incline work that was so hard today I thought I would die. I could imagine myself losing consciousness and getting shredded by the belt on my treadmill. Eug would come home to a dark spot on the dirty workroom carpet and a tangle of my hair, and that would be it. Maybe a little piece of my workout clothes.  Oh, speaking of that: I’m on the phone with Heather today when Theo starts going apeshit. This can only mean someone is on our property. At this point, I am wearing my workout clothes because as a mother of young children, I can tell you that when the opportunity to work out arises, you’ve got to be ready to   GO  , damn it! You sprint to get that workout done, because you can never know if you’ll have more than fifteen minutes. First Commandment of trying to be a Fit Mom: Thou Shalt Not Take Workout Time For Granted.  So, anyhoo, I’m bee-bopping around the house in my workout duds when I realize that the guy from the tree company is on my lawn. He’s here about my magnolia tree, which has a horrid case of scale and is in dire need of help. I have told the tree people that my neighbors will burn me in effigy…if I’m  lucky …should any terrible fate befall the magnificent magnolia that graces my front lawn within twenty years of us taking ownership of this house. Perhaps after that people will agree that perhaps it’s time had come and it died a natural death. Anything before that, and I’m toast.  So Tree Dude is here for something tree-related. I open my door to acknowledge Tree Dude on my doorstep so I can give him authorization for whatever tree-related hoo-hah he’s there to perform. At this point I am wearing a sports bra with a thin, silky little Nike tank that is quite comfy for sweaty workouts and one of those ridiculous pairs of split-side running shorts with the panties built right in. And let’s be honest, here – at this stage of the game, I really have the physique for neither of these things. But, dammit, they’re comfy.  I open the door to be informed…in these exact, unfortunate choice of words…”I’m here to fertilize your magnolia, ma’am”, to which I nod briefly, close the door, and dissolve in hysterical laughter with Heather on the other end of the phone line. The temptation to respond to this poor Tree Dude with “You don’t say? Well, come on in then, Big Fella!” was *overwhelming*. Yes, I am a sick puppy. Fertilize my magnolia, indeed.  So I’ve been living very lean today. Just the eggs-and-oatmeal breakfast, some coffee and a nutrition shake before my workout. I am very hungry right now, but am relishing the fat-burning feel of it all. After yesterday’s Taste-A-Thon, I told myself today would be different. I’m hoping that by doing this I can get good scale news tomorrow.  I’ll end on a good note: I’m struggling along here, running behind on EVERYTHING because managing this diet and workout in the first days when I feel like I am detoxing is all I can handle, quite literally. So time seems to stand very, very still. But then this morning my neighbor and I took the kids on a walk to the mall and I asked her as we were going our separate ways if she was planning the weekly Friday trip to Costco this week or not and she paused for a second and said “Hey, that’s TOMORROW!” Wow! It *is* tomorrow! The end of the week is almost here! Just two more full days after today until my free day! That’s cool. I can make it.

      July 14, 2004  Today was a fairly rough day, again. I got a phenomenal night’s sleep once again…which meant that, yes, I discarded any notion of getting up early for weight-lifting. I awoke happy and refreshed at 8:15am and decided to call the rec center to see if the baby-sitting service had any openings. Lo and behold, they did! So I had them put us down for a 10:30 appointment, and from then on it was a mad rush to get the kids fed and all of us dressed and ready to go. We made it there and, much to my surprise, Henry had a great time. He was not even remotely ready to leave when I came to get them. Yay! This means we will be doing our lower body weight-lifting later in the day henceforth and hereafter. I know first thing in the morning is best for all workouts, but it really isn’t practical for me. I’ll still try to shoot for an occasional first-thing workout, but for the most part I’m better off doing a lengthier workout later on.   I was having a miserable time later, though. Major headache, plus it’s only 9:29pm and I’m dog-tired and ready for bed. I could not seem to stop snacking today – it was like a freight train, it had so much momentum. I did limit myself to a bite of each thing. But let’s just say I sampled way too much of this and that. I’m skipping my BFL-sanctioned evening snack, as a result.  The lower body weight lifting was great – my legs were trembling from the effort, even when I was actually done working my legs. I was doing sit-ups on the mat and my knees were still movin’ and groovin’ all by themselves! So it’s off to bed, now. Scale this morning shows I am down 3.5 pounds, but of course not all of that is bonafide fat loss. But I’m still pretty pleased. I’m going to try to skip the scale tomorrow and add in a looonnng walk outside with the kids on top of my treadmill workout. Goals. Ya Gotta Have ‘Em.

      July 13, 2004  OK, Day Two. I’m hanging in there. Surprised? I can understand that. I slept like the dead last night (with a little help from the pharmaceutical world) from 9pm until 8am. Yes, yeeesssssss, I skipped the morning call of duty for a whopping two days in a row. I got up and had my favorite eggs-and-oatmeal breakfast (despite the fact that it’s what I ate for dinner the night before), had some coffee and ran off to walk around the mall with Jennifer and the girls. Then we came back here for a little bit to thoroughly exhaust the kids and then she went home to put her kids down for a nap and I did the same.  Of course I knew what I had to do. There are still plenty of days when I *don’t* get the kids to sleep at the same time, so I still feel lucky when they do drop off simultaneously. I yanked on my workout clothes and hit the treadmill. I did my 20 minutes of sprints, followed by another 25 minutes of fierce incline work. That is haaaaaaard. I had to take it in 30-second chunks, emotionally. Meaning I would say to myself “OK, just get through the next 30 seconds before you decide to quit…”, and so on.  But I finished strong and felt plenty good.  I also got some good news afterward: my fucking stroller is finally on its way, which I was able to independently verify through FedEx’s website so I know they’re not just bullshitting me, still. It should be here Saturday, which, appropriately enough is my 33rd birthday. Voon-der-barr. A Mountain Buggy Urban Double for me, tra la!  I made the Eating-for-LIFE Chicken Parmesan recipe, which is outrageously delicious. Snarfed that down and am about to go get myself and the kids bathed and in bed. You see, if I skip the call of duty tomorrow, that lower body workout won’t get done. There’s just no way to do that kind of weight-lifting what what I have at home. Hence, my early bedtime. G’night, faithful friends.

      July 12, 2004  Uuuuhhhhhh. What an awful day this has been. I could   not   fall asleep for love or money last night. I think I dropped off sometime after 3:30am. Do I really need to tell you that I did  not  answer the call of duty at 5am?  But all is not lost! I did my workout at home (upper body weights – very easy to manage at home with just dumbbells), and on an empty stomach, to boot. Yay, me! But I am bone-tired, and I haven’t eaten on schedule, either. I have had perhaps 2 of the 3 meals I should’ve consumed by mid-day. This evening will be better, and I plan to crash early. My crucial wake-up call is actually tomorrow morning, as aerobic workouts MUST be done first thing on an empty stomach. And there’s no way I can just disappear behind a closed door to run on the treadmill for 20 minutes when the kids are awake. So I absolutely have to do it before Eug leaves for work.  So that’s all for right now. I am tired and crabby and hungry, even though I just ate. I need a major nap, but I don’t want to be too awake for bedtime. So I’m just going to harumph on out of here and see you tomorrow.

      July 11, 2004  Bon soir. It is the night before I am  on  again, full-time. The good news is that my progress early on should certainly be dramatic, because after yesterday’s party, I am more bloated than ever! (Need a sub for one of the giant balloon floats in a parade? Call me!) I am food-comatose and yes, even a little hungover from all the ‘Blue Mojitos’ and Jell-O shots I did yesterday. Ugh.  But the alarm is set for 5:10 am and my workout clothes are laid out. I have no appropriate BFL food, really, but I have just enough to squeak by for breakfast and a mid-morning snack, thank God. So I’ll have a one-egg-and-three-egg-whites omelet and a bowl of quick oats with a little Splenda. I’ll have a nutrition bar in the diaper bag when I go for Xanthe’s annual ped appointment tomorrow morning, and then I can race to the grocery store right after. Gotta remember to bring my Eating For Life book when I go.  OK, that’s all – just a quick howdy. I need some sleep, big time. My limbs are still aching from the hostessing I did on Saturday – I think I sat down once all day…literally. So I’m going to lay down now and hope that I don’t feel like a corpse tomorrow morning.

      July 2, 2004  Hey, there! Are you still with me? I do hope so, because I have a bit of news. Heather threw me a lifeline…she told me she got the BFL book and she’s ready to give it a whirl. And she wants me to be her support buddy. Which means I have to get back on the wagon, kids.   So here’s the hoo-ha. The Monday after the party is D-Day. July 12th. Look for more blogging from me then, because I’m turning over that leaf once more. :^D

      August 9, 2004  Sorry I haven’t posted in a while. I think I’m depressed about how hard this has been. Consequently, I’ve had a crappy week. I skipped exercise 3 days this week and finally got my butt on the treadmill tonight for 66-odd minutes. A very good workout – I did one 20-minute sprint set, followed by 25 minutes of incline, and then another 20-minute sprint set. VERY tiring.  I’ve been muddling my way through this and indulging in junk food when I’m feeling low. Nothing outrageous, but I’m not doing nearly as well as I need to in the eating department if I want to actually lose some weight.   I’m hoping I can pull it together this week, but the way I’m feeling right now makes me think that it’s going to be a steep uphill climb in order to do so. Sorry to give too much information, but it’s been a long time since I had a… ahem …female cycle, and I think it’s got me all out-of-whack, hormonally. (And, no, I am not pregnant. I swear.) I feel bloated and tired and cranky all the time.  Of course, it stands to reason. I am, after all, carrying a lot of extra weight around. I imagine that I’d be hopping all over the joint if I were fifty pounds lighter. But getting this weight off is proving to be very hard, indeed.  I try to remind myself that if I just keep plugging away, even if I only lose a pound every ten days or so, then by next year I will be looking good and feeling even better. But I’m not immune to wanting the weight-loss equivalent of get-rich-quick schemes.   Gee, I’m sounding really pathetic, aren’t I? I guess I am feeling sort of pathetic, truth be told. I treated myself to some workout clothes from Target tonight. They have the best stuff, aside from the really expensive Nike seamless sans couture line. If I ever get rich, I’m going to live in Nike seamless sans couture.  If you feel like it, post a pick-me-up comment for me and I’ll love you forever.

      August 3, 2004  Let me first get you up-to-date. Sorry I haven’t posted in a while, but these blogs are far from my only writing project. I can honestly say that I am averaging a couple of hours of writing each day, now.  Anyway, here’s some of what I wrote on Sunday. After this, I’ll tell you about today:  August 1, 2004 My friends have told me they’re impressed and somewhat put off by the length of my workouts. They tell me, somewhat incredulously, that they could never log an hour on the treadmill. What I don’t think they realize is that I have a hard-and-fast rule that governs my aerobic exercise days: I tell myself I must complete twenty minutes of hard effort. I never plan to do any more than twenty minutes, and if I catch myself thinking that I will go for longer, I put the brakes on that train right then and there.   At the end of that twenty minutes, I’m always out of water, anyway, so I have to stop. I breathe and stretch and quietly evaluate how I feel. If I feel tired and worn, I stop for the day. That’s it. I don’t spend another second thinking “Gee, maybe I could sneak in a little exercise later.” I’m done, and I’m happy with what I did. If, on the other hand, I feel kind of jazzed, I consider going for another twenty minutes. It’s always twenty-minute blocks, because that’s what constitutes a reasonable block of time for me. One day this past week, I had already done forty minutes of sprints, and I really wanted to do more, but I didn’t think I could go another twenty without stopping. So I did the last twenty in five minute chunks, stopping after each sprint to catch my breath and drink my water. You see, it’s whatever I can handle any given day.  Today was a good day: 70 minutes and 15 seconds, 5.0 miles on the dot, and 564 calories. I did two sets of sprints, followed by an incline workout, topped off with ten minutes of fast walking until I hit the five mile mark. Oh, and I did 50 crunches because when I got up this morning I could actually see that my stomach was a little less poochy than it had been, and it inspired me.   OK, back to today. I made it to the Rec Center yesterday and one of the employees/trainers took pity on my dumb ass and actually showed me how to use the calf raise machine. I had only been employing about *half* the force and range of the machine. Duh. I immediately had to take the weight down by ten pounds because doing it properly was so fucking hard it nearly brought tears to my eyes. Stupidity notwithstanding, I must’ve been getting a fairly decent workout doing it the wrong way, because my calf muscles are looking G-U-D. Put me in a pair of spike heels and I’ll bet you’d whistle. I can hardly wait to see what’ll happen to my calves now that I know how to do that move correctly! Yeesh.  Today I got on the treadmill and hated every fucking nanosecond of it. No realization a few minutes in that I’ve started to feel good, no afterglow, no nothin’. I did forty minutes but I sorely wanted to quit after twenty. I just reminded myself what a pussy I’d be if I did only twenty and how I would not be able to enjoy the pizza I’m going to eat tonight with our buddies Dan and Nicole if I did not squeeze at least forty minutes out of my fat ass. Yes, I got through it today fueled only by self-hatred, LOL.   Speaking of pizza and self-hatred, the goddamned scale WILL NOT MOVE. I should be happy it’s not moving   upward  , I suppose, but I’m not. This is like a SNL skit – amusing at first, but then it drags on way too fucking long to be funny already. Tomorrow will be a good day. Eug is taking a vacation day so we can go to the Rec Center as a family and play in the pool and splash pad with the kids. But first we have to run the gauntlet of a portrait appointment for the kids, so cross your fingers for us that the offspring smile big and sit pretty. I’ll try to update on Thursday, faithful friends.
