      I am sitting here thinking about some things that are heavy on the brain for a early Wednesday morning. Sleep isn't my friend right now, so I've decided to share some thoughts. I left Baltimore, MD last night only to come back home to my reality. Life is grand, my brothers are good, HE is fine, and my parents seem to be extremely happy. No one was upset by the piercing of my nose, nor did they have much to say about the fact later either. I miss lei already. It's funny how you don't think of things while they occur at that very moment, but when there's time and air for thoughts, it all comes to u at one time. I enjoyed the time I spent there, and am looking forward to visiting again: when? I don't know, but I know it won't be another full year. Today I ran some errands. My bus pulled into the station 2 mins late, and I was ready to come home, bathe, and take care of the things that needed taking care of. I got my clothes off of layaway, bought another cordless phone, did some other shopping for personal knick knacks and whathaveyou, and finally sat down to write a friend of mine a letter. I walked into my room today only to find a letter from someone who was once the world to me, but has been dropped to just "existing." How awful that appears to be written before my eyes, but it's true. I couldn't use the ink in my pen to respond, didn't want to send my words via air, and regretted thinking about wasting my time to even share my views on the letter.  Life is funny. There are so many mazes to sift thru, so many challenges to overcome, and after all of that is done: you still have to live...... Goodnight/morning   ~Mindful~

        Aha.. it's been almost 2 years since I posted something on this particular site.. Wow.. I cannot belive that, can you? Yes, it's your gurl once again, with heavy thoughts as usual.  A lot has taken place since my last entry. Now, let's see; I've graduated from college, got back with my ex boyfriend, moved into my own apartment, and now.. I am in the process of searching for another job.  Can you believe I am still in Statesboro, Ga?  The cost of living here is cheap, and I plan on staying here until I can save enough money, then move farther north.  I've got my eyes on Baltimore.. ahh.. B-more.. Wouldn't you know that I haven't been there since my trip in 2001.. A lot has taken place, and when I type a lot.. I mean, a lot.. I cannot believe that it has been nearly 2 years since I graced my blogger with some thoughts... *shh*. I've been sharing all of them with diaryland.. Don't be mad with me, but it's been a little more comforting over there, I know where everything is, and I don't have to search for certain functions and things of that sort. So, I'm Assitant Manager with an Urban Clothing store here, and I am dying to get out of this job... I graduated with a B. S. in Psychology and  minor in Writing.  You should see me running around this little ass town trying to find another job, things are ridiculously slow around here.  I mailed off 2 more resumes this morning, let's hope something comes up   *crosses fingers*  Since it looks like I will be surpassing my time frame to be employed elsewhere (I set my goal for the 1st of August in mid June), I've set another goal for myself, which is October.  I am hoping to have another job, one more stable, with better pay, and so far from retail I forget I ever worked in it, so that I can rest... easier at night.. Hopefully, this will be the case soon :-).. If not.. I know how.. to continue looking for gigs around this town, and one day.. Maybe, just maybe, I'll commute... I must apologize for neglecting you for this long, but.. life calls.. and honestly.. I'd forgotten I had a blog.. really, I did.. Forgive me.......   Since I already have an online diary.. I've decided to make this spot my home for poetry.. ya dig?  Since I am a writer, I will place my wonderful thoughts here.. ahh.. sometimes, they're wonderful.. other times.. they're there to help a sister's heart beat regularly.. ya dig?  So.. here's the first one for you guys to read..... entitled..  On Love .  I done gave up on love, threw my hands up to the sky, and told the Lawd, send it to someone else, cuz I've had my time with love. in its most inviting stance, love can make you forget you're human, make you lose your mind, and hang on to the worst thing that could ever happen to your life (a worthless man). love ain't flowers  and candies on valentine's day wrapped up nicely, smiling and waiting to be opened.. it's drama filled days and sleepless nights, hot showers alone,  and too many wet pillows.... love ain't for everyone, on its worst days, it's not even for the romantic... I've denounced love, because it's brought me  nothing but.. pain....  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt  2003 All rights reserved

         The War Has Just Begun  The Witness (Part 2)  and as she stopped, I saw vanessa clinching a small silver blade in her hand, smiling (like she always does). the gurl... once shouting, mouth wide, now scared, hands covering her screams, darted her eyes my way, while I sat, legs still dangling, fingertips cold, and body shaking. The war has just begun.  I, conscious of what was about to go down, ran up my stairs shouting, "momma, momma, come quick." my mother with her hair  wrapped up in a scarf, sucked her teeth and reminded me  that her stories were on, and it had better be important. ... "momma, vanessa out  there bout to cut one of dem gurls with a blade." "What!!!"  We ran back outside, witnessed  the dark  blood leaking from the corners of  the gurl's mouth, and knew we were too late. vanessa with her too bad to be good self stood there, not in shock... more like relieved. dabbed the blade on her   skirt , and casually walked off.  The other gurls ran home, kicking up dust for miles. My mother taunted vanessa, screaming cuss words, and telling her she "better get back here,"  couldn't' believe what  had happened.  And in the end,, We were witnesses to nothing at all..  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

      Just a little something I plan to make a series...     the war has just begun (Part 1)   she clinches her fist tight to her chest, feeling the woman she's become, so young... yet, so old. this gurl, the daughter of many ancestors passed, her main goal is--- taking on the world at her leisure.. tried and true, ms... "lemme have this for 50 cents, and I'll pay you back" typa gurl. never willing to pay her debt, the war has just begun.  her hands show ages of insight, just not seen by others. I remember chatting with her, never saying much, she'd respond here or there, and nod her head a time or two. "you like talking, huh?" she loved to ask me that. not watching her like I should, she'd dip in and out of my life. curious to know him, her, and him too. she never found her own spotlight..  on our street, not too far from mrs. lee, and mrs. brown, she'd skip with her bows and beads, all smiles. i wasn't fond of her, she stole from the candy lady and everyone knew it. so a gang of gurls followed her home from school one day, one shouting, "I saw you, I saw you," just as loud as the day is clear... ran up on her first...  I was sitting on my porch, legs dangling, eating a dreamsicle, and casually trying to lick the vanilla goodness from my fingers... when I heard them. vanessa (that's her name), all smiles, still skipping, ignored the chants, and lost her mind. the gurl who was shouting, suddenly stopped.. and for the life of me, I didn't know why. the war has just begun.  ©Tremaine L.

        Retail Hell  Something else has to be..... fresh... people screaming, ignorant customers thinking their words mean more to me than they should.. I honestly don't give a fuck about your purchase, I am getting paid next friday  whether you buy this shirt or not...  Hell, retail is a big ass dark cloud swarming around like gnats waiting to bite the shit outta you.. and I can't take another bite. My arms and legs itch from scratching so damn hard in one area.  Each day is a new journey down hell's lane. From registers crashing, to special sales, and women asking me if they can "take one shoe out to the car and match it up with a shirt," my mind's lost its angle. I've forgotten my goal, now.. I mope, praying, hoping, wishing for something better to "stop by for just a little while." But, it hasn't showed itself yet, and I am here.. I am here... wanting to be its next victim, cuz retail done fucked me dry. All in all, I'm one tired motherfucker looking for a  dream.. that still hasn't come true.  ©Tremaine L.

      The War Has Just Begun   Waiting It Out (Part 3)  so, vanessa walked off into what seemed to be a gloomier than gloomy night, while my mother and I watched over this gurl. who was she anyway? and why did vanessa do what she did? I remember them shouting at her, was this gurl part of the same crew that taunted vanessa  at school every single day? making fun of her clothes,  her hair, her.. not so.. new shoes??? The war has just begun.  "Yes, this is Claire, we need an ambulance at 122 E. Main St. A little gurl, I'm guessing maybe 13 has been cut. Please send someone  immediately." My mom was shouting into the operator's ear, while crying at the same time.. I looked at her, and then she at me; "mom, why are u crying, do you know this gurl?" "No baby, but this could have easily been you." I hugged her, just to feel her close to me since what she needed was just that, at that very moment.  The ambulance arrived twenty minutes  later, yes.. twenty minutes later. I sat there, watched this gurl's eyes fade in and out, then thought.. *what if this was me?* "Can you tell me your name, sweety? My name is Josh. I'm with the EMT, can u tell me your name?" And then, with a hush of chopped up syllables, the gurl spoke; "I---ttt's A--mm--aand-aa." Oh My God! Amanda, I know this gurl. Yeah... that's why vanessa cut  her, that's why.  Remembering that day at school in the cafeteria, Amanda was that chick pushing vanessa,  trashing her in front of the entire 4th period Lunch, and I...  sat there, and did nothing. and as soon as I remembered this, I  didn't feel bad anymore, didn't care about what vanessa had done. In all honesty, I kinda felt relieved too, and wondered where vanessa went. I wanted to go be with her, and wait it out, because a crime had been committed, and she.. was the culprit.  ©Tremaine L.

      The War Has Just Begun  No home for vanessa (Part 4)  I wanted to go be with her,  and wait it out...  I followed vanessa's path, the tracks of her worn  keds showed me the way. a frail gurl, curly hair, lonely, dark eyes, she was sitting under her house when i arrived. it was a big place. a big and uninviting place. The war has just begun.  "Hey." "What do you want?" "You cut that gurl's mouth in  front of my house, and you wanna know what I want? Sup with you?" "I was tired of her talking trash about me." "So that's it, you just cut  her, then leave?" vaneesa shrugged her shoulders  and cramped up into herself,  rocking her body back and forth.  "Why are you under the house?" "It's quiet here. No one bothers me when I'm here." "Yeah, but you're under your house.  not many people find that comforting." "Well, I do." I watched her.  She smelled of wind and sun, like summertime trying to form into fall. I never liked  that smell. "I'm not many people." "You're right, you're not."  I wondered where her parents were. This was an odd time for no one to be home, no cars in the driveway, no other kids' voices to be heard. Where was  everyone?  "Where are your parents?" "My mom died when I was 10, and my dad is never home." "Do you have any brothers or sisters?" "You ask too many questions." "Well, do you?" "No, now leave me alone."  I sat there with her, kinda hovered over her in the dark, waiting. She seemed comfortable,  and I... well, I was trying to be  there for someone who didn't want me to be; but somehow, I didn't care. We sat there, among mud,  bugs, and the stale air counting the hours as they passed,  Alone.  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

      Part 5 (the last installment) of the Series will be up soon.  Just taking a break from it... I'm kinda diggin this one you guys.  Peacers~    Enough  I tried to love you like the sun waiting to be shown on sunday mornings... wanted to bless you everyday with phrases such as: "I love you baby, to the moon and back," "I love you now more than ever," and "I'll love you even when everyone else has given up on you." But... you took my hand and scribbled "negative" on your heart to negate anything positive I brought your way. Shit... *pauses* I can  remember us ridin' around, holding hands, whispering good sounds into each other's ears... 'Member us trying to be grown. 'Member wanting not to be like our parents, and  alas... we are more like them than we can see. I love you still.  No more of us, cuz we're 2 different. No more of us cuz there are other tendencies easing up the small of my  back and they no longer  require you to soothe them. No more of us "agreeing to disagree."  I know when I've had enough, and today is one of those days.  *kisses your troubles away* *walks out door* We were nothing more but high school sweethearts trying to hold on to  high school sweetheart status.  ©Tremaine L.

      The War Has Just Begun (Part 5)  The End  I sat there with her,  kinda hovered over her in the dark,  waiting. She seemed comfortable,  and I... well, I was trying to be  there for someone who didn't  want me to be; but somehow, I didn't  care.  We sat there, among mud,  bugs, and the stale air  counting the hours as they passed,   Alone.   A police car pulled up in front of  the big, old house. vanessa and I could see it from where we were, it was a policeman. We both knew where this was going. He slowly pulled into the driveway, got  out of his patrol car with his chest poked out: showing off his ego. We watched. Still. Peaceful. Good little gurls. He straddled, checking for his nightstick and other officer paraphernalia. We  weren't impressed.  *bang bang bang* He knocked away at the door. We still sat there, trying not to  breathe.. *bang bang bang* "Is anyone there? This is Officer Pelote." He manned the front door, blowing off steam, and awaiting an answer. *bang bang bang* "Hello! This is the Windermere Police. If anyone's home, I'd like to come in and talk with you about a little gurl named vanessa."  vanessa shrugged her shoulders,  and dashed from under the house on her knees. I cried. I noticed her shadow getting  smaller. She was brave. She was being the vanessa I loved to hate. "I'm home, and I'm vanessa." "You know what I'm here for,  don't you little one?" "Yeah. It's cuz I did something  I wasn't sposed to." "Yes, and you're in a lot of  trouble, but we'll talk about that down at the station. Where are your parents?" "My daddy ain't here, and I don't know where he is either." "Your mother?" "Dead." "Is there a family member I can call to...?" "No."  "Okay then, come with me."  Officer Pelote took vanessa by the hand, escorted her to the back of his car, and nodded... as if he knew I was there watching them.  I sat there, wiping the tears away from my face and mixing them with the dirt. vanessa wasn't even scared, but I was... for her.  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

      little gurls don't do this/that  little gurls love their daddies, they don't want anything more than a forehead kiss @ nite and a big daddy hug...squeezed just right. little gurls don't inch into  grown folks' buisness, with "mama you said this, remember?" because mama don't play that  shit.  I've watched little gurl stay stuck in her shell, scared of leaving, and I've  blown the dust from between my fingers; digging in dirt trying to retrieve my roots; little gurls don't hate their mothers... They prance around with her heels on, getting first dibs on vanity. They smack their lips, suck their  teeth, and remain little gurls,  even in the cloudiest of  environments.  I've tugged onto little gurl, afraid to let her go, because grown women don't need direction. Grown women can't fall into their fathers' laps and dream about days before divorces and second wives. And I find myself wanting to be a little gurl again, sucking in the airyness that was my life. Blending in with the shadiest of crowds... Pulling my past back  into me... I am not a little gurl anymore   or am I?  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

      Belgian Waffles (Part 1)  I, sitting little gurl  style at the kitchen table, legs crossed, and eyes squared directly on mommy, smelled the  freshness coming from the stove. She, with her hair tied back, sweat dripping from her nose, and exasperated "woos" leave her mouth, flips and pats our waffles just rite.  my little brother pacifies himself with boy toys and rubs  snot deep into his skin. I giggle because he's 2 and  he doesn't know any better. my sister with my father's eyes waltzes into the kitchen with her sweater tied around her waist, sniffing for waffles, kisses  my mother on her cheek and mushes my hair. she's the oldest.  we wait. inhaling the time our mother has put into perhaps silencing our stomachs' growls. we watch. in hopes of one day granting our children  the same pleasure.  she flips and pats  once more, then serves us love no one else can.  ©Tremaine L.

      Belgian Waffles Part 2 (Daddy's home)  she flips and pats  once more, then serves us love no one else can.  I'm still short enough to swing my legs while sitting at the kitchen table. my mom huffs and says, "little gurls keep their legs closed  in the presence of men and boys." she was speaking of my brother  and father. I glanced at the clock  housed inside our stove, it's green numbers read 10:20, and I heard my father's voice.  "Morning baby." He kisses my mom on her cheek, slaps her butt, then makes his way to the table to greet danny (my brother) and I. mom sways over to us, grabs our plates, and nods to me as if she was trying to say, "be nice, ciera." "Good morning daddy. How are you?" "Fine ciera. Sorry daddy couldn't be here to tuck you in last nite, got stuck at the plant; but I'll make it up today, later on. How does ice cream sound?" "Ice cream sounds good." He walks past me and over to danny, kisses his cheek,  and butts heads. Must have been some sort of man to boy code my mother and I were unaware of.   Charlotte excuses herself, picks up her plate, and nods to daddy. They don't say much to each other, but daddy kinda half-way smiles at her to acknowledge his oldest. We sit and watch daddy inhale his waffles and bacon; both cold from waiting on him, but he doesn't seem to care. Mom hovers over the sink, sighs, and wipes her face.  She'll be crying in bed tonite.  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

      Belgian Waffles Part 3 (Mommy cries for help)  Mom hovers over the sink, sighs, and wipes her face.  She'll be crying in bed tonite.  Daddy left the kitchen and went directly to the bathroom. I heard mommy mumbling some angry jibberish, and I said nothing. when she gets like this, it's best that danny and I stay outta the way. a few minutes later, daddy emerges dressed and ready for a day none of us knew anything about. he half-kissed mom's cheek and slid back over to the table  to kiss us goodbye as well. we nodded. danny, wiping leftover syrup from his lip, and me, making invisible funny faces with my finger tips  on the table cloth...  mommy cleaned us up and prepared herself for another saturday afternoon with no husband around. Walzting outta the bathroom, she sashayed down our foyer and turned to her bedroom. I eased in behind her, and said, "Mommy, I heard you crying  this morning. Are you okay?"  She stops in mid-step, looks at the expression on my face, and kinda mouthed "Yes," before saying it aloud. I nodded...   Our Saturdays are usually filled with  helping mommy clean the house, and then going shopping. We cleaned, but did not visit the mall or the grocery store. Mommy's eyes were blood-shot red, and her head she said was "throbbing," *whatever that means* It was 6:30pm on the clock sitting on mommy's nitestand, and I knew daddy and I were not going for ice cream like he promised. I kissed mommy on her forehead, closed her door, and walked down the hall to my room.  I heard mommy again. This time, she wasn't hiding her cries, she was screaming, "God, please... no, not again!" I said to myself before turning  to Nickelodeon, "not again, what," and sank in the sounds of the Fairly Oddparents, drowning out mommy's wails.  It's 8:45pm, and still no daddy.  ©Tremaine L.

      Belgian Waffles Part 4 (Losing Mommy)  It's 8:45pm, and still no daddy.  I turned off my t.v. and  pulled the covers over my head. I heard what sounded like keys  jingling in our front door. *must be daddy* No, it's Charlotte. I guess  she's back from the mall with her friends. She creeps into my room to give me a kiss goodnite. "Nite, lil bit." "G'nite."  I watched my sister step away from my bed, close my door, and patter next door to her own room. *Where's Daddy?* Mommy must be sleep, the crying has stopped, and there's no sound  coming from her room. I tip-toe down the hall, softly knock on her door, and wait. *knock knock* No answer. *knock knock* "Mommy, it's ciera. Can I come in?" Still nothing.  I gave myself permission to go inside... just to check on her.  "Mommy?" There was blood trickling from mommy's wrists, her eyes were wide open, and her mouth was too. I didn't cry. I just stood there waiting for her to blink or cough to let me know she was playing a game... one that I couldn't join in on. I pushed her arm, tugged onto her shirt,  still nothing. I felt a scream come outta me "Charlotte... Charlotte... It's mommy!" Charlotte hurried down the hall, grasped my arm with one hand and held her mouth with the other. "Step back ciera." She pulled the covers over mommy's  face, and sat down beside her.  "I have to call 911, okay Ciera." "Okay. Mommy's just playing a  game. This isn't like her to play this long." I knew she was dead, I didn't wanna believe it, couldn't say it... It was there, on my tongue, like new spit waiting to be rid of, but I couldn't say it. "No, mommy's not playing. She's  dead, Ciera. She won't be  playing anymore." 2 tears fell from Charlotte's eyes and landed into the crease of her left palm.   I just stood there, cold, tired, and in disbelief.   ©Tremaine L.

      Belgian Waffles Part 5 (Saying Goodbye)  I just stood there, cold, tired, and in disbelief.  the amublance came,  they put mommy on something Charlotte said was called a  "gurney" and rolled her outta the house. i asked if they were going to save her and the man with the funny looking mustache said, "there's nothing we can do sweetheart. she was already dead when we got here."  i went to danny's room, made sure he was still asleep. he was. i heard daddy's voice, he was screaming, loud and again and again. "Sarah, Baby, I'm sorry. No, just  lemme touch her, please. I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry." what was he sorry for? sorry for making mommy cry all of the time? sorry for not  keeping his promise about ice cream? sorry for never being there when we need him? what could he possibly be sorry for?  Charlotte tugged my jammies, then picked me up and gave me a long-tite hug... i found comfort in her bosom. sadened, confused, but not alone. i escaped from her grasp, ran down the stairs, and tapped the man with the funny mustache on his leg. "what can i do for you little lady?" "can i tell my mommy goodbye?" "yes sweetheart, you sure can." "goodbye mommy." i froze. stood there watching them prop the gurney inside the ambulance and waved.  Charlotte came to get me from outside, she was crying. Her eyes were red from the pain. We walked,  hand in hand, back into our house... that would no longer be a home.  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

      Belgian Waffles Part 6 (Getting By)  We walked,  hand in hand, back into our house... that would no longer be a home.  Daddy was sitting on the top stair with his hands covering his face, sobbing like some little school-boy. I looked up at Charlotte, her face was steaming red, like if I were to  touch it, the heat from it would burn my skinny fingers. She winced at him, clasped her grip to me even tighter, and I ... confused at what was taking place, just held on.  "You are the cause of all of this. You always were, and you always will be." Charlotte's words were sharp as they were painful. Daddy looked up from his  hands, his eyes red, lashes sticking to each other and said, "I never meant to hurt her. I never meant..." Charlotte didn't seem pleased. She picked me up, carried me down the hall, and laid me in my bed. She sat beside me until I fell asleep.  "Please tell me you don't hate me. I don't think I can have my oldest gurl hating me for the rest of my life." I was awakened by what seemed to be  a mixture of Daddy's sobbing, and  Charlotte's high-pitched screaming. "I don't hate you, but I don't like you. What are we going to do without momma? Who's going to be here when I get home from school? Who's going to help Ciera when I'm at cheerleading practice? Who's going to take care of Danny?" I heard her cry out loud, and I crept from my bed, tip-toed down the hall, and took my place by the kitchen wall.  "Are you okay, Charlotte.?" I hadn't realized a tear was  trickling down my face. I hadn't  realized it was past 2:00 am, and that I wasn't supposed to be out of bed. "I'm okay lil bit. You should be in bed." She said to me as she wiped her face. "Why are you crying then? Are you going to leave like mommy too?" "No, lil bit. I ain't going  anywhere. Daddy might tho."  What did she mean? Where  was Daddy going? "You leave, I can take care of them on my own. You never bothered to help mommy out anyway. Charlotte, a budding 18-year old "Straight-A student" mouthed off to Daddy as if he'd stolen  her most prized possession. And maybe,  he had. "I can't leave you guys on your own. It wouldn't be rite. Your momma  wouldn't rest at all." "Go to her, don't act like a father now. She's been keeping you away from us this long, now shouldn't be any different."  My father looked up at me, pulled me into his arms and whispered, "I still owe you some ice cream." He got up from the table,  straddled down the hall, and  before we could turn around, I heard the sound we link to him the most... the door slowly closing behind him. Charlotte sat there twiddling her  thumbs and biting her lower lip. We were going to be on our  own from now on.  "Don't worry lil bit, we'll get by.  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

      mr. valentine  today, i put on a robe of red with pink  flowers at the bottom in memory of our fucked up fling.  ur daughter called me up to say hi, wished me a happy valentine's day (like i really cared), and i told her that was sweet of her, but... i had to be  on my way. i wasn't really going anywhere, but she didn't know that shit, and she wasn't going to find out. i don't wrap myself in  your old red towel, or slip my feet in your black house shoes. i've thrown those things away.  u've got this permanent spot on my rug from  my iron. i dropped it  the other day, and the shape it made, looks just like your screwed up face. i haven't bought any chocolates, haven't accepted any cards. i barely answer my fone on this day, and i owe it all to you. mr. valentine. you are  the bullshit i hate the  most.  ©Tremaine L.

      "Aht Uh Mi Hed"  i haven't been this open. there was a time when love burds meant more to me than crayon writing  on construction paper. my mind was working hard on you today, yesterday, and the day before...  graveyard shift style, ya know? with the backaches and all. how do they say it? a "jones." that's what older folx call it. but naw, i'm hooked on you. addicted. i have my certified "crazy in love" papers to prove it.  i stand aside, in the shadows, watching you love ____ the way you  do, and i wish i could rise  above your standards, so that you'd pick me over _____.  it's okay to be friends, best friends even. blending so well with each other, but love's too damn smart for me. she knows what i'm doing. hell, she always has.  and i've tried to cut  corners with her, ya know? split even, assign goals for  myself that i know i'll never reach, just so i DON'T have to think about you. i wanna tell you. but what we have, is too brite to dim with  my news. and all news ain't good news. so i sit. i wait. i watch. i pray for a fuckup on _______'s behalf, and u know i'll be rite there/here.  we take pictures. build mini scrapbooks to house our memories, and i smile at each one knowing every day brings me  closer to loving you more than i did the day before. but at nite, i share these  feelings with my queen-sized  bed, four pillows, and a stuffed puppy a friend gave me,  instead of you.  just once, i'd like to get you off of my mind and out of my head. but, that would mean losing you, and i canNOT do that.  ©Tremaine L.

      The Unknown: Part I (An Introduction)  in the cold corners  of cobblestone drive, stood a shadow lost in the chipped bricks and sawdust behind "Legends" nite club. its movements were parallel to each student waltzing in and out of the purple entrance door on saturday nites when the  wind blew just above the trees and below the abandoned houses  with missing addresses (numbers)...  the unknown has always been fascinating to kittens, dogs, and the like. no one questions it. they move along, not knowing its there. they go about with their nitely clubbing sensing its presence, but no one ever comes near it. it has a way of working itself  into a daily schedule of becoming the town's best (un)known voyeur.  in the cold corners  of cobblestone drive,  stood a shadow. he waits and waits. time is  of no essence to him. his patience has outdone the many officers taking "no doz" for the stakeouts that keep them up past their bedtimes. he sees all, knows all, and  has the answers to every question ever thought of.  the unknown has always been a predator. he picks the  rite victim to pounce on, stretches his arms outward,  and lies deeply within his/her  skin, burying himself for a spell. "once bitten," the victim rises above all expected of him or her, and bows to the  unknown's every command. eventually, they die. and the unknown starts all over again.  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

      sunt lacrimae rerum (there are tears for things)  there are tears for things like: watching a baby take his or her number 1 step into becoming not just a baby, but "look at my child, taking her first step," candlelit dinners, nicely packaged  engagement rings awaiting a well-thought out proposal  to a future fiance', and tears for scratching your grandmother's back when she can't "quite" reach it just because, she would do the same thing for u.  she wallks off into the future, leaving you behind. her destination: adulthood. you, as the parent, nod... shake your head in disbelief, and finally let her "grow up," knowing where she will end up later has been predestined, because  she made it that way. u watch her as she packs, moving from side to side hurriedly--- because her flite leaves  prompltly at 5:05pm, and it is now 3:45.   she looks just like you,  and her father has  never been there/here for any important event in her life, but you have... and  you always will be. you cry constantly. chest-heaving, breaths interrupted because "your baby is leaving," but not for long. she'll visit. call. write. send cyber hugs your way because  you guys are "that close."  there are tears for things like: trying to figure out your sexuality, congrautlating your youngest sibling on his college graduation day, because he is not only your youngest sibling now, but he is "my baby brother done graduated from college," sibling, and tears for scraped knees from running home at nite, trying to "beat the first street lite."  he can't get you out of  his heart. he's tried, but with every blink, your silhouette appears, reminding him of the love he has lost. he writes poems for you. on napkins. notepads. on his two cocoa-brown hands. you were his queen, and  forever will be.  he cries at nite for you, knowing far away, you are not doing the same thing. for you have moved on. a husband. two beautiful gurls, a boy, and a dog. a home.  he does not have the fulfillment you have come to know. so he sheds tear after tear because he believes it is alrite to do so.   ©Tremaine L.

      The Unknown Part 2 (Victim 1- Shelby)  Shelby, a lush, appreciates a good, strong drink.  her slanted eyes (although not by nature) view what can only induce sleepiness in a short period of time. at 20, she's all every man wants. 36-26-34,  Shelby flirts and shares herself  with many. Careless, and unaware of what is to come.  The Unknown watches her nitely. he glances in and out of dark corners while she skips from cab to cab  making her nitely rounds. he's been noticing her since 04/17/1996, and  he's branded her as his... He jumps into what used to be a perfect  body, making his way carefully through each bone, and then deep into her soul. she's his now.  Shelby, a lush, appreciates a good, strong drink. She's what her mother dubs as "that  God damned heathen of a daughter of mine," no longer flirts or shares herself with many. A hermit, dwelling in solitude. She counts the days  she believes it will take for her to die.  Her passions have become the stories little gurls line their diaries with, and then hide under their mattresses.  The Unknown has succeeded. for she is victim one. Location: Statesboro, Georgia. His plan: defeat tramps of  all ages, shapes, and sizes.  His goal: drain what life  remains in them. The yearning is more profound than anyone  will ever know. His duty: installing the suicide activation chip in  gurls with low self-esteem.   Shelby, a lush, appreciated a good, strong drink. Here lies Shelby.  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

      simpliste  the sun is at rest, his arms folded, eyes closed... he's tired of waking up to the same ole redundance that his life warrants. wonder what the clouds think of him. wonder how they mix and match so well up in that big ole sky. who reads to them at nite? the moon? the man? or the  stars?  he's got this glow no one else can master. have u seen him? shining all of the time... i wish i could be like him. happy but not happy with his common stance. a peon among all that is worshipped. he is my  dream come alive on saturday mid-mornings. brite. he is the sun. shining. he is  life. simple. he makes "the world go 'round." funny thing is, i don't even think he cares.  do you?   ©Tremaine L.

      *with I only have eyes for you* (in the background)  I’ve Outgrown You  the fone rang, and i focused on the caller’s id cuz a chick don’t be answering  the fone, if it ain’t someone important. “hello.” the common greeting, and you breathe  heavily on the other end. “hey beautiful.” like my  beauty is something u should be speaking on. i listen. i find it best not  to even say anything while u’re talking cuz brick walls don’t have ears, and i am impatient with niggas who can’t even smell good pussy when  it walks by them, so… i let you apologize and run your name so heavy in the dirt, while i… count the many times you’ve  said, “I love you” in the past 3 minutes.  i used to say your name in my head while showering over and over and over and over again, cuz it rolled so well offa my tongue, and u thought this too. hearing you that day, seeing a picture of what you must look like in my head, did me no good. i found the strength to interrupt you. i grabbed the sentence that walked by my eye just in time to say, “u had me once, i loved you then. i loved you after you left.  and i will love you tomorrow, but   today is not a day for apologies.”   i cupped the last breath in my hands of yours and watched it  fly away when i opened them.  u were defeated. we weren’t meant to be, we had different tastes,  we were 7 years apart, and u never even tried, so we could never work. it took some time. 2 years, 7 pounds, wider hips, and a size up in my underwear to recognize i’ve outgrown you. and the stride that i take  now is a much longer one, cuz the weight of loving you is off of my shoulders.  ©Tremaine L.

      coup d'essai  i want to shape the fine edges of your skin. smooth them  out to pure perfection, watching each area become anew. keen bone structure--- something i've learned to love over the years. how delighted i am to make ur acquaintance.  "give me your hand." watch as i play both  fields and coach u on how to satisfy me.  there are sounds outside our window. car horns, whistles, lites flickering, police sirens, children  crying, and the stomping of the many heels up and down our block. we  ignore them, for our purpose is far more  important than their  existence. u're easy to mold. i test  each extremity. every  limb, every digit,  anything attached to your body.  i wish i was a genie, then i could turn you into something u're not, for the sake of pleasing me. but i am patient. it has taken me far longer to teach others before you, and u are no exception to any rule. u listen, then learn, and i sit back and watch  the art you've become.  ©Tremaine L.

      Death Valley  113 degrees. my back, scorched--- bathed in an unkind sun. you smile at me. eyes glimmering, hands shaking--- i spit-shine your complexion; the smudge near your cheek, and watch you beat bushes while trying to  tell me how beautiful my lips are. fuck faking the funk, we yearn for the rawness the moon promises us, our bodies meeting, yet not touching. the trees hum. they have been ashen for eons, no moisturizer, not even a drop of rain. you giggle, and the child somewhere lost inside me shoots shit with you.  118 degrees. your skin burned--- baked in the soul of an unfaithful sun. we play house because that's all we know how to do. you've got your father's eyes, and i can see him smiling at me. our walls melt, yielding at signs we know need adhering. i mimic your movements--- wanting my breasts as full--- as supple--- you're too hot for me. and it has taken me several poems to believe this. but somehow, the heat feels so good.  ©Tremaine L.

        the little boy in leather pants  El Roy... he has very slanted eyes, much like his mother. sitting on the stoop  waiting for God knows who, he plays with the  bubble-yum, moving it in and out of his mouth with his tongue. i've tried talking to  him before; "hey boy! why you always out here on this stoop? who you waiting on?" he'd smile  at me and keep fondling that bubble-yum. "hey boy! i'm speakin  to ya." "i ain't much waitin on nobody. just out here like you." he never moved an inch.  that stoop was his ground. he always stood it. sometimes i'd sit on the stoop  with him. we'd play "that's my car," or "punch buggy, don't punch  back," but mostly, it was me playing by/with myself.  "hey boy! do you ever  go inside? why you always out here? afraid you'll miss something?" he'd stick out his tongue at me, wink and keep pressing at  that bubble-yum. he wore leather pants... in the hot ass gawgia sun, he wore leather pants! whatinthahelliswrongwiththiskid?--- *i used to ask myself* he had every color: blue black yellow orange beige gray purple and it seemed as if he had the bubble-yum to match. "he boy! won't you come inside?" he always said nothing after i said this. just sat there popping that bubble-yum in his leather pants.  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

       at nite when no one is near me...  i   remember how daylite feels, how the sun peeks out, and  then hides--- he has never cared for me. we have always been at each other's throats. constantly bickering about heat. he makes room for rainbows, while i make room for broken hearts, and silly games that i  can't stand being a participant in.   the bed creaks. tossing and turning, full nite's sleep, but my mind remains on pause... as if to say, "you can't be well rested," but i know i am. confusing how the nite turns into day, and the day into nite. maybe it's the sky. maybe she's... high on life. maybe she has an agenda we all are unaware of.  the sun sneaks up, wraps itself around the clouds, and breathes deeply in my ear...   i know the nite will come again, and my pillow will cuddle in  between my legs--- easing tension. after all, it's purposeless for anything else.   ©Tremaine L.

       ruined   *somewhere in a steam-filled bathroom*  a fresh shave can be annoying---she scratches her cooch, washes her hands, and lites an incense.  *erases fog from mirror with finger tips* what has become of her? timeless eyes that look deep into the souls of man. time isn't as precious, nor are the events She has planned, but her reflection reminds her that life could be worse than it is.  the hand is dealt. she's played every round, tossed every trick,  reneged so often, she can't even remember what is what and who is who. while staring at herself, she notices the tiny mole on the tip of her nose, she smiles. a marking  she and all of her siblings have. the smell of  burned cinnamon fills the air, inhaling what could be life to her in the past, she remembers nag champa, musk, and vanilla essence.  *grabs towel from rack* she dries every curve, noticing the inches and angles she's gained. a tease rite now would be good to/for her.  *he looks at her reflection too* her smile leaves, movements  become hurried, and what was once an inviting smell has  turned into overdue shit.   he wants her.  he needs her. she's been wanted before. she's been needed before. she's been "there" before and he... can't seem  to understand,  it has left her feeling ruined.  ©Tremaine L.

"what'll be sexy?" "the usual." *booty claps* she's in no hurry to change her career.  ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

       mysterium tremendum (overwhelming mystery)   he can't call out to her like he used to. she's not there,  her ears have erased the memory. the pain. the  wanting... he was wanted. he sits alone in his studio, naked; revealing 6 inches of love and hate in the open. she can't come to his rescue anymore. the love they once had  evaporated... thin air had no room for it. it seemed to push  the nothingness even deeper into nonexistence.  all he can do is dream. he dreams of her. nite after nite, after nite. he lies on his king sized bed, hand on his dick, stroking life back into  manhood. he remembers how  cumming used to be the  one thing he wanted. now going, is all he sees. he moans... harmony in his lungs. lyrics on his heart. too much time will pass, and  his impression will be heavy in the mattress.  for what he always needed will forever be  a mystery.  ©Tremaine L.

       trapped: part II   so, i saw her at work today. hair pinned up business suit on, nails done to perfection. accounts payable clerk by  day, strip teaser by nite, terri--- has been all over this state. i admire her in a  "wow, i'd never do something like that" kinda way. 2 kids. a husband at home. all the time at nite to spare. she's never late to work, never.  "where u headed lil bit?" ced yells outta his purple caddy while i'm walking down knight drive. "to levy's." "u needa ride?" "naw, u know it's rite up the block, man. thanks tho." his car never stops shining. like it's booked a full week at the detailing shop, and when it's done, the wax never fades. he has more money than the town sheriff, yet--- they don't even know who he is. "well, always good seeing u around lil bit. u need anything, letta nigga know." "okay." he rides off into whatever sunset black men can come up with. head bobbing, eyes forever on his prize.  terra fits 2 tables, a twin sized bed, and more clothes than she can handle in her studio apartment. she doesn't pay rent, instead she... gives the landlord something to look forward to every month.  head hitting the board, back arching, he cums so swiftly...  her mind on her son, her life, her... loves. but for now, time is money, and  fuckin is time... so she'll choose the money anyday.  ©Tremaine L.

"u're writing for the cosmos,  girl."  and like hell, i am...   ©Tremaine L. Loadholt

      mistake---II    (michael andrew loadholt)  at 24, ur little gurl, now a woman can look at you and not feel ashamed, b/c all the years of loving you, all the hard work in getting along, all the times wasted, but spent anyway, has been one big mistake--- and it began with me.  so you got over living for yourself and began loving for me, but not really, at 26, u gave me him, and my 8 year old soul smiled because i was not alone anymore.  he drew close. clung to my legs, stood at the stairs when i wanted to play and cried like someone was taking his favorite toy--- and my back became the most common thing for him to see, cuz i got so used to walking away.  he never cried for you, he was my doll, my playmate, my guinea pig for new designs and new baby outfits, and we grew to stick together because we were all we had. so busy tryin' to keep our father, u forgot about us... "tremaine, i'll listen to you before i listen to momma," and i *nod* cuz what else is there to say?  he never "knew" you the way i did. never saw you when your hair hung past your shoulders, never embraced your giggle, never got the chance to cuddle next to you during a nap, cuz the meaning to mother slowly faded away.  now 16, he is lost without u... and at 42, u're still fuckin' the nite air, still tongue-kissin' teenage clubs, and pussy poppin' for men we don't even know. but, "i'm grown, it doesn't matter what you say, cuz it begins and ends with my words. i'm rite, i'm the mother." he looks to me unsure of how to respond, and all i have for him are *shrugs* and hugs filled with, "i love you even when u've done wrong," cuz he is mine. u gave him to me. he is ur 2nd mistake.  ©Tremaine L.

       mistake---I   at 17, opened legs took in hard  d i c k  u got what you wanted, but aborted the thoughts that came along with the new foundation. a mother at 18, u only wanted him, but got me instead... and for every year that passed u hated me for "taking him away" from u--- and i became  daddy's little gurl with pigtails, and full smiles and happy eyes, u never wanted me in your spotlight, and  at 23, ur little gurl now 5, has her daddy's nose, his ears, his eyes, his smile, and u... want so much for her to be u instead, but she is not.  i eased into the shoes of adults with each passing year, because my soul was much older, and that killed you, manipulation began with him and ended with me.  at 33, ur little gurl now 15, the mother u never were, u watch her waste her youth years away, because u were too busy living out the youth you gave up. late nite clubbing, weekend trips, house parties, while she sits at home with your children, and the thought of returning, seemed futile especially when the nite life had a "no kids allowed" rule. u gave up on her before she even thought of leaving you behind.  at 24, ur little gurl, now a woman can look at you and not feel ashamed, b/c all the years of loving you, all the hard work in getting along, all the times wasted, but spent anyway, has been one big mistake--- and it began with me.  ©Tremaine L.
