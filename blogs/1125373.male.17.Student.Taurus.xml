      hey everyone...sorry about that depressing moment i had the other day...i hit another bump in the road...its just amazing how things can change and you feel like you missed out on it and yet it changed you and then no one likes your change...blah....oh well...if you got confused in that crap....in a nutshell its basically saying "change sucks when you dont want to change".  looking back at... the embarassing times make you laugh the angered words make you feel like a fool the times of panic make you feel un rushed the mistakes made show you a lesson learned the relaxing days make you feel like youve wasted time the busy days make you feel like youve missed something the times you helped a friend makes you realize it helped you grow the lazy days makes you wish you worked harder the hard worked days make you wish you relaxed more the nervous feelings make you relieved the pain of an injury makes you tougher the nights when you were scared made you conquer you fear the times you lose something and you realized how much you should have appreciated it the time you didnt get what you wanted made you want it more the moment you didnt think about yourself made you unselfish the happy memories you cherished then but you never seem to hold back the tears when you remember them now the moments like these that make you realize that they made you who you are  i hope people like this one better.....

      Shattered one hit, on decision my heart shatters like glass on the ground the faded image of me vanishes  my innocence is extinguished pieces everywhere the little dust cannot be replaced a little bit lost forever nothing is perfect anymore it cannot be replaced it can barely be repaired the broken glass heart wont be forgotten just swept away this is all i have left...to give

      ahhh today was so BORING.... i got this balloon in IPC....i drew like a nerdy person on it...and named him Mr. Dork... plus i have ink on my arm again... tomorrow is trashbag/penguin/picture day...hip hip hooray  a bright sunny day, the blue sky seems forgiving, the huge white clouds fill the the airy sea nothing could go wrong  time passes the blue sky turns angry the white clouds turn grey suspicion fills the air  the sun is gone the black fury is unleashed the winds rush with emotion mercy is now forgotten  the storm rages on gaining strengh on the intense fear the deadly weapon is released its path unbroken  a force against the storm rises pushes its intensity down esteem is renewed the war has begun  slowly this new force wins destroying the deadly storm the intense fury gives way the good has won  the clouds part sun rays shine through exposing the damage showing what can be built  the storm may have devisated it may have ruined dreams the storm was killed the fury is over  the light shows opportunity a way to rebuild a way to find new goals another sunny day  lol enjoy.....

      Heres a lil story about nuts....  Once upon a time there was this Peanut who just was hunky dory and played in a Nuthouse Marching Band. There she met Pecan, the insanely smart supercool nut who is not just any nut, but a CHINESE nut (more speshal;)). Anywho, these two nuts, although quite different types of nuts became good friends. Then Peanut and Pecan started to spend more time with someone they knew for a while, Pistachio. Pistachio is a supercool weird kind of nut that everyone loves. So this nut trio always have fun and Pistachio Rocks!. Well that year came and went and a new year came upon us. Pecan met a dashingly handsome and supercool freshman nut, Almond. Pecan had such the hots for Almond she risked the Nuthouse Grapevine and her seniority status to like Almond (but thats another story). Peanut also had this friend named Cashew F. (there are 2 cashews in this story) who is also super cool. She too knows Almond and Pecan. Oh and did i mention Cashew F. is super cool? Well Cashew F. knows Cashew MK who secretly has a thing for Peanut, and although Peanut still does not returns his feelings, he still is a nice and sweet Cashew guy. Peanut also has another friend nut named Walnut. And even thought at times Walnut can be a meanie hes still a cool guy and will be missed once he graduates from the Nuthouse High School later on this year. Thats all for now folks, tune in next week for more tales of Peanut, Pecan, Pistachio, Almond. Cashew F, Cashew MK, and Walnut at the Nuthouse high school.  :)

Colin is no longer my hero  more to come...  hrm im in a writing mood  four long years of high school i wait, foolishly hoping for someone to date, the populars dont notice me, the smart people dont want me, im in a group of my own you could say.  one of my best friends lives in colleyville many miles and minutes from lewisville, though not here he treats me like a queen, he sees the things in me that arent easliy seen, hes a great guy you could say.  my idea of a perfect date is not the normal thought, the stars are the things i want- not what can be bought, a night on the couch with the movie is fine, the way i like to spend my time, just my crazy thoughts you could say.  my best girl doesnt go to my school, although together we're pretty cool, she likes dance, i like band, a weird couple of best friends you could say.  im pretty weird as you can see, im not the type of teen one can be, though i can be nice and funny, and like it best when its not sunny, thats what i am and i dont care what you could say.  :)

      Hey what's up Amy-lovers of all ages! Habibi here, just updating her blog because she threatened me :(  Not really, but she did ask me to, so I thought I'd do the proper thing and update it.  Just in case you guys didn't know, Amy is one of the coolest people on the face of this planet, so you better watch out, she rules.  I'm ready for Thursday, only 1 period I really have to worry about, Challenge, then I goto Shattered Dreams, then I guess Government but we'll probably jack around that period.  Then, during flex, I get to head to Irving to watch the band perform at UIL, hurray! I can't wait actually, I'm anxious to hear the songs.  Well, I'll talk to you guys later..  -Habibi-

      Hola everyone. Sorry for not updating in a while. School started. sucky. My classes are okay though. I have the best english class (Larry, Philip, Taylor...you rock!)   The week has kinda sucked for me. My matteo is gone, i lost my car keys (but found them), did bad on a chem test, and other crap which is too personal to put on here.   My bro is gone, I was in waco for most of the day helping get  him settled in. A few days ago he said one of the most memorable things hes ever told me. He said "you deserve better". Basically it made my week.  I still dont have a date to homecoming, so if your a guy, and your a good friend of mine...go ahead and try to ask me ;) sorry my graduated guys, you cant ask :-P  Ross, Matteo, and Ashton- I miss yall dearly   BIBI!- i miss you too man! its not the same without my fav brown person anymore!  You know. For all of you that told me i deserved better, thanks.   well its gloomy and im in the mood for a Poe reading or something.     rock on and dont forget to wear your safety goggles.

      wow....long time no update. well anywho...i ended up getting a date to homecoming (yay for Kevin I   bands okay now, we learned the rest of the show although it sucked BIG last night. oh well.  Everyday is beat up Jeff Garza day. hahaha just kidding jeff, we  (u better spike your hair!)  Disciple Now is this weekend at FBC Coppell, im so excited i cant wait! nothin like a whole weekend devoted to God while spending it with your closest Christian friends. yay for God!  school stinks, its SO boring now. only 30 more weeks left.....  i cant wait til Ross V comes back, he comes back i think not this weekend but next...look for him in his spiffy uniform!!  i miss matteo too  bibi you still rock my world...   over the past couple of weeks I have learned a good deal about the friendships i have with other people. I have realized the friendships i have made in middle school have been the best than ones made before or after. Also the ones i have made in band, you people rock and I am forever grateful on how you always seem to be there for me whether i need support at a tryout or a shoulder to lean on when im frustrated. Mostly to the people who always are there to give me a hug (Melissa, Ross, Kevin, Kyle, Kyle, Mooney) you guys make everything so worth while. And to my other friends, you guys mean just as much, without you I don't know what i would do with myself. Thanks.  As for the friends I have lost, I do not regret ever being your friend, It was great times. God just is showing me a different direction and I trust him with all my heart. Maybe our friendship will grow again if God chooses to cross our paths once again.   and a SPECIAL happy birthday to my budday Brian. You rock my world.  alright kids, thats all for now  when the world around you crumbles....he will be strong  *rock on and dont forget your safety goggles*

      OK sorry the last one was short, but i was on at like 11:30 and my mom was mad....plus our house got paintballed....btw, if you did it thanks for not hitting my car   Up-de-date-e-o:  - went to Fu's house for a party, it was cool except for all you stinkin people that didnt go! *COUGH kevin COUGH* -still havent done my tape for band...oh well its just my solo - im addicted to FFR, so if im randomly gone, thats where i am - didnt get to be online ALL day yesterday....i felt VERY deprived lol - im lonely :( - hehe according to Kyky i Rul3z - i got 4 points in Guo's info dealy thingomobob - my car still hasnt been shoe polished :)....knock on wood - Matt went to Colorado for a week, hes bringing me back snow.... - got 4 CDs from best buy - got the 4th Harry Potter book...on page 23 out of 734   0k well thats about it, sad eh?  here's that poem and the rest of it from my info....  The world has changed so much, Yet I change so little, Morals and goals are long forgotten, "Live in the moment!" they say. The ties between sanity and I are brittle.  God, I need you now, Give me the strength to keep on, To move forward everyday of my life, To trust, love, and live the way you wanted me to, Keep my faith together before it's gone.  The ring upon my finger is but only a part of my beliefs in you, But I put upon it many different meanings of life, It shall remind me of your forgiveness and sacrifice, It shall remind me of my love for you, It shall bind me to a certain man to whom I am his wife.  God, guide me now, Give me the strength to keep on, To move forward everyday of my life, To trust, love, and live the way you wanted me to, Keep my faith together before itís gone.   love to all, remember yourself, and dont forget to wear safety goggles!  Love, Hugs, and a little weirdness, -=-a|m\e|s-=-

      Alright, i suppose my blog is Due for an update-e-o.  Region went alright, had fun partly to the fact i sat next to kevin (flatt)...made it a lot better than it could haev been. I had 3 mini solos but they didnt really matter. That basically sucked up my friday night and saturday. However, saturday's lunch was MEGA interesting. I sat between the two kevins and I was caught in the middle of the pick-on-siru-and-siru-throws-food-at-kevins-fight. It was kinda funny and then the boys (Colin and kevins) had a rootbeer chugging contest (we were at A&W). So we performed and whatnot. After i changed out of that condemned trashbag and hung out for a while in the instrument room with Kevin(f)...and no Jacky...its not what you think :-P!!  Sunday was Kevin Clark's B-day...big 1-8. I went over to his house and others came over too. We played this game called dirty minds...they kept making me read the clues. Then we went bowling. This is where it gets interesting. We get there and get our lane and Amanda and Leah go get bowling balls. Well this weird (ugly) guy calls them over and asks for their names, Leah tells him her name. But then he asks for a #, but she gives him a fake one. The rest of the time we were there...the guy kept staring over at us. We finally decided to come up with a plan just in case. However the creepy guy leaves and all is well.   Monday....did nothing really.   Today. GAH! Stupid STATS! Forgot i had a test today....EEK! lol. Oh well...didnt do too hot on my history mag...but thats ok i really dont care...  well  more later  AmEs

      Friday the 13th Update  MOL project almost done, Kyle is doing editing, its kinda corny but its GT material Got the most creative valentine award in english I hate valentines day. I'm kinda on sugar overload at the moment. I'm takin pictures for the band video...beware...    The Time flies nothing more than a shadow countless chances extiguished by anger  Love dies lies and accusations wounds from a stalemate burn deep within my soul  God help me appearances decieve the truth distant covered by what is fake  I can't see the world blinds me things have changed their marks are on my walls  I don't understand why black soothes my mind why i wear a target of misfortune in which people place upon me their insults and hate  I stand before all forsaken land I stand for Jesus Christ who leads me from my hell  You can't touch me You can't break me for God will give me obstacles but HE will help me through them.  God help me now.    -Ames

      I     Anyways...ive decided Switchfoot and Coldplay are awesome. yep.  MOL project turned out well....if not that...the cookies were good  Wow...if you asked me a year ago how i think things will go....man things have changed so much that i look at my wall that has pictures on it and realize how long ago they were. I mean i have pictures of Ross and Steve from the Colorado Trip. But then i'm reminded of how people surprise me. I look at this beautiful picture of a yellow/pink rose that Chris Flowers took and i stand in awe...he gave it to me for my birthday...Then i look at movie tickets and how long ago those were.   I miss my boys...I miss Kyle, I miss Ross, I miss Matt, Heck i even miss Ashton. Well at least Kyle and Ross call me and I see Matt sometimes.  I've had so many problems with guys the past few months. It just seems I can't grasp a great guy even for a short while. I sit and wonder if God is testing me or if I'm just one of those girls boys don't want to date. *sigh*

      Alright to all those high school kids who think the opposite sex is confusing...this is what i have gathered:  - nice guys do finish last, but add in the fact when a girl finally finds a nice guy she freaks thinking it's too good to be true - girls are more simple than you think...usually chocolate solves everything, yet don't give it to a girl who think shes fat or one who's allergic - you're only in high school once so have fun take chances, but not the kind of chances that can land you in jail or give you a kid in 9 months - nothing is wrong with juniors dating freshmen....heck my parents are 5 years apart - some boys are jerks while other girls are sluts, but we all make bad choices...just some more than others - a lot of girls are more than willing to just stay at home with a guy watching a movie....yes really watching the movie - when girls are upset, they get either really angry and start yelling or they just get very very quiet...personally I think the 2nd of the 2 is worse...I've used it many times - excuses suck. I've used too many and I know I'm probably ended up on several hit lists for it - I'm sorry never really totally fixes everything - we all don't want to be the third wheel - girls do fish for compliments...but most of us don't receive many at all, and when we do we think they are kidding - boys love girls. girls love boys. cruel cruel cycle. - "can we just be friends?" actually can occur - boys are idiots. girls drop hints allllll over the place and they dont notice (even my hair lady said this) - sometimes the people you care about will be out of reach sometimes   ok kids...i know ive like totally done most of those things wrong but thats why i wrote them, with a little friend advice in there somewhere.   Your dreaded words of fire burn deep wounds into my soul. You laugh as the pain worsens within me. Why must you mock my existance when your life is worth no more than mine? Why must you force tears from my eyes? What do you want from me? Is my suffering not enough to your greedy evil? How dare you feed off my innocence. You cannot have me. May God save me from the demons of my past and lift me up. For I am not yours to keep.  ladeyda!

      Alright for all those people that actually do read my blog, this update is for you.   sam moon= asian owned place in which hundreds of women come to each day to buy something "fashionable" for cheaper prices.   also = mad women trying to grab everything in sight   Ok so I went to Sam Moon today to buy, as my mom called it, "bling bling" for my hair for prom. I thought I was going to go MAD. Crazy ladies EVERYWHERE. sheesh. I nearly got this one purse thats like made out of this plastic like material. my mom didnt like it though. I got this really cool belt, its clear.   Moving on...  So I watch launch.yahoo.com for like hours on end, and I just let the player keep going and this one random video pops up entitled "Penny & Me" so i start watching and i was like "Dannnng these guys are hot." I look at the Artist name, and lo and behold, the return of Hanson. Seriously, they are hot.  proof: hotkansaschik777: yeah trhey got hotter man ambabe girl247: they actually look like boys now! hotkansaschik777: yeah they got haircuts hotkansaschik777: and hit puberty  I know what you're thinking....those guys from like 8 years ago, arent hot. Yeah, 8 years ago they were young, looked like girls, and their music made me sick. But now they are older, actually look like guys, and meh their music aint that great but anything is better than Brittany Spears.    Only a week until prom. YAY! The coolest guy ever is my date and its gunna be so much fun.   I am officially addicted to pudding and jello from my wisdom teeth getting removed. Im still a lil green from bruising.  List of people that called me a name that refered to my Swelling: Brandon Kevin Myself JuFu   if i left you off let me know    allright kids off for now...   rock on

      freshman camp is over! WHOOHOO! *breathes* i'm ok...  Ok...so i have this bet going with Connor. I bet him $10 bucks that he would go out with a freshman this year. If i lose, i owe him $10. But for every freshman he goes out with, he owes me $10 bucks. I say i got the better end of the deal.  We know what we are playing this year...too bad i can't spell the composer's name, heck i can barely say it.

      All right, here's and update for those people who are bored enough to read this:   School is out. Finally. Managed an 88 for the tri in Chem. Now that's a feat.   Guo bleached his hair. Crazy Asian.  Freshman camp started this week, and the kids are pretty cool.  Before that though, we did trumpet initiation which consists of waking them up at 3 in the morning and doing other stuff. Well, we were short drivers so i called an upperclassman in to help. We decided to do the job in a caravan, so we wouldnt get lost. However, we made the mistake of driving down parkway at 3:45 in the morning after picking up adam w. Well lets just say a coppell cop noticed and started following me cause i was on the end. However, i noticed this and i completely stopped at a stop sign and he got fed up with me and went around. But then he noticed the upperclassmen and got him....for basically changing lanes twice without signaling and speeding slightly. BUT! The cop was nice enough to let him off and only get mad at him for not having his insurance card. Oh did i mention? The kid, adam w, was in the backseat blindfolded. Thank goodness the kid is smart enough to remove the blindfold before the cop came up.

      You called to say you wanted out Well, I can't say I blame you now. Sometimes you've got to fold before you're found out. Well thanks for waiting this long to show yourself.  Cause now that I can see you, I don't think you're worth a second glance.  So much for all the promises you made, they served you well, Now you're gone and they're wasted on me.  So much for your endearing sense of charm, it served you well, Now it's worn and it's wasted on me.  I guess that all you've got is all you're gonna get.  - Dashboard Confessional- Rapid Hope Loss

       Alright, here's an update. whoohoo.      Went to OU, very nice and all, but I really think I have my heart set on OSU. Who knows, I'll apply to both anyways.       Band camp has started. whoohoo. Can't you tell I'm thrilled? But yeah, it's alright so far. Mason hasn't totally chewed me out yet and we start drill tomorrow night which should be awesome.       The leadership party was yesterday, it was a lot of fun and thanks to Mallory for putting it on. After that some of us band nerds went to see the Village. A mon avis, it is one of the best films I have ever seen. The way M. Night Shymalan had written that movie was amazing. I mean yeah, It isn't a thriller like Scream or Final Destination but it is very suspenseful like The Glass House. If you like a movie to mess with your head, you should go see it. But if you are looking for a movie that scares you the whole time and has no other basis but to disturb you from sleep, then don't go.    I talked to my ex-cavie friend Lee the other night. He said he was going to call Mason to see if he could possibly tech during band camp. We'll see. It would be really good to see him if he could.         anyways, that is enough for now.         au revoir, mes amis.
