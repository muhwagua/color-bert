      Read Each One Carefully and Think About It a Second or Two  1. No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry.  2. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.  3. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart.  4. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them.  5. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.  6. To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.  7. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you.  8. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful.  9. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened.  10. There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around.  11. Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.  12. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.  REMEMBER: WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON.  True friends: How many people actually have 8 true friends?  Hardly anyone I know ! But some of us have all right friends and good friends!!!

      E.R. Alyssia was hit by a 6 foot ladder last night. That poor girl!!! Her head was bleeding badly. At the moment I was shock and scared that something seriously might go wrong. I rush her to Children's hospital in a quickness. We was in the emergency room for two long hours. Now I've got to say that I am not a very patient person. Its a very sad picture to see a single mom that has no clue of whats gonna happen to her lil girl. As we waited and waited and waited, Alyssia's father showed up. He was the last person whom I wish to see. Damn, I truly hate his guts. Now i'm wondering who the hell called his ass? Has to be my mother. Damn, she's got a big mouth. He just came towards me and yelled the crap out of me at my face. All I wanted to do was to go off on him. But for the sake of my daughter I didnt. I tried to be nice and very polite as possible. It was so hard but I kept all the anger inside. After we saw the doctor, got the wound clean, got it stiched up. He said, "You shouldnt even have to bring her in, its only a lil cut". WTF! What a jerk! What a disgrace. He was such a manipulated person I have ever known in my life time. I was bomb, I was pisted. My reply was, " At least I brought her in, just to make sure she was okay and nothing would affect her later on in the future. If you've got things to do why the fuck are you here? I didnt call your ass and I dont need you to be here. After all these years, you never help me out with shit and you still have the balls to consider her as your daughter. Get the fuck out of my face I dont want to see you!". He was pisted. We didnt talked for the rest of the night. I never regret leaving him in the first place and I'm doing better off on my own. I know that Alyssia needs a father in the life but not the one who doesnt seize her value. People always say never look back into your past becuase it will only hurt you more. So I never did! I've learned to let go from the moment I step out. Once you've learned to let go of something or someone, dont ever go back to it. Lets just say your spitting out your saliva on the ground and later on you've got thirsty and srapt up that nasty dirty saliva and swallow. YEAK....

      The Complements of Men I've received this e-mailed today, its funny and yet its true what they say about "MEN".These are their rules!    - Sometimes we are not thinking about you. Live with it.    - Saturday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.    - Don't cut your hair ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is        that married women always cut their hair.    - Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.    - Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.    - Crying is blackmail.     - Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not    work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!      - We don't remember dates. Mark anniversaries on a calendar. Remind us frequently beforehand.    - Most guys own three pairs of shoes - tops. What makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?    - "Yes" and "No" are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.    - Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.    - Check your oil! Please.     - Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.    - If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to answer.    - If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.    - You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.    - Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.    - Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.    - ALL men see in only 16 colors, like the Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. We have no idea what mauve is.    - If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.     - We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of mind-reading ability is not proof of how little we care about you.    - If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.    - If you ask a question you don't want an answer to expect an answer you don't want to hear.    - When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine. Really!     - You have enough clothes.    - You have too many shoes.    - NO! No, you really do have too many shoes.     - It is neither in your best interest or ours to take the quiz together. And, no, it doesn't matter which quiz.    - I'm in shape. Round is a shape.     *Thank you for reading this.*

      Dignity The quality or state of being Worthy, Honored and Esteemed: True worth: Excellence...  Why does hotdog buns comes in a package of 8 and hotdogs comes in a package of 10? This is a question that I would like everyone to compromise among themselves! My answer would be, be happy with what you get and always enjoy with whats left behind.

      Who In The World Understand Men Anyways I've received this e-mailed about two years ago and had it posted on my asian avenue page. I get alot of men who reply in a very interesting way. So, for all of you men who read my blog, which catagories do you fit in???  * The nice men are ugly *  * The handsome men are not nice *  * The handsome and nice men are gay *  * The handsome, nice and heterosexual men are married *  * The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men, have no money *  * The men who are not so handsome, but are nice men with money think we are only after their money *  * The handsome men without money are after our money *  * The handsome men, who are not so nice and somewhat heterosexual, dont think we are beautiful enough *  * The men who think we are beautiful, that are heterosexual somewhat nice and have money, are cowards *  * The men who are somewhat handsome, somewhat nice and have some money and thank God are heterosexual, are shy and NEVER MAKE THE FIRST MOVE!!! *  * The men who never make the first move, automatically lose interest in us when we take the initiative *   "NOW....WHO IN THE HELL UNDERSTANDS MEN?"  * Men are like a fine wine.  * They all start out like grapes, and it`s our job to stomp on them and keep them in the dark until they mature into something you`d like to have dinner with

      People Under Five Feet For people who are under five feet, are they consider a midget? I cant think of any suitable word for a midget rite now. Until then, let me just use this phase for shortcut :). People intends to call me shorty. I'm 4'11", which isnt a perfect height for shit!!! I hate my height but hey I cant get away from this. I drank so much milk hoping to grow a few inches but that didnt work :(. Both of my parents are short people, so that makes me short as well. I dont have a point to this but can anyone answer my question?

      What Stirs Your Thrist? I stepped into starbucks this morning for some caramel macchiotto and spoted an asian hunk. He was a real cutie with nice smiles! Eye contact begins to reveal. As I stood there waiting for my coffee he came over to chat. I was like WTF. I cant chat dude leave me alone!!! I'm not good at talking to stranger. Especially ones who approach me first. The conversation begins, "Hi my name is Perry, I couldnt help myself staring at you, so I decided to come over to talk while we wait for our coffee". I reply, "Hello! I'm still not awake yet! Do you work around here?" Perry - "Yep, I work for a computer company around the corner. You didnt tell me your name?" Me - "Oh, sorry i'm Sakdary, its nice to meet you on an early morning". Damn, what should I say to him? I'm gonna blow him off like all them other guys I know it. Perry - "Its nice to meet you too. So what are you having? Do you come here every morning? Do you work or go to school around here?" Me - " I'm having a caramel macchiotto ( on the top of my head, I told myself that I should have a caramel macchiotto frabbachinno next time). I work around here for a Real Estate title company". Finally my coffee was handed to me. Yea... I get to take off. Me - "Umm, its nice to meet you, i'll see ya around sometime aye!!!" As I started to walk away he follow me to my car. Perry - " Is it okay if I asked you out for lunch sometime since we worked so close to eachother?" Me - "Umm, I'm in a hurry rite now and i'm also seeing somebody. But i'll see you around sometime okay? Have a nice day". Damn, I really sucks when it comes to guys. Sometime I sit and wonder, asking myself why cant I give anyone a chance to open up to me? Maybe its becasue i'm scared to get hurt. Or maybe I cant fine that Mr. Right. Or maybe i'm left all alone in this world with no soulmate!!! Oh well, only god knows. Let the time reveals its secrets to me.

      ** To all my friends who are TRUE BIATCHES! :)  When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they call me a *bleep*. When I stand up for those I love, they call me a *bleep*. When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or do things my own way, they call me a *bleep*. Being a *bleep* means I won`t compromise what`s in my heart. It means I live my life MY way. It means I won`t allow anyone to step on me. When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak against it, I am defined as a *bleep*. The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being everyone`s maid, or when I act a little selfish. It means I have the courage and strength to allow myself to be who I truly am and won`t become anyone else`s idea of what they think I "should" be. I am outspoken, opinionated and determined. I want what I want and there is nothing wrong with that! So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame, try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold within me....cuz it ain`t gonna work and I`m still gonna be a B*TCH!   B - Babe   I - In   T - Total   C - Control of   H - Herself    B = Beautiful   I = Individual   T = That   C = Can   H = Handle anything   **LOVES** Romance, Travelling, the feeling of importance, lots of hugs & kisses, Surprises, my "daughter", sexy underwear!, snuggling, having my hair brushed away from my face or played with, hot showers, someone telling me that they "miss me", big beds, duvets, the feeling of being in love, driving fast!, fast cars, guys who smell good!, DANCING!, shopping..which also means having a lot of money to spend!, basketball, laughing, having a songdedicated to me, WALK AWAY WITH ME by nora jones, gifts..wrapping gifts, seeing peoplesmile because of me, getting mail unexpectedly, family, the beach, bon fires, being treated like a "princess", love songs, deepconversations, Disneyland!, playing in the rain stepping on mud, eatting pizza, listening to rock and roll, having late night conversations.....  **HATES** Crying, being yelled at!, running out of hot water, stress, cold days, the smell of smoke on someone, "tummy" aches, waking up early, being sick, fighting/arguing, bugs and any creepy crawly things..ughhh..ewww!, people who CAN`T drive, "playa`s", guys who cheat on their girlfriends, ppl who talk sh!t when they don`t even know that person, gossip, rumors, having no money, ppl who lie, broken promises.....

      No Talent So many are blessed, with talents so good  Able to do things, I wish I could  These are gifts, from our one true lord  He`s given so much, he`s given them accord   Some are able, to sing so fine  Others are able, to dance so divine  Why didn`t he, favor me with skill  Some kind of talent, or strength of will   He`s given me, nothing to show  Except jealousy and envy, of all others I know  Envious of those , who can do what I can`t  I`ve only have one wish, that he has yet to grant  Untill that day comes, I`ll sit and wait  And look for a sign, of my ultimate fate

      The Hourglass It's monday! I usually like mondays. But today seems a bit odd. The day is going by so slow and i'm still here at work with no one to chat with. Dunno what happen to people whom I used to chat with. An e-mailed from somebody would really make my day. No e-mailed means no smile. Dont feel like bothering anyone. What ever comes comes. No bigges! Its hard and very tough to keep things inside and not letting anyone know exactly how I really feels. Its a good thing I got myself a journal :). Now I can really blast everything out.

      A Whole New World Wow, my very own personal journal. Feels kinna weird but yet I have so much to say. This is all so new to me so allow me to adjust myself :). Forever Sakdary, represent myself. I love my name because its one of a kind. Although, I would be pisted off if there was someone elsewhere with the same name! I am so selfish. Errr.  Its Cambodian's new year. I went to the temple today, pray, hung out with relatives and ate a whole bunch of delicious food. Mmmm, my favorite food aye! Has got to be papaya salad extra spicy :). Then comes desert, ouu, yummy in my tummy. Duran over sweet rice. Oh man, i've got to make myself some of that soon. The best part of the day at the temple was praying. Yes, praying is what I love to do most. During the whole process I picked up this can with a whole bunch of sticks inside. Each stick was assign to a number. Your suppose to wish or pray for something or have something in mind. But at that time my mind went blank. I sat there shaking the can, waiting for a single stick to pop out. Three mintues later a stick fell out. It was a number four. Yeah, this better be good!!! Got a piece of paper that indicate a briefly message to my head and it hit me. It states "Parting from loved one envisaged, may be a longtim before reunited. Cooperation needed in conducting activities. Avoid taking role as a leader. Patient recovering. More likely to win legal case. Hidden ones still not found. A baby boy forthcoming". Umm, lets talk about this shall we?  Parting from my love one? Cant seem to think of who that person might be. Could this be true? Who knows! Theres only one person whom I wish to see and be close to. Dinner friday night might be cancel. Longtime before reunited again? This could be somewhat true. Oh well, life goes on...NEXT... Patient recovering? For sure i'm putting myself in this cage where i'm not out with my friends doing things I used to do. Thats about it! HIdden ones still not found? Dunno what your talking about!!! A baby boy forthcoming? HELLA NO!!! I'm not having another baby. In your dreams.

      Still A Lost Child Since San Francisco branch is going to be under one roof with our Alameda branch, I've been moved three tymes already. Each time I've been moved, I'm getting closer and closer to the DOOR. Dude, are they going to kick me out pretty soon?  I was moved again today. Yep thats my fourth time, one, ah two, ahh three, and ah four. This time I've moved to a cubicle with only four people surrounding me. Managers must think that I talked too much or being too shy. Nah, cant be, I'm normal like everyone else LOL.   My phone was taken away three weeks ago and that makes me a nobody. But hey I've gottan a brand new germ free phone today. So that makes me a somebody again yep yep check that. I think I should spit on the handle or the bottons tomorrow yeah I'll do that hehhehe.  Gosh, I hope that I wont be moved again any time soon. UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE!!!

      E - Tards An extravaganza worldwide Popsicle 5 rave was last night. Capacity was probably 10,000 people. The line to get inside was a living hell, they've separated the males on one side and females on the other. While standing in line the sercurity would yell from the top of their lungs, " Get to the left hand side of the fence.". I felt like we were in a Nazi's booth camp for some reason. The female line took forever so I jump right over to the guys line. It was cool, I got in hehehhehe. The person who searched me took all my candies and gum. Damn those are what I really need most dammit. It was hell of a good thing that I didnt empty everything in my purse. I told the lady the rest are my make ups and she let me go.  Once we've got in, walked around looking for friends. I was with about 35 heads or more I forgot. So there I am walking around and guess what I spotted? A man thats probably in his late 40's or early 50's, sucking on a pacifier and got at least 6 or 7 beads necklace on him. I thought that was trippy. I was laughing, I know thats very rude of me. After seeing that I was wide awake.  The music was jumping and I was temped to roll. Drop about 10:30 but that shit didnt start to kick in, so I drop another half. An hour later thats when everything was so nice and so breautyful to me. I was gone, my eye balls was really wide open, I was sweating so bad. I drank so much water and smoke so many ciggarette. I would scream and for ever scream people would turn their head and looked at me and their expression was like "Dame she is hella gone". I think I'm getting to love wearing tennis shoes now. Very comfortable I jump around, did some cart wheels, did lots of dance battling with people. I realized that I didnt get freaky on the dance floor at all. Maybe I didnt want to get intimate with anyone there. There was lots of cute guys but I didnt want to bother or get involve with anyone. Hey, I've got to say this, I'm very proud of my height because there were girls that was way shorter then me. :) Now I dont feel bad for being 4'11", I feel good about myself, yeah yeah I'm not the shortest person in the world YES.   The whole night I was trippen over IBM dude. I thought about him. I told myself not to but I couldnt help myself. I wanted to break down and cry but I've learn to control my feelings just kept screaming. After I scream really loud I felt relief, I felt free, it felt good. Took lots of pictures and all my friends was e out. Cant wait to see the pictures lol, I bet you everyone looked hella fucked up. It was fun, I'm glad I went with them.   Half of my friends went to 1015 afterwards but I came home. I was tired, I wanted to sleep. Coming home alone isnt a very fun feeling. I wish there was someone with me to fool around in bed with oh I'll finish this later gotta go.  Wow, what a great feeling dammit. I slept the whole day!!! I am very well rested but still tired tho. As I was saying before I log off, hate sleeping alone when I feel like I really need someone to lay in bed with. The bearable cold night I slept alone naked. Feels really good just being betweens the sheets. I dreamt about him again. The same person whom I would always dream about. Yep thats rite IBM dude. Heres how the dream go.... We was making out in my room, he kissed me on my forehead, we've french kissed while his hands rub all over my body. He travel down to kiss my neck while his hands rub my nipples. We've rolled around in bed, we've tickled eachother, we've laugh, we've moan, we've drove eachother so crazy, all we both wanted to do was to just go for it. And so we did, the sex felt so real and it felt great. Of course I woke up wet and horny. But it was just a dream. In reality it would never happen. Damn I really miss that boi tho.

      End of The Road I really dont know what went wrong. But for sure one of us has changed. I'm pretty sure it was me, the stuck up, clobber one, selfish, hard headed. Last night was a night to remember. In a good way of course and thats how it should be. Its over and thats a heartache to remember. Somehow I dont feel connected to him anymore. I've lost it. Somehow it doesnt click but we end the night with this magnificent powerful kiss that sweep me away. To me it really meant Good Bye with a Thankyouverymuch for all the pasted excitments.   LoL, its funny how I would get this really bad bad toe cramps. Its a habit of nervousness when I'm around him. I told myslef not to be nervous because his nothing to be afaird of but I couldnt help myself. And my speech, Oh my gosh! What has he done to me? I felt like I was speaking ebonic language. Thats bad, really bad. He mustta be laughing at me by now. I wonder if I would ever get toe cramps around other guys? Maybe not because there isnt anyone that I'm interested in.   Guys, they come and the they go. New guys in my life are very similar to new favorite songs. I'll like that song for a longterm or short terms until I get sick and tired of it. After that theres a brand new one along the way or on the side. I'm very wicked and cold hearted that I must say.   I peel a grilled shrimp and my fingers was dirty so I said, "Can I WASH my fingers on your shirt?". Way to go, I felt so clumsy. What I meant was, "Can I WIPE my fingers on you shirt.". There was some other stupid stuff I said or did but never mind about that. Yeah lets forget about that.   Oh, but lets talk about the very first time I've learn how to cook rice. Yeah yeah that should be interesing. I was about 8 years old, a hungry lil girl. Mom was sleeping, didnt want to bother. I climb onto the counter and cooked some rice without adding any water to the pot. And end up burning myself. That was sad and funny, fuuny sad. Oh, the first time I've fried some eggs I didnt use any oil. I'm pretty clumsy huh?

      Cry It All Out I sat there listening to her words, Drama Situation. Her eyes wide open as she looked into mines. I felt her inner emotions because I was once there before. Her words was so strong that it brought back bad memories to my head and it hurt. Her boyfriend comes home with different girls every weekend. His broke ass doesnt even work and dont do shit around the house. He'll take her money, her credit cards,  pond her jewelry. Anything for money. Throw his anger and abused her for everytime she try to defense herself. She's hopeless, cant expose her thoughts, cant go out, cant talk on the phone when his around, cant do this, cant do that. Her face was drown with tears. A tissue was handed to her and she evenually drenched it. She ran to me for a hug and asked for help. I was devastated as my heart begins to iches with emotional feelings. I was disgrace of his behavior.  All I can say to you my friend is to stay focus and be strong, leave him because his a nobody, his a loser, his got nothing to offer. You have no future being with him. He'll never bring you happiness. What he does now will continue on for the rest of your life. Dont expect him to change because he never will. Dont fall for his sweet talks because its all lies. Your a smart girl. You've got a year left to graduate from Davis. Just leave him, you've got your parents and friends to support you. Dont be afaird to lose him because there are others out there. That Mr. Right will come to you when you lease expect it. Just be patience and be honest to yourself.  God will evenually punish him for what his done to you. Once that day comes you have the right to either laugh at his ass or feel sorry for him. Its up to you to decided. I might be wrong and you might not believed in my words. But what ever you choose to do I'm always here for you.   I hope that my advise will open her eyes and lead her to a new step in life. It isnt all that great but thats the best I can do.  Oh my god, headaches dammit. Let me put out some anger by playing tennis. Vivian, here I come, I'm gonna kick your ass, prepared to lose LOL.

      I've Got An Eyest On Me Yesterday I had to do some grocery shopping, so I went to Albertson. Alyssia was with me, enjoying her little goldfish crackers. While standing in line, eye contact was made. A cool clean cut, attractive, well proportioned and imposing appearance white man glacing at me several times. Glanced away, glanced away get it. His about 5'9", mid 30's, well dressed like a business man.  After everything was paid for I rush to my car in a quickness. But I wasnt fast enough. Without noticing, the handsome man appoach me. The conversation begun....  Gavin: Excuse me, what time is it?  Me: Its about 6:15.  Gavin: What nationality are you?  Me: I'm Cambodian.  Gavin: Do you date Italian/french men?  Me: Maybe, but I dont know any.  Gavin: Your such a beauty, I had to solicit the interest of asking you out to dinner sometime.  Me: Oh my, oh wow. Why thank you but I'm involved with somebody rite now.  Gavin: Do you have a boyfriend?  Me: No.  Gavin: So that means your free!  Me: Not exactly.   Gavin: I'm a promoter for Club Hussler and I'm looking for asian girls to host or dancers for the club. Would you be interested? Making good money. Do you like to dance?  At that point we exchanged #'s  Me: Oh cool! Being a host sounds interesting. How much are we talking about here? What about being a dancer? What types of clothes?  Gavin: Host starts out about $12.50 per hour and you get to keep the tips. Dancers starts out $20 an hour. You can wear anything you like. The dancers at 1015 dresses very similar as Club Hussler and the music are basically the same as well.  Me: Ouu, that sounds like fun. So what are the hours?  Gavin: From 3pm - 9pm or 9pm - 2am. If your interest maybe we can rearranged somthing out for you. Are you a rambunctious?  Me: Hahahahha, yes I can be really wild and unruly once it comes to alcohol.  Gavin: What about Extasy? Do you like having sex when your drunk or what about on E?  Me: Umm, no, I'mnot that kinna girl. Why? Do I look that bad to you?  Gavin: My god, you dont like sex? Your just a very attractive girl, I'd just want to know you more. Do you like big men? Do you play with toys? Do you watch porno's?  Me: Gosh, what are you?  An undercover? No- No big men, no toys and yes I do watch pornos sometimes.  Gavin: Your funny, No i'm not an undercover. Just someone whos very interesting in dating a girl like you. When you watch porno's do you like to watch the big guys or the lovely women?  Me: I like the fine women.  Gavin: Your into girls?  Me: Maybe.  Gavin: Have you ever been with a girl? What type of women do you like?  Me: Never been with one. umm, in particular, I like blonde women or anyone thats really attractive.   Gavin: Would you ever be interest in making a video?  Me: NO_NEVER_What are you exactly?  Gavin: Umm, I'm a producer_ in the adult films (porno's).  Me: LOL. Oh my god, so the club is actually a strip joint?  Gavin: Not exactly as exciting as a strip joint. but would you be interested? A pretty asian woman with nice ass is what I'm looking for rite now. Would you go out the back door if a customer asked you to?  Me: NO THANK YOU but I've got to go now. Its very nice to chat with you and thanks for the offered.   Gavin: Alrite heres my business card, call me anytime if you ever need anything or come by the club and check it out.   Me: Alrite GOOD BYE.  Damn, WFT I was just talking about Seamore Butts the other day. Fuck I cant believed its really happening to me. Damn I feel really bad. Who does he think I am, a prostitute? I'm not that LOW, I'm not engaged to sex nor having sex with people for money. Damn what an asshole. At that point I was provoked. I was thrill. I was dreadful, man extremely bad. I was so hapless. I'm just so disappointed right now. But I should be happy tho. But making money in a dirty way like that doesnt exist in my world. No matter what, I'm still feeling so SHITTY.   I regret giving him my number. He called me this morning with a 408 area code. I thought it was a good morning call from the person I'm looking forward to having dinner with but it wasnt. It was Gavin! I was disappointed. Talking to Gavin really gross me out. All he talks about was wanting to know about my sex life, what turns me on? Would I ever go on dates with him. Fuck I need to blow this guy off shit. Somehow this whole Gavin thingy really irritates me. YEAK YEAK YEAK. Fuckin old fart MF.

      The Final Goodbye Another night of Dawson's Creek. The very happiness tears drown down my face as I watch the last episode of Dawson's Creek. For the last five years I've tune in to channel 20 the WB, every wednesday night at 8 o'clock just to watch this show. Friends was teasting me for some reasons. So what if I like a teen soap. I have a total concept potential you wouldnt understand. I've waist so much time in a bubble. This show puts me in a very emotional position. I'm just so touched rite now. :)  I was pretty thrill with the ending. The love triangle waves became a square. Dawson (James Van Der Beer) was so perfect for Joel (Katie Homes). They were soulmate. At the ending Joel choose Pacey. I was alil disappointed but it was a happy ending. I cant be sad over this but its just perfect.   Love Love is a concept that everybody goes through. Why? I dont know! I wish that I've never fall for people I'm so attached to but some how it just developes. I cant stop myself and I dont know how. The only way is for that person to hurt me really bad in a cruel cruel way as much as possible. Sure I'll be hurt along the way but it WORKS. Love is so short and forgetting is eternity. Jumping in with your heart and jumping out with your head. Jumping in and out isnt wise. Making decision with yourself is difficult. But just be honest and be true to yourself. Its hard, who am I kidding? If decision are made dont look back. Dont run away from yourself either. We're in this fancy world discovering life itself. Sometimes I asked myself "What the hell am I doing?". Life isnt perfect, nobody is. The value of time is what counts the most. Is it or isnt it? Mistakes were made. Be sure to make mistakes, makes lots of them. Because there is no better way to learn. Love to the tip of your fingers. Who ever you choose dont run away from it. Dont chase it either. It will come to you when you lease expect it. Just be patience.   Friendship can never be over estimated. Forgive and forget thats all I can really say.  Belief I believed that god put us here for a reason. But how many of you believed in god??? I personaly dont even think god exist. But I do believed in Buddhism because their there for me to feel, see and capable of many things. Everybody should believe in something rite?    Birth is the opposite of Death. Life is the opposite of nothing. Doesnt matter who ends up with who. Just as long as your happy rite? Rite.  Dreams Everybody's dream car would be, benz, h2, navi, anything expensive that flashes people eyeball to open wide. Dream bike would be, yamaha, sasuki, honda, etc, dont they all realized thats the most dangerious shit to be on??? I dont want all of that. No way...my shit has to be a private JET. Yep yep yep, while everybody's going crusin, being stuck in traffic, I'm flying high in the sky. Looking down and the best part of all, I can sit and enjoy my ice cream :).

      Hay Ray Hay Ray I've gone back to school to take the Assessment Test. Cant say that I did very well but lets just say fairly good. Results came out and I have to take Elementary Algebra, English Grammer and Writting. My results made me very unhappy for some reasons. Now I'm stressed out about school, how many unit should I take? What about work? Will I be able to manage making money enough for my bills? Gosh, what happens if I dont past my classes? What about financial aid? Will or am I qualify for it? I've got thousands of question running through my mind. Its hard just to think about it already. I'm gonna be okay rite?   I've got some interesting quotes that i want to shared. Here are some of my favorite.  "Make the most of yourself for that is all there is of you" - Ralph Waldo Emerson  "If you really wat something you can figure out how to make it happen" - Cher  "Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt" - Special Olympics Motto  "You never really lose until you quit trying" - Mike Ditka  "If life gives you a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it" - Anonymous  "I've finally stopped running away from myself. Who else is there better to be?" - Goldie Hawn  "Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind"  - Dr. Seuss  Another Night Last Saturday night, I was at Club NV. I couldnt drink, couldnt down my remy for some reason. I had half a cup of Pink Pussy, Long Island, and Sex on The Beach. Everything was NASTY to me that night. I didnt have too much fun because no one wants to dance with me. Referring to my friends, their so boring made me sad. And the ones who want to dance are just strangers. Those are the people I've always turn down for some reasons. I guess I'm too used to that by now. Dont like strangers and I never will. All I thought about was that IBM guy. His blowing my mind off. Every single song that I've danced with him once before hunt me down and made me sorrow. I thought about him couldnt take it anymore so I left the club after an hour and a half of partying.   In and Out Again Last night you came back to me. Asked me out to dinner. I said yes. The question is What the Hell happen to you? We spent a very good quality of time talking about our lost times which was nice. But I've learn to let go but your back which makes it harder for me to let you go again. Just hope that this time wont be like the last. Friends blame me for being too nice, but hey this is who I am. I dont care as long as I'm having fun and I'm happy. My happiness is just PRICELESS.

      TV Is Full of Crap What else is there to watch on TV these dayz? What else is new? Same old shit everyday rite? I'm pretty amuse finding myself away from tv. I dont watch tv very much, unlike some coach potatoe friends of mines, who are always over at my house getting high and munching up all my junk food. What a friend huh? Its cool tho I dont mind because I'm the nice one LoL. I wonder if any of my shows fit any of your categories? Sunday Nite - Charmed on WB channel 20 @ 8pm. A show about three powerful sister's who are witches. Who try to protect the world and vanish all the demons. The first sister has the ability to freeze objects, the second sister could preminish things, and the third sister could move objects. Humm, If I could choose one super power it would have to be freezing things. I can rob a bank and be so rich only god knows what on earth I would do with all that money. I can strip people down in public. I can do so many things to so many people you wouldnt even know.  Monday Nite - Mr. Personality on channel 2 @ 9pm. A bachelorette looking for true love. She wont depends among the charm but better yet, she wants to reveal their inner beauty inside out. Therefore the bachelor (s) would wear a colored mask, try to persuade and win her heart. The bachelorette who has the power to decided who or which gets to stay or must be eliminated.  Wednesday Nite - Dawson Creeks on WB channel 20 @ 8pm. The show started out since 1998 and next wed. would be the very last episode ever. Damn I'm getting all upset because thats my favorite show. It reminds me so much about life, friendship, love, passion, heartbreak, betrayal, trust, education, drama and etc... This show makes me stop to think of Why do we forget the bad times so quickly? Maybe because we've learned to forgive and forget. Memories are the best of tymes and decisions are made clearly. Its true what they say about time. A min its yours and the world seems like yours forever with a simple smile. The next, its playing tricks on you and it fakes out on you rite before your eyes.  Friday Nite - Family Bussiness on Showtime Late Night on channel 14 @ 11:30pm A story about a guy name Adam who is a producer, director, performer in the adult films industries. Adult entertainer business thats what I've should have said. His films are called Seymore Butts. His a hottie and also looking for that special someone. His always going on dates with women he fines online. But its pretty sad that hasnt find that special someone yet because most women doesnt appreciated what Adams does for living. If ya asked me i'll probably freaked out the moment he tells me his in the adult industries. I wonder how many people found love and how many just gave up like me? i've used to chat online and end up falling for strangers but one day I realized that i'm just hurting myself by doing that. So I've disconcerted myself out of the dating online thingy. Its cool tho, what ever comes comes. When its time I'll meet that Mr. Rite. But for now let me just enjoy life as it is. I'm free and thats FREEDOM. On my spear time, I would watch Thai movies, play with Alyssia, or read romance novel. I think reading is a sign of intelligence. Or watch Food TV! Yeah yeah, the food network is awesome. Molto Mario and Emeril Live are the best cheft that I've like so far.

      Yawn Yawn Go Away I've been sitting here yawning every second. Whats up with that? Everytime I yawned, theres tears in my eye balls and if I was to blink, tears would probably drown down my face. Every yawn, my eyes gets really red and my nose as well. Co-workers walked by and everyone of them seem to find me very amase. The first questions that comes from everybody this morning was "Are you okay Sakdary?". The Second would be "Your not crying are you?". At this point I'm sitting here thinking that I should sign up for an addition. A crying role, perhaps lol. Nah, I dont think I'm qualified for anything. Damn, I might crack the camera lens. Oh well, yawn*, here goes another yawn* and another and more yawn*. Shesh. While writting this, there has been at least sixteen yawns* already. Dude, I need some coffee. Anyone care to take a trip with me to Starbucks? My treat :) !!!!

      Stalkers Yesterday while washing my car, my ex roommate Harvey, had stop by to pick up some of his belongings. Alyssia was crying on the other hand so I had to sit and play with her. Harvey, helped me finish washing my car. Within a flash I thought I saw someone I've been waitting for. This person really looked like you. The hair cut, buff, looks, except for one thing I didnt recognized the car that the person was in. He stop and stared at me for a while. I coulnt really see because I didnt have my contact lens on.  Hey IBM dude, if your still reading this, the dude you saw washing my car wasnt who you thought it was. Please do not take it the wrong way. I've always be honest with you and always will be. But it cant be you!!! Why would you drive 47 miles just to spy on me?  And without a phone call? Come on its impossible. It couldnt have been you and it will never be you RIGHT?

      Blind Blind Blind I waited for you and I waited without you. I put your pictures away and cry away my pain. I will always remember you but will you remember me? We've only known eachother in memories. I'm so tired but I cant sleep. My thoughts for you are so strong and deep. Fate has end our friendship!!! I'm suffering. You've took me for granted which I knew from the start but still I let that lead to a heartbreak. How was I supposed to know it will end this way? This must end and it has to end SOON. All I need is time, recoveries, alone, and drink you away. If your still reading this, I'm sorry for what I've done so wrong to you. I cant think of what but sorry anyways. I'll never fall into a situation like this ever again. This would be the last tears I will cry for you and let this be the end. I wont bother you ever again. I will never be good enough for you am I?  No phone calls and no e mails from you. I'm so hurt and thats all I can say.

      I've Got The Hang Overs After a whole month of recovering from heart breaks and away from alcohol, I must say I did very well. Just last night I went to club GlasKat, back in the clubbing industry again. It was Jessica's 23rd birthday party. She rented out the whole vip room, there was a sushi bar, karaoke room, one open bar, a very big lounge room, and of course a dance floor. I've got in at 11, it was pretty unique everywhere I went there was people I knew since elementary and throw out high school. So basically everybody knew everybody. It was kinna weird, an early high school reunion I must say. It was crazy!!! I dont rememeber exactly how many shots I took. Everytime I run into old friends they would handcuffs me and pull me to the bar. Let me try to remember, three shots of remy, one red bull with vodka, long island, and a sex on the beach. WoW, that was a whole lot for me, I was messed up. Saw my ex-bf from jr high, I was expecting a big hug, but instead we shook hands. That wasnt too bad, I know he hate my guts. Saw Rafael Quach brought back major memories. He had this incredible feelings for me since jr high. I never knew this until after we graduate from high school. I would see him at clubs every now and then, but this boi is so afaird of me for some reasons. I guess I reject alot of greats guys out there. Anyways I didnt see him until twelve and thats when I was fucked up. I went outside with my friends to smoke and Rafael was standing there. All I remember was Sakdary, you remember me? I looked and yelled out Rafaaaaeeeellllllll with a very cheesy smile. Then started puking like crazy. So sorry Rafael I didnt get a chance to associate with you. I realized that when your stressed out about someone you mainly think of that. The more I thought about that person the more puking I did. I threw up so much that security wouldnt let me back in the club. At this point I had to leave. Damn, only two hours of partying for me and I'm fucked up already? Two of my girlfriends had to take me home and take good care of me. I was throwing up the whole way back. My head was out the window the entire time. Got home I manage to take off my clothes, and hopped in the shower. I sat there while the water was running, then got up trying my best not to fall and finish taking a shower. Afterwards I dry myself up and got out the tub and went to sleep in the bath room with just a towel rap around myself. My friends checked up on me and lol I was knock out on the bathroom floor. That was very sad. I was carried and put to sleep and my friends left to 1015. Damn, I ruined everybody's night didnt I? While lying there bed I had this bad bad crap on my left calf. I was hurt so much in pain. This is the part when I really need someone to be with me. Damn, no bfs to call. Poor Sakdary in pain all along. I took two advil and went straight to sleep. Woke up at 10:30 had a hangover. My head was spinning like crazy, I couldnt move, I threw up some more and after all that I was stuck. I sat there thinking what the hell happen last night? Trying so hard to remember who was I with? Who did I associate with? A thousand questions ran through my mind. I tried so hard to get ready and leave the house. But I couldnt even get up. Didnt get a chance to leave the house until 1. Picked my Alyssia up and came home. Play with her for a lil bit then went back to bed by 2. Its 6:46 now, and Cassie's calling my cell like every hour. I refused to answer her call because of what she did to me last night. That was messed up. A friend should always be there for another friend rite? But this Cassie girl left me took off to 1015 with some dude. I was already fucked up but of well. Dont anybody ever expact anything from me ever again. I'm not going to be that nice precious lil thing to anybody anymore. Going to 1015 tonight? I dunno, maybe or maybe not depends on how I really feel. I still feel the handover and bodyaches. If I still feel stressed out by 10 then I'll go but if not I'll be home recovering.

      In fatal Child  I have just received my daughter's report card this morning. And it says......  Attendance A+  Behavior A  Communication A  Dancing A  Drawing A  Listening A  Music A  Sharing B  Singing A  Anita, (Alyssia's teacher) told me that this little one got potential. Alyssia is much stronger and much active then any other kids that is there. Alyssia is always the leader of any kind of games. Alyssia is always the first one that comes up with an ideal game to play with the other kids. Alyssia tells other kids what to do. Alyssia always want to do things on her own. She even folds her blanket after she wakes up. She likes to help and she cleans up after herself. She loves story times. She would act, sing and dance along to story time. She is a goof ball but a real cutie.    Everyone at school loves Alyssia so much. I think that it will break their heart if I was to cast Alyssia away from them. Everyone there is just so nice to my daughter and very kind enough to buy her things. Alyssia is just so spoil by everyone there.   As a single parent, I would like to recommend Mary's Day Care to a low-income family. Its cheap, clean, friendly, a good start for preschool, piano lesson, and the best part of all, your child will learn how to speak Chinese and English.     So far so good. Alyssia is a very bright little girl. I am so lucky to have a daughter that is very elegant and smart. As for sharing, don't even count on it. This little girl is very feisty. What can I say she's got charisma.   Anita is very proud of me for coming this far. She has asked me what have I done to have such a great daughter like Alyssia? It is a secret but I rather center on this administration ability to give people the entire truth, the full picture of reality.   I have a routine of what I like to do. I would read to Alyssia before she goes to bed. Talk to her and listen to what she has to say. My whole intention is to teach her what I know. This is very hard for me as a single mom but I never regret having her as my daughter at all. However, what I regret most is having her at the wrong time.   In the past few weeks some questions have begun to arise about just how am I going to make it through alone. Am I going to make it? Will I have success in reaching for my goals? Am I doing the right thing? Am I a great mom to Alyssia yet? All of these crazy questions running through my mind, fear and afraid that I may not give her enough. However, you know what I will keep my head up strong and always to face my fears. It has been so many years without anyone's help I think I'm doing a great job. What am I to know I cannot judge myself? Can anyone judge me? What are my grades? Did I past the test?

      More Crazy Dreams  All I can really say rite now is DAMN. It was incrediable!!! I mention about Passion yesterday day and that followed me into my dreams. In my dream, I fantasize about him. My body temperture rise as he touches my skin and grab me gently, kissing me softly and caressing my neck. Strong love making involved, I was pleassure. Body shaking intensly as he kisses every single part of my body. With just the two of us mangoling in bed, from one position to another has gotten me all juiced up.   I woke up from this strong sexual desire dream and sat there. I coulnt forget how I really felt in that one amazing dream I just had. That was a strong one. I think I'll have a wonderful day today.

      Passion...  Gosh man, everyone is blogging about Passion. I do not need to spell out everyone's name but there is too many of you. Which makes me wanna blog about passion as well.  What is passion? Does everyone have passion? Is everyone supposed to have passion? Do I, myself have passion? I do not know what my passions are and I do not want to know. Allow me to define "PASSION".   Passion= Fulfilling, strong liking, desire, devotion, concept, sexual desire, goals, feels good about yourself, happiness, peace and GIVE.   Damn, I am not even sure if I have passion. I just know that I love to give; I cannot say no from time to time, that is my biggest problem. Offering because I would feel ashamed if I didnt. I trust myself and i give people a chance to open up to me.   Follow your dreams or fulfilled your passion, be honest with yourself and bottom point of all truly love yourself. Passion is a total concept of loving yourself before you can even love someone in particular. Don't ever put yourself down for some silly reasons. Just be happy with what you have and dont hate on people because of their backround, looks, etc.   So what are you passionate about? If you do not have an answer for yourself you're not ready for many things. Either you win or you lose. You choose. Your choice. Ask yourself.

      How Bazaar  About a little over a month ago, a friend won $10,000 from the Hearts Scratchier. From then on, I am always very anxious to win big. I think I have only spent four dollars. I would break even or win $3, $6 or even just a ticket.  Nevertheless, today holly shit, I turned in my $6 worth and got three scratchier, won, a total of $83. Not bad!!! Its only $83 buts I am excited, I am happy and the most important part of all, I won 83 bucks, FREE.  Gosh man, I am sitting here thinking about cashing my scratchier for cash and use that on grocery and get more tickets. However, there is this little voice inside my head that tells me not to be greedy and that I shouldn't. Lol.   Saturday   After work, I went out to eat with a couple of friends. Then went home and relax I was actually watching the discovery channel. Can you believe that? Walking with the Caveman was playing. I know that I should have picked all this at school but you know me, never pays close attention in class. I found it very interesting no matter how sleepy I was I stood up watching that show. I fell a sleep after the first hour.  I think the movie was five hours long itself.    Can anyone tell me where to get the movie? I really want this movie; it was based on what in the world happen on earth. Documentary from billions of years ago.   Sunday  I went to a house warming in Sacramento. The house was five thousand square feet for only $358 thousand dollars. It is in a nice ass neighborhood. Shit, that was hella cheap.   Now, I have been fantasizing about my future house. It has been going through my head for the pasted two days now. It is not too soon to think of what I really want for my house right. I have so many things in mind. Big and expensive is what I am aiming for. I do not mean to brag, but I told my mom and grandma about this yesterday.  They were very nice enough and very happy to help me. THANKS, a million, I think I will need that.  Friends asked me, whats wrong with the place Im living right now? Why would I want to live alone with just Alyssia and myself?  My answer was, Do you think I want to live in this shit hole for the rest of my life?

      Surfing the net   This is interesting and very cute :)  THE ROAD NOT TAKEN  by Robert Frost  Two road diverged in a yellow wood,  And sorry i could not travel both  And be one traveler, long i stood  And looked down as far as i could  To where it bend in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair,  And having perhaps the better clain,  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  Though as for that the passing there  Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay  In leaves no steps had trodden black  Oh, I kept the first for another day!  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  I doubted if I should ever come back  I shall be telling this with a sigh  Somewhere ages and ages hence:  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-  I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference.   Some other quotes/saying i found interesting...   If I write your name on paper...  it can be thrown away  If I write your name on my hand...  it can be rubbed away  If I write your name on sand...  it can be washed away  For if I write your name on my heart...  there is no way it can go away   If I could be anything in this world,  I would beyour tear drop.  I was born from your eyes,  Live on your checks,  and die on your lips.   @-}-}--- CRUSH --}-}-@  It takes only a minute  to get a crush on someone,  An hour to like someone,  And a day to love someone.  But, it takes a lifetime to forget someone.   It takes a billion tiny snowflakes,  To make a blanket of snow,  It takes a million tiny stars,  To light up the darkest skies.  But it only takes  One simple kiss,  To make me fall for you.   ...Scientific of love making...   1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when women make love they produce doubleamounts of the hormone estrogen, which make hair shiny and skin smooth.   2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses the pores and makes your skin glow.   3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that romantic dinner.   4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches and tunes up just about every mucles in the body. It`s more enjoyable than swimming 20 laps and you don`t need special sneakers!   5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body endorphins into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and leaving you with a feeling of well-being.   6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called pheromones. These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!   7. Sex is the safest tranquiliser in the world. It is 10 times more effective than Valium.   8. Kissing eachday will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid that cause decay, preventing plaquebuild-up.   9.Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release the tension that restricts blood vessls in the brain.   10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.  Recommended dosage: 3x a day!!! AIGHT   FUCK THIS, I'm outta here.

      I Miss Sleeping   I am tired so tired very tired. Feels like the world is going to end any time soon. I am at work! Yep at work, again FUCK. My brain feels all fried up and my body aches. I did not go out; I did not do anything last night. Although I was up until 10:30 watching my Thai movies.   I need some coffee. God damn Star Bucks was not open when I road by this morning at five thirty. I will try again before eight tho. I am about to just crash onto my keyboard and go to sleep. Sleep is all I can think of. Only if that were an option I would do it. The lazy drip of Sakdary.    I cannot blog damn I just cannot. A co-worker has just asked me a question and I went blank. I know she was talking to me but all I got was the mouth moving with no sound. Lol, I am sorry I am not quite awake yet. This is so hard and I cannot stay focus on doing my work shit.   Great now my stomach is growling. I am hungry damnit. I want to go back to sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Im so sleepy and starving.

      Its Time to Move On  Rory and I had this chat based on relationship. His from New Jersey, weve been friends for the longest I cant remember. We hardly talk but once we do it just goes on and on and on.   Me: Dude, do you have any girlfriends? It seems like youve been single for the longest.   Rory; hmm, I was seeing this chic last year and didnt work out. That will be the last time Ill try romance.  Me: So this is it? Youve given up on girls? It hurts and love sucks huh?   Rory: Im not giving up on it. I just hate the pressure I get from family and friends. I almost got engaged to a person I couldnt see spending the rest of my life with. And I feel like I let everyone down when I broke up with her.   Me: Awww, Im sorry to here this but your still young, there would be someone else along the way. Dont be so hard on yourself. Dont expect too much from a person because all that leads you to is heartache and disappointment.   Rory; Thanks. Although, Id rather keep a optimistic view on it. Every heartache and disappointment is a benefit.  Me: do you agree that love is very short and forgetting is so long?  Rory; love is a lifetime. Even if you love someone and break up, that love feeling you felt or gave will always be there. And it will be passed along and it will only get better. Forgetting isnt an option. Everything you did will be remembered if reminded of something. You seem to be drowning yourself in a love complication, have you gotten a way out yet?  Me; lol Rory, shit up.    Time waits for no one. Treasure every moment you have. You will treasure it even more when you can share it with someone special.   Now lets get into my questions and answers  Q; why hasnt he return my e mails? A; Hes not interested in you. Q; why did he take me for granted? A; youre an easy gal to get by and you developed feelings too soon. Q; why doesnt he chat with me anymore? A; his bored of your ass. Q; should I let go? A; yep. Dont waste time on a person who isnt willing to waste their time on you. Q; what is it that other gal have that I dont have? A; degree, knowledge, skills, power and etc. Q; do you know what you want Sakdary? A; I see what I want and I intend to go for it. Q; do you even know yourself? A; Im always true to myself.

      On The Edge of Tomorrow  So I had this super long talk with Harvey, while having dinner at Foreign Cinema last night. About whats going to happen to us within the next five years? This should be real interesting. I made it simple and I somehow shall walk the path that Ive chosen. Basically my big issues right now is to save up as much as possible. The more, the better. Ill become a work alcoholic. Ill party every now and then. Ill not only ignore buddies phone calls but I will not put myself in the center of attention anymore. Im just going to vanish into my own little world. Its called Sakdarys La La Land.   I want to own a house before Alyssia starts school or before I turn 27. Not too much time is left for me. I must do what I have to rite? A three bedroom house, two story high, yard and car garage sounds perfect. Ill be transfer to Sacramento within a few years and thats my destination. Im also sick and tired of the bay area. Better education is offered for Alyssia. Thats all I have in mind as of rite now.    Oh the other hand Harvey bull shit about making his short cut side money and mainly talks about his dream car. The new Navigator w/24s, drop, fully loaded, 6 screens, etc. All there is with Harvey is fast cars, girls girls girls, and a big fat house with an extremely big fat car garage. Talks about his job, everyone is going to get laid off pretty soon. Oh did I mention that he build satellite for Space Loral System company? Anyways that company is going down. Hell probably get laid off at the end of August. That poor boy.    Dinner with Harvey isnt as charming as having dinner with Vu. Harvey complains like a girl. The place isnt his kina place. The food wasnt delicious. People there drinks vine and he had cock tails. But to me its the opposite. I didnt want to say anything to over react because it was his birthday. I got him a bottle of cologne. After dinner we called it a night.

      A Party Bus? WTF! (Saturday night)   My friend Desiree invited me to go on a party bus. The occasion? A bachelorette party!  WoW this is gonna be one hell of a party. Lol, I get to have as many lap dances as I wish. There were seven of us (all gals), sorry I don't remember everyone's name.    Club Whisper was where we had to meet in order to get on the bus. Once we got there, there was another bachelorette party and a birthday party. No one cute, a whole bunch of bean heads (their with the b-day boi). Tried to flirt and sweet talk but I didn't buy it.    The cool thing about the party bus was that we get to stop by four different clubs. Here's our destination;   The first stop - Sky lounge 10 - 10:15 pm. Desiree and I cut out to the liquor store while everyone else went inside the club to party. I, of course got myself a bottle of Remy and Des got herself a bottle of Jack Daniels. We drank on the bus, everyone came back on the bus within 15 minutes.  It was only 10 o' clock; the club was dead so we left.    The second stop - Snow Drip 10:20 - 11:30pm Damn man, nuthang but a whole bunch of white people!!! Where are all the hot fine Asian guys at??? We stay in the hip hop room. Seven girls, dancing in a circle which caught a lot of attention.  I was being checked out for a while. Damn what a good impression, I haven't been checked out since forever. I was approach! I didn't know what to say or do. I was there to have a great time so I dance along with the stranger. Somehow I didn't feel connected with this guy. His very cute; body build; tall; looks like a player to me. Dude was being so aggressive with me. That cheap scape. I took off to the disco room and it was time to go anyways. (Club was wacky)!   The third stop  Velvet 11:40  1:10 This club was poppin! I had a great feeling about this club that I will have a marvelous time. I like this club, I really do! The music was good, hip hop of course. I was buzzin by then. At this point I need a cute guy to dance with but no where to be found. I wasnt desperate but was getting sick and tired of dancing with the girls in circles.   We left the club on the dot and waited for everyone else on the bus. I must say that were always the early birds. Seven girls dancing on the bus weve all became very wild and sexy appealing. An Asian dude approaches me. Wow oh my gosh, shesh he was a real cutie. Who strip for me in exchanging for my number.  Lol, I was drunk! Gave him my work number without the area code and no extension. Wow, very smart of you Sakdary!!! You blew it. He lifts me up and wanted to take me away with him but it was time to leave. It was a very nice time chatting with a cutie tho.   The fourth stop  Polyester - 1:20  2:00 This fuckin club sucks all they play was the oldies, 70s, 80s, disco and Elviss songs. It was boo boo and my buzzin began come down. I sat there, so ready to go home. I was tired!!! Partys over for the night.

      My Mambo # 5  I went to a Karaoke Bar about 4 months ago and a friend sung Mambo #5. I listen to the recorded cd this morning and started to crack up. Its hilarious!!! So I figured it would be interesting to put the words together just to laugh at. Ha Ha. A lil something something. No biggies. Hey GUYS dont take this personal.   Beer Buzz that I had last week, I must stay deep because talking is cheap.  I want Kevin, Rory, Chao and Darol. As I continue weve only getting sweeter.  So I really wanna thank you my love. To me straight flirting is just like a sport. Anything is good.   A lil bit of Vu in my life. A lil bit of Anthony by my side.  A lil bit of Tyler is all I need. A lil bit of Kenny is what I see.  A lil bit of Christ in the sun. A lil bit of Harvey all night long. A lil bit of Isaac here I am. A lil bit of YOU makes me a woman.   I do all to fall in love with a guy like you. You cant run and you cant hide. You and me gonna touch the sky.

      Whats Your Dream Job?  Sitting behind the computer working 8  10 hours a day (Except for weekends). The AC is over my head, Im freezing! Great pay, great environment, people here are very nice. No hard labor but just use your tremendously knowledge and skills. In control of the typing department, tells people what to do and what not to do. Im known as the bossy trouble maker.   Answering calls from clients regarding to their policy corrections and returning their calls if needed. I have to deal with finding files and be very politely to the clients. Im going insane because theres so much for me to do.  I realized that I would roll my eye balls at the computer screen when ever the phone rings. Shesh, I hate this job!!! I loved it before but now I hate it. Let me say this one more time I Hate This Crapy Job Fuck. I hate to deal with people, I hate to correct peoples mistakes. I feel like yelling and screaming. I feel like taking the day off at this very vicious moment. Shit, this is stressing me out damn it.   Intentionally Im still in control! Sakdary rules! YEAH BABY!

      Proposal ???  School starts this coming Monday. So therefore I have to train this new temp on policy. His name is Tyler; very cute; white; 6 foot tall; in his late 20's or early 30's; a pretty boy type;  British looking like; body built; etc.    It isnt easy to train because its one hell of a job. I would say its very complicated to learn. But in and out after the first day of training, I must say that I liked this guy!!! He picks up just like that. His very brilliant who learns very quickly.  It's a piece of cake for him. Which gives me props and extra credits for being a great teacher :).  Today is Tyler's second day. Here I am sitting here doing my usual work and Tyler approached me. Since his so tall, he had to get down on bended knees and started to ask me questions. I eventually started to crack up. Never before has a man prospectively approached me this kind of way before. It's a very weird feeling but very glorious intentional. .

Please forgive me for not being a perfect grand daughter that you've always wanted. Please forgive me for not walking the path that you've choosen for me.

I'm sure your in a better place now. I know that your looking down and smiling at every single one of us. I just want you to know that you dont have to worry about this grand daughter.

      Time After Time I've been telling myself that no on is gonna change him. I'm not going to waste my time waiting. I'm gonna find someone who will treat me right. Its time to move on. Because there are much more for me to see. As hard as it is, I dont think I can maintain to let him go. Its hard to let go and it hurts forcing myself to stay away. But this is what I really have to do Right? I dont want to be an intruder in anybody's life. Being a third person isnt fun to play with. There would be excitments but its only an entrance to heartbreak and disappointments.   I want to keep diving into him but I get nothing in return, I'm just fooling myself. I dreamt about him again for the past two nights. Does this mean anything? Is this a sign for me to contact him? I'm afaird that if I do, all I get in return is a breakdown. Cant he just make me smile once more? Must this be the end of us now? I hope not!!! Cant it just be the end of one chapter and going on to the next? I dont want to run away but I cant take it. I'm so frustrated, my decision was made but I'm forcing myself to be this way. Why should I push myself this way why?     Maybe I've choosen the wrong path. Is it too late to turn back or should I leave it the way it is? I can give friends great advices but cant do the same for myself. Dammit.

I dont have to log in with my user name or a password anymore. Now, I can just turn the computer on and place my thumb on the identix pad and it will automatically scan then log me in. Cool huh? I thought it was tite! Dell is the shit. Go Dell, go Dell, its your birthday hheheheh. Too much coffee for me today. I'm in La La land again.   Aye Aye, since my finger print can be identified at work, does this mean the police department get it as well? Holly shit I better not do anything illegal. Forreals.

      Thirst of Hunger   My step dad works for Oaks Club Casino. His got a gambling problem. Just the other day he asked me to lend him one grand. Therefore, I did. I did not know anything about the 10k. Until my mom told me the truth, about what is behind all of this. The story begun, dad owes Oaks 10k. He has a limited of time to pay back every single penny. If the money isn't handed over, only god knows what will happen to him. Mom asked me to help.   Gosh man, WTF does families seize me as. A bank account? I really want to complain about all of this but what's the used. Family will always be families. My highest priority is to do my best to keep everyone satisfied. I would do what ever it takes to help (if I can). Another grand was all I can offer. I need the rest to cover my ass for my own bills. I am not a greedy person or anything but my bills are due, nevertheless this is the very best that I can do. What else can I do? I don't know any billionaires and mainly I am not rich myself.   My heart fell straight rite to the ground for a second. I could not believe what is happening to my family. The very first thing that came to mind was that he deserved it. Let him untangle this problem his self. He got himself into this situation; let him figure a way out. Let god punish him for what his done. Let him suffer the consequence alone.   Sadly, in the mean time, my little heart collapse. What can I do? I felt so bad for what's going on rite now. I sat here thinking about the old times. When dad rod his bike, two miles, to pick me up from school. I was probably in the 2nd grade. No matter how poor we were, he has always paid for my school pictures. He would always give me lunch money though out high school. He took good care of me. He was always there for me. Under circumstance, I felt so awful if I did not give him more then I can offer.   A friend once said to me, "Without money, there's no happiness". It's very true without money you cant be happy. No money, no honeys. In the elements of life, the saying is so true think about it.

      F A M I L Y  I ran into a stranger as he passed by, "Oh excuse me please" was my reply.  He said, "Please excuse me too; I wasn't watching for you."  We were very polite, this stranger and I. We went on our way and we said good-bye.  But at home a different story is told, How we treat our loved ones, young and old.  Later that day, cooking the evening meal, My daughter stood beside me very still. When I turned, I nearly knocked her down.  "Move out of the way," I said with a frown.  She walked away, her little heart broken. I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken.  While I lay awake in bed, God's still small voice came to me and said,  "While dealing with a stranger, common courtesy you use, but the children you love, you seem to abuse. Go and look on the kitchen floor, You'll find some flowers there by the door. Those are the flowers she brought for you. She picked them himself: pink, yellow and blue. She stood very quietly not to spoil the surprise, you never saw the tears that filled her little eyes."  By this time, I felt very small, And now my tears began to fall. I quietly went and knelt by her bed;  "Wake up, little one, wake up," I said.  "Are these the flowers you picked for me?"  She smiled, "I found 'em, out by the tree. I picked 'em because they're pretty like you. I knew you'd like 'em, especially the blue."  I said, "I'm very sorry for the way I acted today; I shouldn't have yelled at you that way."  She said, "Oh, Mom, that's okay. I love you anyway."  I said, " I love you too, and I do like the flowers, especially the blue."  F A M I L Y  Are you aware that if we died tomorrow, the company that we are working for could easily replace us in a matter of days. But the family we left behind will feel the loss for the rest of their lives. And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more into work than into our own family, an unwise investment indeed, don't you think? So what is behind the story?  Do you know what the word FAMILY means? FAMILY = (F)ATHER (A)ND (M)OTHER (I) (L)OVE (Y)OU  After reading this E-mailed, it suddenly broke my heart. Now, I'm sitting here thinking of my daughter. There are times that I am so busy with doing something and Alyssia comes around trying to help.  It annoys me every time.  All I do is yell at her, telling her to go away. My heart melted and all burned up and filled with regret ness. I am so sorry, I truly am. Making it up to her is my only way out. Children's fairyland this weekend anybody?

      Quest for Love, Lust and Adventure  Just a girl who caught your eyes, in one of my darker dayz. A million times, I thought about you. Memories of laugher and things we used to do. You touch my life in such a special way. I missed your fingers running through my hair. Those crazy nights we cuddle in your cozey bed.   Trading e-mails started happening last February. Everything was lovely, sweet and totally lubby dubby.  Since then we would get together at least once a month. Have dinners together, go clubbing or just chill at his place watch movies and of course making out. Regardless, its nice to flirt with someone, even if it is mostly via E-mail. The truth was, I'm not even that interested in dating anyone at that time or not even rite now. He was fun to make out with and I wanted to see him more and more each time. I find him kinda nutty sometimes but he kept my mind off the romance wreckage side. I let myself go with the flow. What ever happen happens. I didn't really care too much of what's ahead of me. No great expectations.   Again and again I dreamt about him. So weird, so strange. It happened at least once or twice a week. Never have I dreamt about a guy as much as I did of him. The very last time I was over at his place I was getting very uncomfortable. Why? Maybe because of the distanced and his disappearance which made me turn away. The whole making out thingy made me so ready to run out the door.   I was uncomfortable because the whole thing made me feel like a fool. I didn't want to be anyone's Bitch, hole, slut and to be stepped on all over. Ever since that night pasted I have learn another lesson. To tell you the truth I didn't regret of what happen because there was no mistaking what was going to happen.   However, as things began to continue we have lost tract of each other somehow. I really didn't know what went wrong. Perhaps I should say he got bored of me and I was not that kinda gal he was looking for eventually. After four completely great months of good via E-mailed flirting, it was time for me to let it go. It was hard to get my mind off from someone I was so into. It was so terrible because I was always so emotional.   I wanted someone who can respect me for who I am. and someone who doesnt mind me having a baggy. as of now Ive disconcerted myself out again. There isnt too much of anything that I want from anyone rite now. But just a real true friendship.

      Memorandum  I am so not having a good day today. What a disaster!!! Once I stepped into the office this morning people have been throwing files at me. Sakdary correct this. Sakdary correct that. Correcting policy is my job. However, correcting the entire work from some bimbo from last night just throws me off. I have been so feisty to everyone. That is just because co-workers started first. Now you must have thought that I am so selfish huh. Gosh, I hate today.   Being a supervisor is not easy at all. Putting up with people is a Bitch. I was told to let my co-workers know what is going on and how work should be done (correctly). And once I go off doing that, everyone complain to me. WFT? Now, Jim (2nd manager) is going off at me and everyone else because of all these changes. Jim was not around when all the changes took place. Only Kim ( the big manager) was verified. Is it my fault? I dont think so. I was just doing what I was told to do.    Why cant everyone just get alone and do their work the way they was told to do. Why trip off every lil things that are coming out of my mouth? Why cant we just work together and corporate without giving each other mean dirty looks? Great, now two co-workers are passing notes around and laughing. Are they laughing at me? Talking about me? Could anyone please tell me what am I doing wrong?   Now I feel like everyone is just trying to bite me in the back when Im not paying attention. Feels like co-workers are going to stab me with an ax in the back of my head. Now Im the bad person in their sight. What a very nice way to start out a day man.

      Annoying Things...  Things That Piss Me Off :   - People who point at their wrist while asking for the time. I know where my watch is buddy, where the *bleep* is yours? Do I point at my punanny when I ask where the bathroom is?   - When people say, while watching a movie "Did you see that?" No *bleep*, I paid $8.50 to come to the theatre and stare at the *bleep* in ceiling up there.   - When people say, "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too." *bleep* off. What good is a goddamn cake you can`t eat?   - When people say "It`s always in the last place you look". Of course it is. Why the *bleep* would you keep looking after you`ve found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they?

      Personal History Awareness Month  This is the time to tell your loved one that you have cheated on him.  This is the time to question your loved one about their past histories.  This is the time to dig through all those good and bad things that your loved one had been hiding from you.  This is the time to share your personal histories.  This is the time to uncover your personal histories.  This is the time to share your deepest and darkest history to your loved one.  This is the time to settle your differences.   I found this on the internet. I couldn't have said it better. So, read on!  When you think of your past love, you may view it as a failure. But when you find a new love, you view the past as a teacher. In the game of love, it doesn`t really matter who won or who lost. What's important is that you know when to hold on and when to let go! You know you really love someone when you want him or her 2be happy, even if his or her happiness means that you`re not part of it. Everything happens for the best.   If the person you love doesn`t love you back, don`t be afraid to love someone else again, for you`ll never know unless you give it a try. You`ll never love a person you love unless you risk for love. LOVE STRIVES IN HURTING. IF YOU DON`T GET HURT ,YOU DON`T LEARN HOW TO LOVE. Love doesn`t hurt all the time. Though the hurting is still there to test you, to help you grow.DON'T FIND LOVE, LET LOVE FIND YOU!. That`s why it`s called falling in love because you don`t force yourself to fall. You just fall. You cannot finish a book without closing its chapters. If you want to go on, then you have to leave the past as you turn the pages.Love is not destroyed by a single failure or won by a single caress. It is a lifetime venture in which we are always learning, discovering and growing.  The greatest irony of love is letting go when you need to hold on and holding on when you need to let go. We lose someone we love only when we are destined to find someone else who can love us even more than we can love ourselves. On falling out of love, take some time to heal and then get back on the horse. But don`t ever make the same mistake of riding the same one that threw you the first time.To love is to risk rejection; to live is to risk dying, to hope is to risk failure. But risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing! To reach for another is to risk involvement; to expose your feelings is to expose true self;to love is to risk not to be loved in return. How to define love: fall but do not stumble, be constant but not too persistent.

      Joke of the Day  An 85-year-old man went to his doctor's office to get a sperm count. The doctor gave the man a jar and said, "Take this jar home and bring back a semen sample tomorrow."  The next day the 85-year-old man reappeared at the doctor's office and gave him the jar, which was as clean and empty as on the previous day.  The doctor asked what happened and the man explained: "Well, doc, it's like this    First I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand, then her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, and still nothing.  We even called up Arleen, the lady next door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit and she even tried squeezin' it between her knees, but still nothing."  The doctor was shocked! "You asked your neighbor?" The old man replied, "Yep. And no matter what we tried, we still couldn't get the jar open."

      And So Its Over   First day back to work from a nice beautiful, relaxing vacation. It was so hard to wake up this morning.  To tell you the truth I did not feel like coming back to work period. Dont you just wish that wed all dont have to work. Dont have any bills to pay for. Just chill and have tropical drinks ever now and then. In addition, eat delicious food everyday. Dont have to worry about a single thing.  However, just smile the day away.   Vacation vanishes in quickness. So eternizing it was. Id did some city hopping from Virginia, to Washington Dc, Atlantic city, New York, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Boston. With just a blink of an eye, here I am back at work again. It was nice to bond with families. I am gonna miss that so much. It wont be anytime soon until I return. Let just say in the next ten years or so.   In a descent way I am mighty glad Im back at home. Friends called me and asked if I would like to accompany them to Las Vegas in September. Going Jet Skiing and just have a blast out there again. I am so ready very ready to go to Vegas. Sure, count me in!!!

      Let Me B Useful   I want "children" to look at me and feel warm and happy because they know I will do anything to help them where they need to go, human and divine. Performing this function makes me feel warm and happy. Later, I want others to look at me and feel warm and happy but not remember why. I want to do small insignificant task I was born to do and be blissful doing it. I want God to take sips of my soul and be satisfied. I dont want to be thrown away or forgottan. I want to be saved and be downloaded. My function may change, but I'm happy with my role now and while I may not perform it well, one day I might. My dad said the other day that if we knew the future, there'd be no hope.

      God Damnit  I get so frustrated when people who I want to blog don't blog. A small percentage of my happiness of the day hinges on these people blogging and they don't for like a couple of dayz or even longer. Bloop.  Anyways, here are some of my favorite lines that I've been repearting over and over these dayz.   It's not what you got, it's what you give.  It ain't the love you choose, it's the life you live.  It's not what you know, it's who you know.

      My Choice  I once asked an ex boyfriend what is it that he want in life the most. Which would he perfer, happiness or success. He choose happiness. I truly disagree with his decision. Not that I didn't respect it but happiness isn't what i'm looking for rite now.   Don't get me wrong! Happiness and success are two different prospects. Happiness is being with people you truly love. Amazing things all around. Being with a person won't make me happy for the rest of my life. I need to be experienced in the outside world. I need a balanced of both, being happy and work hard for what I shall succeed for.   I don't think that leaving him was wrong. I wanted someone with imagination, who is manly enough to take charge and untangle problems. I need someone with a positive inspiration. I need someone who would make me romantic dinners. I need someone who can give me feed backs on my opinion. I need someone who can be vulnerable and adventurous. I need someone who can make me smiles at all times. Someone I can look up to is all I need.   We spent hours on the phone last night. Why did you have to call me? My feelings for you aren't there anymore. You're not the person I want to be with. I've moved on and now it's your turn. Dont make me live in the past because that isn't where I want to be.   In just a few short lines I brought myself back to some of the darkest days I'd ever experienced. So lonely so hurt so bleak and hopeless and depressed.

      My Arrival In Virginia 07-03-03  It's so wonderful to be back in Virginia. I love the smell of the countryside. I love the humit thick air. I missed everyone so much. Aunties, uncles and lots and lots of cousins. Partly it's because the moment I'm in is so wonderful and densely packed with beauty that no other places can beat the fact that I'm happy.  Red White & Blue 07-04-03  It's fourth of July, a national holiday. YipeE!!! It all went well smoothly and I had some seriously delicious food and more precious conversation and quality time with families. I had beers and more beers. BBQ was great, there was ribs, steak kabobs, chickens, oysters, shrimps, corns and many more. I ate so much my belly looked like the sizes of Santa Claus beer belly.   Oh No...Did somebody say its karaoke time??? They played the top 20 songs from the 80's and 90's. Every song was "I KNOW THIS SONG. I LOVE THIS SONG!" I drank so much and sang my soul out. I was actually singing very amazingly or it could have been Sakdary getting drunk. LOL. The party was on until 12am, which was only 9pm my pacific standard time. No one can stop us now. That was one great night of my life.   An hour later we all decided to go to Atlantic City just for the heck of it. I missed out on the fireworks and that totally sucks. Walking around the broadwalk at 3 in the morning was really nice. I of course, get to play the slots for half and hour. Which wasn't too bad. I've spent $20.00 on slots. What I regret most was not buying any post cards damnit. Came home the next day.   Hot 07-06-03  It's hot like a mother f***** here. All we do here is eat and drink eat and drink. I'm growing a beer billy shit. Oh well, gotta go run and do my sit ups now.

      Mood Swing  It is so funny how music can affect me in so many different ways. I have been listening to R&B, to hip-hop, to trace, to blues and to techno.  Certain songs put me in very deep thoughts of sadness. This leads me into sorrows dangerously depressing.  In addition, curtain songs put me in this lubby dubby thinking happy thoughts.   Come Away With Me by Nora Jones   Every time I hear this song on the radio, it makes me rock my body from side to side. In such a romantic rhythms, I want a dance partner in an instance. I want to do the cha say. I want to be spin and twirl from one corner to another. I want to look into his eyes and seduced him. I want to sing the lyrics softly into his ears and smile in a very happy sexy appeal. Come away with me and well kiss. I wanna wake up with the rains outside while Im safe there in your arms. The feeling of overwhelming joy and peace. Okay okay enough imagination.   She aint right for you by Macy Gray  Now this song gets me all depressed. I would sing along with a frown on my face. Some how it makes me think of being alone. I hate to be alone. I am always alone. I feel so lonely and I know Im not the only one. It just makes me want to cry damnit.   You can fine 50 cents in the club  Now this song gets me pumpin. I just feel like moving through out the whole song. Makes me wanna dance to the beat. Bob my head side to side, up and down. Makes me feel like Im so tough.    I want you back in my life by Alice DJ  This song may be a dancing techno type but I breakdown. The lyric says, I want you back in my life. Want you back by my side. Once you were before. Look at me standing in the rain crying out your name again.   Man, amazingly mind blowing huh? Questions I came up with when ever I hear this song.   Whos the one that makes you happy? Whos the one always on your mind? Who is the reason your living for? Whos the reason for your smiles?   Mars & mystery  trance  I feel like a hard core. Yeah baby.   Shesh, now I am pretty well freaked out by my emotions. If songs can make me feel what I felt, then it really means that Im too sensitive. Isnt that ashamed? Dont know why I feel so sad so sad.    Man I love this song. Shawn Paul like glue. Yep I am rocking to the beat. My headphones are blast and enjoying myself.  Co-workers is laughing at me rite at this vicious moment. Okay Im not sad anymore. Im so hyper right now. Let me just bounce like a disco ball.

      Can't Explain What I'm Feeling Tonight  Uninspired is never the place I want to be. It can make even the most beautiful days not as wonderful as it should be. However, I seem to be inspired enough to blog about being uninspired at the moment... So once again I've reached one of the many confusing crossroads in my daily life... Where words don't.... Where I don't know the words to express the frustration of not understanding how I should feel... I like 0's and 1's... blacks and whites... They are the fuel I use to move forward with confidence... fractions and grays confuse and hinder me... my grays are always close to me though... As my journeys and experiences accumulate, I'm constantly cross-referencing with my grays to see if I've stumbled upon any answers unwittingly... What a feeling it is when it is revealed to my simple mind that something gray shouldn't be... It's so great to let that portion of me rest and experience a semblance of peace.   Oh, to feel hope in hopeless times. Nevermind the silver lining, cuz the clouds are fine. To breathe prayers that move the heavens or save hundreds from the flame, To know my place, to know my name. I never could be good enough to measure up. But You want to take me as a I come. You're the only one who can take me as I am.  I see I am not interesting but I like to write. I actually used to be very charming and witty and funny, and if you spend time with me, I might be that again, but on this blog I guess I'll just have to be mildly amusing and somewhat insightful yet confused... I'm cool with that I guess... but I'd like to be charming again one day...  Anyways this is one exchange that I think Youve Got Mail revolves around. Life doesnt get interesting until you get personal. I think thats why I like to memorize everyones talents or skills that not everyone knows about. I think thats why I ask a million questions to total strangers. My insides yearn to get personal. Im an only child people. I can have a shallow conversation with my shoes. Im looking to get deep. I need to get deep to be of any real use to you. Dont get me wrong, I can wink and smile and witty banter with the best. But if I cant exchange with you ourselves, Im just not being utilized properly.   My insides. How funny. Its cool to see sentences that contain,  my insides What I think is interesting about it is that my insides is often referred to in a manner which implies something like a genetic predisposition. My insides yearn to get personal. But why? Why do my insides yearn to get personal? Im not sure why. Its how I was made. It may be different than how you were made. But I tend to think that a large percentage of peoples insides yearn to get personal with other peoples insides.   Everyone has a sign on them that says, I want to feel important. My sign says, I want you to feel important. Lets find out how.

      Life Is Precious, Don't Let It Slip By  1. It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return, but what is more painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let that person know how you feel.  2. A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go.  3. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had.  4. It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.  5. It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.  6. Don't go for looks; they can be deceiving. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it only takes a smile to make a dark day seem bright.  7. Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be; because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to.  8. Always put yourself in the other's shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other too.  9. A careless word may kindle strife; a cruel word may wreck a life; a timely word may level stress; a loving word may heal and bless.  10. The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything, they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.  11. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, ends with a tear. When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live life so that when you die... you are the one smiling and everyone around you is crying..

      Girlfriends  (More E Mails)  I sat on a porch in Waycross, Georgia on a summer day, drinking iced tea and visiting with my Mother..   "Don't forget your girlfriends," Mother advised, clinking the ice cubes in her glass.   "No matter how much you love your husband, you are still going to need girlfriends. Remember to go places with them now and then; do things with them.  And remember that girlfriends are not only friends, but sisters,  daughters and other relatives too."   What a funny piece of advice, I thought. Hadn't I just gotten married? Hadn't I just joined the couple-world? I was now a married woman, for goodness sake, not a young girl who needed girlfriends. But I listened to my Mom. I kept contact with my girlfriends and made more each year. As the years tumbled by, one after another, gradually I came to understand that Mom really knew what she was talking about.    Here is what I know about Girlfriends:   Girlfriends bring casseroles and scrub your bathroom when you need help.   Girlfriends keep your children and keep your secrets.   Girlfriends give advice when you ask for it. Sometimes you take it, sometimes you don't.   Girlfriends don't always tell you that you're right, but they're usually honest.   Girlfriends still love you, even when they don't agree with your choices.   Girlfriends laugh with you, and you don't need canned jokes to start the laughter.   Girlfriends pull you out of jams.   Girlfriends will give a party for your son or daughter when they get married or have a baby, in whichever order that comes!   Girlfriends are there for you, in an instant and when the hard times come.   Girlfriends listen when you lose a job or a friend.   Girlfriends listen when your children break your heart.   Girlfriends listen when your parents' minds and bodies fail.   Girlfriends cry with you when someone you loved dies. My daughters, sisters, family, and friends bless my life! When we  began this adventure we had no idea of the incredible joys or sorrows that lay ahead. Nor did we know how much we would need each other.   "NEVER CHOOSE A GUY OVER YOUR GIRLFRIENDS.'

Its hard to be alone but I love my freedom. but why cant anyone be there for me in need. no one to have sex with, no body want me. what am i doing wrong to make many guys turn their back on me??? everyone is probably laughing at me by now. Probably calling me a BITCH, a HOE, a WHore. I am so tipsy, dizzy, trying to reember things but i think my fucken brain is all fried up.   AT THE CLUB TONIGHT I SAW dEE, he is one of my close friend, pulled me out to the vip room and chat. Told me that his girl Jane is cheating on him with another friend since jr. high.

Its so sad to hear about somebody's else probablem. damn i am messing up Big time. do you think I i have enough brain cells and know what the fuck I am writing about??? NOOOOO.  Dee made me promise not to tell anybody about this. Now, another stressful shit for me to think about. I think I should give Jane a call tomorrow but I dont want to get into an argument with anybody. What should I do?? THere isnt anything that i can rally do about it is there? who evers hair it is let them deal with it rite?? but i think that it was kind enough for Dee to tell me his problem. I was fucked up at the moment I couldnt think of anythikng to say to him. Damn, I feel ever wrost now.   At the end of the club i saw Yen, the girl who messed up my sweet relationship. we kept staring at eachother. I swear we was about to get into a fight. My friends had to pull me away and we all left the club. anyone but her. that stupid fucken Scumback. fucken hoe, damn how should i curse at her to make myself feel better??? i should just let it go. its been so fuking long. its history baby. dissy, dissy, dissy, spinning spinning.......

      Not Two Perfect And Not Two Awkward   Lately, there have been many people telling me that I am a great dancer.  From friends to people who are willing to pay me to dance at a club, at a strip joint, and surprisingly, even at the bar. Thanks for the offer but no thank you.   I figure it is a gift, so why not use it rite? Dancing is one thing I really love most. I started dancing since I was in high school. Jazz, Broadway, Modern, hip-hop, ballet, African, sway, you name it. From my experience, what I really love  most was the performances. Maybe, because I love getting attention and I love the spotlights on center stage. It changes my whole life around from this boring, shy, embarrass, Sakdary to this magnificent new person. Once I am on the dance floor, don't expect to see any shyness in me. I can go on and on and on all night long just like that energizer bunny.   I was once a choreographer for Ambition Studio but I gave that up because I fell my accomplishment. I did not get the edition and I am still sad god damnit. If I was chosen that night, I could have been living large in Vegas rite now. I could have been sitting in Monte Carlo, in front of the slot machine going cha ching cha ching.   I still practice at home when  ever I have time.  I still believed that if you practice and practice, you'll get it. I am not going to give up and let that go to waste, until I get what I want. This time I will come back strong, stronger then before. I don't want to be a pathetic loser.

      United We Stand  I have been off and on with my politics lately. For some stupid reason it became very interesting to me. I used to hate politics so much but now, now, I cannot get my mind off this. Maybe, because of a famous actor, Arnold what's his name? Swishniger!!! I liked him as an actor for Hollywood but running for governor is so out of the question.   I don't care if people agrees to vote for him as a candidate, he is a very brilliant man but I DON'T LIKE IT. He is depending on his charm and popularity. I hope he does not win the election. Another reason is that he is republican and republican only helps the rich (higher-class) people. Has anybody ever thought about the lower class people? What is going to happen to them if a republican wins this election? I sure hope that who ever is running for democrat wins this election.   Have anyone ever thought about California? Of what is going on? Don't you think that California itself is a piece of  fine art museums? The most expensive place to live in. If I had one magic, I want to be able to control people's mind. I will tell them what to do and when to do it. Lol.

      Irritating  Damn man, the dude that said that I looked like a chicken that is choking on water wrote me this poem today. After reading it, I just had the chills. Gosh, this is beginning to scare the shit out of me. Hope that I wont shit on my pants if I read it once more. Damn Sakdary. Bad Sakdary. Bad bad bad Sakdary.   Here is what he wrote:  HERE IS THE POEM FOR YOU: SADARY My lonely eyes shimmer oh so quietly. As your picture perfect frame graced my presence I heard you walk pleasantly by my way. I completely absorb every inch of you into my curious mind. The intoxicating smell of your sweet perfume, Spell bound me like extreme insanity. My idle thoughts ran like a broken record: "Hello Miss? Is it me you've been looking for?" Yet I could not open my lips to tell you: "I want you", I need you" and most importantly " I am oh so deeply in love with you". I am like a mentally un-bloomed rare flower. That needs your soft touches and your light caresses. You are the butterfly that always passes me by. Without a second thought, you fly pass me I wish you would just perched your body on top of me. Use your skillful tongue to taste my inner core. This nectar is oh so sweet and oh so rare. Feel how long it's been waiting, wanting, and wishing. Make me spread my delicate petals out as far as I can. Feel my limbs and stems shaking uncontrollably. And feel me burst out with all unmentionable joy. As I bloom into sweet extasy. Feel the never-ending explosion with ever breath you breathe into me finally...Blooming into a beautiful flower on top of you... I hope you like it..hehehehe    I have just realized that I, Sakdary have the actual power to turn SOME GUYS upside down. Just here to mess around, have something on the side but this isnt want I was looking forward to. This is truly not my mentality. I didnt persuade this to happen. All I really need are true friends just to chat with. However, this has gone out of hands. I am just an infatile child what can I say.   This guy is a very handsome man and very nice. But elaborately, this isnt my plan for all of this to happen.  I am not looking for anyone at this time. Id better disconcerted myself out of khmer connection before things gets worst again. Never ever will I be on khmer connection as Sexy-Sadary anymore. Good-bye khmer connection.    Guys, if you are trying to impress me, please do not sweet talk me down. I wont fall for it but I will eventually push you very far away. My completely intentional is challenging because I have an opinion and decisions to make. I have a life and my freedom is very valuable to me. So dont try and push the button.

      Life Is Beautiful  Lately, Ive been saying Life is beautiful, Life is Beautiful. Life is beautiful once you are happy and have exclusively nothing to think about. I dont know why am I so excited but I am really happy. I can just sit here and smile forever. Love my life, I love my life. Maybe because it is payday and I am so ready for the weekend hehehhehe.   I have been listening to these Chinese songs. I have no idea what this person is singing about or the theme of these songs. However, I love the beat and it somehow so what really relaxes me. They put me in such a romantic mood that I prefer a lover in my life to dance with. Does anyone want to be my lover? Lol, I didnt think so.   I got bored being the boring old Sakdary. So, I made myself this flirt profile with a pix. Very harmless rite.  One guy compliment me about my skin color. He said that I look like a chicken that is choking on water. HELLO, I am 50% Cambodian (khmer), 25% Vietnamese, and 25% Chinese. I know that I am very light for a khmer girl but believed me, I am khmer!!!. In addition, I am so darn glad that I am light-skinned color.  I try to tan but never gotten any darker.    After chatting with so many people online, there is no one and I mean no one that I am interested in chatting with any longer. I had too many people to chat with but I think I will past. I am going to stay away from these so so called strangers. It isnt worth my time chatting if I would keep making these frowns faces. You know, left eyebrow up, lips all crochet.   There must be something wrong with me. It feels like I have block the entirely wall surrounding myself inside this bubble and never want to come out and play. I dont like to met people at the club because I think that they are after one thing SEX. Guys at the mall, players or broke as a joke. I dont know. I cant explain anything to myself either. They say when it is the rite time, the rite moment, the rite person, I will eventually feel it. But when? When I become too old with wrinkles all over?  What is wrong with me? Why am I doing this? For what? For whom?

      FORGET HIM   Forget his name, Forget his face, Forget his kiss, his warm embrace. Forget the love that u once knew, remember he has someone new. Forget him when they played ur song, remember that u cried all night long. Forget how close u two once were, remember he has chosen her. Forget the things he use to say, remember he has gone away. Forget his laugh, Forget his grin, Forget the dimples on his chin. Forget the way he held you tight, remember he`s wit her tonight. Forget the time that went so fast, Forget the love that move it`s past. Forget he say he`d leave u never, remember now, he`s gone 4-ever.

      Starting To Feel It  Sometimes I feel like I'm drifting... Into the abyss of perpetual confusion... And forlorn seclusion...  Riding helplessly on the wave of dispair  Pulled unwillingly through the motions of life.  But I have to find a way to break free from the monotony Or else nothing is all I'll ever be.

      The Lost Soul  I have alot of time to think, life is confusing. There are thing that I do understand and things that I still do not understand. But I am just trying to understand what is going on in my life at this present moment. I am not sure where my life is taking me. But I do know that I dont want to take this trip alone. I just wish there was someone out there for me. SOMEONE, who would be there at least in my heart and in my mind. Even if they are not physically present. If a love is strong enough the mere thought of them would be good enough just to get through a rough day. With just a simple smile which would melt to the bottom of my heart.   One day I will find that person, maybe I will be able to fix the broken pieces that I have left of my heart. But until then I will sit here everyday wishing, praying, hoping that I would not be awake alone. I have to be strong! Be strong patience is a virtue and I would wait until my dying day because even on my last if you appeared at my dying moment my life would be completly into pieces.  YOU KNOW I CAN'T GET MY MIND OF YOU, GRAMS*.

      Joke of the Day  Q: How do you make four old ladies say F***? A: Get a fifth old lady to yell "BINGO"  One evening, a family brought their frail, elderly mother to a nursing home and left her. Hoping that she would be well-cared for. The next morning, the nurses bathed her, fed her a tasty breakfast and set her in a chair at a window overlooking a lovely flower garden.  She seemed okay, but after a while, she slowly started to lean over sideways in her chair. Two attentive nurses immediately rushed up to catch her and straighten her up. Again, she seemed okay, but after a while, she started to tilt to the other side. The nurses rushed back, and once more moved her back upright. This went on all morning.  Later the family arrived to see how the old woman was adjusting to her new home. "So ma, how is it here? Are they treating you alright?" they inquired.  "They pretty nice here." she replied. "Except they wont let me fart".

      Being Twenty Something  It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are a lot of things about yourself that you didnt know and may not like. You start feeling insuecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but the get scared because you barely know where you are now.   You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to arent exactly the greatest people you have ever met and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you do not realize is that they are realizing that too and are not really cold or catty or mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.   You look at your job. It is not even close to what you thought you would be doing or maybe you are looking for ones and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and are scared.  You miss the comforts of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant basis. But then you realize that maybe they werent so great after all.  You are beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not want. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You've seen what others are doing and find yourself judging a bit more then usual because suddenly you realized that you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to you list of what is acceptable and what is not.   You are insecure and then secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused.  Suddenly changes is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life but soon realized that the past is drifting futher and further away and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.  You've got your heart broken and wonder how someone you love could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you cant meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you are not a bad person.  One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap and getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look like apathetic fool. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over and talked with friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision.  You worry about loans, money, the future, saving bonds, making life for yourself and while winning a compatitive game, right now you'd just like to be contender! What you may not realized is that everyone reading this relates to it. We all are in out best times and out worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.   This is exactly how I feel and wonder if there are people out there who feels the same way. Life is best when you realize the moment that you`re in and cherish it forever. I think the greatest thing is having a dream and then reaching it. I realize that sometimes you have to work extra hard to get there, and once you are there..ENJOY IT!!!

      Comparison   Yesterday after work, I went out for coffee at Star Bucks with some girlfriends. Somehow, we had talked about flowers and started comparing one another. Me, I was compared to a ROSE. Very dangerous to be around with. My color would capture a lot of attention but I have thorns that would hurt people deeply. And very expensive.   My eyeballs grew wide open; almost choke on coffee for a second there. Really? Am I that dangerous? NOWAY. Damn, I cannot protest with this one.    Gee, I think that I am to be more of a velvet lily. Fresh, pretty, clam, shy, cheap, very insecure. Cant hurt anyone because lilies dont have thorns. In addition, I do not hurt people. Unless people was to hurt me first. Now thats an exception.

      Who Me? Cant Be!    Friends tell me that I have no life. Why? Because, Miss Sakdary works excessively too much. I cant help it, if I am so dedicated to work. This is just the way I am. This is who I am.  I do not mean to brag but it makes me feel so special. One of a kind! Not like any other! Feels good to be different from the rest! Alyssia was not home with me this weekend. So therefore, I come to work on Saturday. . What else is there to do? Stick my butt up, snoring like a pig while the sun shines on my ass? I love what I do and it makes me happy. Most important part of all, I got paid overtime. Extra money for me to spoil myself ha ha.    It isnt shopping time because I hate to shop. I hate waiting in long lines. I hate to look for stuff.  Nevertheless, once I do shop, please do not try to stop me from having a lil fun. I hate it when friends say, Lets go to the mall to check out guys. BULL SHIT, guys are trouble. Guys are heart breakers. No need for that. I am find being single. I love my freedom and therefore no one is gonna take that away from me. No one will and I mean it.    I came to work on Saturday. Worked from six am until one pm. Oh, did I mention that I was also drinking at work? Laugh it up. Yep, (Vodka and red bull).  I was pretty buzz by 11am.  What a very interesting way to start a day huh? There were only four of us in the office at that time and I figured it would be nice to try out something new. In addition, only Abby knew that I was drinking because she was drinking with me. It was so funny how once alcohol gets into my system I couldnt stop talking. Hahaha. Ya de ya de ya de ya de.    Some funny feelings I have experienced that day. It was so hot and all I wanted to do was dance. Gosh man, I knew I should not have drank so early. Oh dang, it was getting to me, and then all of a sudden I was seeing colors, I was buzz by that time and I couldnt stop singing.    Ive always been in love with you I guess youve always known its true Youve took my love for granted why oh why   How was I suppose to know which way the story go How was I to know youll break my heart   After work, had lunch with friends and chill at home then, I went out to play tennis and found some encyclopedia. That was awesome. Went out for dinner with a couple of friends at Pasta Pelican. Then shot pool. And called it a night.   Sunday, went out for lunch, look around for paintings, dresser draws, a fancy gold poster sized frame and play tennis. After all that, I went straight to bed. Out of nowhere surprisingly, a very good friend since Jr. High called and woke me up. Have not seen or chat with him in about a good long three or four years. Had a very nice charming conversation.  It was a very good impression to hear from an old friend occasionally.

      WHY MEN LIE  Joke of the Day  One day, while a woodcutter was cutting a branch of a tree above a River, his axe fell into the river. When he cried out, the Lord appeared and asked, "Why are you crying?"   The woodcutter replied that his axe has fallen into water, and he needed the axe to make his living.  The Lord went down into the water and reappeared with a golden axe.  "Is this your axe?" the Lord asked.  The woodcutter replied, "No."  The Lord again went down and came up with a silver axe. "Is this your Axe?" the Lord asked.  Again, the woodcutter replied, "No."  The Lord went down again and came up with an iron axe. "Is this your Axe?" the Lord asked.  The woodcutter replied, "Yes."  The Lord was pleased with the man's honesty and gave him all three Axes to keep, and the woodcutter went home happy.  Some time later, the woodcutter was walking with his wife along the Riverbank and his wife fell into the river. When he cried out, the Lord again appeared and asked him, "Why are you crying?"  "Oh Lord, my wife has fallen into the water!"  The Lord went down into the water and came up with Jennifer Lopez. "Is This wife?" the Lord asked.  "Yes," cried the woodcutter.  The Lord was furious. "You lied! That is an untruth!"  The woodcutter replied, "Oh, forgive me, my Lord. It is a Misunderstanding. You see, if I had said 'no' to Jennifer Lopez, you would have come up with Catherine Zeta-Jones. Then if I also said 'no' to her, You would have come up with my wife. Had I then said 'yes,' you would have given all three to me. Lord, I am a poor man, and I am not able to take care of all three wives, so THAT'S why I said 'yes' to Jennifer Lopez." _______________ The moral of this story is whenever a man lies, it is for a good and Honorable reason, and for the benefit of others.   Laugh it up ya.

      MY PHILOSHOPHY   Hard working is a leading key to the future.   Life is never balance so always be ready.   Facing a difficult situation as a learning experience.   Tireness is a combination of its own reward.  Dont get through the day, but from the day.   No one is perfect so always keep up a good self-esteem.  Money must earn but principle is above all.  Death is not horrible. The horrible thing is dying without your consciences.  Here`s a few reasons why GUYS like GIRLS:   1. They will always smell good even if its just shampoo.  2. The way their heads always find the right spot on our shoulder.  3. How cute they look when they sleep.  4. The ease in which they fit into our arms.   5. The way they kiss you and all of a sudden everything is right in the world.   6. How cute they are when they eat.  7. The way they take hours to get dressed but in the end makes it all worth while.   8. Because they are always warm even when its minus 30 out side.   9. The way they look good no matter what they wear.  10. The way they fish for compliments even though you both know that you think she`s the most beautiful thing on this earth.  11. How cute they are when they argue.  12. Theway her hand always finds yours.   13. The way they smile.   14. The way you feel when you see their name on the call ID after you just had a big fight.  15. The way she says "lets not fight anymore" even though you know that an hour later you will be arguing about something.  16. The way they kiss when you do something nice for them.  17. The way they kiss you when you say "I love you'.   18. Actually ... just the way they kiss you...   19. The way they fall into your arms when they cry.   20. Then the way they apologize for crying over something that silly.   21. The way they hit you and expect it to hurt.   22. Then the way they apologize when it does hurt.(even though we don`t admit it)!   23. The way they say "I miss you".  24. The way you miss them.   25. The way their tears make you want to  change the world so that it doesn`t hurt her anymore.  I've got a new favorite song in mind.  I'll always be there for you by Angelina  I never met a person quite like you, someone that makes me feel love. I wanna be the one that you are thinking of the on that brighten up your day.  Because there's nobody else that can do the things you do. Forever I'll be there for you. So if you feel that you need the love, let me be the on that you are thinking of. Because I will make it so rite.   I've got to tell you what I feel in my heart. I wrote this song just to say nobody's gonna love me nobody but you. Forever and ever I will always be there for you. I'm yours from this very day, I promise I'll always be true.

      Valentine's Day "1996"  Seven Years ago, I got into a relationship which never existed. On Valentine's Day, I was stood up by a cruel hearted guy name Michael Yu. Even tho it has been seven years, (Seven... fuckin... years), I am still hurt. Yep thats rite, I have this wound that could never heal unless he tells me his sorry for what he's done.   I was on my way home from work today, made a complete stop at a stop light and spotted Michael. At first I didnt recognized who he was, he called out my name and asked me where i was going. In a complete stunt look on my face, he said hed follow me. Stupidity, I didnt want him anywhere near but after seven years it kinda faded away.   Pulled over, weve hug, reminisce about the old dayz. What else is there to say you fuckin idiot. All I could think of at that moment was to bring up that subject "The Valentine's night", but I didnt say a word, I went with the flow, as how every body talks when seeing one another after a very long period of time.   He said that he heard a lot about me through one of my girlfriend. Thanks a lot Linda!!! We had a nice time talking even tho it was short. Back then, I see him as a lost boi who doesnt know what the hell he want in life. Now, hes this grown attractive man. Yet, a bad boi type, which isnt my type. I was being hit on but its not gonna work sonny.   He's got my number and I didnt really care because the number I gave him was my work number with no extension and without the extension, he'll never reach me. lol. Go ahead and call you bastard. Why am I blogging about this guy??? I dunno!!! Hes just that somebody that hurts me. I will be able to forgive him when he says "SORRY".  After three whole months of guessing whos that guy that has been stalking me, I finally know the answer. Yep, it was Michael all along. Vivian told me that it could have been fate. Haha a lil too late for that sweety.   This quote shall do tho...   "People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel."

      In Memory of 911  In memory of all those who perished this morning, the passengers and the pilots on the United Air and AA flights, the workers in the World Trade Center and the pentagon, and all the innocent bystanders. Our prayers go out to the friends and families of the deceased.   IF I KNEW   If I knew it would be the last time That I'd see you fall asleep, I would tuck you in more tightly and pray the Lord, your soul to keep.   If I knew it would be the last time that I see you walk out the door, I would give you a hug and kiss and call you back for one more.   If I knew it would be the last time I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise, I would video tape each action and word, so I could play them back day after day.   If I knew it would be the last time, I could spare an extra minute to stop and say "I love you," instead of assuming you would KNOW I do.   If I knew it would be the last time I would be there to share your day, Well I'm sure you'll have so many more, so I can let just this one slip away.   For surely there's always tomorrow to make up for an oversight, and we always get a second chance to make everything just right.   There will always be another day to say "I love you," And certainly there's another chance to say our "Anything I can do?"   But just in case I might be wrong, and today is all I get, I'd like to say how much I love you and I hope we never forget.   Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, young or old alike, And today may be the last chance you get to hold your loved one tight.   So if you're waiting for tomorrow, why not do it today? For if tomorrow never comes,  you'll surely regret the day.  That you didn't take that extra time for a smile, a hug, or a kiss and you were too busy to grant someone, what turned out to be their one last wish.   So hold your loved ones close today, and whisper in their ear, Tell them how much you love them and that you'll always hold them dear.   Take time to say "I'm sorry," "Please forgive me," "Thank you," or "It's okay." And if tomorrow never comes, you'll have no regrets about today.  REST IN PIECE

      Sometimes...  Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there, to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson, or to help you figure out who you are or who you want to become.  You never know who these people may be (possibly your roommate, neighbor, professor, long lost friend, lover, or even a complete stranger), but when you lock eyes with them, you know at that very moment they will affect your life in some profound way.  And sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair at first, but in reflection you find that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, willpower or heart.  Everything happens for a reason.  Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness, and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul.  Without these small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless.  The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience, help to create who you are and who you become. Even the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones.  If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart.  If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things.  Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again.  Talk to people that you have never talked to before, and actually listen. Let yourself fall in love, break free, and set your sights high. Hold your head up because you have every right to.  Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don't believe in yourself, it will be hard for others to believe in you.  You can make of your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it with absolutely no regrets.  Most importantly, if you love someone tell them, for you never know what tomorrow may have in store. And learn a lesson in life each day you live! Today is the tomorrow you were worried about yesterday.  Was it worth it?

      Doggy Style  Has anyone ever seen dogs do it? First thing that comes to mind is the Doggy Style rite?  Wrong!!! I went home for lunch today and spotted two dogs BUTT to BUTT. Is it possible that they are actually having sex? They were just there in one spot all clobber to each other. I swore I peek but not eye locked on them. I told the dogs to get a room or at least find a bush. As the neighbors started to laugh at me, I eventually covered my eyes and walked away.    There isnt any ways that I can separate them while they are going at it huh? Theyll probably attack my ass for trying to stopping them. That is such a shame. Bad dogs. Bad bad bad dogs.   Seeing dogs on the street makes me feel sad and vulnerable to feed them. I too feed one of them with left over food and stuff. However, to see that it became the neighbor slut gets me disappointed.    Come to my conclusion, really is that how dogs have sex? Is that how they get intimate? Can somebody smack me in the back of my head and tell me to get over this. I should stop feeding that damn dog. Its not suppose to become a slut. I should neuter that poor dog. God Damn Dog.

      Personal Moments  This journal is all about my personal moments that I shared with all of you. I dunno if I can let it dread away without getting hurt or will it effect me sooner or later. I thought about you. I thought about the times we spent together. Even tho it was a very short amount of time but I too still think of you.   I thought about "TUESDAY". I decided the night before. How can I not? Me and you. Enjoying sweet charming conversations over delicious food. We've blushed before, but I never really took you seriously. It's always harder on me, I'm always hurt after we meet. You??? You just go on. You go on as if nothing happened, as if I was never there.   I finally realized it now. I gave you my all and you didnt appreciate it. I turn and walked away. They say, never look back because it will only hurt you more. I'm a lil hurt, but not as much as before. No, not nearly as much. I'm going to move on into bigger and better things. I'M SO OVER YOU.

      Love Is Not Loving At All  When life takes a toll on you , you won't feel like doing anything except slack the day away.  More and more you're all I'm thinking of. Once again I'm sitting all alone, hoping one day you will come to me. I can see you in my mind. Its been a while since i felt this way. Emotions when I think of you.   Here in the night like an angel while i'm sleeping, I feel your arms around me but sadly I'm just dreaming. I star into the darkness and hope to find you waiting, but I know that its useless, I'm just hallucinating. Tell me why cant I stop thinking of you.   What I wrote were only songs that reminds me of someone that has been on my mind for zzzzzdayzzzzz. I'll let you know more when I know for sure what is going on.  Cang Hai Mang Mang sent me this poem which fits perfectly into my situation tonight.  Thanks Cang!!!   I Don't Know You Anymore  I would like to visit you for a while, get away and out of this city, maybe I shouldn't have called, but someone had to be the first to break... We can go sit on your back porch, relax, talk about anything... It don't matter!!! I'll be courageous if you can pretend that you've forgiven me... Because I don't know you anymore... I don't recognize this place, the picture frames have changed and so has your name... We don't talk much anymore, we keep running from the pain but what I wouldn't give to see your face again...  Lost without your love  Lost and all alone, I always thought that I could make it on my own... Since you left I hardly make it through the day... My tears get in the way... And I need you back to stay...  I wander through the night... And search the world to find the words to make it right... All I want is just the way it used to be... With you here close to me, I've got to make you see.  That I'm lost without your love... Life without you isn't worth the trouble of I'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel... A touch without a feel I can't believe it's real... And someday soon I'll wake. And find my heart won't have to break...  Yes I'm lost without your love...Life without you isn't worth the trouble of...All I want is just the way it used to be I need you here with me...Oh darlin' can't you see...If we had love before...We can have it back once more...

      When I Move You Move  I went to a hip-hop class last night with a bunch of friends. Of course, my class was at 24-hours fitness. It was so weird to see men with nothing but tight tights on. My friends actually liked it. Hey, I wasnt there to check anybodys out. I was just there to kill time, to enjoy myself and hang out with friends. Not to lie but there were a peek here and there but that was it.   I was surround by much much older people who obviously never heard of any of the songs being play before. Such as, I got five on it, in da club, baby boi, etc. Its amazing to see how many people cannot move for shit. Im not trying to say that Im any good but it was one hell of a laugh when you are dancing soberly. Of course, everyone got his or her own lil sass, twist, or spunk to the beat.   I think that dancing is something that you were born with. Something that you actually like doing naturally. I was able to pick up the moves just like that and throw some of my own moves in and got some extra credit by the instructor. I was honor and I was turning red at the moment but hey I had a great time. Did I mention that dancing is a part of me? I love it no matter what type of dancing it is. I think that dancing is a gift, why not use it rite. I wont let that go to waste. I will enjoy it every grips I get.    I enjoy dancing and music. At the clubs, what really annoys me most is when Im on the dance floor trying to dance alone or with a bunch of friends in circles. Dudes from nowhere started dancing around me trying to get attention. WTF. If you are trying to pick me up, just talk to me let me judge your knowledge.

      Dedications From "Harvey Huang"  You probably already have your mind and heart set on something. Something I don't know about or something that nothing has nothing to do with me. I know once you set your mind and heart on something there's nothing that would change it. I respect that. I'm sure most guys do too. That's a really good thing, it means you're a strong person (Guys like that).  I'm really lucky to have you love for this long. I know I haven't been a very good or perfect boyfriend through out and all along. I fucked up in many different ways. It's too late for me to make that up. I can't just win your feeling and heart back. I'm probably consider as a pass to you huh? You do deserve so much more then me.   I know what you mean when you say that "you wanted more in life". This is what I was thinking about this morning. I figured it'll be easier for me to express myself to you in writing than talking to you face to face. I know you'll get very annoyed by me. So I don't wanna see you all sad and stuff. I'm gonna end it here. Love you and miss you.   There are so much things I have planned out to do with you. Getting married, having kids, little Sakdary and Little Harvey running around. Starting our family with, travel, enjoy the rest of my life with you, etc. There's nothing more I would rather do than that with YOU. I just wanna spend the rest of my life being with the one who I really love and care for. You know that I am afraid that I wouldnt have the chance and time to do that with you.   I'm sure that's what everyone wants in life. Wanting and having are two totally different things. Its nice to want things but it's not so nice not having it. Just like how I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Things tends to happen for a reason and there's nothing I can do to change it. I think I'm just being really selfish.  I'm willing to do whatever to keep you by my side. At the same time I feel you want to be doing other things. I'm keeping you from doing what you wanted to do in life. Keeping you from making friends. Its like I'm trying to lock you down with me, even tho you're not happy. Making you do things you don't wanna do. I'm keeping you away from all your dreams and goals in life.  This pass week has been the most wonderful week. It meant alot to me more than anything. Just seeing you happy. Seeing you smile!!! My heart lights up from that. It means so much to me just to see you happy on the outside. Inside I wouldnt know unless you open your heart and tell me.   I my self Sakdary, never thought that there would be another who would love me as much as Harvey does. It really means alot but what is love? Nothing last forever rite. I do believed that things happen for a reason. We've just got to find ourselves and ask our heart what is it that we want most in life. This is a total concept experience that every human being goes through.   I finally figured an answer to this situation and I tend to keep it that way. Feelings are only good when it's there. Cherish every moment when being together. have a great time and smile more often. Enjoy life as it comes because nothing last forever. I take anything that life has to offer and go with the flow. Life is too short to compormised anything if you would make plans for.   I do believe in having a future but like I said "I'll take it as it comes. Nothing last forever". My greatest fear of all is falling in LOVE. I am so afraid to get hurt by anyone. Life doesnt have too much great expectations. I live day by day for happiness and glad that i am still alive. I've got two favorite quote that I live up to.   "Don't cry because it's over! Smile because it happened".  "If life gives you a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it."

      WAYS TO TURN MEN DOWN   HE: Can I buy you a drink?  SHE: Actually I'd rather have the money.   HE: I'm a photographer. I've been looking for a face like yours.  SHE: I'm a plastic surgeon. I've been looking for a face like yours.   HE: Hi. Didn't we go on a date once? Or was it twice?  SHE: Must've been once. I never make the same mistake twice.   HE: How did you get to be so beautiful?  SHE: I must've been given your share.   HE: Will you go out with me this Saturday? SHE: Sorry. I'm having a headache this weekend.

      Blast From The Past   Day after day I'm more confused. My life is changing everyday. As possible as it is, I never felt like this before. Now I'm feeling it.  Again I begun to think that I'm wasting time. Many days I dunno what to do. I don't understand the things I do. The world is so unkind to me. I've decided to let you go. Another great guy has left my life for good. I broke his heart and I felt bad. But its only fair that I let him go. Thanks for the joy you've given me. GOOD BYE MICHAEL YU.  "Until I Get Over You"   Woke up today thinking of you, Another night that I made my way through So many dreams still left in my mind, But they can never come true, I press rewind and remember when, I close my eyes and I`m with you again. But in the end I can still feel the pain, every time I hear your name   [Chorus]  The sun won`t shine since you went away. Seems like the rain`s falling every day. There`s just one heart, where there once was two. But that`s the way it`s gotta be, `til I get over you   [Verse 2]  Walked through the park, in the evening air. I heard a voice and I thought you were there. I run away but I just can`t escape. Memories of you everywhere. They say that time will dry the tears. But true love burns for a thousand years. Give my tomorrows for one yesterday. Just to know that I could have you here   [Bridge]  When will this river of tears stop fallin`. Where can I run so I won`t feel alone. Can`t walk away when the pain keeps callin`. I`ve just gotta take it from here on my own. But it`s so hard to let go.   Life is best when you realize the moment that you`re in and cherish it forever. I think the greatest thing is having a dream and then reaching it. Through out my whole life, I realize that sometimes you have to work extra hard to get there, and once you are there..enjoy it!

      Look on the Bright Side!  Living on Earth is expensive, but it does include a free trip around the sun every year.  How long a minute is depends on what side of the bathroom door you're on.  Birthdays are good for you; the more you have, the longer you live.  Happiness comes through doors you didn't even know you left open.  Ever notice that the people who are late are often much jollier than the people who have to wait for them?  Most of us go to our grave with our music still inside of us.  If Walmart is lowering prices every day, how come nothing is free yet?  You may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person.  Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.  Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened.  We could learn a lot from crayons: some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, some have weird names, and all are different colors....but they all exist very nicely in the same box.  A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour.  Have an awesome day, and know that someone who thinks you're great has thought about you today!..

      One Min Sassy, One Min Emotional  When people put you down, you intend to believe it. When people say things they dont mean, it makes you hurt straight to the heart. Sometime I ask myself, "Why doesnt the world understand me?".  Most of the time I would tell myself, "Never listen if I choose not to. Never care for what people say. Just live my life to the fullest".   I am known for being a party girl. I party just to have fun and not worry about anything. One thing I dont do is Sleeping around unless I have feelings for that person. But that doesnt happen very often, I'm just too picky with who I sleep with. (Hey, there is nothing wrong with that!!!).   I love being stress free and I truly love my freedom. I've grown into a young blossom whom I dont think anyone can have. At the same time I feel lost, full of loneliness and I often get emotional from time to time. I'm getting sick and tired of being alone!!!  I want someone to comfort me with an open arm and who would make me smiles at all time. Dont you understand??? I want a man who can be a real man, not a mama's lil boy.

      Hakuna Matata  It means no worries for the rest of your days.  I know I know!!! I've been very busy in the past previous month. I never had any spare time to face reality for my own personal uses. A couple of friends have complained about me not posting anything up for them to read. My bad my bad. I didnt know that my words are that meaningful to some people. But hey, guess what I'm back for good WA LA and I've got plenty of things to blah blah blah about.   A month ago, I file for child support.  Yep!!! I took the courage and do what I had to do. A couple of days ago, I received a phone call from an attorney from the child support services department. To tell you the truth I am very scared. I am just concern about what would happen to Alyssia? Will I get money every month? Do I have to face him in court? Would Alyssia be under my care or his?   I held back and hold on strong. Again and again I would tell myself to take a deep breath and keep my mind strong. I cant lose and I wont give up. I cant keep running from everything all the time. Sooner or later, its gonna hit me in the face when I turn a corner in life. I have to face him and I am going to make sure he knows that since he took a part in creating the baby, he's gonna take a part in supporting her.   I know that I am so scared of losing Alyssia but I'm pretty sure that there wont be any problem with the court deciding in my favor, or if he has a delinquent in his child support payments. It all comes down to whats best for Alyssia and me.   I wonder if I can amend her last name as well.

For those of you who remembered my birthday, thank you all, you guys are the best and there is no other way that I can say thank you but to kiss you on both cheeks and give you lots of hugs.

      Ease My Pain  I heard from a friend yesterday and she said that you were in town. And suddenly the memories came into my mind. Seeing you was the hardest thing ever. You're handsome as ever. You're still the sweeties guy I've ever known. You were a lover with the sweeties touch, with a slow hand and an easy touch. But that was five years ago.   Reuniting and a nite of singing our ass off at a karaoke bar was amazing, but you know what no matter how hard you try you'll never win me back into that old position. I'll never fall for you ever again nor will I ever date you as a boyfriend again.   So what if you sang "All I Have To Give". It eventually brought back alots of memories since high school but that doesnt mean anything to me anymore. I've moved on and you know I did. So quit trying to play games with my heart and quit trying to win me head over heels.   Many many years ago I would say, I've alwyas been in love with you, I guess you've always known its true. You took my love for granted why? Its only fair that we say good bye. So good bye Josh.

      Bastard  If its not for you, I've always knew what I had to do. Everything is gonna be alrite is what I would always tell myself. I play my part to be a perfect girlfriend to you but you fucked up big time. All you wanted to do was to keep me in a lock down. I cant change you and you'll never change.   Why the fuck do you care so much where I am at, who I am with, what I am doing? Its none of your business for all that I care is my freedom. Between you and me, its sooo over, its history. You know that the past will always remain the past. Nothing can be changed. Over and over I let you lead the way, but you've lost me because of your insecure and you're too over protected love.  Instead you try to control my life. That isn't how I appreciate how I want to be treated.   Whats yours was once mines, whats mines was once yours, but those days are over. I'm grown now, I don't need you.  I hate you more than anything in the world. Why do you still want to play little kids games? Why cant you see that I don't need you anymore. I'm doing better on my own, no need for your shoulders to cry on. I don't wanna shine when you shine; I've got my own path to walk now. Don't ever think that I will forget what you did to me. I was hurt and I shall remember my wound. Just fucken leave and never come back to me.   I rather walk away then be with a person like you. I don't want to bring tears to my eyes anymore. Never again that I will shed my tears for you. Never again will I talk about you. Never again will I say your name. Leaving you was what I needed to do to be okay. I made that move years ago. I don't need you next to me anymore. Don't talk about future plans with me, don't call me, dont come back to me with a fat diamond ring. Its not worth it, youre just wasting your time. Just leave me alone. Go to hell for god's saint.

      Southern California  Here I am working in Riverside, Ive been here since Monday, thank god Im leaving tonight and I am so anxious to go home. Its nice and all but I am home sick. I miss my bed, I miss moms cooking, and most of all I miss Alyssia. That cute smile of hers and the way she talks to me and how she kisses me good night.   I was sent here in the first place because my office was the first to learn the new program TRIP. Therefore, I have to train the entire policies typist here on the new system and Ive got to say that some people are just DUMB ASSES. I may seem like the type of person who have a lot of patience but I dont. Damn every time I have to train someone new I felt like a bomb thats so ready to blow.    I dont understand why people wont take notes. If ya take notes youll pick up alil faster. And maybe ya wouldnt have to ask me questions every fucken minute. Didnt any of these people learn anything in school? Ive got seven people, all ages here that I have to train and they are in their early twentys, and mid thirtys. WTF??? I have a few favorites but the rest are just SLOW.  It cant be my fault if they still dont understand, I did what I could to train these people. Ive got to say that the supervisor in this department is horrorable!!! She is an offal supervisor who is so unorganized. She doesnt know what the fuck shes doing. Many things that I know, she did not know. Whats up with that??? I have to make a complaint.  Well, Im outta here thats the best that I can do I put out all the effort and the courtesy that I had, if anything goes wrong after that, its isnt my fault. Im outta here. I get to go home now YEAH BABY.

      Thats Disgusting  Could you imagine what people do these days??? I was just in the restroom at work doing the number one of course, when a person walked out of her stall and walked rite out the restroom door without washing the fucken hands. Thats disgusting dammit. I try to peek under the stall to see who it was but I was too slow. It just grosses me out!!!  Can someone tell me WHO, who nowadays uses their hand to flush the toilet in public? Have I ever? Heck no!!! I use my foot. Do you know how dirty your hands get after using the toilet? Germs germs germs germs.   Its amazing what people do these days. Not me tho I love to wash my hands. I wash my hands at least ten times a day or even more. I love warm water running through my fingers. I love to squeeze the right amount of soup on my hands and just rub them together, in betweens fingers, clean out my finger nails, gosh I just love the rubbing part.  I realized that I also use a paper towel to open the damn door. Youll never know where peoples hands been.   For those who doesnt wash your hands after using the potty THATS DISGUSTING!!!!

      Good Tips for Women  Hey ladies, please take the time to read this. I know you guys are smart enough to know these pointers, but there will be some where you will say to yourself "Hmm, I must remember that!" Trust me!!! After reading, pass it on to someone you care about, it will never hurts to be careful in this crazy world we live in.   1. Tip from Tae Kwon Do: The elbow is the strongest point on your body. If you are close enough to use it, do!   2. Learned this from a tourist guide to New Orleans: if a robber asks for your wallet and/or purse, DO NOT HAND IT TO HIM. Toss it away from you.... chances are that he is more interested in your wallet and/or purse than you and he will go for the wallet/purse. RUN LIKE MAD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION!   3. If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car: Kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy. The driver won't see you but everybody else will. This has saved lives.   4. Women have a tendency to get into their cars after shopping, eating, working, etc., and just sit (doing their checkbook, or making a list, etc. DON'T DO THIS! The predator will be watching you, and this is the perfect opportunity for him to get in on the passenger side, put a gun to your head, and tell you where to go. AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR, LOCK THE DOORS AND LEAVE.   5. A few notes about getting into your car in a parking lot, or parking garage:   A.) Be aware: look around you, look into your car, at the passenger side floor, and in the back seat.    B.) If you are parked next to a big van, enter your car from the passenger door. Most serial kill! ers attack their victims by pulling them into their vans while the women are attempting to get into their cars.    C.) Look at the car parked on the driver's side of your vehicle, and the passenger side. If a male is sitting alone in the seat nearest your car, you may want to walk back into the mall, or work, and get a guard/policeman to walk you back out. IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. (And better paranoid than dead.)   6. ALWAYS take the elevator instead of the stairs.(Stairwells are horrible places to be alone and the perfect crime spot).    7. If the predator has a gun and you are not under his control, ALWAYS RUN! The predator will o! nly hit you (a running target) 4 in 100 times; And even then, it most likely WILL NOT be a vital organ. RUN!    8. As women, we are always trying to be sympathetic: STOP IT! It may get you raped, or killed. Ted Bundy, the serial killer, was a good-looking, well educated man,who ALWAYS played on the sympathies of unsuspecting women. He walked with a cane, or a limp, and often asked "for help" into his vehicle or with his vehicle, which is when he abducted his next victim. Another Safety Point : Crying Baby Someone just told me that her friend heard a crying baby on her porch the night before last, and she called the police because it was late and she thought it was weird.The police told her "Whatever you do, DO NOT open the door." The lady then said that it sounded like the baby had crawled near a window, and she was worried that it would crawl to the street and get run over. The policeman said, "We already have a unit on the way, whatever you do, DO NOT open the door." He told her that they think a serial killer has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax women out of their homes thinking that someone dropped off a baby. He said they have not verified it, but have had several calls by women saying that they hear baby's cries outside their doors when they're home alone at night.

      What Can I Say..   Shes single, shes young, shes smart, and shes independent who loves animation movies. Tho she can be a lil hard headed and stubborn sometimes but shes still my little girl. ALYSSIA!!! A very bright little three year old whos smart and vulnerable. Shes cute and lovely and brilliant and very active. Shes into learning new things, books, making friends, boys, etc.    My three year old loves to get on the computer just to play with Elmo on sesame streets. She could sing her ABCs, count from 1-15 and also count 1-9 in Chinese. Wow, my little girl knows all that huh. What can I say, shes a natural, and shes good like that.    She has just recently started preschool. Not just a regular ordinary day care but a real school. She gets breakfast and lunch, (and you sure know how good cafeteria food was, yum yum I could smell it already). She also gets computer game lessons and act in plays. Thats great huh?    On her first day of school, she was scared of the new environment just like anybody would. She was shy and did not want to see me leave, it was sad to see her in tears and it surely broke my heart. Hey. A mom gotta do what she got to do rite.    At the end of the day when it was time to pick her up from school, the teachers told me that Alyssia got into a fight with a little boy. They fought over toys. I slowly picture the scene in my mind and the first thing that I so wanted to ask was WHO WON? Silly of me huh? Its so irritating that she got into a fight on her first day of school. Bad Alyssia bad bad bad. The other kid wasnt hurt or anything but his mom came and apologized for the inconvenience.     To make my story short, shes a strong little girl and I love her more than anything in the world. Im proud of her for being her because it slows me that she knows what she wan and will be very independent in life. Just like mommy yep yep yep.

      One Fucken Sad Blog  Three years ago after I gave birth six months later I started working. I worked so hard for what? for a car and for money to hold in the palm of my hands. after 8 months of working like crazy, I bought myself a brand new car. after having it for three nights, my mother whom i do call mom asked me if she could borrow the car to Cash Creek with her friends. I refused. we got into a big ass fight that night.   I remember exactly what she have said to me that night. "If you dont let me take your car out tonight, your not my daughter. pack up all your belongings and get the hell out of my site. Dont ever come back her and show your face at my door step ever again. dont call me mom."  I was hurt and i was devastated ... at the age of 21, I didn't know where to go. Why is she CO cruel. she never loved me like how she loved teeda and Tony. I've never talked back to her in any conditions. I gave her money whenever she asked. I'm so sure of myself that I was a very good daughter to her. but why was she treating me that way?   I never spoke of her or have i dear to step into her house. no matter how anyone treated me Istand strong. I cried a whole week. a few friends helped me out at the time. thank god for them. four months later, my mother called me to return home. now do you see how cruel and wicked she is? Just when I can actually let go, she pulled me back.   Today, three years later, that same routine return. I've got her message this morning which she left me a voice mail a couple of nights ago. the same shit with dont call me mom ever again. this is the second time you've done this to me. you're not my daughter, i found you in the trash can, i hate you. dont even bring your daughter to my house for me to baby sit ever again. dont ever step up to my house.   For those of you who came from a wealthy family dont know how much this really hurts. I've been crying for the past couple of hours. my eyes are swollen red. I dont feel like leaving the house to go anywhere. I'm so upset. how come life have to be so harsh on me like this?   My biological father left me when I was a couple of months old, my mother treat me like I'm not a daughter to her. What??? Am I an unlucky daughter which nobody wants or what? I have no one rite now. What can Alyssia do for me? NOTHING. she doesn't even know a thing. It seem like at this moment I'm all alone in this world. with no one to cheer me up. I feel so small.

      I Dont Get It!!!  Am I the only one who is blind? Is love blind? Is it because I have never fallen in love which never made me see that love is blind? Did YOU know that others know what I did not know that love is blind? An old friend has just recently gotten in touch with me after two years of her disappearance. Today I want to blog about her!    She told me that shes with a guy who treats her kinda fucked up, I would say as a living hell, whose three years younger then she is, who has a donut shop which she is working for but doesnt get pay. Shes broke and its no joke. She has asked me to help her find a job. That she is very bored and wanted to go out with me sometimes. She also wanted to reach old friends from high school, she wanted to call and say hi.   Ive got in contact with several agencies, trying to help this girl get a job of her dream. The entire agency asked for was for her to come in and take a test and turn in her updated resume. Thats basically it!!! I really dont know whats who with her, shes just so lazy in doing her part. I did my part and thats all I really can do for her. It isnt my fault.   Ive got connect to everyone whom she wished to speak with. Now her so so called boyfriend thinks Im just trying to break them up. He thinks that I am trying to find a new boyfriend for her. And that I am a very bad influence for her. We cant go out clubbin just as we plan this weekend because of his ignorance selfish dumb ass self.  He wishes for her never to conversant with me ever again.    I think hes abuses her when ever she talked back to his face. She once told me that and that hes always doing her wrong. She also mention to me that he would always pushes her out of his way numerous of time. Why is she living in hell with him? Why doesnt she see that his just messing her life up? Why does she let him do so much harms to her? Why is she still with him?  She is now living with him, with his family in one house. His parents dont even like her because shes only got a high school diploma. They look down at her so low because she is living with them. You all know that Cambodian families are very strict once it comes to this.  Why does she do this to herself? Why? Why allow others to look down at you? Why allow others to treat you like trash? Why be at a place where there is no happiness? I dont get it!!!  I dont get it!!! Im not so strong myself but I did what I could to survive. Ill do what ever it takes to get myself in a better position, a better relevant, and a better stage. I think about my future more than I ever did. If I find myself not happy, I move on and look for more that god has to offer. I just wish Phira is okay without my guide. I did what I could to help. I just hope that one day she would open her eyes and see what god has to offer her. I just wish that she, one day will be happy for what she have. All that I am wishing for is for her to be happy but not the life she is living rite now. I want her to have a better life with a better future. I want her to know that I am always here for her.

      Tell Me About It  Everyone kept asking me, When are you going to make a move on Ben? Whats going on with you and Ben? Upon my reaction, I turn away and laugh. Not to be mean or obnoxious but I dont want to. I rather be friends and remain as friends until he decided we cant be friends anymore. I dont want to break the rules of us being friends. I dont want to part from anyone because that breaks my heart.   He has just recently called me just to see if my injury had gone away. That was sweet of him. He also asked me out to have dinner with him. His excuse was Chinese New Year and that he doesnt have anyone to have dinner with. Oh please, that is so lame, its not gonna work on me. I still want him by my side, just to make me smile.   I used to date Harvey and Harvey is Bens friend, I cant do it. Especially when Harvey was my ex. Even tho Harvey is cool about it and all but nah Ill pass. I rather start a commitment with a total stranger. Someone brand new who doesnt know a thing about me. Ill just wait, it doesnt matter how long, Ill just wait.   Everyone knows that I have been single for the last 18 months. Wow! Thats a very long time for a gal like me. I love it and Im happy this way. I dont want to have anyone telling what to do, or who to hang out with, or you cant do this, you cant buy that. Thats just not me, I cant picture myself in that situation.

      In Pain, In Pain, In Pain   A road trip to Lake Tahoe, Woo Hoo how exciting. Four people in my ride and five in the other ride. Four hours of bullshitting, smooth conversation, smart talk, and dirty talk, messing around, you name it. Once we reach south Tahoe, everything that surrounded us was so beautiful, it was lovely, it was nice. Sitting in the car with three guys makes a big different. I was like this little kid who have never seen snow before. I was like look look look over there, look over here, down there, up there, look at that other side, look at the mountains, look at the lake. WOW. I was just so excited.    Once we got to the hotel, unpacked, rested, then off we went straight to the buffet at Harrahs. The wait was an hour and forty five minutes. We bounce; end up at a different restaurant similar to apple bees. I had a big dinner, and I found myself playing with my food like always. After dinner everyone did a little of gambling, I stood around because I didnt feel lucky at all. Once we got back to the hotel, a few friends had gone out to the spa. I could have gone but I didnt have any swim suit to wear.  It was freezing outside; it was probably 20 - 30 or so. I couldnt stand the cold so I went to bed.    Ive got to say that sleeping at an unknown place really freaked me out. I kept on tossing and turning. The pillow was way too flat and it hurts my neck. I found myself waking up every hour. I look towards the glowing digits on the clock, 4:47 am!!! I thought I was the only one that was awake so I started to sing to myself.  I heard a voice cracking up with my singing skills. It was Ben!!! So we stood there talking about so many things that I dont even remembered. Twenty minutes later everyone in the room was up. We watched cartoons til 7:30 am. Shower, put on our snow pants, snow jackets, load four boards into the car, got everything and everyone and off we went to mickey ds.    Nine in the morning, we head out to heavenly resort. At last we come to it, breathing in fresh morning icy cold crispy thin air. At last, yes, its time to gear up, got our boards check, my camera check, my beanie check, my gloves check, my Chap Stick check, my glasses check, everyone was ready check, got our lift ticket check. We were all good to go; off we went onto the ski lift. I sat with Ben, we were so calm, and it was so peaceful then off the lift we went. The landing was smooth, everyone finishes strapping in and double check all their bindings and off we went.    While taking off we were all going so fast, Harvey pulled onto me and I pulled onto Ben. I fell on my tail bone that exploded to my stomach area then I felt the pain heading up to my back spine. I couldnt move even if I tried to. All I could say was Help, help me out of peoples way, I cant move, pull me to the side. I sounded like an old lady who was helpless. I was in pain. I felt like crying. I didnt know what to do but just go with the flow. Everyone pulled me to the side hoping that I was okay. I could barely walk; I had to lie in the snow for a while. At this point I was still up on the hills, feeling pretty dizzy. I was about a mile away from the lift.    An hour went by, everyones having fun, I see them fall, scrub, having a great time and me, Im still in pain but at least I could sit up. The second hour, I could move, I made a snow angel and I also made three snowmen but I was still in pain. The third hour I got up and stretch, the pain kinda fade away and I can walk. Friends gather around me making sure I can get down the hill without hurting myself even more. Had lunch and off we went on the ski lifts again.    I didnt want to give up even tho I was in a great pain. This time it was different, I had Ben holding on to me making sure I wont fall. He was taking care of me and I must say that hes done a very great job. I fell many many times and of course I drag Ben alone with me. I fell on top of him; he fell on top of me. Weve almost kissed a few times, just by looking at each other made both of us crack up even harder.  It was fun, really fun, hella fun. One great moment. At the end I fell again, this time I land on my tail bone once more. I gave up for the day, I was in pain again and couldnt go on anymore.    Afterwards Ben brought me down the hill, he sat with me for awhile until he was sure that I will be okay. The last word he said to me before he goes was, Hang in there, Ill be back for you.  Up the lift, down the hill, up the lift, off the lift and down the hill again. Waiting for another hour wasnt so bad. The day was over and back to the car, back to the hotel room, rested for an hour and got ready for dinner.    All of a sudden I realized that Ben must have had a thing for me. Since when? I didnt realized it but he kept making eye contact with me. Always asked me if I was okay. Making eye contact with Ben was a different feeling from making eye contact with anyone else. Suddenly I felt the comfort of Ben, helding me in the snow, twirling around, flirting, and speaking our minds. After knowing Ben for over five years I have never had this kinda feeling before. We both have a lot in common, were good friends. This is actually the very first time I felt like this for him. Whats going on?????      Anyways we had dinner at Harrahs, this time no waiting in line. We went rite through and ate rite away. Every one of us was so exhausting. I, was still in pain, limping, I needed a cane for when I walk.  After dinner we went straight to the casino. I went straight to the slots. Wheels of Fortune, I spent twenty bucks and only twenty bucks for over three hours. I was winning big but I got so greedy and end up loosing one hundred bucks after five hours.    That night, I slept at the edge of the bed, thinking. Why am I feeling like this towards Ben? He was on the next bed with David facing me. I was on the opposite bed from his with two other friend facing him. Other friends were across the room from us. Again I was tossing and turning. Ben was doing the same thing. I try to ignore him and went to sleep and not think about anything. Every time I was awake I would sing or humm to myself and his always responding back. David was snoring so loud that Ben couldnt stand it anymore. Ben got up and recorded Davids snoring. When he plays back the recording, it sounded like David was moaning. We were all hella making fun of him, laughing and joking about it.     Waking myself up from a dream that I hope it isnt going to come true. In that dream I saw Ben staring at me constantly. Six in the morning, I was up, trying so hard to go back to sleep but I couldnt. Again I humm and Ben responded. I turn and he was lying there staring at me. God, this is creeping me out. I was nervous, I didnt say anything. We got up and got ready for a new day. We all got ready for breakfast.    The same thing reputably happened, Ben staring at me!!! I dunno what it is that makes me felt this way towards Ben but it seems like he couldnt take his eyes off me for some apparently reason. I really cant explain what I am feeling inside but Im trying to avoid this feeling. Everytime we talked we were on the same page, songs, life experiences, deep thoughts, etc. There was a moment after breakfast when everyone had to take a dump. I left with the girls to the second floor hoping that no one will find us. Once I was done and walked outside to the waiting area, there was Ben. Everywhere I went Ben was there. Whats sup with this. The harder I try to avoid him the more I see him.   Waking up after two hours during a car ride, Ben looked at me through the view mirror. I was paranoid. Stop and got gas and had lunch at popeyes, the same thing with the eye contact. Got home unpacked, shower and went to bed, thought of Ben. Went to sleep dreamt of Ben. Woke up thought of how Ben looked at me. Got coffee this morning someone had called out Bens name. Got to work, many lenders who is looking for their policy with the name Ben. Everywhere I go I have to hear Ben. This is really freaking me out of my mind.    I dunno who to tell or who to talk to but to write and write and write and post this shit onto my blog. Hoping that someone will give me some advice soon. I just hope that I can exclude myself out of this feeling. To me Ben is just a very good friend that I can really count on. Although I must admit that I did flirt with him in some kinda way. I spoke my mind when I am around him because he doesnt take anything seriously. But please tell me why am I feeling this way? Can I stop thinking of him anytime soon? Will he leave my mind and my dreams?

      Book Report  Schools back and I have to do a book report which is due in two weeks. Not that I am complaining but damn I have to find something that is base on a true story and plus I have to get in contact with the author. Amazingly, Ive got a few replies back and I think I found the rite one. This is just a friendly reply from D. Dexter Vizinau, a very handsome man, in his mid 50s.   My new novel "Shine On Me'" is the story of a blind African American woman trying to raise two boys on her own in San Francisco during the 50's and 60's.  She was a Gospel Singer/Musician and sang and played the piano to support her family.  This is a story about faith!  Shine On Me is the story of my mother.  I was the oldest of the two sons and basically had to be my mother's eyes.  This book is full or emotion, drama, passion, suspense, humor, religion and sin.  Margaret Vizinau had four strikes against while living in San Francisco.  She was a woman in a man's world, she was a single parent, she was Negro, and she was born blind.  Shine On Me is for adult reading and contains strong language.  I will have a limited number of first edition (officially unedited) copies for sale this Saturday Night.  They will be on sale during our Holiday vendor party at Kimball's Carnival, and at Phillip Bell's Annual Holiday Party at the Oakland Downtown Marriott.  I will be signing books at Kimball's from 9:00pm until 12:30am, and I will be signing books at Phillip Bell's Party from 1:00am until closing.  I hope to see you Saturday night.  Below is a copy of the Prologue which is at the beginning of the book.  Thank you, D. Dexter Vizinau Author  Prologue      It is a rainy Saturday in the Fillmore district of San Francisco.  The year is 1959 and it's just before Christmas.  Eight-year old Dexter is looking out of their front window watching the rain drops fall and keeping an eye on the cars as they travel up and down the busy streets.  He is nervous and has a sinking feeling in his stomach.  There is a chill over him that's causing him to shake even though it's warm inside the house.  His younger brother, Hank, is in their bedroom playing with toys on the floor.     Margaret is adding the final touches to her makeup, applying a little face powder to her cheeks and some lipstick to her puffy lips.  Dexter approaches the dresser and watches his mother make herself up in the mirror.  He is used to seeing her look at herself in the mirror even though she is blind and cannot see.     It's not easy being a female like Margaret in the big city of San Francisco in the fifties; she has four strikes against her that makes it especially difficult.  One, she is a woman in a man's world.  Two, she is a Negro woman.  Three, she is a single parent with two small boys.  And four, she's been blind since birth.     When Margaret appears to be finished with her makeup Dexter asks, "Baba, why can't I go with you"?  She cuts him short with a stern "NO, you can't go and stop asking me.  You have to stay here.  I know how to get around by myself, boy.  I got around on my own long before you were born and I can get around just fine now".  Tears begin to form in his eyes and he begs "Please Baba, please you need me to take you".  He has thoughts of someone trying to steal her purse, or attacking her, or even worse being hit by a car.  Margaret is getting angry now and becoming impatient with him "Look, you can not come and stop asking me".     Since Margaret's two children have grown into little boys, they have been her guides.  And with Dexter being the oldest he has stepped up to the main responsibility of guiding her since their father left when he was five years old.  Because Hank is the youngest, to Margaret he has always been the baby and has less responsibility.     When the children are not escorting her on outings, Margaret's mother and friends will usually take them about.  On this occasion no one was available and she is Christmas shopping for gifts for the boys and she doesn't want them to know what she is buying.     Margaret turns from the dresser, pauses, and takes two-steps forward turns a perfect right and then a left.  She walks through the bedroom door, and makes a right, and walks down the hallway to the closet on the left.  "Dexter, I need my blue overcoat".  He takes her hand and puts it on the blue coat trying not to let her hear him cry.  She quickly scans her hand towards the top of the coat, reaches for the hanger, and pulls the coat from the rack.     She stands by the front door and turns towards Dexter and says, "Bring me my purse off the dresser".  Dexter goes to get the purse and Hank comes out of the boys' bedroom and runs over to his mother "Baba, where you going"?  "I have to go out and do some shopping".  Dexter returns and Margaret opens the purse and brings out her money pouch.  She instructs Dexter to check her money.  First, he counts the ones, then the fives, tens, and twenties.  He confirms the money and stands by sobbing, "Yes Baba, it's okay".  Margaret tells her sons, "You boys behave while I am away and don't let anyone into the house.  Hank if you get hungry, you can have anything in the refrigerator.  Just don't make a mess.  And Dexter, there is some soup on the stove.  All you have to do is heat it up.  The crackers are in the cupboard.   I'll be back before dark and I'll call you a little later".  Hank says, "Okay, Bye Baba", and pulls on her coat sleeve.  She leans over and gives him a kiss and he heads back to the bedroom to watch the Little Rascals on television.     Margaret puts her money pouch back in her purse and feels inside for her collapsible white cane with the red tip.  She grabs the black knob at the top of the cane and lets it drop.  She pulls on the leather strap and the cane becomes tight, and Dexter hands her an umbrella.      Margaret steps towards the front door and searches for the door handle, she quickly turns the knob.  Dexter now frantic stops her and cries, "Please Baba, please, take me with you.  It's raining outside and I need to go with you, something could happen".  Angrily she shouts, "Boy if you don't stop and let me loose, I'm going to whip you till you don't see tomorrow, now let me go and behave yourself until I get back".     Margaret heads out the door and uses the cane to find the top of the stairs, "Tap, tap, tap" on the ground goes the cane.  Once the cane slips over the edge at the top of the stairs she reaches for the banister and begins her descent.  Dexter stares at her through the glass front door and watches helplessly as she reaches the sidewalk.  He quickly runs to the front window to watch her travel down the street.  The rain is pouring down and the wind is fiercely blowing.  Dexter is looking for her but he can't see her because she is under the overhang of the window trying to get her umbrella up which is useless because it is so windy.  It just blows inside out.     With a plastic scarf over her head Margaret begins her journey down the sidewalk, "Tap, tap, tap" goes the cane.  Dexter is in the window attentively watching his mother and crying "Baba, Babaaaaa".  His face is so close to the window it's fogging up.     The intersection of Waller and Fillmore Streets is a busy one.  It's a major throughway in San Francisco, running from South to North.  The bus Margaret wants to take is the Twenty Two Line and the bus stop is one block up Fillmore Street at the corner of Haight Street.  Cars travel fast heading up Fillmore and there is no stop sign or signal.     Margaret reaches the corner and stops when the tip of the cane slips over the curb; she decides to cross Fillmore rather that turn at the corner and cross Waller where traffic has to stop.  Young eight-year-old Dexter begins talking to himself, "No, not that way, go the other way"!     Margaret is standing at the curb with her head turned and tilted; she is listening for the traffic, trying to determine when she should step off the curb and go.  A man walking up Fillmore doesn't pay attention to her and keeps on walking.     The sound of the traffic is dying and Margaret steps off of the curb and pauses, then proceeds, "Tap, tap, tap" go the cane.     Dexter's eyes are full of tears and the rain is beating down on the window, he wipes away the fog to get a better look.  He watches as his mother steps into the intersection and taps her cane as she crosses the street.     Suddenly it seems out of nowhere Margaret hears a loud engine heading in her direction.  It's a large delivery truck, the kind with a big cab on the back.  The driver doesn't see her because he is fumbling with the radio.  Baba hears the truck almost upon her and freezes.  Quickly the driver sees her and slams on the brakes and stops just short of hitting her.  Dexter sees this and yells out "BABAAAAAA".  The driver rolls down his window and yells out to Margaret "You black bitch, you almost got yourself killed".  Margaret just says "Thank you, Lord" and continues to walk in faith.     Dexter continues to watch from the window.  The wind is blowing and the rain is pouring down.  He watches as his mother reaches the curb, turns and taps to the next curb, to cross Waller Street where there is a stop sign.  She again listens then steps off the curb, taps across the street, steps up, and continues until she is out of his sight.  He leans on the glass, which is foggy and wet from his breathing and wiping, and just weeps.    After reading the prologue I wanted to shed in tears, I mean the story itself  is so sad, I felt like I was actually there, now I cant wait to see the movie (if they ever make one) sigh*.

      New Years Eve 2004  I spent my new years with a bunch of old friends hosted by Synergy and Beyonds part crew. One of my favorite parties of all times. It was located at the San Francisco City Hall. It was a formal party, you know ladies had to be in an evening gown and the fellas, oh man the fellas was real fine with their suits on. I think that eventually bring out more attraction in guys when they are in a suit.   Once we got in, I was like DAMN!!!! Inside there were a main ballroom, a second, a third, a big ass chilling lounge, a vip lounge, and four fully stocked bar. Ive got to say that it was one fine place to be at. The gallery was beautiful, and that stair case, oh man I couldnt take my eyes off it. Everywhere you go, people are standing there associating with friends. It was pretty boring at first because no one was dancing.   After many many shoot I had to take before the count down, I was ready to roll. I was ready to get my groove, so ready to shake that ass. During the count down I was like, WOO I Drank wayyyyyyy too much, and my birthday is almost over.  I got a few punch here and there but it was a love bitch slap punch. I must say that it was one great night of my life, maybe because its my special day.    I was pretty surprised that a few good looking guys hit on me. But I didnt see a reason for that. Why? Can anyone tell me why? Why am I holding back on every nice guy that comes my way?  Somehow I feel that Im not ready for anyone. All that it really mattered to me was that my friends were there with me at the moment. Or maybe because I am so in love with Alyssia. I dont want anyone to look down at me in any kinda way just because I have a kid (the future guy or his family).   To top it off Im happy with who I am and Alyssia in my life. Im still going strong and Im loving it. WOO HOO Im 23 now.

      Another Road Trip   This post was written 02/23/04.   On a breezy cold Saturday afternoon, Phong, Ben, David, Harvey and I all headed out to Tahoe for the second time this year. I figured it would be a short trip for me if I was stoned. And I was rite, woke up after four hours of the boring car ride and we was there in South Lake Tahoe. To me it seem like an hour.    The snow was beautiful as how I remember it was from the last time we were there. I didnt do much talking this time. I sat way in the back sit sleeping, playing textris and keep quiet. I didnt want to conversate with Ben either or anyone else.     Once we got to the hotel, unpacked, rested, then off we went straight to the buffet at Harrahs. The wait was an hour. I must admit that I ate so much. Everyone was so shock when they saw my plates. After dinner we went straight for the casino. I spend 20 bucks on the pai gaw table and another 20 bucks on the wheels of fortune slots.  I end up winning 100 from the slots after three whole hours. By this time I was drunk, I had two bottles of Heineken, a bottle of corona and two shots of remy.      Eleven oclock no one wanted to leave, I went straight to the bar and started flirting with the bar tender, and she was hot. Blonde, cute smiles, big boobies. Damn what else could I ask for? I didnt know if she wanted me to go away or did she wanted me to stay but she kept giving me free shots. I took another three shots of remy and I was gone gone gone.    My friends found me and I was throwing up everywhere, we all got kicked out because of me after that I was knock out. We headed back to the hotel, what every happened after that I didnt remember. I slept like a baby. I didnt remember a thing.    The alarm went off at six in the morning. I didnt want to go, all I wanted to do was sleep. Waking up with a hangover wasnt so nice at all. I was mean and grouchy. Shower, put on our snow pants, snow jackets, load four boards into the car, got everything and everyone and off we went to mickey ds.   Nine in the morning, we head out to heavenly resort. At last we come to it, breathing in fresh morning icy cold crispy thin air. At last, yes, its time to gear up, got our boards check, my camera check, my beanie check, my gloves check, my Chap Stick check, my glasses check, everyone was ready check, got our lift ticket check. We were all good to go; off we went onto the ski lift. I sat with Ben again, we were so calm, and it was so peaceful, we didnt say a word to each other, then off the lift we went. The landing was smooth, everyone finishes strapping in and double check all their bindings and off we went.   An hour went by, everyone was having so much fun. We scrub, we fell, I flip so many times, and we were all just having a blast, having a great time, the greatest moments of laughers. Up the lift, down the hill, up the lift, off the lift and down the hill again. Damn, it was so fun I miss it already.  Had lunch at twelve and off we went on the ski lifts again.   The day was over and back to the car, back to the hotel room, rested and packed. I stay inside the hotel room chatted online with Andy, while everyone else was having a great time in the Jacuzzi.  A couple of hours past by we were ready to roll. Had dinner at mickey ds and we were on our way home. I was exhausted, I slept the whole way back and I was sober  Said good bye to the beautiful mountains in Tahoe and I shall see you again in March.

      Waiting to Exhale   All of a sudden Im feeling left all alone. Could it be because I havent been around anyone who will give me love in such a long time? I feel like Im the only person here and looking for a partner to be with. Everyone I turn to for comfort seem to be fading rite before my eyes.   A friend once told me that I was no longer the lonely, timid girl I once was. That I was so strong, so sure of myself and that he was very proud of me. To see me where I was at, from where I once was, only proves to him that he was right about me. I sit back and asked myself, What Happen to This Girl?   I have so many things running through my mind rite now. Such as Sex, School, Money, Work, Alyssia, No Doubt concert, Britney Spears concert, friends, relationship, love and etc. There is only vision thats planted into my mind. Many friends turned to me for advice and I didnt know what to say. I did what I could, and if they didnt like my advice oh well. But today its been bothering me, so I have to blog about it.   Love is just like a punishment, its only here to represent, so easily to come my way. Can real love survive? Love is a total concept that everybody goes through. Why? I dunno!!! Love is so short and forgetting is eternity. Jumping in with your heart and jumping out with your head. Jumping in and out isnt wise.   Making decision with yourself is difficult but just be honest and be true to yourself. Its hard, who am I kidding? If decisions are made dont look back. Dont run away from yourself either. Life isnt perfect, nobody is. The value of time is what counts the most.  If youve found that special someone take care of him/her. Hold on to that person tight and dont let go.  If you misunderstood each other just talk things out. Communication is the only key.   Be sure to make mistakes, makes lots of them because there is no better way to learn. Who ever you choose dont run away from it. Dont chase it either, it will come to you when you lease expect it. Just be patience.   Man, Ive been telling myself this over and over again but when am I going to let any guy into my life again? I know that one really great guy is waiting for an answer. Waiting for me to let him fly into my life. Waiting to start something serious with me.   All these time Ive been searching and never finding the answer. Im not ready for a serious relationship. I have too much issue to think of and to take care of. I still want you by my side just to help me dry the tears that Ive cried. Give me some times to explore your world and show me what you are capable of. Allow time to reveal yourself to me. Let me enjoy your friendship for as long as faith will allow us. If it grows into something more beautiful then friendship then let it blossom.

      Another Blonde Joke  Two bored casino dealers are waiting at the crap table. A very attractive  blonde woman arrived and bet twenty thousand dollars on a single roll of the  dice.  She said, "I hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I'm  completely nude." With that, stripped from the neck down, rolled the dice  and yelled, "Come on, baby, Mama needs new clothes!"  As the dice came to a stop she jumped up and down and squealed..."YES! YES!  I WON, I WON!"  She hugged each of the dealers and then picked up her winnings and her  clothes and quickly departed.  The dealers stared at each other dumfounded. Finally, one of them asked,  "What did she roll?" The other answered, "I don't know - I thought you were  watching."  MORAL: Not all blondes are dumb, but all men are men.

      This Is Embarrassing   Late last night I had the weirdest and the scariest dream ever. I woke up shedding tears, holding my pillow tight, cuddling so close to Alyssia and I also had a knife under my pillow just in case. I have never waked up from a dream being this scared in my life. I felt like a mouse that was trap in the corner with a bunch of big fat cats surrounding me with no place to escape.     Now we all know that Miss Sakdary has been working very late at night, its always so dark by 7:30 or 8pm outside walking towards my car. Its a good thing that I carry a bottle of MACE with me all the time.. Anyone dares to mess with me Ill kick you in your balls and spray mace in your eyes, to top it off Ill lift a garbage can near by and dump it over your head. Oh, and Ill also cog a big chunk of loogie and spit it rite on your face.   Heres how the dream hunt me:  I was working late on night walking towards my car and three men walked up to me the next thing I realized that I was locked up inside a mansion surrounded by mafias with guns. There were other women with me as well, we totally realized that we were kidnapped. That was the last time I saw all the other women.  We were separated one by one to different rooms. There was this Hispanic man who came into my room and told me why they have kidnapped me. It was because of my looks, that I was beautiful. Their plan was to rape every single one of us and then sell us to people who wanted us.   After that I was attack!!! I was aware of the situation, I try to fight back, but every time I do, I was abused. I was hurt every time. I scream for help, I yelled, I cried but they didnt let this innocent girl go. I was so scared.  Once I woke up, I was in fear shaking in tears. Staring into my digital clock it was 3:31 am, I couldnt get back to sleep, I didnt want to sleep. I wish never to dream of anything like this ever again. I didnt get back to sleep until five this morning. Until now I am still kinda paranoid.

      WTF  After working for Old Republic Title Company for three whole years, yesterday was the very first time I have ever raise my voice at my manager, Jim. Why? Its a long story but Ive got all night to explain. And so the story goes.  The typing department was doing just find until this black woman came along. She was transfer to our office from San Francisco. Everyone knows that shes a snitch and not everyone like her very much. She is the type that kisses ass with the boss. Shes so coincided. All I have to say is that shes full of herself.  Working here for so many years I look up to Ann, now Ann knows everything and shes very sweet. I see Ann as how I see my grandmother. When ever I needed a piece of advice shes the only one I turn to and I must say that shes an expert. Things started out find yesterday morning until Carolyn (the black lady) told me about a replacement code for policy she also said that Jim wanted the new code to be added in. From my experience and how I was taught its a different code from what Carolyn told us. I wanted to make sure I am getting the rite code so that nothing will come back for corrections. I went over to Anns desk and ask for justice. No one has ever heard of the new code Jim has suggested. Everyone in the office disagree with Jim.   I over heard Carolyn said, Why is she going to Ann for, Ann doesnt know anything. So bitch ass, snitch ass took her little behind and went up to Jims office. She probably told Jim that I refused to use his new code. Less then two minutes later, Jim came over to my desk. He yelled, WHY ARE YOU REFUSING TO USE THE NEW CODE I SUGGUESTED? WHATS WRONG WITH IT?  I tought it was so rude of him to yelled at my face like that at nine in the morning. I was so not ready for this SHIT. I snap!!!! My reply was, WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME, IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS STUPID CODE. TITLE OFFIER SAID THAT THE CODE YOU SUGGESTED GIVES LENDER PROBLEMS. I DONT APPRECIATE YOU RAISING YOU VOICE AT ME. IF YOU WANT US TO USE THE NEW CODE YOU SHOULD JUST AT LEAST SEND OUT A MEMO!!!.   At that moment the look on his face was filled with humiliation. He walked away saying, WELL, FROM NOW ON YOUR USING THE NEW CODE.. I thought what a fucken ass hole, I hate any men who dare to yell at me. I sat at my desk feeling so uncomfortable. I had tears in my eyes but I held strong. I took a deep breath and work on.  Later on that night, Lanie who is now my new supervisor, approach me and notified with me that the entire state corporation shouldnt be in the policy. Shes been correcting policies for so many fucken years now but has she ever received anything with a state corporation? NO.. Again, I argue with her for my rights. Sknky ass started to fucken cry because she couldnt argue with me anymore. PEOPLE, I am just doing what I was told and how I was trained. So Carolyn came along and they were just talking, theyve changed everything in the policy. Thats just hella messed up. Carolyn doesnt like Ann and wanted Ann out of the typing department what a fucken whore. I hate her ass so much and I hate Lanie for being a dumb ass.   This morning coming to work, I didnt know what was going to happen. Kathy a very nice sweet lady came up to me and asked if I was okay and that she heard about it and that I should let the other manager know about this and that is I wanted to sue Jim for yelling at me I have the rite to. But you know what, I want to see how far is this going to go on. I want to see the look on Carolyns face when she finally realized that being a snitch ass MF isnt cool at all. Until now, I havent spoken a work to her. Im just so pist off and the anger inside I will always remember.   People will forget what you say to them but people will never forget how you made them feel.

      Important to know  Through a Rapist's Eyes  A group of rapists and date rapists in prison were interviewed on what they look for in a potential victim and here are some interesting facts:  1) The first thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle. They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed. They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair. Women with short hair are not common targets.  2) The second thing men look for is clothing. They will look for women who's clothing is easy to remove quickly. Many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing.  3) They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can be easily overpowered.  4) The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the early morning, between 5 and 8:30 a.m.  5) The number one place women are abducted from/attacked at is grocery store parking lots. Number two is office parking lots/garages. Number three is public restrooms.  6) The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to worry about getting caught.  7) Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries a 3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years.  8) If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isn't worth it because it will be time-consuming.  9) These men said they would not pick on women who have umbrellas, or other similar objects that can be used from a distance, in their hands. Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon. So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it.  10) Several defense mechanisms he taught us are: If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with you in an elevator or stairwell, look them in the face and ask them a question, like what time is it, or make general small talk, I can't believe it is so cold out here, we're in for a bad winter. Now you've seen their face and could identify them in a line-up, you lose appeal as a target.  11) If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of you and yell Stop or Stay back! Most of the rapists this man talked to said they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back. Again, they are looking for an EASY target.  12) If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him wherever he goes,) yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it out will be a deterrent.  13) If someone grabs you, you can't beat them with strength but you can by outsmarting them. If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner thigh -- HARD. One woman in a class this guy told him she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands the guy needed stitches. Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it; it hurts.  14) After the initial hit, always go for the groin. I know from a particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's parts it is extremely painful. You might think that you'll anger the guy and make him want to hurt you more, but the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of Trouble. Start causing trouble, and he's out of there.  15) When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible. The instructor did it to me without using much pressure, and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly.   16) Of course the things we always hear still apply. Always be aware of your surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts. You may feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble.  PLEASE READ THEN FORWARD THIS TO EVERY WOMAN YOU KNOW--FRIENDS, DAUGHTERS, GRANDDAUGHTERS, RELATIVES, CO-WORKERS, IT'S SIMPLE STUFF BUT IT COULD SAVE HER LIFE.

      More Junk E Mails  Here was this couple that had been married for 20 years.  Every time they made love the husband always insisted on shutting off the lights.  Well, after 20 years the wife felt this was ridiculous.  She figured she would break him of this crazy habit.    So one night, while they were in the middle of a wild, screaming, romantic session, she turned on the lights.  She looked down.  And saw her husband was holding a battery operated pleasure device...  a vibrator ...  soft, wonderful and larger than a real one.  She goes completely ballistic.   "You impotent bastard," she screamed at him, "How could you be lying to me all of these years?  You better explain yourself!" The husband looks her straight in the eyes and says calmly: "I'll explain the toy...  if you explain the kids."   I thought that this was one funny shit. Hey guys, if you are not satisfied with something, don't fake it. DO SOMETHING!!!

      I Got K.O.  All the girls decided to check out club Whisper in SF, drinking in the car before we enter like always. The ghetto thing was that we didnt have a chaser, so we had to chase it with a tangerin. That was so unfullfilling.  After three whole shot i was good to go. Once we enter the club found more friends then, had two more shots. Dance alittle, i took two more shot.   By this time i'm having so much fun, i didnt really car who's there and who's not there anymore. i got my groove on and shake my ass like i've never have before. i was dancing with so many hot girls that wasnt my friends. then they had to bounce, i was like oh man, and i didnt even get any numbers. lol.   Spotted my crew, drank some more, this time i had two sex on the beach. I didnt know how this happen but i was dancing with the girls and than they took off but Linda, she asked me to dance with her cousin. i think his name was Twan, his pretty cute.  at first i was like  eh, i dont want to dance with any guys. Just to be nice since he bought me so many drinks. Dancing with him was really fun. i enjoy myself from the inside out. maybe because i didnt really care because i was so drunk by this time.    After danicng with Twan for Two whole hours, I had to pee, its already two but i dont want to leave. After that, before i can even get out of the stall i started to feel everything in my throat. i was hogging the toilet quite some time. I couldnt stop yeaking. Then, i started to cry, Linda came in, i was talking to her telling her about my drama with my mother. she started to cry. Man, it was bad!!! Both of us kept hogging the sink throwing up. After a short a amount of time we walked outside.   Twan and Calvin was waiting for us. Linda walked into Calvin's arm which was okay because their dating rite there and then she fainted. Me? i started to throw up somemore. Twan was looking after me. He walked me outside. Sat and waited for everyone. HE was comforting me but i didnt feel a thing with him, i just thought, oh his really nice to be taking care of a dumb ass like me.   Throw up some more. Before i even notice everyone was outside and i was knock out. Laying on Twan's lap i was so cold. He escorted me into Calvin's car, i was gone gone gone. I've have never like this before. Damn, i must be really fucked up to be ko. Got home by three thirty, fell asleep in the bathroom until Linda got me out and tuck me into bed.   Nine am this morning, i couldnt sleep anymore. I had to blog about what happen. I can still taste alcohol in my mouth and i'm still pretty much very tipsy. I'm so weak, I'm so stuck, i dont even know what to do.  I just want to sleep but i cant sleep. well, thats the end of my story. I've always wonder how well with i do blogging while being kinda tipsy so here i am. Man, i really want some pho. i'm hungry. Note: I am still tipsy so I'll correct my blog later for spelling and shit.

      Open Wide  So I visit the dental office yesterday just to get a regular check up as always. While waiting to be seen by one of the doctors, I realized that Sakdary has been checked out by one of the new doctor. I pretend that I didnt notice anything and minded my own business. I try not to make any eye contacts and sort of hide my face by turning away so that he wont be able to take a good look at me.    Had an x-ray by one of the nurses, I must say shes pretty cute. She smelled real good. After the x-ray I had to sit in the waiting room again. Walking past that cute doctor I avoid eye contacts again. Five minutes later he called me in which wasnt so odd. Introduced ourselves with a hand shake and blare with a smile.    Upon opening my mouth for him, he did so many things to my mouth that I havent had a clue. All I could do was lye there and open wide, look at him, at the ceiling or just close my eyes. I hate the noisy drills, it kinda scares me away. For every time his about to stick something inside, I twitch.    Ive always wanted to see what the heck doctors do to you while you are just lying there. I mean what the hell are they looking or doing. I know that they for sure know what their doing but I was just very curious. Out of no where he asked, How old are you? I was puzzled. 23 I answered. Then another question flew out, Are you married?ummm, NO I thought to myself, what was that? Where did all of that come from? Sure he was a cute doctor but Im still puzzled by his questions.   Overall, he was real nice to explain to me that I dont have any cavity, and I wont have to make another appointment until 6 months later. Then he said, I think you should make an appointment with me on your next visit. Haha. I said thankyouverymuch and Ill see you in six months and I took off   That was much unexpected; does a doctor always ask their patiences weird questions like that???

      This is So True  What's In A Name? How sexy is your name?   According to studies, the first letter of your first name reveals your sexual identity.   At the very least, I find mine to be pretty accurate (except for the gay thing). What do you think?   ----A----   You are not particularly romantic, but you are interested in action. You mean business. With you, what you see is what you get. You have no patience for flirting and can't be bothered with someone who is trying to be coy, cute, demure, and subtly enticing. You are an up front person. When it comes to sex, it's action that counts not obscure hints. Your mate's physical attractiveness is important to you. You find the chase and challenge of the "hunt" invigorating. You are passionate and sexual as well as being much more adventurous than you appear; however, you do not go around advertising these qualities. Your physical needs are your primary concern.   ----B----   You give off vibes of lazy sensuality. You enjoy being romanced, wined, and dined. You are very happy to receive gifts as an expression of the affection of your lover. You want to be pampered and know how to pamper your mate. You are private in your expression of endearments and particularly when it comes to lovemaking. You will hold off until everything meets with your approval. You can control your appetite and abstain from sex if need be. You require new sensations and experiences. You are willing to experiment.   ----C----   You are a very social individual, and it is important to you to have a relationship. You require closeness and togetherness. You must be able to talk to your sex partner before, during, and after. You want the object  of your affection to be socially acceptable and good looking. You see your lover as a friend and companion. You are very sexual and sensual, needing someone to appreciate and almost worship you. When this cannot be  achieved, you have the ability to go for long periods without sexual activity. You are an expert at controlling your desires and doing without.   ----D----   Once you get it into your head that you want someone, you move full steam ahead in pursuit. You do not give up your quest easily. You are nurturing and caring. If someone has a problem, this turns you on. You are highly sexual, passionate, loyal, and intense in your involvement, sometimes possessive and jealous. Sex to you is a pleasure to be enjoyed. You are stimulated by the eccentric and unusual, having a free and open.   ----E----   Your greatest need is to talk. If your date is not a good listener, you have trouble relating. A person must be intellectually stimulating or you are not interested sexually. You need a friend for a lover and a companion  for a bedmate. You hate disharmony and disruption, but you do enjoy a good argument once in a while it seems to stir things up. You flirt a lot, for the challenge is more important than the sexual act for you, but once  you give your heart away, you are uncompromisingly loyal. When you don't have a good lover to fall asleep with, you will fall asleep with a good book. (Sometimes, in fact, you prefer a good book.)   ----F----   You are idealistic and romantic, putting your lover on a pedestal. You look for the very best mate you can find. You are a flirt, yet once committed, you are very loyal. You are sensuous,sexual,and privately passionate. Publicly, you can be showy, extravagant, and gallant. You are born romantic. Dramatic love scenes are your favorite fantasy pastime. You can be a very generous lover.   ----G----   You are crap in bed!   ----H----   You seek a mate who can enhance your reputation and earning ability. You will be very generous to your lover once you have attained a commitment. Your gifts are actually an investment in your partner. Before the  commitment, though, you tend to be frugal in your spending and dating habits and equally cautious in your sexual involvement. You are a sensual and patient lover.   ----I----   You have a great need to be loved, appreciated...even worshipped. You enjoy luxury, sensuality, and pleasures of the flesh. You look for lovers who know what they are doing. You are not interested in an amateur, unless that amateur wants a tutor. You are fussy and exacting about having your desires satisfied. You are willing to experiment and try new modes of sexual expression. You bore easily and thus require sexual adventure and change. You are more sensual than sexual, but you are sometimes downright lustful.   ----J----   You are totally fucking marvelous!   ----K----   You can be very romantic, attached to the glamour of love. Having a partner is of paramount importance to you. You are free in your expression of love and are willing to take chances, try new sexual experiences and partners, provided it's all in good taste. Brains turn you on. You must feel that your partner is intellectually stimulating, otherwise you will find it difficult to sustain the relationship. You require loving, cuddling, wining, and dining to know that you're being appreciated.   ----L----   You are very romantic, idealistic, and somehow you believe that to love means to suffer. You wind up serving your mate or attracting people who have unusual troubles. You see yourself as your lover's savior. You are sincere, passionate, lustful, and dreamy. You can't help falling in love. You really enjoy stimulating yourself, though you are fairly new to it. You fantasize and get turned on by movies and magazines. You do not tell others of this secret life, nor of your sexual fantasies.   ----M----   You are emotional and intense. When involved in a relationship, you throw your entire being into it. Nothing stops you; there are no holds barred. You are all consuming and crave someone who is equally passionate and intense. You are willing to try anything and everything.

You can handle more than one relationship at a time with ease. You believe in total sexual freedom. You are willing to try anything and everything. Your supply of sexual energy is inexhaustible. You are a flirt, yet once committed, you are very loyal. You are sensuous, sexual, and privately passionate. Publicly, you can be showy, extravagant, and gallant. You are born romantic. Dramatic love scenes are your favorite fantasy pastime. You can be a very generous lover.   ----O----   You are very interested in sexual activities yet secretive and shy about your desires. You can re-channel much of your sexual energy into making money and/or seeking power. You can easily have extended periods of celibacy. You are a passionate, compassionate, sexual lover, requiring the same qualities from your mate. Sex is serious business; thus you demand intensity and diversity, and are willing to try anything or anyone. Sometimes your passions turn to possessiveness, which must be kept in check.   ----P----   You are very conscious of social proprieties. You wouldn't think of doing anything that might harm your image or reputation. Appearances count, therefore, you require a good-looking partner. You also require an intelligent partner. Oddly enough, you may view your partner as your enemy. A good fight stimulates those sex vibes. You are relatively free of sexual hang-ups. You are willing to experiment and try new ways of doing things. You are very social and sensual; you enjoy flirting and need a good deal of physical gratification.   ----Q----   You require constant activity and stimulation. You have tremendous physical energy. It is not easy for a partner to keep up with you, sexually or otherwise. You are an enthusiastic lover and tend to be attracted to people of other ethnic groups. You need romance, hearts and flowers, and lots of conversation to turn you on and keep you going.   ----R----   You are a no-nonsense, action-oriented individual. You need someone who can keep pace with you and who is your intellectual equal the smarter the better. You are turned on more quickly by a great mind than by a great body. However, physical attractiveness is very important to you. You have to be proud of your partner. You are privately very sexy, but you do not brag, you are willing to serve as teacher. Sex is important; you can be a very demanding playmate.   ----S----   You are secretive, self-contained, and shy. You are very sexy, sensual, and passionate, but you do not let on to this. Only in intimate privacy will this part of your nature reveal itself. When it gets down to the nitty-gritty, you are an expert. You know all the little tricks of the trade, can play any role or any game, and take your love life very seriously. You don't fool around. You have the patience to wait for the right person to come along.   ----T----   You are very sensitive, private, and sexually passive; you like a partner who takes the lead. Music, soft lights and romantic thoughts turn you on. You fantasize, but do not tend to fall in and out of love easily. When in love, you are romantic, idealistic, mushy, and extremely intense. You enjoy having your senses and your feelings stimulated, titillated, and teased. You are a great flirt. You can make your relationships fit your dreams, oftentimes all in your own head.   ----U----   You are enthusiastic and idealistic when in love. When not in love, you are in love with love, always looking for someone to adore. You see romance as a challenge. You are a roamer and need adventure, excitement, and freedom. You deal in potential relationships. You enjoy giving gifts and enjoy seeing your mate looking good. Your sex drive is strong and you desire instant ratification. You are willing to put your partner's pleasures above your own.   ----V----   You are individualistic, and you need freedom, space, and excitement. You wait until you know someone well before committing yourself. Knowing someone means psyching him out. You feel a need to get into his head to see what makes him tick. You are attracted to eccentric types. Often there is an age difference between you and your lover. You respond to danger, thrills, and suspense. The gay scene turns you on, even though you yourself may not be a participant.   ----W----   You are very proud, determined, and you refuse to take no for an answer when pursuing love. Your ego is at stake. You are romantic, idealistic, and often in love with love itself, not seeing your partner as he or she really is. You feel deeply and throw all of yourself into your relationships. Nothing is too good for your lover. You enjoy playing love games.   ----X----   You need constant stimulation because you bore quickly. You can handle more than one relationship at a time with ease. You can't shut off your mind. You talk while you make love. You can have the greatest love affairs, all by yourself, in your own head.   ----Y----   You are sexual, sensual, and very independent. If you can't have it your way, you will forgot the whole thing. You want to control your relationships, which doesn't always work out too well. You respond to physical stimulation, enjoy necking and spending hours just touching, feeling, and exploring. However, if you can spend your time making money, you will give up the pleasures of the flesh for the moment. You need to prove to yourself and your partner what a great lover you are. You want feedback on your performance. You are an open, stimulating, romantic.   ----Z----   You suck.

      So Why Go Out Drinking? Just read this in the current issue of The Onion.  "Now, the secret to going out for the night is drinking before you leave the house. At home, you drink for half the cost and you don't have to tip the guy who gets the beer out of the fridge."  Yeah, it costs half or less, the beer is as good or better, and you don't have to wait for your next one. Plus, the music is fantastic. So, why go out drinking? I suppose, if you're feeling flush and social.  Dude comon now, Im not a bar kinda gal. Its boring.. Dont ask me to go to a freaken bar. Never ask Sakdary to a freaken bar. Dont pursuant Sakdary to go to a bar. Cuzz the answer would be NOOOOOOO.

      The Injured Thumb   This guy went into a restaurant and ordered his meal. When the waitress came out with his soup, he noticed that she had her thumb stuck into the soup. This upset him, but he let it go. She then brought out his chili, and again her thumb was in the food. He let it go again. When she brought out his hot fudge sundae, her thumb was in the food and this was too much for him. "Goddammit," said the man, "get your damn thumb out of my food!'   "Well, I injured it a while ago and the doctor said I should keep it warm."   "Why don't you just shove it up your ass?" the man said angrily.   "That's what I do when I'm in the kitchen."

      I'm So Scared  Something had happened last nite and earlier this morning, I dunno if it was a mistake or will I ever regret what I did. One thing for sure tho, I did it with feelings and I meant every word I said. It was amazing but I must lay low and not rush into anything. Through the hourglass, things will show me that you're here to stay, and time will reveal itself.   "Look in my soul... hold on tightly... and never let go"

      A Nite At Club Rouge  A couple of friends called me to come out and party with them on a lovely friday nite. Sure Sakdary will come out and party with them, but just dont get me drunk drunk. Arriving at the club, parking sucks and the waiting in line shit SUCKS.. Took too many shoots and dance the nite away. I was having fun, just a great time hanging out with friends.   I must admit that i was pretty much buzzin at the time until now. As we speak i notice that i've spotted a friend which i never knew i would ever run into. Upon the reaction that i had i dared myself to go along with the flow just to say HI to a friend whom i have never really met. What a small world it is. The friend whom i was waiting to meet was Curtis.   Anyways, I was having so much fun afterwards that i totally forgot what time it was. By this time everyone was pretty much gonne gone like a crack in the joke. Its a good thing that i've got Andykisaoski taking care of me or else i would pretty much be so doom. Poor Sakdary, cant even bearly walk to the car.   I have no idea what am i blogging about rite at this moment but all that i know is that i am so buzz. Good nite everyone. I have nothing else to say. God, I hope this headache will go away....

      Four Eye Geek  I went to see the optometrist beginning of this week and I was told that I can not wear contact lenses that often anymore. Because my eye balls need some oxygen, it needs to breathe. I thought to myself DAMN I AM BLIND. My doctor proscribed me a pair of glasses.   Here I am at work, my first day without contacts and my first day at work with glasses on. Im thinking whats next rite?  People left and right stares at me with a furious thought running through their mind.   I guess it really didnt matter what people think as long as I like it. Well, do you like it Sakdary? Gee, I dunno. I think I look sophisticated, and much much more mature and all grown up. What do you guys think? Dorky huh?

      Four Twenty....  It is that time of the year again folks, no doubt many people are getting ripped rite now smoking a joint. I once said to myself Id never touch that stuff and that its bad for you. I still dont understand people who do it everyday, why is 4/20 so amusing for them? I mean they would smoke and smoke and smoke like theres no tomorrow. Ive got one thing to say, They are outta their mind.   Coming to realized that it takes my stress away for that moment and it makes me go crazy munching.  Im thinking maybe I should stop eating but as people say your eyes are bigger then your stomach. Lol. Two hit could do so much to me. Mainly because after experimenting a little, I like to munch on anything and everything that Ive got.   Heres the funny part, I ate so much to the point where I cant stuff anything else inside, mean while I couldnt sleep either because I was too stuff. I was actually rolling around like a lil chick thats been feed with rice and water.

      Gross, Grosser, Grossest   What's grosser than gross?   Two vampires fighting over a bloody tampon. What's grosser than that? Finding a used condom on the bottom of a mayonnaise jar.   What's grosser than that?  When you open the refrigerator and the rump roost farts in your face.   You want to know what's grosser than that?  When you sit on your grandpa's lap and he pops a boner.   But the one thing that is grosser than that is when you are sitting on your grandma's lap and she pops a boner.

      Happy Birthday boys  Yesterday I went to PixelLand for my god sons b-day party (Aj 5 and Adrian 2). For those of you who have never ever been to PixelLand, I recommend you guys to throw birthday parties there for lil kids. Its like a fun lil carnival which is like a circus to me. I had so much fun I think I was worst then my daughter.   I got a chance to see old old old friends and many new faces. I was introduced to this one hot Pilipino girl, we shook hands and I smiled at her. While shaking hands she squeezed my hands so hard I couldnt pulled away nor could I tell her that she was hurting me. Dude, she didnt want to let go. My innocent smile became a fake smile because I was hurt. I felt like screaming OUCH but I held it. To tell you the truth I almost slip out a fart because it hurt so bad. Lol.   Didnt she know that Sakdary is hella fragile? Didnt she know that Sakdary is just a lil girl? Didnt she know that she was hurting me? Ill remember to never ever shake her hands again. I must admit that she was a hottie and shes probably a meanie too. Come to think of this, Im getting kinda scared to shake hands with pretty girls. Hey, that was just a silly thought, Id take that back =D.

      I Don't Want You to Leave  I never thought I would feel this way. I never knew I would be so emotional about this. I don't want to feel vulnerable. I don't want to be all sad and depress. I was his favorite. He once told me that he had confident in me and he was rite. Each day he would always pick on me, giving me a hard time but I was just his favorite one.   Jim, the manager I once got into an argument with awhile ago is relocating to another office in Pleasanton. Before the argument, I didn't like him very much because he was always there to push the button. He would tell me to stop e mailing people and get back to work or smoking is BAD for you or your not working fast enough. People would always tell me that I was his favorite that's why he picks on me.   Then one day something occurs and I hated him so much after that day. But then time pasts by and we somehow got along again. We joke around, specify pathetic things here and there. Today, as he is leaving forever, I gave him the sad puppy face, he turns to look at me and encourage me to be strong and told me he'll be back and that's a promise. With a pat on my back I felt like shedding tears. He didn't look too happy himself but this is what he got to do.   He's gone and I'm feeling sad because there wont be anyone else to spoil me like he did. There wont be anyone around like Jim to pick on me making me hates his guts. I hope he return soon. Man, why am I sad? God damnit!!! Sniffle* sniffle*

      Screw Them  Someone will always be prettier. They will always be smarter.  Their house will be bigger. They will drive a better car.  Their children will do better in school. And their husband will fix more things around the house. So let it go, and love you and your circumstances.  Think about it. The prettiest woman in the world can have hell in her heart. And the most highly favored woman on your job may be unable to have children. And the richest woman you know -- she's got the car, the house, the clothes --might be lonely.   And the word says if I have not Love, I am nothing. So, again, love you. Love who you are right now and let God be your barometer. Mirror Him. Look in the mirror in the morning and see how much of God you see. He's the only standard and even when you come up short; he will not leave you or forsake you. Smile and may God continue to BLESS YOU Real GOOD!!    "I am too blessed to be stressed and too anointed to be disappointed!" The shortest distance between a problem and a solution is the distance between your knees and the floor. "The one who kneels to God can stand up to anything." "Winners make things happen.. Losers let things happen." Be Blessed ladies and pass this on to encourage another woman. "To the world you might be one person, but to one person you just might be the world"

The one who got slapped                               was hurt, but without                                 saying anything,                                wrote in the sand:                                TODAY MY BEST FRIEND                              SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE.                                They kept on walking                            until they found an oasis,                                where they decided                                  to take a bath.                               The one who had been                             slapped got stuck in the                            mire and started drowning,                             but the friend saved him.                               After he recovered from                                the near drowning,                               he wrote on a stone:                                TODAY MY BEST FRIEND                                  SAVED MY LIFE.                             The friend who had slapped                             and saved his best friend                           asked him, "After I hurt you,                          you wrote in the sand and now,                            you write on a stone, why?"                             The other friend replied                              "When someone hurts us                              we should write it down                              in sand where winds of                          forgiveness can erase it away.                              But, when someone does                              something good for us,                            we must engrave it in stone                                   where no wind                                can ever erase it."                                   LEARN TO WRITE                                   YOUR HURTS IN                                  THE SAND AND TO                                    CARVE YOUR                                BENEFITS IN STONE.                                 They say it takes a                             minute to find a special                                person, an hour to                              appreciate them, a day                              to love them, but then                                  an entire life                                  to forget them.

      It must have been love    You came into my life unexpectedly, and everything took a turn for the better. You're warm eyes, your laugh, the sincere way you speak, and the kindness you showed me all became a part of my life.   It must have been love but it's over now. It was all that I wanted now I'm living without. It must have been love but I lost it somehow. From the moment we touch til the time runs out. Its where the water flow. Its where the wind blow. It must have been love but its over now.    I realized now that I had never known what it meant to be loved until I was loved by you. There are some days that I guess I never know when you love someone you gotta learn to let them go. There are things left unsaid and done. I'm letting go and you should too.

      You are Charlie Brown   Everyone has a personality of a cartoon character.  Have you ever asked yourself what cartoon character do you most resemble? A group of investigators got together and analyzed the personalities of well known and modern cartoon characters.

(35-42 points) You are Charlie Brown: you are tender, you fall in love quickly but you are also very serious about all relationships. You are a family person. You call your mom every Sunday. You have many friends and may occasionally forget a few Birthdays. Don't let your passion confuse you with reality.   (43-50 points) You are Dexter: You are smart and definitely a thinker. Every situation is fronted with a plan. You have a brilliant mind. You demonstrate very strong family principles. Maintain a stable routine but never ignore a bad situation when it comes.

      Renee Duvall  I've never loved anyone the way that I love you. I've never known someone so well and still felt there was so much left to discover... never been able to say "I love you" and have it mean something beautifully different every time. I've never known someone I could spend hours with and still long for time to share... never felt so close to someone in so many ways. And even though I know I'll never be able to tell you with words how much you mean to me... I hope you somehow understand that the love I fell for you is more beautiful, more meaningful than words could every say.   Andy, thanks for this lovely card, thank you so much for loving me but things will always remain the way they are.....

      God Give Me Strength   This post was written January 16, 2004  Walking along the side walk towards the city court house, smelling the morning fresh thin air, I can actually feel my heart pounding. So hard that I could feel a sharp pain running up my throat and guess what I threw up. Entering the building with several metal detectives that I had to walk through made me realized that I am during the right thing. Filing for child support was what I should have done a long long time ago. Entering into the court room and there he was that bastard who once hurt me so bad. Seeing his face once more only made me hated his guts even more. And now he wants to do a dna test? Punk ass nigga wanted to do a genetic test to see if Alyssia is his biological daughter.   At that moment my heart drop to my stomach, I just couldn't believed what I have just heard. Honestly, I did mess around behind his back but only because he wouldn't let me go and we would always argue over stupid stuff and end up getting into a fight. I must admit that I was very stupid at that time. At the age of eighteen I thought I had no choice. But I was so wrong, I thought to myself that I am the winner and he's the loser. And that there would be no man alive would ever hurt me physically and emotionally ever again.  I cant wait to hear the result.. I'm gonna laugh so hard, so hard that it will make him so humiliating.   June 28, 2004, finally the result are in this is good news for me, he's the biological father. Just made my day. I end up laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Fucking bastard.

      The weekend was COOL  Friday, went to the A's games. The company gave out free tickets along with a tailgate party FREE FOOD and FREE BEERS including margarita. I claim seven tickets, went with six friends, it was so cool. We all ate so much except for Phuong. She's one of the tiniest Pettit girls with the biggest boobs I have even known. Didn't know what it was like until we got there. The game itself was very exciting, call me stupid but I didn't know which team I was suppose to cheer for. Of course I knew we were cheering for the A's but I didn't know what color was their uniform. We had a binocular but most of the time I was checking out the guys' ass.   Towards the end of the night, we all were pretty buzz, the A's were losing badly, I got pretty upset and it ruins my night. I figured even no doubt concert was so much better. Before we left the game I went up for more beers, stood in line with a friend all of a sudden I felt so hot, I was getting dizzy, I felt so numb from head to toe, then I went black out for a couple of seconds. It was a good thing I didn't crash or fainted but pretty close. My friend had to rush me back to my seat after that the miserable pain went away. My gosh, wtf was that? Can someone tell me why I had that feeling? It was so scary for me. Apparently this was the second time that happens. The very first time happen four years ago when I was pregnant and now it's happening again. Is there something wrong with me?  Saturday, went to the dentist, the doctor told me that I've got one cavity. God damnit I was horrified. I brush my teeth twice a day, floss before I go to bed, rinse my mouth with Listerine and still I have a freakin cavity. Had to get a rout cannel and my plan for the night was ruin. I was hoping to go to 1999 rave but no I wont be able to drop. Whore shit I cant do anything. end up staying home, slept through the whole afternoon, woke up watch Along came Polly and stuck eating porridge. Afterwards I crash into bed again, supposedly the medication that I took had codeine in it and it makes me so sleepy everything.   Sunday, took my daughter out for breakfast at denny's, then took her to Six Flag Marine World. Had some free tickets why not use it rite? We had a great time, it was so hot but we stay there for five whole hours.

      No Doubt  Last Saturday I went to see no doubt, the very first concert I have ever gone to. It was a good ass thing I purchased parking tickets and luckily we didnt have to walk that far unlike all the others which have to walk miles away from the amphitheater. When we got into the amphithrater it was like a circus to me, so many people, so many stuff on sale, it was so exciting.   Got myself some beers and off we went to the lawn for our seats. While waiting for no doubt to come on, we stood right by these people who got into a fight, over what I did not know. But it got to a point where it was very exciting to watch, I pulled out my camera hoping to take some pictures of them, and then on second thought naw forget it, a lil voice inside my head told me not to, what if they turn and kick my ass instead what would I do then? I was a chicken, I figure they was on something because two chicks was fighting, they were just pulling each other's hair and punching each other. A few punches were to a point where I had to turn away it was so disgusting, they both were bleeding, and gosh that was nasty.   We moved towards the top and it was so cold. There were so many people out there that night. The show started at seven sharp. The first band that played, I didnt have a clue of who they were. Then blink 182, I didnt really like them, I didnt know any of their songs. Most of the time it was an associating moments for me, catching up with whats going on with friends that i havet seen in a while. I also ran into a few friends that i knew. Linda and the gang from Santa Clara, Richard and Amy from Vellejo, then I ran into Brendon and Georgette from San Jo. That was amazing, out of all the people there, I mean there were hundreds and hundreds of people but still I ran into people I knew which were totally kool. Took some picture here and there.   By the time no doubt came on, I couldnt even feel my toes and my fingers anymore, apparently, it was so cold, I wasnt just freezing I was actually frozen lol. It was a good thing Gwen Safani sang all the songs that i knew of, she sang songs from the single hits of 1997-2004. I was yelling, screaming, singing, dancing, jumping I was having such a great time. By the end of the night I think I lost my voice. Gwen was always at her best, she looks so incredibly good. Gosh, I love this bitch. We stay until her very last song, didnt want to get caught in traffic so we took off even before it was over. The show was great, we had one hell of a time, it was so fun. I'll do it again next time for sure....  Didnt get home until 11 somthing, then got ready to go clubbing at 1015. We didnt get in until 1am. We made it for ALCOHOL. Took two shots of remy, then I had an LC, yeak, then had a bottle of beer, I was good. While bumping and grinning, shaking my ass on the dance floor, this white chick came up to me and said you are one beautiful chick, very beautiful, I like you. Then she star at me from head to toe twice. I was like thankyouverymuch with a friendly hug then she totally grabs my ass. I was like whoa sugah. That came to my surprise. The club was cool but I was so tired. Dance for an hour, meet up with more friends by two thirty I was floored. It was boring to me, other times I would have so much fun but this time, I sat and watch everyone else dance, hving a great time. Left the club at three something, got home before four, shower and just crash.

      Late Nite Dessert  Lately I found myself going to Yummy Guide very often, not just to bring back memories but to flirt with my favorite desserts. I would order the same thing every time and all the time, Homemade Sesame dumplings and grass jelly ice. Its so weird that now I talk to my desserts before I eat them. Stupidity, but yeah I do that a lot now, matter of fact I have shallow conversations with everything that I eat and even clothes and shoes too. Don't ask me why, I cant explain.

      Do I really want to know this?  Yesterday I got my fortune told. Was it something I want to know? Gee, I don't even know. Everything seems to be pretty exciting for me because I do want to know, I want a path,  I mean destiny is mine and I can do what ever I want and how ever I want to my life because I control it. But all I needed was someone to guide me there and tell me that I am doing the right thing.   Monk Saran was very nice and very kind. He didn't make a big deal even if I didn't know how to speak proper Cambodian nor do I know how to speak monk. It was pretty hard for me but I managed it. He told me that my future looks great. I don't have to worry about it and that he doesn't have to say much. I'll be very successful within the next two to three years. Just have to keep in mind set on my goals and stay focus on what I really want to do and stay strong. This is business wise.   As for my love life... He told me that there is no one out there who can control me because I'm the wild one. I'm always the one that's always messing around with everything and everyone. The one that I'm planning on the start a family with is rite next to me and that I don't have to look for him anymore. This guy is the one I'll choose to be my soulmate and I will always be the boss to this person. I'll always be the lead which is good. I just have to be nice to this person and not talk so much shit. He said that I'm a shit talker and that I need to stop doing that if I want things to work out. I also need to stop pushing and stop avoiding him and start looking at the right direction.  The in-laws... my family and his family wont get along because his family is very strike and very tradition. We're looking at two different class rite now. One will look very low at the other. But all of this doesn't matter as long as this future guy can manage to maintain working things out with me we'll do just fine. The monk also told me that I am the type of person who doesn't like anyone looking down at me under any circumstances. I will work my way up to the very top and they'll respect me and see me as a somebody. But then again the love will by past everything.  Alyssia... she'll do just fine... I'll be very proud of this girl. She'll be very smart and very successful. She'll have a better life then her mommy will.   Having more kids.. one or two more if I desire.   He had said so much more but I'll cut it down short. I don't have to worry about my life, I'll do just find. Now, I'm just very excited, I'm gonna go for whats been plan for. I'm going for it and this time no turning back. I need to hold on and look straight towards my target. I'm happy that this is something very positive that I want to know..

      Confession   Last nite was the best time of my life, you pleasured me so well, I didnt want to leave, and I didnt want to stop. You make me feel so good, you make me wanna rock side to side, you make me wanna shake alil harder and torch alil harder. I must admit that it was the most in creditable nite of my life.  I was singing, I was dancing in the shower, I was so happy. Just bought myself a little portable radio and placed it in the shower. Now, every time I hit the shower I get to listen to music too. Music that makes me wanna do so much but Ill leave that up to imaginations.

      What ever happen in Vegas Stays in Vegas  May 28, 2004 @ 9:45 am The digital alarm clock went off, eyes wide open with a huge smile on my face check the time 6 am. OMG, Im gonna miss the flight. Rush out of bed, ran straight towards the rest room, hop in the shower, got dress, check the time 8am. SHIT, I swear I was only in there for like 15 mins. Storm out of the house, down the stairs, into the car, drove out the drive way. Turn back to look for my luggage, damnit I left it at home. Ran out of the car knowing that the keys were in there and ran up the stairs grab my luggage and dash down the stairs and into the car again. Check the time 8:55 am, call me blonde but I have just missed my flight to las vegas. I got out of the car ran in circles and said to myself what should I do what should I do?   The alarm went off 6am, I woke up in fears, and I had to run around the house to check every single clock to make sure I wasnt dreaming anymore. My heart was pounding like a racing popcorn popping machine. Shower, got dress, check luggage check, shoes check, clothes check, toothpaste and toothbrush check. Got everything okay Im ready to roll. 7am picked up a couple of friends and off we went to Oakland airport.   The coolest thing about purchasing tickets online is that there are no waiting in line to clam your tickets. You go to this e ticket electronic machine (which looks like an atm machine btw), stick your credit card in, pop up a menu option and print your ticket. Cool huh?   Got on the plane Im so exhausted.  Last nite was the hardest part of all time, I was tossing and turning, I was too excited to go to sleep, I had to take a nite quil so I could knock myself out. I slept like a baby. Maybe that was the reason why I had that stupid dream. I am on the plane right now!!! Gosh, I cant wait to get to get to Vegas, its gonna be so much fun, its gonna be one hell of a trip Ill tell ya that. Let me just go crazy with the girl and party our ass off and forget our stupid problems. Those days are over baby. I heard the weather is gonna be real nice in vegas, in the 90. Which is perfect for me because all I packed was shorts and tank tops, outrageous clothes, skimpy clothes oh ya know what I mean. 30 mins to go until we hit the soil of vegas. I cant wait to enjoy the nice warm weather and check out guys that I dont even know.    May 30, 2004 @ 4:57 pm OMG, hang over hang over damnit, my headache wont go away.   YesterdayFriday..28th of May.. We arrive at the airport took the taxi to Treasure Island, unpack and went out to eat. Then we walked around the strip the whole day. After walking for about five whole hours we return to the hotel, rest and got ready for dinner. We ate at Cesars steak house then went to palms RAIN in the Dessert. The club was cool, they played hip hop, techno, it was a mixed crowd, guys there were fine fine fine.    We gather everyone up and just drank, one shot after another within 30 mins we had like four shots already total. I was feeling alil tipsy. We dance on the center stage with water surrounding us where everyone in the club can see us, we were crazy that caught a lot of attention. Every now and then there would be these flame that pop out of no where from the ceiling like a fireball it was one amazing show.. While we were dancing, I spotted this guy across the water he had his eyes hooked on me and he kept toasting his drinks at me. He was pretty darn cute, an asian guy alrite Sakdary He wore this black banana republic short sleeve button up shirt dark blue jeans with dress shoes. I was totally ignoring the other guys that have asked me to dance.   I walked off to the bar and there he was asking me for my permission if he could buy me a drink. I didnt understand why a handsome guy like him would even look at a girl like me. I mean I was hanging out with girls who have large nice beautiful breast, very attractive who were models and strippers and me, I didnt have anything to flash we were talking for awhile, his name was Joshua, from santa cruz, he seems to be very nice, and he was a great dancer. I thought to myself this is vegas of course everyone is gonna be nice just to get laid. We dance for awhile and he gave me his room number and his phone number. I took it and toss it away at the end of the night.     The girls and I didnt leave the club until 5 am, got to the hotel slept until 9am, got ready for the new day.. Walked around the strip again then ran into Josh. I try to ignore him by running off but he followed me. We talked for a lil bit he told me to call him then we split. Later on that night we went to mirage, had dinner and did alil gambling. Then ran into josh again. Dude, why cant I get away from this guy? I swear vegas is a huge place, is he stalking me? This time he wont go away damnit. So we all decided to go clubbing together. Opium was the club, it was jumping. Some how josh wanted to get close but every time he moved too close I move away. We party until 5 am again. After that nite I didnt see josh anywhere around again. Which was great and thats how I wanted it.    Sunday May 30, 2004 @ 4:45 pm Woke up this morning, packed got ready to check out. Leaving the hotel room and walked towards the elevator. Got down stairs and guess who have been waiting for me in front of the elevator JOSH,.. What on earth was he thinking? Didnt he get the clue from last nite? We end up having breakfast together and went shopping. Some guys just dont get it do they? We went to Hawaiian palace, it was nice, and it was beautiful. I was looking at these beautiful pink diamond bracelet but I couldnt afford it because I had lost all my money to the damn slots..it was a hundred I figured I can do a lot more to a hundred then getting the bracelet.   Josh asked me if I liked it and I said of course I do but its too expensive for me to buy. I walked away and look at some other stuff. Josh came back with the bracelet in his hand.. This should have been the part where I should kiss the guy but instead I kept telling him I cant take it I cant take it. it was sweet of him to get something so expensive for me. I try to refuse but he said this is something that you wanted and I see it in your eyes, wore the bracelet for me and said beautiful piece of jewelry goes together with a beautiful lovely woman like yourself then kissed my hand. At that point my heart melted, I didnt know what to say.   My time in Vegas was up I had to head out to the airport. Josh walked me and another girlfriend to the airport then we split. All I gave was a hug and a kiss on the cheek. I have his number and all but I dont think I want to call this guy.. Hes too fine for me. He might be a player and break my heart. I dont want to take that risk. Im not going to call him, Im gonna loose his number after I leave Vegas. Overall the trip was great, I drank so much nite and day, it didnt really matter because all I had to pay for each drinks are like a dollar. Gambling was cool and all but I realized that Sunday wasnt my night to gamble. I had so much fun!!! that was just what I really needed. Lets just keep it that way...for nowuntil next year

      WTF  Walking toward my car last Friday, I felt&nbsp;my heart just drop straight to the ground.&nbsp;Some stupid ass dofin broke into my car while being parked at school.&nbsp;The front passager window was SMASH. Stupid Muther Fucking ass took my whole stereo, some speakers, and the whole consol. I was so disappointed until now.   Now I have to run errands here and there seeking for a high estimate for my car. I'm gonna try to pocket as much as I possibly can. If I&nbsp;EVER find out who did this, I'm gonna take him down. Forreals..........

      It's Party Time  This post was written 07/18/2004 @ 5:30 am.  Went out with the girls to club Q. The club itself was really cool. I heard it was so ghetto and all but I actually liked it alot. Altho there wasnt many HOT looking guys. To me they were all HongKongnees boyz... Here and there I would get holla at but you know me, I dont dance with strangers @ clubs. I had to use stupid lame ass excuse  for the guys to get off my back. Such as my boyfriend is here or I am married. One dude was so disappointed he beg me to say goodbye to him three times before the left.   Partying with the girls was really awesome. The camera man kept taking pictures of us. God knows how many time but oh well. The photographer said that he loved our smiles and couldnt get enough and also enter me in a beauty pageant. Wow!!! ME? Beauty Pageant??? I dont know about that. Overall it was an amazing night. Oh not to mention we met E-A-SKI, a group of  rape singers from Oakland.   By two, none of us wanted to go home so we all decided to go to 1015, drop and I was so fuckin high. Dude I was farting like crazy, it was one hell of a stank bomb. Didnt get home until 4:30 am. I wasnt tired at all. Funny of me, I am still peeking but I am doing homework & watching music box. I must admit that I can study better while I'm still high... What a trip huh.  Gosh, I only drop half but i'm still feeling it right now. It feels so relaxing. Humm, what should I talk about? I know lets talk about college of cosmetology!!! My second week have just pasted, I'm having so much fun, so far I am doing really well. Practical and written. The boss really like my work alot. He's got a job offer for me already in Vacaville, $3000 a month and thats not including tips. That's not I'm interested in tho. What i'm interested in is Traveling. Yep, I want to travel to do people's nails. Sounds like fun huh? I'm looking forward into making "BIG MONEY". We have testes every week, so far I'm getting B's but B's isnt what I'm aiming for. I want an "A", I want everything 100%. B isnt so bad but I'm not satisfied, I have very high tolerance.   Every one of my friends tell me that I have a very high confident self esteem in me for doing what i've been wanting to do. Yeah, thats me. If I want it then I would go for it. If I dont want it you cant force me. Everything has to be my way or no way at all. That's SAKDARY. Better recognize fool... lol...  Six am and i'm still up not even tired fuck. Chewing gum like I never had gum before. Sucking on my finger like a fuckin baby sucking on a pacifier. Inhaling vicks vaporade like a dofin. Drinking water like I have never had water before.   A Cinderella Story= Hillary Duff is so fine, "Our lips are sealed" is such a great song. I love it.  Damn the sun is up and I havent gotten any sleep yet. Tho I am not tired hopefully later on I will be. Alrite ya, I'm going to return to studying and bobbing my head to the music and sniffing vaporade. Ha ha ha lol.. Sakdary is such a fucken E-Tard....

      Here's A Question for Everyone  There's this little pond, in the middle of this pond grows a lotus. The lotus grows bigger and bigger each day. In three days it covers half the sizes of the pond. Can anyone guess how many more days it takes for this lotus to grow to cover up the entire pond???

      I Hate Being Emotional  Who in the world understand feelings? Yesterday, I found out that another person was involved and I started to get so aching about this all of a sudden. Somehow emotions took over and possessed my mind into another dimension making me feel so jealous. I dont want to feel this way but the thought of someone taking over hurts. It leads my mind into thinking of all the odds. I feel that it is so difficult to control my emotions, my feelings. I dont want to feel this way nor do I want to go through this alone. I hate the fact of knowing that there is someone else.

      I Want To RELAX  First week of school, I am learning so much, I was having so much fun and I am making many friends. But now I am so exhausted. Tired to read. Tired to study. Tired to even think. Instructor has been so hard on me. I have class from tues-sat. Damnit, one more day to go CRAP. I want to go out and party damnit.   I heard that club IBIZA has a grand opening this Sat. Which is so cool, its the home boyz b-day, their renting a room and we'll have our own DJ. Good luck to anyone who will try to look for me that night. If you dont have connections you'll never find me. It's my time to have fun. I'm so gonna party until I drop. Shake what your mama gave you hehhehehhehe....

      I woke up screaming Nooooo....  The worst part of waking up from a nightmare is waking up to a cold loneliness bed with no one to hold when you are scared.

      Fahrenheit 9/11  Saw the movie today and it was soooo boring!!! It was based on Bush and how what we called War all started. It was a film documentary and the relationships between Bush and the Enemies Allies. I mean it was interesting to learn about what happen, it was sad but it was a disgrace. It makes me hate Bush even more, what a dumb ass president, what an idiot. I cant wait for the new election in November. I strongly encourage people to see this movie and not be a dumb fuck to vote for this selfish man again. He has put too many people lives in danger not to mention he also cheated to become president. So people, beware of who you vote for....
