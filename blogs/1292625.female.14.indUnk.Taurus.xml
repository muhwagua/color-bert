I can't stand to fly  I'm not that naive  Men weren't meant to ride  With clouds between their knees   I'm only a man in a silly red sheet  Digging for kryptonite on this one way street  Only a man in a funny red sheet  Looking for special things inside of me   It's not easy to be me. [Dina Rea:] Mmmhh   [Eminem:] You high baby?   [Dina Rea:] Yeahh...   [Eminem:] Yeah?   [Dina Rea:] hahaha..Talk to me...   [Eminem:] You want me to tell you somethin?   [Dina Rea:] Uh huh...   [Eminem:] I know what you wanna hear... 'Cuz I know you want me baby I think I want you too...   [Dina Rea:] I think I love you baby...   [Eminem:] I think I love you too... I'm here to save you girl, Come be in shady's world, I wanna grow together, Let's let our love unfurl. You know you want me baby, You know I want you too, They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you, I wanna save you girl, come be in Shady's world...   [Dina Rea:] oh boy you drive me crazy...   [Eminem:] Bitch you make me hurl...   [Eminem:] They call me Superman, Leap tall hoes in a single bound, I'm single now, Got no ring on this finger now, I'll never let another chick bring me down, In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? you make me sick, Superman aint savin shit, girl you can jump on shady's dick, Straight from the hip, cut to the chase, I'll tell a mo'fuckin slut to her face, Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face, I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask? Kiss my dick, hit my cash, i'd rather have you whip my ass, Don't put out? i'll put you out, Won't get out? i'll push you out, Puss blew out, copin shit, Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out, Am I too nice? buy you ice, Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life, What you tryin to be, my new wife? What you Mariah? fly through twice, But I do know one thing though, Bitches they come, they go, Saturday through sunday monday, Monday through sunday yo, Maybe i'll love you one day, Maybe we'll someday grow, Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe...   [Chorus:] 'Cuz I can't be your superman, Can't be your superman, Can't be your superman, Can't be your superman, I can't be your superman, Can't be your superman, Can't be your superman,  Your superman, your superman...   [Eminem:] Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes, It's no secret, Everybody knows, Can't we fuck? Bitch so what? That's about as far as your buddy goes, We'll be friends, I'll call you again, I'll chase you around every bar you attend, Never know what kind of car i'll be in, [Woman Screaming] We'll see how much you'll be partying then, You don't want that,  Neither do I, I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys, Too much pride, Between you and I, Not a jealous man, but females lie, But I guess that's just what sluts do, How could it ever be just us two? Never loved you enough to trust you, We just met and I just fucked you, But I do know one thing though, Bitches they come they go, Saturday through Sunday monday, Monday through Sunday yo, Maybe I'll love you one day, Maybe we'll someday grow, 'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe...   [Eminem & Dina Rae Over Chorus 2x]  [Eminem:] I know you want me baby, I think I want you too...   [Dina Rea:] I think I love you baby...   [Eminem:] I think I love you too, I'm here to save you girl, Come be in shady's world, I wanna grow together, Lets let our love unfurl, You know you want me baby, You know I want you too, They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you, I wanna save you girl, Come be in shady's world...   [Dina Rea:] Oh boy you drive me crazy...   [Eminem:] Bitch you make me hurl.   [Eminem:] First thing you said...   [Eminem As Women:] I'm not phazed, I hang around big stars all day, I don't see what the big deal is anyway, You're just plain ol' Marshall to me...   [Eminem:] Ooh yeah girl run that game...   [Eminem As Women:] Haily Jade...I love that name, Love that tattoo...what's that say? 'rot in pieces' aww that's great...   [Eminem:] First off you don't know Marshall, Add also, don't grow partial, That's ammo for my arsenal, I'll snap you off that bar stool, There goes another lawsuit, Leave handprints all accross you, Good lordy-wody you must be blown off that water bottle, You want what you can't have, Ooh girl that's too damn bad, Don't touch what you can't grab, End up with two back hands, Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand, Girl you just blew your chance, Don't mean to ruin your plans, But I do know one thing though, Bitches they come they go, Saturday through Sunday Monday, Monday through Sunday yo, Maybe I'll love you one day, Maybe we'll someday grow, 'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe...   [Eminem & Dina Rae Over Chorus 2x]  [Eminem:] I know you want me baby, I think I want you too...   [Dina Rea:] I think I love you baby...   [Eminem:] I think I love you too, I'm here to save you girl, Come be in Shady's world, I wanna grow together, Lets let our love unfurl, You know you want me baby, You know I want you too, They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you, I wanna save you girl, Come be in shady's world...   [Dina Rea:] Oh boy you drive me crazy...   [Eminem:] Bitch you make me hurl.   [Chorus 2x B/W Dina Rea Singing]

      Kay. Think what ever ya wanna think. I don't kiss ass to Willamson i just think she is really nice so I treat her the same way she treats me. If you dissagree go talk to her. I'm not saying that the prizes were evenly distributed eg look at slim. I also thought u were really good on the film... way better than me but maybe Willamson prefered my attitude towards the subject than your's. I'm not tryin to say 'U SUX',  not that quite on the contrray. Anyway sorry... it's not my fault.... I REALLY LIKE DRAMA it is the subject I am least bad at.... so I try mi best (although in the film I was not at my best). Everyone says that I stole the Drama prize from them but I didn't give it to my self.... Some people just claimed that the prize was their's and I robbed it.... how do these peps wanna make mi feel... I didn't give it to myself. Ne way some peps said that the prize was theirs and I just took it that is simply WRONG to say........... The prize is everyone's cause we all like drama and we all try hard....  Ow well if peps r jealous not mi fault (not saying that u r, or ne shit. I'm reffering to the class in general)  Lot of love Luv mi  Le Duke of le grand tampon

      bells just for u to know a lil backround info. becuase in one of ur messages u anctually really offened me and lu by calling us weak willed! thomas never tried to make us not talk to u ok he can't monipulate us that easily ok!! me and lu have strong heads we know what to do. If for one dat we weren't talking to u it was 1) we didn't feel like talking to u 2) we were anoyed with something that happend between us 3) we just felt like talking  or 4) we were talking to some1 else ok gald that was straitened out g'night sleep tight and all that crap xx
