       NEWater   Ok, that's just gross.   Another potentially gross thought:   What if atype of body fluid found in the pool is excreted by guys only?? (a la the movie 'y tu mama tambien'??) now that's NEWater with added nutrients in it.  Ever thought why the pool juice tastes salty? You can thank those who decided to blow their noses or clear their throats when they're swimming.

      Woo Hoo...and the weekend has just did its infamous disappearing act once more.... Here's my thought for the day (came up with it awhile ago..) Went for the Splash fest mass swim just now...whilst swimming, incidentally ingested a couple of gulps of pool juice...and this thought crosses my mind: Man, I'm like swimming in NEWater!!!! (get it? The pee and all other human excretions and body fluids coupled with good ol' tap water)  Yech.

       More Useless Information   Something new i learnt on fri. How to make soda lime or lime soda... (does it actually matter??)  Recipe: A  LOT  of soda.  A  BIT  of lime concentrate.  You wouldn't want to try soda lime that was 1/4 lime concentrate and 3/4 soda.

       Clarification regarding the 'annoying neighbor' saga   With reference to the previous news about the attendant wanting to open the door with the master key, well, that information was inaccurate. It seems that Mdm Wong, after knocking repeatedly, wanted to unlock the door but found the door to be already unlocked. [gasp!] However, since she couldn't go in by herself (may be due to regulations & privacy), she asked this writer's roommate to be the witness. However, when she came back to the door, she found the door to be locked, which was impossible unless someone was already in the room but refused to open the door.  Seems that BU was dumber than it was thought originally.   Updates: As of last night, Mr BU and his Ms are still living together in the room. One wonders how long before they'll get into another mess again.....

       something on a similar note....   was walking ard halfnaked in my shorts at PGP (not black undies, besides, my fav color is blue)... to the toilet to bathe.... when this gal suddenly appeared from the pantry (which is located beside the toilet for some obscure architectural reason which evades my common knowledge of hygiene)... wld have walked rite into her if not for my superhuman reflexes n dextirity (who noes if dat was the true purpose of her diabolical plan??)  both of us got a fright when we saw each other (for different reasons i shld guess... me, for seeing a gal appearing from behind a wall in a place where only guys ar allowed... her, for seeing erm... well, i wldnt noe wat features gals notice abt halfnaked guys 1st)  anyway, after recovering from our respecive initial shocks, both of us juz side-stepped each other n went abt our own business... me to shower... her, to ambush another unsuspecting male??  on hindsight, im beginning to tink dat i may have been on the losing end of this encounter, considering dat the gal isnt dat chio.... not dat im cute myself, but hey, i was the victim caught in a state of undress here!  wunder wat wld happen if i went lurking ard the female levels n bumped into one in her underwear?  hmm......

       COMMENTARY   This writer would like to add that she's VERY Glad that BU was caught. She's sick and tired of having to look at BU (the item, and not the man) hanging on the hook in her bathroom.  Future improvements to be expected: 1) No BU in sight 2) No pubic hair lying all over the floor 3) Possibly a new neighbor(?) [one can only hope..]  This writer woud like to say that her dislike for BU and Co stems not from intolerance of neighbors, but from the general inconsiderate behaviour that she has had to put up with ever since the start of the school year. She has no complaints about neighbors who let their respective boyfriends co-habitate as long as they do not infringe on anyone's privacy ie no walking in the bathroom with just underwear, thus, making both himself and the neigbor uncomfortable. Actually, the writer's dislike is not so much for BU but for his Ms, due to incidents (mentioned in previous postings) that occurred.

       BLACK UNDIES CAUGHT   Latest development in the 'annoying neighbor' saga.......  Today, hall officers caught Mr Black Undies, henceforth to be called BU, in the room without the presence of his female counterpart. The incident occurred at approximately 9.45am when hall attendant, let's call her Mdm Wong, came round to hand hostel forms to hostelites. She was persistently pounding on abovementioned neighbor's door but still no reply. After handing the forms to this writer and her roommate, she asked said writer's roommate to witness that she was going to open the door using the master key, but however, found the door to be latched from the inside. This meant that someone was inside! After not being able to deny his existence (cos BU was too dumb to hide in the bathroom and let Mdm Wong come in), he opened it and she handed in the form. After complaining a little to this writer's roommate (about a guy being in the room, not allowed, blah blah blah), she promptly went to the hall office to let the officer know about it.   [here comes the fun part]  Hall officer, A, knocked on the door and gave BU a good, and well-deserved lecture about how guys aren't allowed in female hostel room. (This writer couldnt' get the full conversation cos if she were to stand at the door, that would be too blatant. So the best she could do was to eavesdrop from the vicinity of her own room) Officer A wanted letters to be written by both Mr and Ms BU, who wasn't in the room at the time. Also mentioned that complaints have been made about the room regarding illegal squatters, MALE illegal squatters, that is. (This writer assumes it might have been the roommate who moved who lodged the complaint, cos it couldn't have been the writer herself.) Lecturing continued for about 15-20 mins, which is heck of a long time, cos BU was trying to explain himself. Officer A was joined by Officer B soon after. (The writer knows this cos she couldn't resist taking a peek. This was done tastefully by throwing out the garbage) The entire lecture was in essence about illegal squatters, letters that need to be written, threats of barring Ms BU from staying in halls, and the absurdity of the situation cos BU said that Ms BU gave him the key before she went to class and that he had never stayed there before. Luckily, Hall officers A & B had enough brains to know that the story was a load of Bull.   to be continued....

       Today' s General Knowledge Program, proudly brought to you by the b***h of rant: Do You Know this???   Topic of interest: Ear hair and Nose hair (since we remain on the topic of head hair and pubic hair, we shall continue... haha)  Well, how does it arise for old men - the ah peks with the wobbly walking canes? Basically, it's a manifestation of the law of conservation of hair. When males were young, the manly fluid filled their whole being, but as they got older a lot of it boiled off. By now it doesn't even reach the bottom of the old brainpan. The sad result is that hair grows in their nose and ears rather than on top of their head. The plus side is that they can now watch Pocahontas with the grandkids without thinking, "Whoa, nice rack."  Some findings: ( Excessive hair is called hypertrichosis. ( Even less is known about hairy noses than hairy ears. ( The tragus is the pointy projection on the front side of your ear opening. Interestingly, tragus can also mean any of the hairs growing at the entrance to the ear. So I guess what most old men get is a bad case of tragus on the tragus. (i.e, hair growing on front of ear) (I bet hair on the tragus is what's really important, since smart men have it too, like Einstein..geez, was he hairy or what? figure it, the amount on his head's a pretty good gauge.. (You can get hairy ears as a result of using minoxidil (some hair growth tonic) and, boy, does it look gross. DO NOT TRY UNLESS YOU WANT HAIRY EARS, BUT HOWEVER, A HAIRY CHEST NOT UNLIKE DR. EVIL(yummy....) and AUSTIN POWERS IS VERY WELCOME~~~~ ( Some great mind is going to have to do a lot of this work over if we're going to come to any firm conclusions about ear and nose hair. ( But it's not going to be me.  This one's to make up for the weekend. Plus website of the week:  urlLink Mummies!

       Today's General Knowledge Program, proudly brought to you by the b***h of rant: Do You Know this???   If dieting was anything on your minds....how many calories are there in the average male ejaculation?  Answer: Start by assuming that male ejaculate is roughly equivalent in nutritional composition to raw egg white (a safe assumption, and bloody well tastes the same, SO I"M TOLD!!!!  =0) Heh Heh Heh ). The normal size egg is about 35 cubic centimeters in volume and contains about 14 calories and 3 grams of protein. the normal size ejaculation is about 5 cubic centimeters, or one-seventh the volume of an egg white; figure it, therefore, to contain about one-seventh the nutrients--approximately 2 calories and .1 gram of protein. Of course, you'll have to adjust those figures if you're talking about Jumbo Size (eggs, that is)......  Ah, the thirst for knowledge--it knows no bounds......happy dieting, folks!

        Hostel life as I see it: A Tale from One who Has stayed for 2 years and is Still living it out  1) greatest risk - pple with peculiar habits to the left, right, down (below) and with you...what peculiar habits, one might ask:  > playing extremely loud ear-drum busting music, the kind that forces your poor already overworked heart to throb along with the beat until a heart attack is the next thing on your mind > Watching football/soccer/ESPN in the middle of the f***ing night and shouting like jaybirds to every goal or goal-attempt > Splashing people with water, smacking their groins into pillars, rubbing cake into facial crevices as a birthday tribute  2) Late nights - work begins at midnight. Sleeping at 2 am is a LUXURY. Being able to sleep in quiet and peace is an even rarer commodity.   3) Bugs, creepy-crawlies of varieties possibly not yet recorded in the Museum and Guiness Book of Insects and Insectoids: - worms with wings - bugs that are orange in color - bugs that look like bees and dragonflies at the same time - bugs that don;t fear humans; only the spray gun - bugs that don't die - bugs that keep returning  TO BE CONTINUED....

       I'm BAAACK   helooooooooooooooo.. i am back, after being MIA for the past week or so. And back by popular demand.....  [Loud voice]  HALL LIFE PART 5   Juicy news coming from Hall 1!   Toilet mate (heh, only in NTU do you get a term called "toilet mate") has moved out! Why? I dunno, but p'haps might be due to the presence of Mr Black Undies. She cleaned out her room last night... and now, Mr and Ms Black Undies have the room to themselves. Heard him in the morning (about 5am) when i woke up. Hahaha.. I think he was bathing or cleaning, I dunno and I frankly don't care. I was tempted to open the bathroom door and scare the shit out of him, but decided not to embarrass myself at the same time.   Toilet is free of hair (from all places) at the moment. ;p  Wildlife status so far: A wasp flew in on Monday morning. It landed on the light fixture and I hit it with a broom after which I couldn't find it anymore. So, I suspect that at this moment, there's a dead wasp somewhere in the room. It can't be alive cos I've not heard it buzzing around. Window is still free from nests of any kind. Thank god for that.   And that's it for HALL LIFE PART 5 [voice fades]

Wld make refreshing debate in parliament abt setting up a new nature reserve, instead of quibbling over price hikes... which occurs regardless of the debates anyway.

       Hall Life part 4   Icky stuff that can occur when staying in an NTU hall.  Firstly, you have horrid neighbors.  Secondly, you have animals that make a home on ur window sill. Yup.. my life isn't going very well nowadays. Just found a huge (well, to me it is) wasp nest on my window. So nicely tucked away, hidden from sight that i wouldn't have noticed it if i didn't happen to look up at my window on my way out. So, decided to spray the insects living in the nest before i knocked down the structure. Now, my corridor smells of insecticide. And guess who helped me clean my mess up? Surprise, surprise, it's my toilet neighbor's boyfriend. Yup, it's mr black undies. Nice enough to offer his help cos he was taking a cigarette break. So back to the insects, I've got remnants of the mud walls on my window pane. WIll have to remove it when i'm more awake. Totally gross.

       NEIGHBORS!   ugh.. neighbors can be such pleasant ppl if u get the right ones... it's really unfortunate if you are stuck with neighbors whom u share a bathroom with. i hate my neighbors.. i really do. i washed the toilets today at 12.30am!! yup, that's right, in the middle of the friggin' night. why, u might ask.. well, it's because, some lame-brained neighbor was either eating in the loo or squashed a bug which attracted a whole generation of red ants to gather round the poor creature or morsel of food. And guess what? They had no sense, ABSOLUTELY no sense to clean the mess up. Not only that, the whole bathroom is littered with hair. Hair from up there, hair from down there... All over the friggin place. They use the shower area and wash their hair. But they don't remove the hair that gathers round the drain and they let it gather, gather and gather some more. Maybe hoping to start a hair exhibition or something. They aren't like Rumplestiltskin who can turn straw to gold. That's head hair, pls don't get me started on pubic hair. Gosh.. how can pubic hair be found near the sink and not in the toilet bowl is beyond my comprehension. What do they do? Scratch themselves silly in the bathroom??? The floor is littered with pubic hair man.. Obviously not as much as head hair, but it's enough to spot when u're standing and not even scrutinising the damn floor. They use up all your toilet roll. I actually have to hide my stash of loo roll cos they use up 1 roll for every 2 days, unless it's their roll that they are using, then it'd wld last longer.. Bunch of freeloaders.. Is it just a typical singaporean thing? Must i stick posters on the wall to remind users to keep the toilet clean? It's supposed to be second nature. Be considerate. Keep the bathroom clean, cos there ain't no maid to do the cleaning everyday. We are in Uni for goodness sake. Where have all the manners gone? All those courtesy campaigns have not done any good at all. UGH.

       Book Review   hahaa... yucks.... no more gross discussions pls... okok... book review time.... dats IF u ppl have anytime for books other than those u muz mug for exams...  u guys heard of Leon Uris? well, the gd news is hes dead, so its actually possible to catch up n  finish reading all his werks in a limited period of time... not like crichton n sheldon or some other crappy author who writes a new bk every 2 yrs. so, wat does Uris write? basically all his bks ar novels based upon actual historical settings... from the irish struggle of independence... to the ill-fated battle of Gallipoli... n the holocaust.  a gd bk to start wif wld be Redemption (abt irish migrants in New Zealand n the IRA), but neva ever start wif Ruins of God (or isit God of Ruins) cos dats really the last bk he wrote b4 he dieded n it aint as gd as the rest. other werks include Exodus abt the jewish plight in the middle east from 1890s all the way to 1970s... The Haj (on the same topic but from the arab pt of view)... Trinity (if i remember correctly, a sequel to Redemption)... Mila 18 (abt jews surviving the holocaust in a polish ghetto)... QBVII (the most provocative of his bks in my opinion, abt whether the perpetrators of the holocaust were forced into the act of exterminating jews by circumstances).... hmm... dats abt all his bks i remember reading i guess... not often u learn abt history n geopolitics while enjoying a novel ya noe...  happy reading dancing-moon n jester!  =)

       Two cents worth (or any amount you wanna pay for wat i'm saying now)   Brilliant discussion we're having now.... Just gonna nitpick on a coupla stuff.  1) What has tears overflowing from ur eyes got to do with mucus? I thought mucus was the icky green stuff (the color of TJC uniform) tt flows frm the nose (or dose, if u have a cold)? Well, if you're like me, the stupid stuff is just stuck somewhere in the deep recesses of my nose.   2) btw, fluke, it's   LESTER   and not JESTER.   3) Dust, dust!     Clean the house, i must!     OOh, brad pitt, how i lust!     Know wat i need? a bigger bust!  A short poem abt dust, and watever word that rhymes with it. :) I'm the next yeats...

       The good thing abt sweat n mucus... =/   Perspiration, otherwise known as sweat, is one of many mechanism utilised by the body in the process of homeostasis... ie maintenance of a constant internal bodily environment. wat does sweat do? to keep body temp constant. y we need a constant body temp? cos enzymes function optimally at a temp of 37 C. y do we need enzymes? cos we... oops... out of pt... anyway... sweat when evaporating from the skin removes latent heat from the surface of the body, dats y dogs pant so much... saliva evaporating from the tongue removes latent heat from their bodies which cant sweat.. which explains y dogs have such long tongues, erm, dats if u believe me ;) no sweat means ur body gets hot... which means all ur enzymes cld be destroyed... which means u start frothing at the mouth, aphyxiate n ur muscles go into spasms... then u die after ALOT of pain... hmm... or did i mix it up wif how u die after eating potassium cyanide?  so wat does mucus do?? dat depends on where the mucus is coming from... the mucus lining ur trachea n bronchus or the tears overflowing from ur eyes into the tear ducts.  in my not so professional opinion, based upon a negligible amt of experience in the medical community, i wld say dat jester or watever he calls him/herself actually suffers from the latter. so y does ur eyes keep producing so damn much water they cld eventually be a new source of water for singapore?? cos its trying to unclog the drainage system of ur eyes n nose n get rid of watever irritant has entered ur breathing apparatus... probly an allergic reaction to pollen n/or dust... which leads us to the next question... Wat Good does Dust do???

       URGGGH RUNNY DOSE   haha and here's a bad way to start your holidays: a runny dose too! runny doses spoilt everything: first days at school, first days of vacation, first days at work.. what the heck first days of everything. everything that happens in your body has a purpose you say? runny doses don't quite do anything for anybody... in fact, mucus comes close to being the most useless bodily discharge i can think of (with the exception of puke). Come to think of it, getting anything out of your body should be a pleasant experience. crapping provides instant relief, sweating cools you down (apparently, but someone tell me how that works), but yet again i find no joy in blowing my dose. It has to be the most joyless purging process of the body (with the exception of puke again). Its likely that this is how our bodies invent mechanisms to counter these joyless purging processes. Sniffing gives you the instant high and tissue-less response to nose blowing. Choking stops you from talking with your mouth full. See everything has a purpose to add joy (ok so choking isnt that pleasant) to the mundane routines we subject ourselves to (of course, choking on your own puke doesn't count. you're hopeless if that happens to you on a regular basis). Well, guess that leaves us to crapping as the best option for letting anything out of our bodies. have fun people.

       A not so random musing   Horrid, distasteful and utterly gross. These words aren't enough to describe a certain club at Clarke Quay. What do you get when you put black music, lots of booze and a bunch of ' mats ' in one room? You get a place called LOX, where ass-rubbing is  the   move of the night. LOX is the place to go only if you are stone drunk, almost comatose or if you harbour a secret desire to be a pole-dancer. The dance floor was so hot, you would be exchanging body fluids with other equally sweaty people in no time at all. With strangers constantly dancing against one another, it was nearly impossible to avoid brushing against them.  All you pole-dancer wannabes, pay attention! LOX is a place for you to try out your moves. Shake that body and show them boobs.Rub your groin with a fellow dancer, be it male or female and don't forget the occasional stolen and not-so-chaste kisses as well. Throw your hands up in the air when asked to by the dj (who's da man of da night) and scream 'hey.. ho..' as often as you can.  Thirsty? Well, that $12 coupon can get you housepours. For teetotallers, I regret to inform you that your coupon only entitles you to a glass of coke. No OJ, and you can forget about asking for a Shirley Temple. This further emphasise the fact that in order to enjoy the music, one must be incredibly drunk first.  [shudder] Oh man... Gimme retro gimme bengs. I'd rather dance to synchronised steps than have to face such music again. If anyone is thinking of asking me to go LOX again, I'm gonna ask you to kiss my ass, honey.

         Font Colors To answer lester's really old question, here's a rough explanation of the hexadecimal color system, as far as I understand it. There are 6 digits in the code; 2 digits each for red, blue, and green color values. So the numbers basically define how much red, blue and green goes into the color mix. It's like in primary school where you take paint and mix different base colors to get new colors. So, your next question is, where do the letters come in, right? well, digits only go up to 9, so the letters represent values greater than 9 (like 10). Yeah. And as for the question of why can't you just type in the color name, well, guess what, you can. Have a look at  urlLink this page  to see what color names you can use.  And today's font color is: red. The moralizer appears... Now, about the things that Nephthys reviewed... no personal criticisms or condemnations are intended at all, but still, at the risk of being labled a prudish, self-righteous judge with outdated values, I shall proceed to state my personal opinion on such matters.   Firstly, I hate The Bachelor. Who would have believed that some of the women are Harvard grads and doctors and lawyers? They're just a bunch of desperadoes making fools out of themselves on TV. Furthermore, how can you possibly attempt to find a husband by going on a reality TV program? Are they serious about marrying this guy at all? Are they even considering what needs to go into a successful and stable marriage? Do they really think that the bachelor is a man of good character, considering that he's mass-dating a bunch of desperadoes and telling them sweet lies so that he can have fun with as many of them as possible? Did it ever cross these women's minds that this guy must have a substantial ego with a voracious appetite?  Secondly, Christina's new video is not hot, it's just gross. Yes, announce to the world that you're even sluttier than Britney. Have you noticed that the recent music videos involve a lot of references to mass sex orgies? In the past, we used to think that Madonna was being risqué. Now, risqué is cliché. What is the world coming to? Who wants to raise children in such a deteriorating environment?  Thirdly, no, I haven't seen SATC, but I outright reject the idea that lust outside of a stable relationship is fun and acceptable, and also that having multiple sex partners over time is good. In fact, it is very bad. If you believe in the spiritual dimension of things, every time you have sex with someone, you make a "soul tie" with them. It becomes a spiritually binding relationship. That's why you're only supposed to have sex with your spouse, because you are creating a permanently binding relationship with them. So what happens if you have multiple "soul ties" with many partners? It prevents you from developing lasting and stable relationships with anyone in the future! Of course, it's possible that accidents happen, and dead "soul ties" must be renounced to free yourself from them. But in any case, liberal, multiple-partner sex is not good for your soul, your heart or your mental health.  In conclusion, the world is in a bad, bad state. Time to get serious about where we're all going in life and what values we're gonna cling to.

           Reviews     The Bachelor   Although I admit to being a fan of reality tv, (ok, only survivor and TAR), the bachelor is the pits. The setting, 25 women vying for 1 man (TB: the Bachelor). TB is "charming, sweet, tall, handsome" yadda yadda yadda, as quoted by one of the women there. This show is even shallower than Temptation Island. Only Americans would think of producing and participating in such a show. *shudder*   Dirty - New Single by Christina Aguilera   Ok, you gotta admit, that girl has got talent. Not just to sing, but with her new single, she has shown that she is one raunchy miss. 'Dirty' is as dirty as you think it is (pardon the pun) and christina makes no apologies for it. Her video is even hotter than britney's "slave" with a skirt so short that you can see her red undies everytime she thrusts her hips towards the camera.    Sex and The City    Thanks to the creators of a lovely program called kazaa, we in singapore can now watch "Sex and the City (SATC)"! This show is refreshing and doesn't overload viewers with moral behavior, especially with regards to sex. Women have 'fuck buddies' and monogamy may be over-rated. Why look for love when lust is so much more fun?  [writer's aside: i'm not advocating such behavior, just looking from the perspective of the characters in the show]   Right, more reviews when there's actually something to review about. Till then...

         Amidst the Stress......    Amidst the stress comes more stress... well actually that isn't quite right, but i didn't know what else to say. how many of you here feel indifferent to exams? none? everyone? someone? after 2 years of it, i'm frankly quite sick of exams. the stress gets progressively lesser each year, but that isn't due to me being VERY prepared for it. NO. Actually, the stress doesn't get lesser, it just doesn't develop to a full-blown panic attack anymore.. doesn't rear it's ugly head.... doesn't manifests itself into something tangible like errr.. chewed nails. (no, i don't have that problem) (ok ok... i'll stop with the analogy)  1 paper down, 3 more to go. and what am i doing now? writing about things that have got nothing to do with Strategic Management.   preparing for exams is like running the 2.4 or any marathon. the journey sucks... some of us want to be first, or top 10% or top 15%. some of us want to remain in the middle.. while others had such a horrid journey that they want to just finish the damn thing, regardless of position and timing. the exam result slip is akin to the certificate that one receives for the napfa - gold, silver, bronze. and just like the certificate, it is worth shit when one leaves the institution. 10 years down the road, is anyone going to ask you, "so, how did you do for your napfa when you were in school?" no. i don't think anyone is going to ask that. similarly, no one is going to ask you, "so, how did you do for your first semester exams?"  despite knowing this, does it make the preparation any less important? no, it doesn't. we will still be doing this at the end of each semester, just like we would run our marathon, no matter how much we hate it.   and this, ladies and gentlemen, is the manifestation of my exam stress...

        HOW DOES THIS FONT COLOUR WORK ANYWAY   hey does every combination of letters and numbers give you a colour? we should be allowed to use english instead. makes so much more sense. like very black, unpopular pink, violent green, pukish yellow, or darker shade of grey than my pet elephant's bum. thats how i'd transpose them at least, but 3 giga cheers for heffalump! i can never play those tabs but great job anyway (did i mention i can't read those tabs either)!

         Today's font color: 00CCFF (ain't it pretty?) Actually, the whole world is going down the drain... just read the newspapers... I try not to read them too often, actually.. too depressing.  On a happier note... Whose Line is gonna be in Singapore??? when??? I wanna go see!!!!!  And, if any of you are guitar players, I am pleased to announce that the On-Line Guitar Archive (OLGA) has accepted my latest tab for posting on the net... check out my transcription of Santana's "Game of Love", featuring Michelle Branch,  urlLink here . No, I can't transcribe Santana's guitar licks yet. Will work on it after exams. But at least I got the chords down... I also have a fantastic, totally accurate, full transcription of Michelle Branch's "All You Wanted"... unfortunately, someone beat me to submitting a transcription to OLGA, so they didn't accept mine... but if anyone is interested, let me know and I can email it to ya :)

         Rights my ass.... :) i like the green (default) font color that i allocated for ppl who dunno how to change the colors of their font.  Regarding the main heading, ie, "TALES OF THE MUNDANE" sign, what type of font do you see? I used "courier", and i wanted to use a fancy font that i downloaded, but i reailsed that only my computer wld reflect the new font, but for those of you with no fancy schmancy font types d/loaded, u won't be able to see the font, and thus wld only show times new roman, or some other boring font like that.  OOh ooh, i don't quite like a dancing skeletons either, but i was in a hurry to choose a gif. will change when i've got time to browse thru all those gif websites.

Today's font color: 225522 Ah, I guess guys would never complain about seeing a gal in her underwear.. girls just have higher standards.. we complain when the guy in black underwear looks like crap and is already attached... am I right ladies?

PS2 eh? 500 bucks? is it that expensive?   haha.. i think So Close would have been better to watch than Transporter cos   1) there's 3 babes instead of just 1 2) there's 3 babes instead of just 1 3) there's 3 babes instead of just 1  ok.. i really can't think of any more good points.   ooh.. i lodged a complain against my stupid next door neighbors yesterday..

        Hypothesis: Any "blockbuster" with Shu Qi in it will be a waste of money...  Today's font color: 996699 Why did you even  consider  watching that film? Did I tell you about the hilarious meaningless strip-fest that "So Close" was? I already wasted my money on that one, and hey, it may have been more worthwhile cos they stuck to Chinese for the most part, and there were three babes with plenty of flesh flashed, so there's  no way  I'm gonna console  anyone  by watching another dumb film. Too bad, lester ;-P  No Madame Clairvoyante, I'm not getting a drum set. I am attempting to buy a PS2. Mini-TV not included.

       why everybody should watch transporter   oh another list you might say? don't shrug this off just yet. here's why you ALL should go watch the transporter:  1. to amuse yourself with shu qi's nonsensical english 2. to amaze yourself that the producers actually released the film with shu qi's nonsensical english 3. to watch all your dreams fulfilled in one movie (eg find shu qi in your car boot, tie a rope round shu qi's neck while she goes off to pee, scold shu qi for ruining your quiet morning, steal your enemy's car cos he blew yours up... awww you watch the rest) 4. to watch bruce lee's nemesis act as shu qi's father. 5. cos i wasted my $8 and i want you to waste yours too.

Right. Btw, if the font color looks horrendous, then it's because I'm just randomly making up a hex code for the color. Like the headline color for my last post was totally.. disgusting... what color is that, puce? ugh. Anyway, just for the heck of it, from now on I shall post the actual hex code of the color I'm using so you can use it too, if you like. We shall call this.. erm... "Font color of the day". How's that? hahaha....  And today's font color is... CC6699. yaay. ok. before I go let's post a comic to lighten up everyone's day.. (and please, please, don't sue me for posting the comic...

       Proud Supporter of the Monochrome Font n the Pic-less Backgrd   The absurdity of my life reached new heights yesterday while i was waiting for my fren at orchard mrt...... in the space of 5 mins, as i was standing beside a pillar, reading my copy of the newpaper, n waiting for my fren to turn up...   1st, an italian woman (who cld be french or spanish or from any western european country for dat matter) approached me to ask for directions to citibank... well, i'd have thanked my lucky stars if she looked anything like virginie leydoyen or  erm... dunno any spanish or italian actress (wld probly have accompanied her to the bank)... she was juz middle-aged wif a 8 yr old daughter in hand... the nice guy dat i am simply told her how to go to citibank...  2 mins after dat.... a chinawoman asked me how to go to wisma... after telling her dat wisma is juz 10m away from where we were standing, i promptly searched myself for any sign dat i looked like a street directory... but to no avail.....  1 min after  dat... some arabic looking man then asked me how to use his singletrip fare card dat he juz bot in the station.... i muz have almost burst out laughing then, n made him tink dat im laughing at his stupidity (but of cos, i was laughing at myself).... anyway, it confirmed my suspicions dat i din look like a street directory, but a multi-purpose handbk for tourists...

       nepthys is egyptian!! how many times muz i tell u??!   =p  Nepthys, or Nebet-Hus, is the daughter of Nut the sky goddess n Geb the earth god, is the Sister of Isis and Osiris, the Wife of Set, the desert God of storms, chaos, night, and wild nature, and with Set or Osiris, she is the Mother of Anpu, or Anubis, the funeral Priest who wears the mask of a Jackal, and whose name means "opener".  Her headdress is a cubic throne topped with a bread basket (*shrugs* im not kidding!).   She is the deity of the Harvest and Agriculture and the Moon. Like Isis, she is sometimes shown as a Falcon, and thus she probably became the Greek Goddess Hera (u noe... hercules' step-mum who keeps trying to kill hercules... knew abt her from watching the tv series). She is also probably related to the female deity Habonde or Abundance, the Bona Dea of the Witches (im sure my sec sch chinese teacher is one of them)  as if all this werent confusing enuf... she was Sets sister and wife, but was truly in love with Osiris, and she was able to trick him into conceiving a child with her, and this was accomplished by taking the form of his true wife, and their sister, Isis... eeks... INCEST!!! no wunder the son Anubis looks so ugly...  ok, so shes the wife of seth.. slept wif osiris... n also married zeus to become hera... woah... kindof a busy goddess huh?  anyway... dun u find the not-so-amazing race this season filled wif guys having broken-wrists?? really felt like breaking the neck of the son in the father-son team... n the twins ar only good at looking good... cos apparently they left their brains in their bags, which they left in the taxi, which they left... how brainless can u get??!  the 2 lawyers-cum-bitches look gd tho... esp eve.. heheh ;)

      well, since nephthys is my icq nickname, i'm assuming they would know who i am. FYI, nephthys is a greek (i think) goddess.   ahh heffalump.. piglet.. ok.. i geddit now. what i want to know is WHY?   hey.. TAR isn't that much of a bitch fest mainly cos it focuses more on intra grp dynamics ie between the partners.. ohhh. unless, you've been watching season 2. now that was a bitch fest. i think it's probably cos the participants were "media whores" (to quote some guy) so they acted for the benefit of the camera.  oh and lester, pretty cool pic u posted. How did u do it?? gotta learn, so that we can spice up this site of ours.. :)

      huh? and people would recognize you more as nephthys? (what IS that anyway?) and heffalump is not me asking do u want a lump.. duh... heffalump is an elaphant-like creature that Piglet was afraid of, but he dug a big hole and caught one (if I remember that story correctly).. geddit rite.. cochon bleu/piglet/heffalump...(ok you have to know french to understand what cochon bleu is) "I am a seething mass of contradictions" to quote CK in his contradiction ad... heheh... oh dear. this bolg is bad for my sanity and my reputation.  And just for the record, I think TAR is just another bitch-fest. I guess that's why reality shows are appealing rite... *grins*

       The Amazing Race   Ok.. ok.. i'm a sucker for reality tv shows; survivor, temptation island (just love to watch how absurd the show is), and my ultimate favorite, The Amazing Race (TAR). TAR 3 made its debut on channel 5 this afternoon, 12 couples competing for a cool million. Did i forget to mention that it's a race around the world for 30 days?   Without getting into the nitty gritty bits of the show (i doubt you wld want me to summarise the whole ep, and i sure as hell wouldn't want to write it all down), TAR 3 is going to be interesting to watch for the next 12 weeks... uh-oh, i can forsee spending my thursday nights at the tv lounge trying to study and watch at the same. the nice uncle who cleans my blk told me that i shouldn't do my work and watch tv at the same time, at least that was what i assumed he was telling me, cos he was speaking in chinese...   For those who wld like to know more abt TAR   urlLink Official website   urlLink The amazing race links

          REVIEWS    Harry Potter (Parts 1,2 & 3)  In the space of 2 weeks, I've read the first three instalments of Harry Potter, by J.K. Rowling. Well, not 2 weeks, more like 2 days over 2 weeks. (geddit?) Although not as thrilling as Lord of the Rings, it is fun to read. The plot gets more interesting in each book. Harry and friends are a curious lot, always seeking adventures and sneaking off into the night. The protagonists face new villains in each new instalment, although all the villains have a connection with  he-who-shall-not-be-named . Thankfully, Rowling does not try to sugar-coat the plot and villains and the story does get darker and more sinister as one progresses. Readers, along with Harry himself, will discover more about his past and will be drawn into Harry's life and ride along with him and his friends in each adventure that they embark on.   With specific reference to the second book, mainly because the movie is out.. I dislike Gilderoy Lockhart. He is such a  git!     the Book Vs the Movie  This is purely based on the first one, cos i've not watched the second one yet. While Chris Columbus does try to stick to the original story, like all movies that are adapted from books, certain scenes, dialogues have to be cut in the movie to fit the time frame and to make it watchable. In a certain sense, watching the movie before reading the book is good because one can have an idea of how Harry, Ron and Hermione actually looks like. I daresay, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson fit their characters to a T. However, Harry Potter has more spunk in the book, I feel, than portrayed on the silverscreen. Hermione, on the hand, is perrrfect. And so is Hagrid. Well, once I catch the second movie, I'll be sure to write my two-cents worth.   Trivia: Hermione is pronounced as Her-my-own-nee

       can someone watch Double vision n tell me wat really happened in the end?   heyhey... i noe my exams havent ended... but i've got a 6 day break b/w my 2nd last paper n the last wan.... n erm... a fren from taiwan came back erm... soooo one thing led to another lah... (gd thing abt blogs is they let us tok to no one n yet lets us assuage our own guilt)  anyway... Double Vision is a weird movie... ala x-files... wif an intriguing plot... weird characters... n even weirder ending.... acting is excellent, cinematography is superb wif art direction by tim yip, the same guy who werked in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (or so my fren who came back from taiwan told me).... its not really a scary movie... tho there ar some gross scenes of amputation, gory images of rotting wounds n stuff... my fren screamed a bit in those scenes, n shes one of the braver gals i've met... sooo... watch if u dare gals! (or guys for the matter, juz to be politically correct)... david morse has been nominated for best-supporting actor, tony leung for best actor n chen kuo-fu for best director in the golden horse awards... so it tells u wat a gd production the film is... movies i watch n recommend ar always gd, n its not juz becos of who i watched it wif!  =p

         WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY    This stand-up comedy show made its way to our Singapore shores on Monday and I must say, they are even funnier on stage then the are on TV. Scenes improvised by the quintet included a Bolivian expert giving a speech about funerals and llama-herding, a three-headed Captain talking about how horses can play cricket and a bizarre fairytale about Alice in Wonderland and the Whisk. Some games played are similar to the ones on TV, like scenes from a hat (or in this case, scenes from a bucket). Scenes ranged from 'three blind mice trying to mate' to 'four girls in the bathroom' to 'my mother, the green serpent'.  Trying to recall each specific scene/act is almost impossible, and frankly, I can't be bothered to try. They certainly had the audience rolling around laughing with their antics and especially when they bungle up. Their jokes seldom degenerated to toilet humour  a la  Boom Boom Room, but there was a penis puppet show and a lot of one liners like "shave my ass and call it a football", "shave my pubes and call it.. (i can't remember what)". Needless to say, it was worth every cent. Those who missed it can catch reruns of the Brit version at midnight on Wednesday on Central.

         REVIEWS     Who Wants To Be A Princess   Not me!! Esp if i have to parade around and answer questions like "where's the most provocative place you've been intimate in?" This 1 1/2 hour show is almost like "The Bachelor" only shorter (thank goodness for that). It's a beauty parade (aren't they all??) but the winner doesn't get to wear a crown, she gets to date one that does. (If i were a prince, i wouldn't want to get a date through some stupid show like this, and i sure wouldn't want to date an American.) I bet all the prince wants is one good _ _ _ _ (fill in the blanks yourself).  And all those women! What can i say about them? Cheap-o, and lame-o. That's what. Of course, i can call them other vile names... but, i'm trying to be nice and give them the benefit of the doubt. *snort*  like real  I think American women (dunno abt European women) are so into the romantic, fantasy date. They want a fairytale life and are willing to subject themselves to such 'humiliation" in order to achieve that dream. "Ooh, he's so charming. He's the kind of guy i've dreamt abt since i was a little girl!" They want to be romanced, courted and charmed... Any guy can fulfill that role and in return, i'm pretty sure they are willing to do just abt anything for him afterwards. (With all the wine that's been poured down their throats, i don't think they'll be capable of thinking straight)

         MORE REVIEWS     Temptation Island 2 (TI2)   Was up last night watching TI2, not by choice but simply cos the tv was turned on as i was reading my notes. Ok, this latest installment is  WORST  than the first season (which i watched cos it was soooo hilarious to see couples behaving like that. sometimes bad tv shows are fun to watch, mainly cos u can make fun of those in it). TI2.. what can i say abt it, while maintaining a neutral position at the same time? Frankly speaking, nothing. This show is  PATHETIC!!!! . The phrase 'cheap sluts' is an understatement, a euphemism, for the women in the show.. and don't get me started on the men... And these women are professionals.. teachers, event planners... Teachers(!) and they're the ones that are educating the young in America.  One scenario that really pissed me off: Couple guy (CG) liked single girl ,A, (SGA). SGA said they 'clicked', personalities matched.. yadda yadda.. anyway, CG and SGA went to CG's room to, ya know, mess around.. (another euphemism). ok whatever. the next day, all couple guys and their respective girlfriends are supposed to choose one Single girl or Single guy to go on a date with. so, all single girls/guys are dancing on this bridge thing, and each Couple guy/girl are supposed to dance up to the girl/guy they want. Back to CG... when it was his turn, he didn't dance with SGA, whom he slept with the night before, but instead chose  ANOTHER  single gal. [muahaha] so, SGA is like soooo sad, cries.. yadda yadda. Had a talk with CG and said something to the effect of "i'm not some girl u can screw. i thought we had something going on... " whatever...  CHEAP SLUT!!!! that's what i felt like saying... *sigh*

       Fight Club   Ever noticed how couples fight in public? I've been a witness to about 3 such spats and I must say they have been quite amusing. You have:  a)  Guy who points finger and shouts at girl . This made the poor girl cry. It was sad, cos the fight occurred at the bus interchange so everyone who walked by could see them arguing. He was a young punk, well, actually, so was she. I didn't know what they were fighting abt cos i can't speak Chinese.  b)  Guy who argues with girl in a bar.  This one took place at Next Page. I couldn't hear what they were saying cos it was too loud. The amusing part was that a group of Caucasians got involved as well, cos, they, being like their governments, like to butt into other people's problems. Soon, one big, hunky ang moh kinda threw the small Asian to the outer part of Next Page and someone called the bouncers. The girlfriend was screaming, "don't hurt him! don't hurt him." But they were apparently attacked by a sudden desire to be chilvarous. It was amusing.  c)  Girl sulks at guy cos guy pissed her off.  This one occurred last night on a bus from Orchard. She was so irritated by him. And he persisted in talking to her which pissed her off even more. She banged her bag against the front seat a couple of times and pulled such a long face that i think must have reached the floor at some point in time. And the most irritating thing was that, he was still talking to her! Doesn't he get it? Your girl's pissed with you, leave her alone. And he had his arm around her waist (doesn't it make his arm numb or smthg??) and she was trying to shove it away but he wouldn't budge. Geez... Even I felt irritated by him!

        Of hand holding and all that jazz   Congratulations on the CD!! I've heard its good actually. :)   As for the holding hands issue, I think its ridiculous (ok, downright stupid) to assume that you're in an exclusive relationship because you've held hands, even if two platonic friends have no reason to hold hands (which I think they do, whatever happened to the days when we were little and you could hold hands with anyone and skip around the playground and run around and stuff?). Sometimes you just wanna hold your friends hand (boy or girl) and just... walk!   Anyway, back to the issue at hand, the problem here is, the lack of communication. If they had talked about it, and figured out what different gestures mean to both of them, this wouldn't be as much of an issue. Talk people! Talk and listen! And talk about things worth talking about. Most of the chatter that fills our lives is so... innane and inconsequential (did I even spell that right? Having issues with my brain right now, its saying go to sleep goddamit) that I sometimes wonder why we even bother talking, then I realise... its probably because no one is really listening... oh well...

      I'm in a melancholic mood right now and so, this is for all of you...    BUT YOU DIDN'T    Remember the time you lent me your car and I dented it? I thought you'd kill me..... But you didn't.  Remember the time I forgot to tell you the dance was  formal, and you came in jeans? I thought you'd hate me...... But you didn't.  Remember the times I'd flirt with other boys just to make you jealous, and you were? I thought you'd drop me.... But you didn't.  There were plenty of things you did to put up with me, to keep me happy, to love me, and there were so many things I wanted to tell you when you returned from Vietnam......  But you didn't.

       My First Ever CD Review   I finally bought my first ever CD in more than 2 years. Yes yes, all this while I've been living off napster, audiogalaxy and recently, kazaa. [Stop frowning, you anti-piracy freak, you]   The CD I bought is called "  Lady Sings The Blues  ". It is a compilation of jazz songs all sung by women from legends such as Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday to a newbie, Norah Jones. This 2 CD compilation is a steal at just $17.00 ( I think). There's something mersmerising about women jazz singers. I think it's their smoky voice, the slow beat and the fact that so much atmostphere can be packed into a 3 min song. Everytime I listen to the songs, I feel as though I'm in some swanky New York bar in the 1930s, wearing a red dress and holding a martini in my hand.   Anytime you find yourself drowning in the events of the day, play this CD and your mood will lighten considerably. And for a brief moment, life is good.

       Holding hands n skipping stones... Hugs n kisses....   hmm... holding hands? errr... depends on how n in wat context i guess... y wld 2 platonic frens wanna hold hands for anyway? i definitely dun wanna hold hands wif my guy pals n be mistaken for a gay... i mean, if its during some silly ice-breaker game for orientation camp or wat, then ok lah... but y wld i wanna hold my female fren's hand unless i was assuming a more intimate r/s wif her? i dunno abt gals, but dats how straight, normal guys like me think.  as for hugs.... the only time i wld ever hug anybody is   1. when the team scores a goal n we all hug each other in mutual camaraderie as team mates (or however u spell dat french-anglicised word) (gender neutral action)  2. when the team scores a goal n we all hug each other in mutual cameradeire as supporters of the same team (gender-neutral action)  3. when the female fren is in need of comfort n i offer the proverbial sholder to cry on (only applicable to gals, wld be seen as gay if done to guys, gender-specific action)  4. when an event occurs akin to the team scoring a goal n we all hug each other in mutual camaererdire in celebratory mood (gender-neutral action)  kisses shld be the same as hugs i suppose... tho i doubt many singaporeans kiss each other for fun (even on the cheek) given the conservative nature of public scrutiny (ala dancing queen's powers of observation on the mrt) =p wld be screwed if my mum saw me pecking a gal on the cheek n then doubly screwed when she knows its not even my gf im kissing...  ok... hope dat clears up the typical alpha male's side of the argument...

        Events    After my earlier diatribe about relationships and going steady, I'll shall move on to a more pleasant topic. A couple of  urlLink Romancing Singapore  activities caught my eye. This month long campaign is aimed at "Romancing Singapore" (duh).  1)  urlLink  Shall We Dance - A Bridge Version    Date: 7 Feb Venue: Read Bridge at Clarke Quay Time: 8pm til 2 am Cost: FREE! This should be a fun event. Dancing in the night with instructors to guide the participants. You can come with your gal pals, boy toys, boyfriends, lovers, ex-es, lesbian/gay lovers and even drinking buddies and dance the night away. Best thing is that this event is Free! So come on down and enjoy yourself. A side note: I'm thinking of going for it, so for those who are interested, hee, well, we could make an outing out of it.   2)  urlLink  Love Lane   Date: 7 Feb Venue: Open field beside Jurong East MRT Time: Not given Cost: Free! This sounded interesting. I think it's like a carnival set in the 60s. It's good for those who stay in the west are too lazy to get their butts down to Orchard on a Friday night.   3)  urlLink  Confessions of Three Unmarried Women   Date: 13 - 16 Feb Venue: Victoria Theatre Time: 8pm Cost: $21, $26, $31, $36, $41 Ooh!

A side note: I'll also be going for this one as soon as I can enthusiastic friends to go with me. Will give a review of it.

       Hall Updates   Guess who I spotted a few nights ago lurking around my hall? Ms Black Undies and the malignant growth by her side. Yes apparently she is now staying at the other end of my block after vacating the room next to mine during the holidays. Sheesh..

       Much Ado About Relationships   An article in the Straits Times appeared a few days ago about the nature of relationships and how it has changed. The writer said that in the past, holding hands constituted as "going steady" and that nowadays, some people do not subscribe to that ideology anymore. A couple can spend the night together, see each other every single minute of the day and yet still consider themselves to be "just friends".   That article reminded me of a boo-boo I made with my friend (let's call her Jane) last year. A certain someone was pursuing her - calling her, visiting her etc. One day, she told me that they held hands and asked me what it meant. In all honesty, I don't see how holding hands can be considered going steady. So I told her that he liked her enough to hold hands but they were still just friends. Apparently, I was wrong. He did consider that as "going steady" and his friend was totally surprised as to how I came to my conclusion and conveniently called it "weird".  But seriously. How can holding hands equate to "let's be together?" How much should one or can one read into the act of hand holding? This goes with hugs and even kisses (french kissing or sucking face doesn't count). I'm no expert on this topic, having had only one relationship in my life, but I'm puzzled as to how people define the boundary between being "just friends" and "going steady".   Can just platonic friends hold hands? Similarly, can people like each other and yet not go steady? That's something to think about....

         Cravings, Fetishes and Fantasies     As I walked around Jurong Point, something beautiful gleamed from afar like a jewel in the sun. It was perfect; the shiny black box and the pictures on its cover. Ahhhhhhhhhhh... it was the PC-game of Lord of the Rings. The words "PC-Game" on its front filled me with extreme joy. I no longer have to save money to get myself a PS2 (that's Playstation 2, for the uninitiated) in order to play the PS version of LOTR. I've been  craving   for that baby ever since I tried out the PS version at a Sony roadshow. Fantastic graphics as well as characters, and it's the type of RPG (role-playing game) that I really love. Move over, Diablo. Aside from LOTR, I saw 5 boxes of  The Sims  - Expansion pack, Living large, et al. OOoooh.. I tried hard not to water at the sight of those shiny boxes. How can a person fall in love twice in a day? I know where my next allowance is going to go to now. *grins*    Fetishes  aren't my cup of tea. It would certainly be interesting to read about a fetish for kinky underwear. But I'm not that perversed. :) If I could pick any fetish to have, I would want to have a fetish for shoes. That is one fetish I wouldnt' mind cultivating. After watching one too many seasons of Sex and the City (SATC), I've come to love those Manolo Blahniks that cost about $400 a pair. The way it fits into one's foot, the design, the color, those little straps and those high, high, heels.... Oh-so-sexy and oh-so-expensive....  Everybody has some kind of  fantasy . I'm willing to bet good money on that fact. Perversed, extreme, bizarre, or simply idealistic, fantasies are exciting to have. My fantasies are sedate, unlike what many of you may think.. haha.. As much as I've said otherwise, I do not wish to  be a pole dancer!! But I do fantasize of performing in public. And who knows? I may just do it... Performance is by invitation only though... hahaha...

       Clarifications   I was a virgin clubber then!! :) And hey, for those who want to have a good time clubbing, you can come to me. No sex, no smooching, no groping.. But other than that, I'm game for anything. Oh wait, I'm not into  menage a trois  or any other kinky stuff you people can think of.   I'm not a big fan of mambo nights either, but it is EXTREMELY fun to diss everyone that does that schronized dance routine shit. Am I being mean for doing that? Hell yeah. But it's effing fun. Mambo people (what the heck do you call them anyway? Mambers? hahah) can form the 5th major race in Singapore.   And the one-liners that guys use on girls are hilarious!! I mean H.I.L.A.R.I.O.U.S. "err, you dance very well. What's your name?" or "You look like my friend" or "Is that guy your boyfriend?" Sigh.. A word of advice, guys. Please don't use such lame lines on us.   [As I'm writing this, Lady Marmalade is playing in the background.]

       Clubbing Insights   I'm not a regular clubber: In fact, i've only stepped into the what-i-can-only-call-a-music-underground filled with loud-mouthed, half-high-and-crazed teenagers 4 times. My club-de-virgining experience was Mambo night at Zouk to celebrate the A-level results. Despite donning my most gung-ho, most randy outfit i could put together, I looked about as sexy as the old auntie hanging outside the loos eying each entrant with a watchful eye to see if they flush. So, anyway, upon queuing up to enter (despite valiant attempts to strike it with the 2 yokozuna-lookalike bouncers at the door, and paying an EXTRAORDINARY exorbitant $22 buckeroos to place my feet onto the black carpet) and entering, i came to the self-reckoning conclusion that i;ve missed my teenagedomhood. Man, the music was LOUD (at least several gazillion decibals, sooner or later you can have your pwn private band banging away between your head and eardrums), the crowd was raunchy was hell-of-a young. They had da moves and da grooves...shmuck, and i was the only 'kid' there downing my 2 free drinks with sparkling ribena. Geez. But i sure don;t envy the poor babes who spent half their day plucking their brows, shaving their legs, making up their faces, only to be thrown up all over by some enthusiatic underaged drunk who probably tried to say hello but his gut contents came out and introduced itself instead.  In my second experience, I was a little smarter --- > i hid near the curtains and did my stuff: observing the crowd. I gather those punks must be regulars: For one thing..they knew not only the moves to EVERY song, but they even knew what song was going to come up next!!!! DUH HUH! ?????? All over the place ??????  My 3rd and 4th time were conciliatory accepted invites to NTU bashes. The first in year one..with dancing queen, my gal pal, and my ex-roomate. These gals were clubbers, even then: I was still the kid from the block. Anyway, hell, we dragged our butts to the platform and shook it for all it was worth. Hiak! Talk about making things happen...  My last time was another bash at Orange, where I, upon 21 years, first stepped into the famed MS. It sucked. My company was great. But the music sucked. I left, swearing no more would i cram myself into another club: My old faithful Sony hi-fi awaits my return and usage faithfully...

      heh heh heh..  i get the feeling that some (not all, i emphasize) seem to want the WHOLE world (or at least the whole MRT carriage) to know that they are an item. Even if they're not sitting, they're leaning against each other, cuddling, nibbling at ears, neck, any facial area.. pressing up to each other as if that bloody carriage were empty and there were not a million pairs of eyes boring holes right into their heads: OMIGOSH! What a show: Bang, bite me. What are they trying to say? "Ooh, look at me, Ay gott a boyyy-friendd/girrrllfriend...---->>ENVY ME????" Geez...get a life, and some ectasy while you're at it.

       Clubbing   This is a topic close to my heart. I love clubbing and I wish I'm in a smoky club dancing to trashy music rather than being in the computer lab doing my Audit tutorial. I love the pulsating music, the bright lights and even the crowd. Yes, the crowd makes or breaks a club. The crowd defines how popular a club is. In Singapore, there are many clubs that cater to all sorts of music. You want R&B/Hip Hop? Well, hop (pardon the pun) on down to Lox and you can grind the night away. Fancy some Retro shite? Then Zouk's Mambo night is just the thing for you. Trashy top 40 hits? One need not look beyond Next Page to get one's fill of trashy music and trashy people.   For some people, clubbing is a way to meet new "friends" or more realistically, ONS (one-night-stands). For others, the experience of clubbing is incomplete without a jug of beer, long island tea or anything that strikes their fancy. As for me, I club for the sole purpose of dancing. I'm not interested in the drinks, I'm not interested in the people, just get me a dance floor, good music and I'll be happy.   Unfortunately, I don't think that it is possible to club just for the sake of dancing. Many a time, I've encountered over-enthusiastic males trying to get fresh on the dance floor. I doubt it's cos I'm oh-so-hot (I know I am, but that's a different matter. *grin*). More often then not, these males just approach or grab any females that go by until they get one that responds. And, rest assured, they will find one.

       Random Musings   As I made my way back to school on the ever-so-reliable MRT, I was sitting strategically between two couples, both different and yet so alike in behavior. Are couples, by nature, exhibitionists? Guy will flick girl's hair, girl will place hand nicely at guy's crotch. I was ready to keel over by the time we reached Kallang. Thank goodness couple #1 alighted at that station. Couple #2 was less annoying. But guy loved to put his hands on girl's thigh and she was wearing such a short skirt! She, on the other hand, had her hand oh-so-close to his groin.   I'm not against couples or relationships per se, but man... Get a room!

         Reviews     Modern Dance for Beginners      Do not let the title fool you. This is a play and has got nothing to do with dance. This is a play about love and sex, starring Mark Waite (the prat from Moulmein High) and Debra Teng (from I-don't know-where). This play is actually a series of scenes depicting many people. The two central characters are: Owen and Frances, played by Waite and Teng.   Commendable performances by Waite and Teng. Aside from Owen and Frances, they also play a host of other characters as well. Waite is a natural and his dialogue is sharper and wittier than Teng's. He moves in between scenes and characters effortlessly and the audience is able to see the change from one character to another. Teng, on the other hand, is slightly more awkward. Maintaining a Brit accent proved too be a slight problem for her, thus making her sound Singaporean at times. Mind you, this play is supposedly set in Britain. Her acting was a little wooden at times but on the whole, she could carry off her many roles as well.   This play goes to show that class/appearance plays no role in love and sex. The upper-class miss is one raunchy kitten who just wants to be taken by the handyman. The wimpy office colleague goes around hard most of the time. The promiscuous girl just wants to be loved. These issues are dealt with in the play but without any moral high-handedness.

      Love the updated site! :) Two thumbs up, and toes if i can manage!   Had a similar experience with a beetle. But the one that flew into my balcony was HUGE and BLACK. And I was cheering it on because it was trying to fly out, but the windows weren't opened wide enough. The darn thing couldn't figure it out. But then again, beetles aren't very smart...   Oh well...

        Hall Life: The Final Chapter   It was foolish of me to think that i can have a bug-free life during my last semester in hall. Just 15 mins ago, a HUGE, and i mean HUGE beetle flew into my room and landed itself at the hinge of the door. Needless to say, my roommie and i screamed in the hope that we wld scare that mutant away. But, we weren't so lucky. Mutant beetle refused to budge and closing the door was risky as it cld either be squashed to death, which was fine by me, or it wld fly into our room and we would be in deep shit. So, me, being my brilliant self, thought that i cld push it out of the room using my broom. Hah! Problems soon arose. Firstly, I cldn't even get the beetle to move. It wasn't afraid of the broom. Secondly, it kept making this peculiar noise. It sounded as though it was sneezing. But I think it's just some defense mechanism where it sprays its enemy, hence the sneezing noise. Finally, it latched itself onto my broom, but now, I had a new problem. It was stuck on my broom. After a heart-stopping moment where we thought the beetle moved away frm the broom, we screamed, I pushed the broom out of the door and closed it shut.  Now, I refuse to be held hostage by a mere beetle! No doubt, one helluva beetle, but still, it's a darn BEETLE. I used my roomie's plastic cup. I trapped that bloody thing, put it inside a plastic bag, and promptly threw the whole thing into the dustbin.  Is that Brilliant? or is that Brilliant?

      cant agree more with lester.. when i look at a person's feet the first thing that i look at are the toenails... for guys dirty toenails or clean, well trimmed toenails, for girls the colour of the nail polish suggest something abt the person.

       If Clothes Maketh The Man, How do Shoes Fit in?   This is the following part to the section on feet.   No one lives in a Cinderella-world where shoes magically fit ones feet. Notice how she has such tiny feet, whereas her stepsisters and stepmother have ugly, bunion-filled ones. Nowadays, no one gives a hoot about feet shape particularly when it comes to buying shoes. While my earlier post about long skinnies wearing stilletoes and broad stumpies confined to low-heeled shoes, in reality, this situation does not exist.   It seems that shoes maketh the person. Court shoes to go with that black suit for that formal, executive look. Boots to go with that mini skirt for that cowboy chic wear. Chunky platform shoes with the weird dress for that Jap anime look. And of course, slinky shoes to go with that gorgeous cocktail dress. The combination can go on. Whether one's feet can actually fit into those shoes comfortably, nobody knows. The point is, the shoes complete one's outfit and in that sense, completes one's identity.   Notice how I rarely touch on the subject of men's shoes. To a certain extent, a man is not defined by his shoe. Well, not as much as a woman, at least.

        Who Looks at Feet?   I've got ugly feet. I must admit that, although I like to think of them as a "dancer's feet". That's a euphemism to say that my feet look deformed. But what exactly is the perfect feet? Long and skinny? Frankly, I get turned off by long, skinny feet. To me, they look weird, like a skeleton's feet. No doubt, just like  body size, long and skinny feet can suit all types of shoes. What about broad feet with stumpy toes?   Would people with long skinny feet look down upon those with broad stumpy ones? Does the type of feet affect one's entire being? Long skinny wears stilettoes, hence leads a fancy life where stilletoes are the norm. Broad stumpy, on the other hand, wears low-heeled sedate shoes since she can't fit into stilletoes. THe life she leads would be just like her shoes - sedate.   Guys have no such problem. Lanky or stumpy, shoes are made with a one shape fits all mentality. Any guy can fit into a pair of Kenneth Coles as easily as he can fit into cheapo Bata sandals. Would his life be affected by his shoes? I doubt so.   But who looks at feet?

      That's moi! :) *curtsies, waves and flying kisses*  For those of you who were out today and donated generously to the people rattling tins for RDA (Riding for the Disabled Association of Singapore), give yourselves a pat on the back. Those who didn't, smack yourselves on the head!   Would like to mention that probably the BEST way to get through a crowd of people in say, orchard road, is to HOLD A DONATION TIN. Generally more preferable to going out stinking of fish (rotten, fresh et. al.).

Its rather late now, so I'll post something more intelligent *cough* and thought provoking *cough cough* when... I... uhmm... sometime in the near future (Hey, some of us live in hope!). Rest assured, it will not have anything to do with Britney... but then again, it just might... ;)   Goodnight!

       Reviews: The Ring   I've not watched good scary movies in a long time. Asian movies don't count cos I think Chinese/Jap horror movies are much better than English ones. This adaptation of the Japanese movie "Ringu" does not deviate much from its original form. There are new bits in the English one that wasn't on the Jap one. For example,  the son of the reporter plays a larger role in this movie and he can communicate with Samara/Sadako. While the Jap version was a masterpiece of mood and atmosphere, this Hollywood adaptation is less subtle. Hollywood is Hollywood where being loud and obvious sells (probably because Americans are just dumb and can't appreciate the finer points of being subtle). But there is a sense of anticpation when watching as audiences are drawn into the story. Watching the Jap one does kill the joy in watching this version somewhat but it's similar to reading a book and then watching the movie-version of it.   However, as mentioned, the adaptation is fair. I wasn't disappointed when I watched it. On the whole, I would pay at most $7.50 for it. It was fun getting scared and screaming along with tons of other screamy girls in the theatre!

        Now it's my turn to write about the best/worst films of 2002    The honor of being the worst film in 2002 goes to " Slap Her, She's French! ".   Aargh! This movie is BAD. BAD. BAD. Teen flick gone wrong, and that's saying alot since almost all teen flicks are never right. But this is wrong. It's so wrong that it shouldn't have been shown in the cinema and gone straight to a video release, not even a VCD or DVD release. A VIDEO release. I'm not gonna bother writing about the plot. It stars whats-her-face, the girl who acted as Piper?Phoebe? in Coyote Ugly with a BAD french accent, that even I can do it better.    The second worst movie : "Star Wars - Attack of the Clones"   I can't remember the last movie I watched that made me cringe cos of its really, and I mean,  really  corny lines. Even Hayden whats-his-name wasn't cute enough to make me like the show. But Natalie Portman is a  HOTTIE .    The third worst movie : "Queen of the Damned"   The queen had a screen time of only about 30 minutes in the entire show! There is no plot and Lestat the vampire, played by Stuart Townsend, who was the original Aragorn but he was fired i think, thank god, was just sucky. A good waste of $6.50. Even the gory bits weren't gory. Aaliyah, who played the queen, had a funny accent which was supposed to be Egyptian but sounded abit Hispanic.    Best Film since Memento - Insomnia   This movie stars Robin Williams (in a non-comedic role!) and Al Pacino. A fantastic movie directed by the same guy who did Memento, Christopher Nolan. This movie is dark and very drawn out. The viewer is made to feel like Al's character who is having insomnia. The nights are long and unbearable and the viewer is treated with a visual of how Al's insomnia is affecting him physically; the tired, blood-shot eyes. Robin Williams is surprisingly good as the bad man. Very low key acting, very un-robin williams. One of the best shows I've watched without being a big budget Hollywood blockbuster. We can expect great movies from Mr Nolan.

        my first movie of 2003   ah so 9 days into the new year and ive watched my first movie the wedding banquet doesnt count this is the first one in a real cinema and its  the experiment  rather disturbing show about a prison experiment gone wrong an explicit insight into how man abuses authority given to him and the unthinkable consequences of that freedom however the music choices of the show are questionable and so are certain character and plot involvements but on the whole a poignant and shocking take on man taking things into his own hands watch it one of these days cos theres probably nothing much else worth watching

        Best Films of 2002!!   (according to my worthless opinion)  alrite alrite... since i've nothing better to do... no thanx to nus screwing up my module selection (i was the only person i noe among all my frens to have been allocated only 1 mod after balloting, i muz be a damn lucky guy)   Best Comedy of 2002   *drumrolls* the award goes to  About A Boy   !!! a comedy wif touching undercurrents of single-parenthood n interpersonal relationships... witty n dry brit humour performed by hugh grant (who else?? john cleese is too old n mr brosnan has associative personality disorder as mr bond)   Best Horror of 2002   hmm... this is tough.... cos there werent really many horror movies this yr... but  Dark Water  has to get it. From the director of The Ring, this jap film portrays many of the scary elements so essential to the jap horror genre these days... u dun actually see the ghost.. the anticipation n dread of seeing 1 simply drives u nuts... also wif an underlying plot of a mother's luv for her daughter, to the delight of parents who enjoy watching scary movies??   Best Suspense/Thriller of 2002   well... well... is there any compeition??  Red Dragon  is it!! anthony hopkins... edward norton... wif a riveting performance thrown in by ralph fiennes... wat more do u need to win this category???   Best Drama of 2002   yesyes... all jude law fans... its ur day!  Road to Perdition  gets this even tho jude law appeared in only 3 scenes in the movie?? Tom hanks plays a father to a son... Paul Newman plays a father to Tom Hanks n another son... makes the father-son r/s kindof surreal n poetic, but realistic nonetheless....   Best Action/Adventure of 2002   wah lau...  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  lah!! how many times muz i say!?

         More Reviews     Gangs of New York   A compelling movie spanning almost 3 hours. Tells the tale of rival gangs in 19th century New York City. The opening sequence shows 2 rival gangs, "The Dead Rabbits" and "The Natives" getting ready to fight. This fight scene is disturbing and awfully bloody. Even this writer herself couldn't help cringing while watching the show and she loves blood and gore.   The political situation in the US, (the civil war occurred then and Lincoln was recruiting soldiers to fight) was juxtaposed against the political situation in New York, where everybody owes and everybody pays. Irish immigrants were despised by the Natives (men who were born and bred on US soil) and officials are corrupt.    Being the great reviewer that I am, I shan't write a whole long passage about it. Go watch. Cameron Diaz is surprisingly not annoying, and neither was Leonardo. If you aspect me to gush over them, forget it.

        the return of punctuationless man   aha so the one who refuses to put an end to any sentence is back well i watched the wedding banquet today in school during soci lecture today and it was a pretty good show not a bad start to the year eh aha now everybodys talking about school and im talking about silly old films sorta lagging i suppose but who gives a rotten donut about that anyway well back to the show was a nice take on a chinese living america who lives in with his gay partner but stages a mock wedding to please his visiting parents but things get out of control thought it was done pretty well so i guess thats a good sign for better movies to come this year my favourite movie of last year was one hour photo starring robin williams as the harmless looking intrusive man who works at a photo developing shop rather disturbing but shot in a very clinical and engaging way so what were your fave movies of last year

         Back to school....    Well, well, well, whaddaya know? After 2 mths, we are back to a daily dose of lessons, tutorials and tons of readings. For some, it's still the first year, while for others, it is the FINAL semester! And for others still, it's still neither here nor there.   The first day of school brought surprises for me. I have new neighbors and a new roommate. All first years!! Aargh. Apparently Ms BLack Undies moved out and in place, I've got 2 girls from Comm Studies. First years! Need I say that again? My roommate is a very decent Malay girl, also first year, studying Engineering. Decent meaning that she's totally unlike me, but she doesn't wear the tudung. What do I do with first years?? AArgh. Thankfully, my roommate isn't the gushing, yabbering type cos frankly, I so don't have the energy to start chit chatting and having pow wow sessions with her. I miss my old roommate and now I understand why my second year roommate hardly spoke a word to me. I think by the time I reached my 3rd year, everyone below 20 just seems young, too young. All first years are very excitable esp when living away from home for the first time. But seems that my roommie and I have reached a nice state of silence. Heh. But she loves to keep the door closed and I'm feeling a tad claustrophobic in the room right now.

        Rina the teenage scoring sensation    well... well... if it isnt rina, the player-manager back after a long spell of suspension n injury... marking her return to the side wif an excellent brace n sending the supporters wild in the stands...   Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers   the list of superlatives juz goes on n on doesnt it? breath-taking shots of backdrops in kiwiland... combined wif out-of-this-world, computer-generated, mind-boggling, adrenaline-pumping (how many more hyphenated adjectives can i find?) cinematography... lets juz say dat the visual effects ar something dat i've neva ever experienced in my life b4 as a movie-goer for 20 yrs... certainly beats Star Wars hands down... u cld imagine y Saruman's evil sidekick (forgot the guy's name, im not a mad fan) teared upon setting eyes on the uruki army... cos mine were on the verge of spilling too during  many scenes.. not cos i was touched emotionally, but simply moved by the utterly amazing scenes b4 my eyes... simply put, its a visual spectacle enuf to set ur heart on an emotional roller-coaster ride   The 2nd vs the 1st   hmm... i gotta disagree wif the gaffer... i find the 2nd was better in terms of storyline n pace... contrary to her view, i found bits dat were draggy in the 1st movie dat were absent in the 2nd =p besides, the battle scene towards the end in the 1st movie was, i felt (even then) kindof lame, cos it seemed dat it was juz ppl in costumes fighting wif nothing impressive... also, as the boss pted out, the amt of humour in the 2nd is much more than dat found in the 1st, so dat its become much more enjoyable on a diff scale... besides... Andy Serkis' voice impression of Smeagol as a schizophrenic "precioussss" fanatic certainly warrants an award of some sort... for other reasons, pls refer to the previous paragraph n aforementioned "visual spectacle"   The movie vs the book   okok... i gotta admit dat i neva even contemplated reading tolkien's books... 1. cos i was neva a big fan of fantasy... 2. cos i din wanna read the bk n get disappointed in the movies dat i was gonna pay at least 6.50 for... anyway, i did actually pay 6.50 for Twin Towers, erm... oops, i mean Two Towers (where did dat slip come from??)... so it werks out to abt 2 bucks per hr of swash-buckling entertainment... much more economic than any bk i'll ever read  ;)

       Reviews   Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers   This movie is grandiose. By itself, ie, without taking into consideration that it is a sequel to The Fellowship of the Rings, it is a fantastic show. With beautiful scenery and beautiful people (well, except for Eomer and his funny moustache). The battlescene was MAGNIFICENT. I totally loved it! (For a more pro review, i'm sure you can find other sources to read. :) I'm just gonna gush.)   The Second Vs the First  However, I find that the first movie was better in terms of story line and pace. There were bits that were draggy in the second movie that was absent in the first one. The treebeard scene, for example, was slow. I'm sure that was the effect that Peter Jackson was going for, as Ents are unhasty creatures, but still...    The movie Vs the book  Frankly, I preferrred the book. The book was much darker and conveyed the seriousness of the entire quest. Although the movie was dark, it had funny moments which lightened the mood. I enjoyed the funny scenes, Gimli and his 'toss me over, cos i can't jump that far", Gimli again with "what's going out there?" and Legolas saying "do you want me to describe it to you or do you want me to hand you a box?" had me in stitches. Both scenes were not in the book (thank goodness) but it worked well in the show.  All in all, it was a fair adaptation of Tolkein's book. In a way, it was better that Peter Jackson didn't keep so closely to the book, unlike Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets, because trying to follow very closely to the original material would disappoint alot of fans cos there's no way one can follow everything to a T.  That's just my $0.02 worth. Any comments feel free to let it all out.

       WELCOME BACK!!!!   Seems that I'm not the only one who did a disappearing act over the past 2 months. This site is now a ghost site! Well, I'm hoping that there may still be those who want to post stuff here so as to keep it going. :)   It's 2003 people! New resolutions should have been made and steps taken towards achieving whatever you resolved to do. For me, I resolve to...  1) Weigh less (as always) 2) Still remain single (as opposed to those who want to find their special someones this year) 3) Read every single book by Tolkien (haha i think that would take me a couple of years) 4) Travel!!!!! 5) Learn the salsa 6) Learn to speak spanish  Heh.. I guess that pretty much sums up my new year's resolutions.   A new year, a new beginning.. Sounds cliched, I know. :p

       The Term Break   This is just a euphemism for "there ain't no school, but u still have a shit-load of work to do". Midweek and work is still piling on me. I'm now drowning in my own work. If it was backlog that I have to clear, it wouldn't be so bad, cos it's my own fault that i've got backlog to clear in the first place. But nooooo... projects and more projects have to be done and handed in within the next 2 weeks.   I'll be a hunchback soon, carrying the weight of my work on my shoulders. A pack mule would be useful now. :)

       More Reviews    Chicago      I love musicals. Moulin Rouge, Phantom of the Opera and Les Miz. I've watched them all, with the exception of Cats and Chicago. I can't compare the movie versus the original musical cos i didn't watch the musical but I really loved the movie.   Plot-wise it's no Memento. Basically, it revolves around the life of Roxie Hart (Renee Zelwegger) and her trial. A short recap. Roxie murdered her lover as he lied to her (don't all men??). He had promised her that he would introduce her to club managers so that she would be able to be a star. She tried to get her husband to take the blame for it but he found out and therefore landed her in jail. Her lawyer is the very slick Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) who has never lost a trial, and with the princely sum of $5,000 he would be able to defend you and get you out of jail. There is also rivalry between Roxie and Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who's in jail for a double homicide. She murdered her sister and her husband cos they were doing "the spread eagle" heh. Velma is the "star" in jail, but Roxie, being a media-whore wants the limelight as well.  The main draw of this movie is the SOUNDTRACK. I absolutely loved the soundtrack and the performances that I wanted to clap in the theatre. Unlike Moulin Rouge where the soundtrack is a rehash of old hits, Chicago's soundtrack is ORIGINAL. Check out the "Cell Block Tango" where 6 ladies tells us why the men they killed deserved to die. I loved another number which showed Mama Morton performing a very Mamasan-like number. Queen Latifah adds some groove and pizazz to the number. The lyrics are hilarious!!!  There are also a number of surprise stars. Lucy Liu, Mya and Christine Baranski (Cybill) make acting appearances in the movie.   Ratings: I would pay $8.50 to watch it. I'd pay it TWICE. :)

       Reviews    Catch Me If You Can      This movie is actually worth watching. :) Tom Hanks as always was a delight to see and Leonardo wasn't annoying! Yay for us, non-Leo fans. I think he has redeemed himself with his 2 recent movies (Gangs of NY and Catch Me) and we can now forget that he ever acted in the Titanic.   Catch Me is a very light-hearted show, without any heavy drama a la Spielberg's last film, A.I. This mood is seen in the costumes, very pink-hued and the soundtrack as well. I need not describe the plot, as it has been described to death in all the reviews found in the papers.   In terms of acting, I think Spielberg did a good job in casting these 2 stars, as well as Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. The chemistry between the two main leads is obvious, which makes them more enjoyable to watch. If one wants to probe into the relationship dynamics of the show, then, Tom Hanks' character is the father figure that Frank Jr so desperately needs in his life. His own father, Frank Sr, hardly gives the boy the discipline that he craves. "Tell me to stop," cries Frank Jr. "I can't," says Frank Sr. While the movie glosses over the exact reason why Frank goes on his conning spree, one can assume it is due to the breakup of his family and his desire to "get everything back" so that his family would be together again. This is unfortunately very idealistic and in the end, things of course, don't turn out as planned.   A tidbit: The real Frank Abagnale made a cameo appearance as one of the French policemen.   Rating: I'd pay $7.00 to watch it.

Would things be better if I did something that I enjoyed? On hindsight, I would rather have done something I really enjoyed than to do something which would make my parents happy. Choices.. Choices..

       My favourite things   Do you have a favourite thing that would probably make someone puke/feel disgusted/think it's simply ghastly? It could be a smelly pillow, a penchant for the macabre, or simply something grosteque? Well, i do.  My favourite bug; the small brown beetle. In fact, one particular member of this from the family Chrysomelid[ae] is calling up my chest towards my neck (again). These bugs come and 'bug' me quite often....hey, where did it go????? Uh oh..

       Sex and the City    Mundane Sex Shop Directory   Now, you don;t have to be in the infamous desker road, red light glaring geylang alleys, or sleazy nightclubs doubled as brothels to get your little naughty toys! What am I saying? Simply, our prudish, stick-up-in-the-butt country does boast some naughty naughty shops of our own. And no, I'm not referring to the House of Condoms or Condomania that we thought (or at least I did) was the closest thing to sex humor we can get. Those 2 shops are at PSLE level. These shops deserve honours. Things sold at these shops leave little to the imagination. Dildos, sex games, lingerie that don;t cover what they ought to, that reliable sizzling pair of handcuffs, blow-up dolls.... The question is not that these shops exist, but rather, would you dare step in! Alone, or with friends? Would you relive your childishness all over again by blushing uncontrollably at the lewd products or appearing shocked at the variety? What would you do if you bumped into an aquaintance/friend/ and worse, relative? Dare you make a purchase by walking as nonchalantly as one who has been caught with a hand in the cookie jar and doesn't give a damn about who but the cookie? Dare you look in the eye(s) of the cashier, or your fellow shop-mates?  Get your kicks at: 1) Adult World: Far East Plaza #05-03 2) Black Pie: Bugis Village #01-03 3) Crazy Condoms: Orchard Towers #01-14 4) Aphrodisiac: Chinatown Point #02-12 5) U4Ria: MIdpoint Orchard #02-11A, Peninsula Plaza #04-54  The challenge to drop by one or all of these shops and getting myself something is seeding....

       Kara-You-Oke, Kara-Me-Oke   I experienced my first karaoke session on sat. hee.. and i must say i enjoyed myself immensely. I'm a natural star! We sang english songs, mucked through a chinese one and attempted latino songs as well!! 3 hours wasn't enough to satisfy the desire to perform. We sang, we danced, it was like performing in our very own version of "Fame - The Musical".   Can't sing? No one cares!! Just turn on the "AD" and the fake singer will cover ur sad attempts to hold a note. Haha... It was a blast.

       Mundane Info  Ok. One thing to note, just cos a guy stands at the bar counter doesn't mean that he's the bartender. Made a slight boo-boo at China Black on Sat. Was at the bar counter waiting to be served, drink coupons in my hand. The guy next to me was getting glasses with ice and pouring whisky/brandy (cldn't tell which is which) from the huge bottle at the counter into those glasses. He then turned to me and asked what drink I wanted. Innocently, I gave him my coupons and said i wanted a glass of O.J (for me) and a beer (for my friend). He gave them to the bar guy on the other side of the counter and asked if I wanted to have a glass of that whisky/brandy. At this point, I was still clueless. I was wondering why in the world the bartender wld offer me a drink, if i'm supopsed to pay for it. When I declined, he told me his name was Eric and that he WASN'T a bartender. I promptly took my drinks and left. haha.. what a dumbass. But hey, in my defense, it was dark and smoky. I cldn't see a thing. And secondly, if a guy who stood at the counter asked what drink i wanted, of cos i assumed he worked there!!

       n in response to the Queen of Dance's posting on her views abt Native Speaker n Linguistic Ownership... here ar some excerpts from my postings in my sch forum...   The idea that language belongs to everybody and nobody at the same time, is, i believe, a desirable attitude which all language users should cultivate.    It may be true that language does serve as a marker of cultural and/or national identity, but such cultural markers are mere artificial social labels which proliferate ethnocentrism and chauvinism, and can do no good for a world striving for mutual understanding and peace.  Language as cultural/identity marker also does not validate a claim that the language hence belongs to the individual (who is a member of the particular sociocultural group), which immediately implies exclusive ownership, such that peoples outside of the sociocultural group cannot claim the language to be his/her own native tongue.  The reasons for this are simple.  1. with English as an example, the culmination of present-day English is a result of a large amount of words being "borrowed" from other languages, such that the number of loan-words is significantly more than words originating from Old English.  So does English really "belong" to the French or Greeks or Romans?  2.  There exists no natural state of law which decides who owns what language.  Is the language "owned" by the 1st sociocultural group that develops the language and uses it as a distinctive marker of identity?  If so, then the Americans cant own English as well. Who decides who owns what? You, me or tony blair?  Anyway, the process of language developing into a marker of identity is a long and protracted affair, rather than one with overnight clarity, so how do we determine which group developed it 1st?  If linguistoc ownership is not determined on a "1st come 1st served" basis, then any group which uses it as a marker of identity may stake equal claim "owning" the language rite?  My view is that language cannot be "owned" exclusively by any group or individual (since there exists no natural law that determines "ownership", so that any self-proclaimed "ownership" must be an artificial social construct n hence can be disputed by other societies not subscribing to such a construct).   While if one states that one can truly claim to "own" a language it wld almost immediately imply a certain trivialisation n marginalisation of users who do not "own" the language.  Hence, more importantly, the arguments about the ambiguity of "native speaker" isnt just a debate about terminology per se, but involves far more insiduous cultural underpinnings regarding social, racial and linguistic discriminations.  Much like the fight for equal rights and opportunities for all, it is a social debate we cannot afford to lose.

       Dancing in the Moonlight   It's sad that Singaporeans aren't very romantic. Tonight's event would have been a good time for couples to learn how to dance together. But hey, it was still good fun. Us gals cldn't be bothered that we had no dates and no love interest, we just wanted to have a good time. And a good time it was! I have never missed latin dance so much! It was fun learning how to salsa and cha cha, taught by the same instructor that i used to be under!! Shawn and Gladys studio organised the event and the dances were taught by Shawn. Met up with dance friends who were there and it felt like old times.   Latin dance is by far the best dance to learn, in my humble opinion. Look at the moves... Even the music is great as well.. We went back sweaty and tired, temporarily forgetting our achy calves. :) Looking for the next opportunity to salsa the night away....

       Celebrity Sightings   And so I was at the Romancing Singapore event with Selin and Cale. We went ga-ga over Pierre Png, who really looks much better in real life. Andrea is very thin and very fair. There was also a Channel 8 couple, dunno hwo to spell their names tho. Cherry Chocolate Candy also performed. The girls are very thin and one of them is especially pretty.. :) But Pierre blew us away. haha..   The next part of the night will be written in another post.

       More Mundane Info   Dancing too much will make your calves ache. I've been walking around the past two days with achy calves. Actually, it's not walking.. I've been  hobbling  around school with achy calves. To make things worst, I'll be going for a dance thing later. What a masochist. No, no, I'm not clubbing later.. It's a salsa thing at Clarke Quay.

       Hall Life Part V - How Lazy Can One Become?    My laziness knows no bounds. I've resorted to making my friend throw stuff across from her blk to mine cos i'm usually too lazy to go over to her place to get it. I wonder why we didn't think of it in the first year. What we do is, we usually go to the ends of our respective blks and just throw stuff over. Just a precaution, when throwing things over, it's usually beneficial to have a  GOOD  aim and not throw it off the balcony.   THis method saves alot of time and energy. Well, it only saves time and energy if the person throwing does it correctly. If not, one has to go all the way down to retrieve the items. Small things like boxes, tubes are good to throw, but a plastic bag of clothes is not advisable unless one has an arm like Hercules.

       Intellectual Debate     Native Speaker of English   By the term, I would assume that a native speaker of English is someone who speaks English as a First Language. I guess from this definition, one can say that the Brits are native speakers of English. One would want to say that Americans would fill this description, but Americans are made up of many cultures, it's a melting pot, and it isn't homogeneous, like the English (ok, you have to ignore the effects of migration and British-Asians, or British-Africans).     Ownership   This brings us to the question of ownership. I don't think a particular race/breed can claim to "own" a language. I dont' even think language is something one can own. Languages are specific to the different areas of the world, again ignoring globalization, and effects of migration. So you have French, spoken in France and other French colonies, English spoken by the Brits, Malay spoken by those from the Malay Archipelago, Chinese in China, Punjabi spoken by the Punjabs and so on and so forth. But to assume that these people own the language is not accurate, I suppose. They are probably the pioneer speakers of the language, hence the use of the term "mother tongue" and "native speaker" but they don't "own" it per se.

       Hall Life   It's funny how people can get all apologetic and polite when they see you doing something that they shld have taken the initiative to do in the first place. I'm talking about washing the toilets. It happened to me last semester as well. I was washing the common bathroom when my neighbor popped in and promptly offered to help. I declined her offer (cos I was finishing) but told her that she could do it the next time. She agreed, but of course, she didn't do it at all.   This time round, new neighbors, but the same reaction. The toilet was getting grimy, although considerably less hairy than last semester's. Decided it was time to give it a wash. The last time the bathroom was cleaned was before school started. Neighbor came in, saw me washing and also offered to help. I declined. NOt only was I abt to finish, but the bathroom is too small for 2 ppl to do it. I told her next time, which she agreed to.   I find it funny how no one can notice how dirty a toilet is until they see someone else washing it. Then the thought "oh, i shld help" will pop in and they will offer their help. Maybe deep down they wish that their offer wldn't be accepted and they only offered for politeness sake. Whatever the motive, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn. All I'm asking is for them to do their part as considerate neighbors and do the washing the next time.   Perhaps she will actually do as she agreed. Only time will tell....

       Movie Review - Shanghai Knights   Aargh. This is my 3rd attempt to write the review. The blog screwed up on me twice! So, i'm not going to bother writing a whole chunk of stuff.  Fann Wong - NOt bad Jackie Chan - so so Owen Wilson - ANNOYING! Plot - very thin, convoluted about English royal who steals imperial seal in china to give to bastard bro of Chinese emperor who wants it cos he wants to rule china. Bastard bro will then help English royal to kill royal family so that he also can become king. (i scratch your back, you scratch mine.. and together we can rule the world! muahahaha) Ending: bad guys die, sidekick (Owen) gets the girl (Fann) and hero (Jackie) lives to see another day.  Nitpicks Soundtrack - Awful! Didn't go with the time period of the show. Owen - ANNOYING! waste of screen time and space Fann - English was abit grating. Sweetie, it's "FA-THER" not "FAR-DER"  Ratings - Will only watch it if you paid me to.

From lowest to highest:  I'm not even going to watch it even if you paid me too  - oh puhleeze... go straight to a video release!!   I will only watch it if you paid me to  - the movie sucked!   I'm willing to pay $6.50  - hmm.. that wasn't too bad   I'm willing to pay $7.00  - I think I may like this movie   I'm willing to pay $7.50  - That was actually quite good!   I'm willing to pay $8.00  - oh boy oh boy, I loved it!   I'm willing to pay $8.50  - [trumpets blaring] We have a winner, you guys!!!

       More Reviews - The Green Mile   While everyone was out playing mahjong and having their reunion dinner, I was home watching "The Green Mile" on Channel i. I never did watch the show at the cinema cos I thought it was going to be too sappy. 3 hours long. Now, that's a good way to waste time (and at no cost, whatsoever!). I liked the show primarily cos of Tom Hanks. (sigh) I think most of you would have watched the show, so I shan't bother giving a review abt the plot.  I liked the show. Have I said that already?  I guess I've been a fan of such prison movies, the other favorite being "The Shawshank Redemption". So anyway, the show does plod on a little, especialy the whole sequence about the mouse running across the floor. The ending bit was sad.. Yes, heartless ol me felt sad seeing what-his-face being executed. Err.. John Coffer, or smthg like that.   To sum it up. It was good. I wished I had watched it at the cinema. However, I'd only pay 6.50 for it. :)

      You wanted Reviews? Well you got em.    Movie - 8 Mile   I didn't waste money to watch this. I did what any self-respecting cheapskate wld do; I downloaded it off kazaa. The plot has been tried and tested in various forms. Poor talented boy makes it big while trying to get out of the 'hood. I can't think of any movies off hand right now, perhaps, "finding forrester" or even "save the last dance" echoes certain aspects of the plot. So anyway, the main guy here is Eminem aka Jimmy "Rabbit" Smith. Yeah, no doubt abt it, this  dog  is good. He can rap and he can certainly talk like a GENUINE black. I actually like the theme song "Lose Yourself" and have tried unsuccessfully to follow the rap. (haha...)  Ok, back to the movie.. Need i say more abt the plot? Throw in a love interest, a few good friends, and you've got yourself a movie that's about 2 hrs long. Of cos, don't forget the white trash momma, cos hey, without her, you can't blame anyone else for the shitty life that you lead right? But you see, the protagonist can't be seen as a callous SOB who beats up his momma (no he doesn't do that, it's just an expression), so what you have to do is throw in a sister, who looks up to her older bro. And there you go, that's 8 mile for you.  Eminem is a surprisingly understated actor. You'd expect him to go around cussin' his head off, but he doesn't. He's pretty restraint, and that kinda brings out the vulnerability of his character. His character also likes to walk around dressed like Kenny from southpark. Yeah, the hooded parka thing. Apparently it's in. The dialogue is pretty hard to decipher. Firstly cos the quality of the download sucked and secondly, I don't do black speak.   Well, all in all, I'm glad i caught the show. i wld pay $6.80 to $7.00 for it. :) (i guess that cld be my rating system. 6.50 to 8.50)

       Missing!   I lost my pencil! It wasn't in my pencil case and I assumed that I left it in hall. But now that I'm back, there's no sign of it anywhere!! Aargh. A pencil is like a boyfriend. You don't change it often. Pens, on the other hand, are like flings, interchangeable and losing one doesn't mean a thing. Colored pens are like friends. Fun to have, and they brighten up your life. But pencils.. man... I hate losing pencils. I get so attached to one, and now I must look around for a suitable replacement. Buying one of the same brand/type is boring. But having to find the "perfect" one is exhausting. Looks like I'll be heading for popular bookstore tomorrow.....

       A different kind of student   I wonder if you guys have seen the article in Straits Times on the 29th of Jan titled "Are you really so different, SMU?"   The article questions the claim that SMU students are "different" to NUS and NTU students, because they are more articulate, confident and willing to speak up. I'm just wondering what you guys think about this because, judging from experience, I find that they are no more articulate and confident than any other undergraduate in Singapore. In my personal opinion, I think the students at SMU THINK they're more creative and  articulate and this, gives birth to their confidence. Whether or not they are is a different story altogether. The times I've been to their campus and interacted with SMU students, I've noticed a school of thought that they seem to subscribe to; that they're just so darn alternative, and this somehow makes them better. Maybe its the fact that the university is just starting to establish themselves, but they are making an awful lot of noise about being different.   At the end of the day, the students they take in are still the product of almost 12 years of the Singapore education system. How out of the box are they expected to be? Will transplanting them into a new environment mean that they'll instantly grow better? I think these things take time. Telling your students they are different (as was THE theme for SMU's patron's day speeches) doesn't MAKE them different. Time will tell.   What's your view on this?

       Song Review Time!    Work It - Missy Elliot   Don't cringe. She's actually quite good. A nice change from Nelly, Ja Rule et al, ie, not yer typical cussin' black rappers. Her lyrics are cheeky and fun. Of cos, no one understands a word she's saying while she's rapping. But then, it wldn't be rap if everyone did, right?   Is it worth it, let me work it I put my thang down, flip it and reverse it  If you got a big [elephant], let me search it To find out how hard I gotta work ya

        A case of the chicken shits    Why is it always so diffucult to take that first plunge and ask someone out? I'm not talking about picking up at clubs, when you're slightly tipsy from the long island teas you've had. I'm talking about being stone cold sober and working up the courage to "just do it!"  I for one, will be first to admit that I have a very bad case of the chicken shits. It never seems that diffucult when you think about it, it can be summarised into 3 simple steps: Step1: Walk up to the person Step 2: Say hi Step 3: Ask him out But somehow, no matter how confident I am in other areas, I'll be reduced to a stammering, bumbling glob of insecurity in front of said person. Its really very sad when you think about it. The femminist movement has garnered us the right to vote, make our own babies, go to school, and do whatever the hell we want and some of us still can't get over the chicken shits. Its not that I'm dying to be in a relationship, its just annoying that if I ever do meet a guy I want to get to know, I turn chicken and run clucking...

       A description of love   Now what is love?  I pray thee, tell.  It is that fountain and that well  Where pleasure and repentance dwell.  It is perhaps the sauncing bell  That tolls all into heaven or hell:  And this is love, as I hear tell.    Yet what is love?  I pray thee say.  It is a work on holy-day;  It is December matched with May;  When lusty bloods, in fresh array,  Hear ten months after of the play:  And this is love, as I hear say.    Yet what is love?  I pray thee sain.  It is a sunshine mixed with rain;  It is a tooth-ache, or like pain;  It is a game where none hath gain;  The lass saith no, and would full fain:  And this is love, as I hear sain.    Yet what is love?  I pray thee say.  It is a yea, it is a nay,  A pretty kind of sporting fray;  It is a thing will soon away;  Then take the vantage while you may:  And this is love, as I hear say.    Yet what is love, I pray thee show.  A thing that creeps, it cannot go;  A prize that passeth to and fro;  A thing for one, a thing for mo;  And he that proves must find it so:  And this is love, sweet friend, I trow.   -- Sir Walter Ralegh

      A Poem for Friends....    Friendship   Such love I cannot analyse: It does not rest in lips or eyes, Neither in kisses nor caress. Partly, I know, it's gentleness  And understanding in one word  Or in brief letters. It's preserved By trust and by respect and awe. These are the words I'm feeling for.  Two people, yes, two lasting friends. The giving comes, the taking ends. There is no measure for such things. For this all Nature slows and sings.

       Aren't We Arty Farty   My my my... Looking at all the poems posted here, it seems we are being arty farty eh? Poems have so many uses. To let someone know of one's love for him/her, to tell the tale of war and pain and to weep for loss of loved one.   If something doesn't rhyme, I don't get it. :) That's the extent of my poetry knowledge. Don't expect me to do a PC (practical criticism) on it. I did it in JC and sucked real bad at it. But I love poems and the way certain emotions can be beautifully conveyed.   A Haiku by yours truly....   It's late at night now I'm thinking too much about Some things I can't have.

      funny poem haha...  12 Modern Days of Christmas  On the first day of Christmas  My true love gave to me  A cell phone with digital display. It glows in the dark,  And sings to me, the tune of 'Yesterday'      On the second day of Christmas My true love gave to me A Mastercard and Visa With a twenty dollar limit on each.   On the third day of Christmas My true love gave to me her warmth A tender hand to hold, a steamy cup Of coco, then she pointed the way home ~  On the fourth day of Christmas My true love gave to me her spirit of  Caring mixed with a song to sing upon a star In praise of the season, and a vision of faith In the image of three Magi traveling afar ~   On the fifth day of Christmas My true love gave to me Five Enron shares With an option to purchase more    On the sixth day of Christmas My true love gave to me Six long stem roses With the bill addressed to me  On the seventh day of Christmas My true love gave to me Seven nights of the week~Blessed To hear him snoring, lying next to me   On the eigth day of Christmas My true love gave to me Eight days in Baghdad At a two star hotel  On the ninth day of Christmas My true love gave to me Nine AAA batteries Just in case....   On the tenth day of Christmas  My true love gave to me Ten packs of Tylenol  And a wish list hanging on the tree  On the eleventh day of Christmas  My true love gave to me Eleven silver sprockets And a subscription to swimsuit illustrated for him  On the twelfth day of Christmas  My true love gave to me A red velvet cake And a poem of promise, To love me for all eternity

      In tune with nephthys' valentine's daily blog, here' s my contribution for singles who fret about getting attached.. :) This is very much filtered from a buddhist website ...  Wednesday, January 15, 2003   A "Love Letter" to a Friend Dear Xin,  All we have now is this moment to relish, to live in. Why fret being single when single? Why fret being married when married? If the situation can be changed to what your heart desires, do it. If not, enjoy this moment without lament. Live happily in each moment, moment to moment. This is your life now. Don't let it slip away.  The fail-proof way to attract love is to be a loving person to everyone, even strangers. People love loving people; the unloving are more "unlovable." If someone is attracted to you in the moment because of your loving-ness, relish the moment of being loved and make the next decision from there...

        A Song of Daphne to the Lute    My Daphne's Hair is twisted Gold,  Bright stars a-piece her Eyes do hold,  My Daphne's Brow inthrones the Graces,  My Daphne's Beauty stains all Faces,  On Daphne's Cheeks grow Rose and Cherry,  On Daphne's Lip a sweeter Berry,  Daphne's snowy Hand but touch'd does melt,  And then no heavenlier Warmth is felt,  My Daphne's voice tunes all the Spheres,  My Daphne's Music charms all Ears.  Fond am I thus to sing her praise ;  These glories now are turn'd to Bayes.  --John Wyly  Anyone who did sec 4 Lit poems would remember this I think ;)

       There is a pleasure in the pathless woods   There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, There is a rapture on the lonely shore, There is society, where none intrudes, By the deep sea, and music in its roar: I love not man the less, but Nature more, From these our interviews, in which I steal From all I may be, or have been before, To mingle with the Universe, and feel What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.  Lord Byron   I love this poem because it describes to the T what I feel in this one line: I love not man the less, but Nature more

       Pulling an "All-in-one"   I apologise for the all in one post. I should really check this blog more often... :)   1) Happy Chinese New Year (Its not too late is it?)   2) Concerning Families: I never realised how many cousins I have till I did a head count the other day. 42 cousins (excluding my two siblings and me). The worst (or best depending on how you look at it) is they're all in Singapore. Its no wonder I find family gatherings so.... stifling...   3) Children: Children are annoying. This is my personal opinion (I don't expect everyone-or anyone for that matter- to share it with me). Actually, no, I find babies much much worse.  I find them gross. There is something in a baby that just triggers such disgust in me. This of course, I have to hide because, who doesn't like babies? You have to seriously be abnormal to hate babies right? Because they're just to loveable. I just want to puke. I don't find them cute, I don't like their overly large eyes. I don't like how they smell (puke and milk is not a good smell you guys...). And I dislike Anne Geddes with all of my heart. They don't do anything interesting, they cry and puke a lot. What I don't understand is why adults like to carry babies and the pass them around to other adults. I always go "pass" when they get to me and that's when I get the questioning looks and the raised eyebrows. The only time I can tolerate babies is when they're asleep. And even then I don't find them cute. They just look peaceful and I respect that.   Anyway, back to children, most children in Singapore are ill-mannered. They are also selfish and think the world of themselves. This reflects upbringing. I must admit I have encountered well mannered and likeable children but they are few and hard to come by. So as a general rule, I find children unlikeable too. When there are nice children though, I find I take to them almost immediately. I like the whole "child's perspective" thing and how they're always curious, and get excited for some things. In other words, how they're not jaded. If I could maintain that state most of my life, I think I'll be happy.

       Beyond Our Shores   I rarely write about events that occur outside our little island, but the world is in a turmoil. We are plagued by tragedies and bad news. How much tragedy can the human race take? When has living become so difficult? The talk of war, the rise of terrorism, economic uncertainty, the destruction of nature and more recently, the space tragedy makes one wonder when life will ever be pleasant again. Reading the newspapers have become such a chore lately. War, water issues, death. This Earth is sick and its inhabitants are doing their best to aid in its demise. I long to see the light at the end of this long and dark tunnel; a light which may not cure this diseased world but at least will bring some smidgen of hope.   Perhaps, it pays not to dwell too much on the bigger picture. At least by writing about mundane events in my life I can still believe that life is normal. So while the world goes on about war and other crisis, I shall create a nice little bubble to live in, and be happy for the small things in life, because that is my way of dealing with all that pain.

       Paradiso Perduto (Lost Paradise)   The beach is supposed to be a paradise, a place where one can relax and be one with nature. Sadly, it is not possible to do that anymore. The beach is now crowded with beachgoers who bring all their inconsiderate behaviour with them. Cycling along the tracks is akin to driving on the PIE, no, actually it's much worst. No one drives on the wrong side of the road on the PIE, but people will not hesitate to cycle on the wrong side. Why?? Doesn't it make more sense to follow the direction painted on the track? It is less hassling to keep to one side of the tracks because one wouldn't have to worry abt the on-coming traffic. But NO. It is also a wonder how people can ignore the cyclist who rings his bell to ask them to move a side. [groan] Many a time I did that, people (usually KIDS!) just start back blankly at me and REFUSED to move! Hey pal, this is the cycling track, if you're walking stay on YOUR side of the track. I actually told them off. I really did. The joy of cycling died that day. The next time I cycle, I'd make sure I wouldn't do it on a weekend, or even during the day. I'd do it at night, on a day where there would be less people.   The beach is supposed to be a paradise. I wonder when did it all go wrong.

       Shall I Compare Thee, (Sonnet XVIII)   Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day? Thou are more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And Summer's lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd: But thy eternal Summer shall not fade Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st; Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st: So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

       The Great Equalizer   Writing about sleeping on the mrt got me thinking and I realised that the MRT is the great equalizer. One can have a PhD and can still behave like the ah-beng who didn't get his O level cert. It doesn't matter who you are or what you look like, your behaviour on the MRT makes you equal with every other passenger there.   Notice how before the train reaches the station, everyone will wait anxiously in front of the station door, despite the yellow sign demarking the area to stand. Businessmen stand side by side with the coffeeshop auntie. All having the same intention: to get through the door as soon as possible and zoom in on a seat. Once the train door opens, it's every man for himself. Thin, fat, tall, short, old or young, no one actually cares. It's a dog eat dog world out there. Everyone wants a seat and the fastest one will get it. I especially hate the ladies (usually they are ladies) who literally push themselves in and barge their way to a seat.   Notice also how not many are willing to give up their seat to the elderly or the pregnant lady. There are a few exceptions to that but the majority will just turn a blind eye towards it. Many people have different tactics to ignoring them. Some pretend to sleep, some feign ignorance but others, others just stare back blankly as if daring the old man or pregnant lady to shove them off their seat.   Oh man.. and the kids. That is my main gripe. Kids who swing from bar to bar and use the pole as an obstacle course. Worst still, parents that ignore them. Whoever said that kids are cute obviously haven't been on the mrt, cos they are at their least cutest there. I think kids will purposely wait to get on the train before they let loose the monster that possessed them. I've seen kids screaming, kids crying, kids screaming some more and kids doing every un-cute thing they can think of. [shudder]

       Sleeping in my car(riage)   I love observing people on the mrt. It makes good fodder for enterainment and gives me something to write about. No prizes for guessing what I'm going to write about today. Yes, sleeping on the train. From experience, I can tell you that sleeping on the train is extremely uncomfortable. One can hardly find a good "spot" to lean against, unless one doesn't mind leaning against the oily glass at the sides. More often than not, people will usually lean back against back glass or keep their heads straight.   Deep in sleep, people will hardly realise what they are doing. So, occasionally, you'll get those who end up leaning precariously on one side, encroaching his/her neighbor's space. Their heads usually bob up and down and when they lean too far to one side, they'd automatically jerk back to position, only to start leaning once they've positioned themselves properly. I've encountered some of those people and depending on my mood, sometimes, I'd usually just let them lean against me. I can remember one incident where a plus-sized man was leaning against me. It was gross cos he was snoring at the same time. Haha.. i didn't know how to get him back into place without being rude. So what I did was to slowly nudge him upright with my body. Yeah, i pushed against him and he was startled by the sudden movement. With a nice little grunt, he sat upright and promptly fell asleep again.   People also sleep with their mouths open and sometimes snore. It's very interesting to observe them.

       Sightings   As I was walking around in Orchard the other night, I noticed something about Singaporean women. They are awfully thin! Whoever said that obesity was on the rise got his facts wrong! Almost every woman/lady had thighs half the size of mine. They, in their hipsters and itsy bitsy tops, walking on their small feet. How I envied them, me with my big thighs and hips. People tell me that big hips are good for childbirth. That's fine and good   IF   I was pregnant now or REMOTELY thinking of getting pregnant. But I'm not and a big hip is the last thing I need in my life.   So anyway, I also noticed that Singaporean women look much better than the men. Haha, sorry guys, but that's the truth. I am sure that there are very good looking men out there but in general, the average woman looks better than the average man. In that sense, the males are lucky cos they have a wide range of women to date whereas, the women have a limited choice of men. ;p (hmm.. maybe that's why I'm still unattached....haha..   NOT!  ).

      Another poem. This time it's not sad, (like the first one) nor funny (like the second). This one is by Yeats, and one of my favorites as well.    He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven   Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,  Enwrought with golden and silver light,  The blue and the dim and the dark cloths  Of night and light and the half-light,  I would spread the cloths under your feet:  But I, being poor, have only my dreams;  I have spread my dreams under your feet;  Tread softly because you tread on my dreams  W.

Highlights  Nicole looked  HOT  (screw tom cruise for divorcing her), Adrian Brody totally frenched Halle Berry, some fat guy who won the short film award started critising Bush, amidst cheers and jeers from the audience, Peter O'Toole is still alive, so is Kirk Douglas (i'm sure both of them are on the wrong side of 90 by now), Steve Martin was funny, Sean Connery was wearing this odd suit, J.Lo was nicely covered up in a lime green dress, Adrian Brody won for best actor, Nicole for Best Actress, Chicago for Best Movie and Roman Polanski for Best Director and the biggest surprise, in my opinion, was that Eminem won the song of the year award.

       More couple tales   I've not written on this for quite some time now, mainly cos i've not seen anything worth writing about. But tonight is a different story. I was on the MRT, on my way back to school, when a couple walked in. There were not so many couples in that carriage tonight, so it was easier to observe them. Are all couples by nature very clingy? Not emotionally, (who can tell if a couple is emotionally clingy?), but physically. This girl had her hands wrapped around one of her boyfriend's arms. But of course, he didn't exactly discourage her from doing that. This was obvious because when they sat down, he placed that particular arm on her side of the chair. Do you get what i mean? Let me try to describe it. He was sitting on her left. She was clinging on to his right arm. So, that right arm was placed on the chair on her right. Geddit?  That's not the grossest part. The grossest part was when they started scratching each other. That was funny. I've never seen couples scratch one another in public before. At first she was just rubbing her hands over his arm (yes the arm that she was clinging to). I suppose she was feeling his muscles at the same time (he had very nice biceps, if i must say so). He, in turn, used his free hand, ie his left hand, to rub whichever arm that was closest to him. So, they looked like they were trap in a blizzard and the only way to keep warm was to rub their arms.   And so the scratching begins. As one of his hands was "trapped" by the vine that is her arm, he could not scratch the itch that appeared on his left (free) arm. And you know what he did? He pointed to it, and she happily scratched it. It was not a fervent scratching like one would do for a bad itch, but it was more, rubbing with nails. Rub rub rub, she went. Then he pointed to another itch that conveniently appeared on the trapped arm, and she scratched that for him. You know what they reminded me of? Ever seen chimps scratching each other, looking for fleas? Yeah, that's what they reminded me of. It was funny and disgusting at the same time.   Thank goodness they were on the train for about a few stops only. Haha..

       Tales of the Funny  Singapore International Comedy Festival - Ross Noble in "Sonic Waffle"      Review time! I went for a stand up comedy show last night by Ross Noble from the UK. This is his 2nd time in Singapore for the Comedy Fest and I must admit I went for the first one as well. Long story as to why my friends and I went for his show again.   Anyway, he is slightly better this time round as compared to two years ago. His jokes are more slapstick and dumb as opposed to being witty. He is funny, but not as funny as the first stand-up comedian that came 5 years ago (I forgot his name, but man, that guy was HILARIOUS). If you like jokes about how man can milk cows while drivng (long story, don't ask) then you'd enjoy the show. He did recycle some of his jokes though.. something about "hair" and "humidity" and things you say when you're having sex.

       Say What?   With all the talk about the war, I found a new word that i like. I like the sound of it.    " blitzkrieg "  - A swift, sudden military offensive, usually by combined air and mobile land forces. Of German origin.  To lighten the mood, i'll be going for a comedy festival show tonight (woohoo!). Will do a recap when I'm back.

       Oh what a night!   Oh what a night it was. We were supposed to have our post-FYP celebration tonight. After much debate about the choice of clubs, we decided to try out a new place instead of our usual Wednesday haunt. Boy, what a mistake that turned out to be. Our first choice had potentially good music but nobody was dancing. Apparently, Wednesdays are reserved for drinking and not dancing. We then decided to go back to our usual place, as good music was a given and the crowd would be on their feet the whole night through. However, certain establishments are just so anal that they would not allow a person in without proper identification, despite futile attempts to convince them otherwise. [As you can see, the night isn't going so well for us right now].  We then decided to go to a new place which has been deemed as "hip" and "happening". ID was not a problem and we soon figured out why. But first, upon reaching the inner sanctum of the club, we had to purchase our drink before we entered. The place was almost empty, save for a few people milling around and smoking. ID was not a problem namely because they needed the crowd to keep their cash registers ringing. The music was not of our taste, ie alot of drums and bass and no lyrics. [If I were high, I could have danced, but since I don't drink, that was going to be a non-occurring event.] The management was very smart. They made patrons buy their first drink before entering so that even if they were to leave, they would have already spent at least $10 on drinks. Sigh, we left soon after finishing our drinks. Oh dear, it was already a quarter to 1 and still no place to go.   But we persevered. We returned to our original choice to see if the crowd was better. It was, but no one was dancing on the dance floor and the music had degenerated to more drum and bass. [What's with that?] Ok. This was getting tiring. So many clubs in one location and yet there was no where else to go! Some places were even empty! Finally, we chanced upon a place that had a lot of people. And, gosh, there were lots of people. So far so good. The music was good and people were dancing. After much squeezing, we found ourselves a choice location on the dance floor. But the inevitable happened: Mr Drum and Bass appeared. [Groan] By this time, we had more or less given up hope of actually enjoying ourselves. We left the joint at half past 2 and headed straight for Fong Seng's.   Oh what a night.......

       MORE MOVIE REVIEWS  (oh god noooooooooooooooooooooo!)   3) Hot Chicks   Another lame-brained movie starring Rob Schneider (what's with him and B-grade flicks?). In case you don't know, he's the guy who acted in  Deuce Bigelow, Male Gigolo . So 'nuff said. You know what kind of movie this is. Cheerleader, prom-queen-wannabe, ms diva is  like  so popular in school and she has  like  all her posse with her  like  all the time.  Like  totally. And  like  she bought this cool earrings from this  like  African-ish store. What she doesn't know is  like  the earrings have the ability to swap the identities of the wearer.  Like  if I were to wear one, and you  like  wore the other one, our identities would  like  swtich.  Like  isn't that cool? [The paragraph above must be said in a bimbo voice]   So, anyway, Ms Prom here and her friends banged into some guy and they dropped all their shopping [gasp!] including the earrings. So blah blah blah, Ms Prom wore one earring, so did the guy (wtf? why wld a guy wear 1 earring? it's not even a stud. it's one of those horrendously ornate earrings that dangle). They swapped identities.. and it all goes downhill from there.   Ratings: Never going to watch it again. Luckily I didn't watch this at the cinema.

       2) Daredevil       This is another movie that I didn't watch fully. And it's got nothing to do with the language barrier. This movie just sucked. I didn't like it. I watched the first 50 mins and skipped all the way to the last 10 mins. There's nothing much to say. Blind guy becomes superhero. Miraculously, he falls for CUTE, HOT gal, while fighting the villains of the world, namely Kingpin and Bullseye. See, even the names sound corny. Kingpin? What kind of name is that? And why is he so lucky as to be able to catch himself a HOT CHICK? huh? Why can't he fall for a gal who looks like Robert Schneider in "Hot Chicks" (another review coming soon)?? Sheesh..   Ok actors:  Blind guy is Ben Affleck (the guy who can't act) Hot gal - Jennifer Garner (and boy is she HOT) Kingpin - Michael Duncan Clark or was it Michael Clark Duncan? (The green mile freak) Bullseye - Collin Farrel (Irish hunk, who's not so hunky in this show)  Ratings: Puhleeze, I couldn't even finish watching the download.

       Ok more Reviews  (i'm on a roll here)  Some of you may wonder what the hell do I do with my time since I seem to be reviewing alot of movies lately. I'm not as free as you may like to think. I watch all these movies over lunch/dinner or any meals I have whenever I'm in hall. :)    1) 8 Femmes (8 Women)     As much as i'd like to review this show, I can't. First, I've not finished watching the show. Secondly, the reason why I've not finished watching the show is cos I don't understand it. This show is in French and while the quality of the download is incredibly good (it's a DVDrip, btw), it has no friggin subtitles. It's a headache to follow their dialogue. I gave it my best shot. I lasted abt half of the show before I gave up cos my head was pounding. This show isn't like Taxi (another French movie) where one can rely on the actions to understand the movie.  Au contraire , this movie is similar to Gosford Park, a movie where dialogue is  tres importante  (very important). My French is very rusty, it has to be. The last time I had to listen to unsubtitled French was when I was in France, donkey years ago.   So, what I managed to gather from the show: It's actually a good show, very campy but not in a cheesy sorta way. The characters are all women and the plot is: The patriach was killed one snowy morning. Who killed him? Is it his powerful but unhappy wife? Or one of his two daughters? Or is it his mother-in-law? It could also be his spinster sister-in-law. Don't forget there are 2 housekeepers who may have a reason to kill that bastard. Then, there is the sudden appearance of his sister.... Each of them have a motive. But only one killed him.   I don't know who's the killer, neither have i figured out exactly what their motives are. There are light hearted segments found in the show, namely all those songs that each character has to perform. It's hilarious.

       Movie Review    How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days  (Chick Flick alert!!!)     This movie isn't out yet. :) Thanks to the wonders of Kazaa, one can now watch it esp if one does not want to throw $6.50 down the drain. If you think this movie is a romantic comedy, then Ding! you're right! This movie stars Kate Hudson ("Almost Famous", spawn of Goldie Hawn) and Matthew McConaughey ("The Wedding Planner", I dunno who his parents are). It's a cute, fluffy, feel good show. No braincells are needed to enjoy the movie.    Sigh. Must I get into the details of the plot? Naw.. Not gonna.   Kate Hudson is a delight. She's cute and perky but not annoying like Reese Witherspoon in "Legally Blonde" or "Sweet Home Alabama", shows which I've (unfortunately) watched. Matthew McConaughey isn't what I'd call a typical romantic hero but he can carry his role well enough. Unlike most shows, there is only ONE sex scene! Think you heard wrong? No. There really is only ONE sex seen and the most one would see is a bare shoulder. No boobies, no mid-riffs. Surprising eh?   The supporting cast add to the laughs as well. However, not much screen time is given to each of them. I barely remembered their (real and reel) names. The typical ingredients for a romantic comedy are all there: The cute/lovable main characters with their odd, romantically challenged best friends, the light soundtrack, the cute but weird-looking pet and more lovable people. It's all sunshine and happiness over in la-la land people, so pack your bags and get ready for the trip. This show, like its predecessors, is enjoyable but utterly forgettable.   Ratings: I'd watch it, only if someone paid for it.

       Sights and Sounds   I was out today. It was a bad idea though. Never go out on a Sunday especially during the school holidays. I had a simple plan: Go to Suntec and have a look at the IT fair. Sounded simple right? But it seemed that every other Singaporean had the same plan as well. At Suntec, I was surrounded by all those aunties, uncles, yuppie types, couples, expats, tourists and of course KIDS. Everyone was heading to the 4th floor of the Convention Centre. I could feel the beginnings of a headache. It was going to be a loooooong afternoon. The IT Fair was packed like sardines. No, not even sardines, it was even worst. If a fire broke out, I swear, there would be a stampede.   Going to the fair, one wouldn't know that Singapore is in the midst of a recession looking how people were just merrily spending their money away. "Ooh, let's buy a printer," says one. "Nah, how about a digicam?," says the other. First one says, "How about both?" "Sure!" says No 2. That's just a hypothetical conversation between 2 people but it sure conveys the buying atmosphere there. Tons of people were carting around huge boxes, Lexmark, Olympus, HP, Acer and lots of other brands. If I had $1,788 I would have gotten myself the 12" Ibook. Such a bargain and it looks soooo pretty. Aesthetically very pleasing. But alas, some people aren't just born with a silverspoon in her mouth.   I left the fair partly cos I was suffocating in there and partly cos I've done all the sightseeing I wanted to do. The rest of Suntec was just as crowded, unfortunately for me. 1 place wasn't very crowded though, the Times bookstore. Haha.. Singaporeans aren't big fans of reading I suppose.

       Mundane Info   For those who actually care, I CUT my hair! yes ppl, that's my great big announcement for the week. I must say, I totally love it! :) No more tying.. no more looking for scrungees, no more having hair stuck in my face all the time, hair in my food and hair all over the place! This new hair cut isn't as short as my previous ones (for those who know me for a long time, u'll know that i love cutting my hair as short as possible). Nope. This new hairdo is a la meg ryan's. Yup. slightly above shoulder-lenght and the ends are curling out. :) Heee.. I'm pleased with it.

         Long Live the Mac  Yes, it's been awhile, but I am finally posting something, to demonstrate solidarity with all Mac fans... It is time the world revolted against the tyranny of Microsoft.. too long have we been held in captivity by the Gates, forced to suffer blue screens, infestations of bugs, and poor surfing conditions... too long have we been fooled by updates that promise to end our misery but in fact, cause more... too long, too long have users been crushed under the weight of unreasonably priced software that promises to crash at the very first use... It is time... power to the people... we have the right to long computer life, liberty from frozen PCs and the pursuit of happy, stress-free computer activity... Give me a Mac and give me death to Microsoft!

       Attack of the stupid computers (and stupid computer users)    Ok sorry for ranting here, but well, it is a mundane rant.   So anyway, my friend bought a PC right? And it got here on Friday. Yesterday (Saturday) it was already f*cking up and doing stupid things and bringing up those little messages it does to annoy the hell out of you. And it does this when she does the smallest things! Like resizing her IE window. Hell, it does it when she opens IE! Its so dumb! And it keeps saying "do you want to report this to Microsoft?" What the hell man. Shouldn't Microsoft test drive its bloody products before shipping them out? I mean surely, getting IE up and running without driving the rest of the computer completely beserk is  quite essential . It is afterall a web browser, and the first thing most people do when they get a computer is usually to surf the web, check email etc. I was over in her room trying to "fix" the problem. This on the  second day  they don't even bother giving you a grace period of a week anymore. The programme just comes with holes and bugs and you're expected to "fix it" by downloading updates and by "reporting problems to Microsoft".  Meanwhile, the ctrl+alt+del button is already worn out...   THIS is why I use a Mac. It may not be 100% compatible with a windows network (ala NUS), but stuff that! Why would I want to be compatible with something that crashes with the click of a mouse? I don't have to download 21 updates when I first installed my new OS. In fact, I think it was more like 3 updates. I have to pay for Mac support? Stuff that too! I can ask other mac users and they'll probably have an answer to my question or at least know where to look for an answer. Better than calling the resident computer guy, who of course, will "fix" the problem on the PC, (which always comes back later) and strangely, he doesn't know how he fixed it either. Dodgy anybody? Sure, my mac freezes from time to time, but I find that that only seems to happen when I'm using Office programmes like word, and excel, which are of course, quality Microsoft products (yes we do have MS Office for Macs, and Microsoft seems to think that Office runs better on a Mac than on their windows counterpart, they look better, I'll give you that!). So in conclusion, Microsoft should stop shipping crap, and stop making people pay money for the crap they ship. Its no wonder people go for pirated versions. I mean seriously, if I had paid US$199.95 for something that drives me insane, I'd be pretty damned pissed!   That is my rant. I'm going back to sleep now.

We're just in a lull, sorta like the calm before the storm, a hiatus of sorts, so enjoy it while it lasts ;)

        Random Musings   It's a good thing this site is nicely known as "Tales of the Mundane" and makes no bones about it's lack of thought-provoking content. However, it has de-generated to an all time low, comprising of mainly answers to dysfunctional tests. What have we learnt so far, boys and girls? Well, for one, there are 3 strippers on this site, chiefly, Victoria Nun, Nicky Dipple and the mama of all whores, Prima Donna. We've also learnt that telling the difference between one's arse and elbow is NOT an easy feat, unless you're a girl. And lastly, that we have strange personality disorders.   Good stories are sure hard to find nowadays. And yeah, I do admit that there has been a dearth of juicy news to keep myself entertained. Life has been very monotonous since the start of the holidays, even beyond mundane.   On the bright side of life, there are tons of good movies out, or coming soon. I guess, it's to coincide with the OSCARS!! (aka wayang festival)   In the meantime, make do with dysfunctional tests and whatever lah, cos  frankly my dear, i don't give a damn .

       The Return of the Sloth   I had 2 wake-up calls today.. and none of them worked. This is in addition to the 2 wake up calls i had in the middle of the night. I had such big plans. To do my work til 3, sleep and wake up at 7 to continue. However, things never go according to plan. I was so damn tired by 1.30 that I asked for a wake up call at 2am. When 2 am came, I prolonged it by asking for another call at 2.30. This time it almost worked. I got up, did my work but fatigue overcame me by 3.30. Sigh... Wake up calls at 7 am and 8 am respectively failed to rouse me from my slumber. I answered the calls, chatted with them for a few minutes, and promptly went back to sleep.

I'm not saying it's cheap, but considering that I was willing to pay $600 for one, this is a bargain. And it's an  OLYMPUS ! How cool is that?   Hee so anyway, I'm going to take a look at it today with my mom. Heh.. If all goes well, oh man.. I don't even want to think about the things I can do with that camera! Watch out pple!

       On My  Kawfee  break   Going to do another all-nighter tonight. Heh. Did one last night. Wasn't entirely productive cos I was watching 2 eps of Friends and 2 eps of Gilmore Girls intermittently. But I did finish what I set out to do. Tonight, I've got 2 more chapters left to read. It's approaching 2 am in the morning [Geez, what's with the number 2?] and I've just had my midnight soup snack. Am feeling bloated and a little tired as well. I refuse to drink coffee this late at night as it will never be able to sleep once I'm done.   Today was a screwed up day. Due to my all-nighter last night, I only slept at 6 and woke up close to 12. I missed my Gilmore Girls cos I badly needed my twilight nap. Haha. But I did get some semblance of work done in between the slothing. Now, my eye hurts, I don't have a friggin' clue why. WTF. The last thing I need is a swollen eye.   Oh crap. I'm sleepy already. Think I'll have to drink my coffee. Desperate times call for desperate measures. As it is, I'm pretty miffed by the fact that my NUS friends are either done with their exams or will be done by the end of the week. Bleah.

       AMERICAN IDOL BITCH-RANTS   I'm soooo happy! The goat girl aka Carmen Rasmussen from American idol has been voted off the show! About bloody time is what I'm saying. The adoring American public has finally caught on to the fact that the girl can't sing. She can't. Like I'm sure her weird sounding voice would be great in future, but, honey, the American Idol is just not for you. The public has finally redeemed itself. Her fan base has been immense considering that singers better than her have not lasted as long as she. Think about it. Kimberly C, although, sounded errr.. abit screamy at times, was alot better than her. Sigh..   So anyhoo, Carmen was awful although I must admit her swansong performance was one of her better ones. And the whole episode of her and Clay faux smooching while singing that group song last week was just gross. I can just go on and on about Carmen.   Yay to Carmen getting voted off! Actually she wasn't voted off, but her votes weren't enough to keep her in. Maybe people from the state of Utah finally switched on the volume of their TV and realised her singing was just plain awful. Ok.. I'll stop with the singing already. hee.. but i'm glad. Only 5 more weeks till the end of Idol.   [for those not in tune with AI, too friggin' bad]

       my two cents   My two cents, don't worry, i've got lots to spare. I would normally wait, which is my usual stand in situations like these. But I'm no expert, seeing as I'm not in any relationship right now and my "wait and see" approach has been operating at a 100% failure rate. So I guess, my advice here shouldn't be taken at all. heh..   I think going with the flow is a conservative approach. I'm sure you could just jump in and declare your undying affection towards her, but that would just scare her away wouldn't it? You could shake a "magic 8-ball" if you can find one of those here and ask the all important question: "should i tell her?"  Maybe hinting is a good way. Girls are more receptive to hints than guys. Haha. I think with a guy, even if you drop a 1-tonne hint, it would never work. You can hint yourself to death, and he still wouldn't get it. But that's a different story altogether. Anyway, this is just my opnion.   In other news  I lost one of my earrings just now. Bleah, how sad. First my pencil now my earring. Gotta get myself a new pair now.

       The case of the ex   Do you still have artefacts from previous relationships lying around at home? I do. Not because I want to keep the memories, but because I couldn't be bothered collecting and returning them to their rightful owner. Heck, I think that if he wanted it, he could have asked me for it cos they are his things, not mine.   So anyway, in light of all this SARS thing, one of the best things that I have from that relationship is a thermometer. Hee.. it's one of those digital thermometers. So fun taking my temperature whenever I'm home. Haha, good thing that the ex's dad is a doctor.

      Just came back from a faaaaaantaaaaaaaaastic swim. 30 laps. That's 10 laps more than usual and I'm friggin' exhausted. The weather is perfect for an afternoon swim; there were hardly any clouds and it's so bright and cheery. Decided to swim more to make up for my pig-out session last night. Cheesecake, a brownie and a pot of coffee for dessert, shared between just two people. Haha. Only dessert, mind you. Doesn't include the dinner we had before that.   Yesterday was a day of firsts. Bhavish actually cancelled a clubbing outing! Time to buy 4-D. haha.. To quote him "Straits are as dire as ever" therefore we met up at Holland Village for some indulgence. Hence, the splurge on food.   Which brings us to now. :) Going to take my shower soon but not before I gripe about my pencil.  I lost it. My favourite (actually, my only) blue pencil. I had a mild scare sometime during the semester, but it was a false alarm. This time, however, I really lost it. It went missing last week and  I wanted to buy the exact one however, Popular Jurong Point didn't carry that particular type of pencil.  I wonder why. So anyway, I bought this reasonably priced (ok ok, it was cheap-o lah. About $1.50) pencil which totally died on me the next day. Some metal thing came out of the tip of the pencil and the lead kept breaking. To cut the long story short, I went to Popular Tampines last night to buy my original pencil. And do you know how much it cost?  $3.90!!  That's close to four friggin' dollars! How can that be possible? It's like a meal already. To top it all off, they didn't carry the colour I wanted! I had to buy a yellow one cos the pink was just too    PINK    But, at least now I have my pencil back. hee...

       i've found THE WAY   yes... i've finally made my choice... well, sortof... assuming dat OY doesnt pull any stunts to change things... im a sucker for damsels in distress  rite... to give some backgrd info in a nutshell... by some God-engineered twist in my life last wk, i came to have kindof confused feelings for 2 gals: E n OY...  well, OY was almost the complete prototype dat i envisioned in the past... sporty, extremely similar to me in character n probly more intellectually compatible to me between the 2 gals... unfortunately, ppl wif such a personality, like i do, ar very hard to understand wif complicated moods n almost impossible to demistify...  E is the shy type, not so sporty but likes sports nonetheless... less of an enigma, more reciprocal n hence, i felt, a better choice...  dun look at me dat way! at least i didnt throw a die!  yep... n so i shall chase my dream.........

      I love being at home during the day. There's no one to piss me off, no one to tell me to clean up the house. It's like the greatest feeling (at least for this time of the day). I have the food to munch on, my bed, my TV, heee...   Nothing happening in my life to bitch or rant about. Have not been on the MRT either so no icky couple behaviour to report on.   FYI, for those who actually care, Mariah Carey has postponed/cancelled (don't know which one) her concert which was supposed to be on the 11th of June.   Sigh.. the angelfire site is down. Can't tweak my site today. It's so exciting! and incredibly geeky as well.. hahaha... Will post up the addy soon, errr.. think in abt 1 mth cos there isn't any way I can finish it soon. Takes too bloody long with all that html coding shit. I can now proudly say, I know how to make colour changes on hyperlinks and stuff. Hahaha.. Attempted Javascript, and am still lost despite copying the entire script from the tutorial website. Oh well, in time to come, I suppose, I'll eventually know how to do it.

       It's a MONDAY!   It's a monday and i'm finally going home after being here during the weekend. "Here" meaning my hall. It has been a loooooong and extremely solitary weekend with no human contact whatsoever. I didn't get much work done as always. I'm amazed at my ability to waste time even when I've got nothing much to do or no one to talk to. I have a new hobby, which is totally geeky, but it's tons of fun. This whole making a website thing is soooooooo much fun!   In other news, the yahoo photo album would be deleted once a new site has been found. I'm in the midst of working on one, but I doubt it would be ready by May or even after that. Haha. HTML coding is exhausting. Hee....

       Dear dream chaser ,  Your soliloquy was touching. The criteria we have for our dreamguy/girl are just guidelines to aid in looking for or choosing the most suitable person for ourselves. Just like rules, such criteria can be thrown down the drain in any event one finds an "unsuitable" girl/guy attractive and would like to give "it" a shot. Some people just hold on to the criteria/guidelines/benchmark tighter than others. Criteria or rather lack of criteria doesn't equate to an unhappy or unsatisfying relationship.   To a certain extent, having preconceived expectations about one's dreamgirl/guy limits one's choices. It is best to just enjoy the moment. You like a girl? She likes you  back? All fine and well. Talk it out and see how things go. Not all attractions would end up as relationships. Don't know if you like a girl but you keep thinking about her? Then, throw out all your criteria and concentrate on the girl's attractive qualities and decide if you want to get involved with that person.   Things aren't as complicated as we make them out to be. I wish you luck in your search.... :)

       Dear Aunt Agony,   okok... i noe im supposed to have exams on monday... but hey, Sars didnt stop my life did it?  im not gonna let a coupla exams ruin my perfectly thrashy boring life filled wif routines of rotting in front of tv watching footie...  well... its been a really weird study break this whole week.... didnt do much of studying as usual... ended up thinking abt various personal affairs... do the criteria we set for our dreamgal or guy actually matter? i mean, we end up getting blinded anyway when things really happen, dun we? so wats the pt of tinking abt wat we want in a guy or gal in the 1st place? okie... maybe we shld werk the other way n tink abt wat we DUN want in our partners ( as a particular guru advises me to do ;p )...   i dun want my potential, future, as-yet-unfound gf to be too self-righteous n always tinking shes in the rite... even if shes rite, pls dun gloat too much...  i dun want her to be too overbearing abt being smarter than me... hey, i dun mind gals who ar smarter than me... in fact, i get impressed when i meet gals who actually ar smarter than me (not in the academic sense tho it does play a small part), since it also saves me the trouble of tinking for myself... but pls dun rub it in my face...  i dun want my gf to be a mugger only concerned abt studies n bks n werk... n earning the million bucks when shes 25...  i dun want her to be some bimbo who i cant communicate wif... no matter wat they say, i feel dat communication has to be THE most impt factor in any r/s... from the most mundane matters in life to the most abstract... she has to understand wat im saying, n of cos, vice versa... n the mutual communication definitely has to be comfortable, enjoyable n not strained or forced...  i dun want my gf to be uninterested in any sport... heck, if u dun play it, at least be excited by some kind of active sport which requires perspiring (thus bowling, 9-ball or chess doesnt count)... watching it on tv n being excited by it is fine...   okie... dats abt it... dats all i DUN want my imaginary gf to be... havent toked abt looks, but i guess im not picky so long as she doesnt turn me off at 1st sight... so where does this monologue leave me? im still stuck at square 1...... lost in the darn fog, waiting to be led out of the forest by anyone who fulfills those prerequisites... im tired of chasing the dream... y cant it look for me instead?

       Waiting for my hair to dry....   It's 4.50 in the morning and I'm waiting for my hair to dry before I go to sleep. Norah Jones is singing in the background, and I'm feeling clean and smelling good. Ahh,  c'est la vie . Another day has gone. Came back from a so-so clubbing outing. Sigh. The golden age of clubbing is coming to an end.   We had our pre-dinner drinks at Devil's Bar. Happy Hour was from 5pm to 8pm and you can get 3 mugs/jugs of Tiger beer for the price of 1. Bhavish got himself the beer at $9.50. He finished all 3 mugs by himself without puking. That guy drinks like a fish. I was happy with my virgin colada, albeit, a very tangy virgin colada. Went back to his place for dinner. Heh, parents bought Burger King for us. After which a pre-clubbing session was in order. Listened and grooved to music in his room while he read his cases.   Tonight's clubbing destination: Devil's Bar again. We got our chops during happy hour so we did not have to pay again. Place was full of NS people. Crowd was friggin' young. Don't know how they all got in since security was very anal about IDs. Our trash was played sparingly. No surprises there. Dj in the dance room played alot of bad remixes. We weren't there very long. Live room was a bit better. Band played our usual trash. Dj must have used to work at Zouk on Mambo nights cos there was a mambo phase.   By 1.30, we were bored. Went out for cheap-o drinks at the nearby 7-11. Ahh.. convenient stores are the greatest. Bought a huge drink and chips and sat down at the bus stop for a midnight snack. After pigging out, went back into Devil's bar to get my bag out of the locker. Took a walk to Hard Rock, but the place was empty. Strange. It's the end of the clubbing world as we know it.   SN buses are fantastic. The nice uncle dropped me off in front of my bus stop again. A long hot shower was needed to rid myself from all that smoke in Devil's Bar. The crowd may have thinned, but the amount of smoke was still the same. And here I am... Waiting for my hair to dry.

       NAME CHANGE   What's in a name?  In any case, the site has been changed! To go with the new look,  Tales of the Mundane  has retired and from it emerges " Lava deposits on the sandy shores of granada " courtesy of morgan hoax! woohoo... *applause*  Any objections? Frankly, I don't give a damn. It's MY SITE and i can do as I wish. [evil laughter + thunder] But you can still air your objections (hint: tagboard! tagboard!) and i may just listen to it.

       AMERICAN IDOL      I admit it, I love trashy shows.. and American idol (AI) is no exception. Although, I must admit, that it is sooooooo much better than the local talent time show we had. I watched that too, from the quarter-finals onwards. Never did bother with the heats. Same thing with AI. Only watched it from the q-finals and I am hooked! I love this show! I don't care about backstage drama, but boy, those people can SING. Ok. let me clarify. MOST of them can sing. After yesterday's show, we are left with 6 wannabes. They are: 1)  Ruben Studdard  - a BIG man, with the voice of smooth velvet. This boy can sing! A younger version of Barry WHite  2)  Clay Aiken  - Geeky guy. When I first saw him, I thought he wouldn't be able to sing. Heh, was blown away by his rendition of "open arms". He has proven each week that his voice is no fluke. The geekiness has won him many fans. But sometimes a bit too drama with the facial expressions.  3)  Kimberly Locke  - Not your typical star. First, she's on the fleshy side. But this lady has the voice of a diva. Very soulful and her renditions are more often than not, right on the money. Dressing needs some working though. Not much fan support.  4)  Josh Gracin  - The marine that never made it to Iraq. Popular with the American crowd, mainly cos he's a marine. Can do country renditions competently. But not a whole lot of talent. Getting fatter now that he's staying in that mansion with the rest of the contestants.  5)  Trenyce  - Another black singer (Kim is half black, half white). Very Diva. Dresses like one too. Has a good voice, although her performances aren't consistent.   6)  Carmen Rasmuseen  - Oh god. don't get me started on this girl. SHE CAN'T SING! Sounds like a goat/sheep/any farm animal. The only reason why she's been here for so long is cos of fan base. Fans vote for her and always garners enough votes to stay another week. UGH UGH UGH. Americans can be sooo stupid at times. Has this cutesy dollish face that is "in" and "commercial".

       YAK YAK YAK...    If it weren't for the postponement of exams, quite a number of us would have to sit for papers this weekend. But since exams now start at the end of April (yay!), everyone can enjoy the Easter weekend. I, for one, would be looking forward to all the good tv programs shown. Especially cos I'm in hall, and there aren't many ppl around. hee! but I love it, being anti-social and all....  So today, I'm looking forward to watching an old Tom Hanks classic, "Big". I totally love that show! I'm a BIG fan of Tom Hanks and I Love all his shows, except for Castaway (and that's only because i didn't watch it). So, BIG is an endearing old and feel good show. My fave scene was when he was doing that melody thing on that huuuuge keyboard. What song was it btw?   Oh, Oh, should i change the name of this website? Tales of the Mundane doesnt seem to work it for me anymore... I mean, i don't mind it. But it lacks a certain  je ne sais quoi , lacks a certain something...

        AAAAAAARGH! I HATE COMPUTERS!!!    This is it. The final straw. My bloody pc is  DYING  on me! It restarts all by itself  WHENEVER  it feels like it. No warning, no message. The monitor will turn black and i can hear my CPU whirring, and Oops! It has restarted.  WTF?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT?!  The last thing I need is a computer problem. I don't know much about it and I'm not a difficult person to please. All I ask from it is for it to work, run smoothly and have no program errors.   Which brings me to ICQ. I've never had  ANY  major problems with the ICQ program till today. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why the ICQ program  REFUSED  to load! After clicking on the flower button, the image "ICQpro2003a is loading" appears and the flower appears on the task bar.  AND THAT'S IT . The pgm doesn't start, the "loading" image doesn't disappear!! I went for a nap and when I woke up, it was  STILL  like that!  WHY??? OH GOD WHY??????? WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE SUCH MUTINY FROM COMPUTERS AND THEIR RELATED PROGRAMS?  I've never had this problem before!   Then I thought, fine, nevermind, switch to ICQlite. I've had a problem with ICQLite for some time now, but i decided to give it a shot. To prevent any problems from taking place, I uninstalled ICQlite and re download the pgm and re-installed it. Smooth sailing so far. Clicked on icqlite. Ahh.. my contact list was all there. BUT when I tried to send a message, the stupid windows said that ICQlite had an error.  WHAT ERROR? WHY? OH WHY?  And so, I had to  CLOSE  my icqlite pgm. Undeterred, I tried again. I uninstalled Icqlite and repeated the  WHOLE  process. The error log still appaered.   I was at my wits end. Then I tried uninstalling IcqPro and reinstalling it again. This time, there was an error with one file even before i clicked on the flower!!   AAAAAAAARGHHHHHHHHHHHH!    And so, now, i'm using WEB-BASED icq which is totally  RIDICULOUS  considering that I  SHOULD  be able to use  BOTH  icqlite and icqpro.    DEATH  to pcs and Icq. I want the iBOOK  NOW .

       BIMBO ALERT!   I went shopping today! *squeal* I bought 2 tops - very girly and can be used for clubbing. Actually won't wear them unless i'm clubbing. heee. but it's so fun! I've not gone shopping in such a LONG time that I've almost forgotten how good spending money feels.   I would eventually find a way to get a picture of myself wearing the tops and would definitely post it up for all to admire (and puke, whichever is more natural)! heee....

       Voice from the past   Ok not really, but its been awhile since I've said anything, and usually, I save my postings to quality comments (HAHA) but seeing how that has yet to happen, what the hell, its a blog for mundane things right?   Anyway, its been a crappy week, tests and assignments galore. I need a nice long sleep after that ordeal, and I got that last night when I fell asleep at 9 and got up at 8 this morning. Everyone is leaving for Easter Break! They have it so good here, Easter goes from Friday to Monday. Yes, they have an  Easter Monday  after Easter Sunday. Its a weird concept. Why would anyone need a holiday after a  religious  holiday? My answer to this is the drinking and revelry that goes on (I would like to say behind closed doors, but its done quite publicly, with no pretenses about being sober on the day Jesus supposedly died). There's an Easter Party tonight, with "Easter Slammers" and "Cheap Drinks". Hello? I know Jesus turned water into wine, but I'm sure this was not what he had in mind... Maybe I'm missing something here, but that's supposedly the life of a college student: Beer and loud music, oh and passing out in the hallway...  But well I don't know too much about Easter, and even less about where the Easter Bunny came into the picture, so I'll just enjoy the extra day of rest.

       What would you do if you had $25?   looking at something more reachable (sorry to be the party pooper), what would you do with that extra 25 buckeroos in your wallet? buy a cd of course! its the perfect sum and its just sitting there waiting to be spent. which conveniently brings me to my untiring plug for my much favoured disbanded psychadelic group,   the olivia tremor control      theyve disappeared into doing their own little side projects after disbanding, producing only 2 albums and quite a few brilliant singles. but you really have to get your hands on those 2 albums-   music from the unrealized film script: dusk at cubist castle  and  black foliage: animation music volume 1   locating these albums isn't easy, but keep that 25 bucks safely tucked away in your wallet just in case you spot one lying around. good luck

       So what would you do if you had $53 million?   Don't ask why I thought of the question. It's a long story, and involves alot of bitching. Hee. So what would you do if you had 53 million smackeroos? I would shop. Yeah I totally would shop. Not for clothes, but for houses. I've thought it through. I want a villa in Greece, a log cabin (3 separate buildings, including a barn) in Canada, a loft apartment in New York, and a bed and breakfast inn in France. I also would love a ski cabin and a ranch, but I shan't be greedy. I would still live in Singapore. Would love to own one of those colonial bungalows they have here. Then I'd get myself a Lear jet. So that I can fly from one home to another.   Heh.. I've not thought of other things to buy at all. Am pretty hung up over the idea of owning homes in almost all the continents on earth. Not into those fancy cars as well. Too small, although they look really gorgeous. Ahh.. who says money can't buy happiness?

       Clubbing Woes   Went to ChinaBlack tonight because Bhavish received an SMS granting him free entry to CB on Fri and Sat (NO SNEAKERS ALLOWED!). Not been there since last June. Wondered whether the revamp/renovation would do the place some good. At the lift lobby, seemed that the CB crew were CB-ed or something. The cashier lady and her 3 bouncers on the ground floor had the most  xia lan  faces I've ever seen. WTF? Long, sulky faces. They shouldn't even be working if they were that effed up.   Paid for my entry ($15) and had to place my order as well. Proceeded upstairs. First thing that struck me when we got there was that the windows were all covered. Yup. Every single inch of window was hidden behind panels. The crowd looked young. How could they get in? It was pretty empty for a Sat. Was almost 12mn. We were already bored because music wasn't too good and volume was eff-ing loud. The decor? Can't remember what the old one looked like so can't give a comparison. Security was picky. NO leaning against the sides of the dance floor. Heh. How anal.  Alot of kissing couples tonight. Why can't they just get themselves a room? Only 1am... started to yawn. Music went on a black phase after the initial trash and house. 45 mins of hiphop. Stop. My ears couldn't take it anymore. There's only so much one can club to Mary J, Eve and all your rappers. Knees were weak.  Went up to the AtticRoom. Got a drink. Ahh... had nice comfy bar stools. Dj played the generic alternative music. Not bad. Less smoky as well. Oh look! A pool table. How fun. Waiter was friendly. Oh... 2 o'clock already. Finished the drink. Had the intention of leaving A.S.A.P.  Made our way down to the main floor. More kissing couples. Ooh! Ooh! Trashy music!! Woohoo.. Felt happy again. Looked at more kissing couples. This was waaay better than an R(A) movie. Worth the $15. Ugh.. hiphop is baack. Yuck that song! "Lick my pussy and my crack" YUCK YUCK! WTF? Another hiphop phase!! Aargh. Time to leave.

       Site Updates    Ok.. as you can see, the blog site is now completely different. I would really like some feedback from all you people who actually bother coming down to the site. With the tagboard, you can now leave messages. Yes, I do read them, and so will the rest of the world. But if you aren't the kind to leave creepy messages, I don't see why it should be a problem.   One qn regarding the tagboard:  Does anyone know how to change the time of the entries? The times are all wrong.

       METZ   ooh.. Went to Metz for the second time last night. A place where I actually liked and don't mind doing a review on it. It's located at the Gallery Hotel, very near Liquid Room. The place is cozy with seats and sofas surrounding the dance floor. The resident band "Energy" plays a mixture of alternative and pop every night. They are pretty good and can sing well. Requests can be made of course, but no guarantees that they would play it. We requested John Mayer's Your Body is A Wonderland each time we went there, but they have yet to fulfill our request.  Seats are comfortable. It is advisable to make a reservation first so that the seats would be available. We had a choice spot, right at the corner, away from the dance floor and the smoke. The volume of the music was, unfortunately, very loud such that screaming was necessary in order to be heard over the din.   Mocktails were good and affordable, at $10 a glass. The drinks came in fancy cocktail glasses with cute stems.

       Bleah .  Ok. I'm bored. Have been in the computer lab since 230 this afternoon and I'm tired of reading my notes. Not that I did a whole lot of reading since, but still, I'm entitled to feel bored. Right. So, I'm bored. I've been thinking about food for the last 30 mins or so. I have a huge craving for baked rice right now, with a layer of melted cheese on top. Oooh, and a huge sandwich with everything on it: turkey, mayo, lettuce, tomato, in between focaccia bread. Now that would be absolutely fabulous. Crepe with a huge scoop of caramel ice-cream and mixed fruit is the perfect end to the perfect meal. As for drinks, well, heh, no cravings for any type of drink, but a pina colada sounds real good right about now.   Gosh, I'm hungry.   Pasta with arrabiatta sauce. Ooh.. ooh.. tortilla chips with salsa dip. Lasagna with layers, and layers of cheese. Freshly made apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.   I have to stop. I'm going to drive myself crazy if I don't.  Ok. Have to stop. Stomach is growling.

      Woohoo! The 9th season of "Friends" is back on Channel 5! I love that show and have more or less followed the happenings of Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe and Joey since day 1, donkey years ago. I've been through breakups, clumsy moments, marriage and recently, a pregnancy with them. I love all of them, although my absolute favourite has got to be Chandler. We have so much in common: we are funny, sarcastic and fun to be with. Heee.... Yesterday's episode was "The One Where No One Proposed", not their best episode but it ends the cliff-hanger from last season.   Another show that is back on 5 is "Gilmore Girls" at a weird time slot: Sunday 6pm. Now who the hell puts good tv shows at this time of the day? No one is ever home to watch it! Sometimes, Mediacorp can do the stupidest things. Quality dramas like Gilmore Girls, The Agency (heh, another favourite) and Judging Amy are scheduled at godawful times. But crapshit shows like The Bachelor and Meet the Folks are given prime slots during the week. Like excuuuuuuuuse me. Reality shows like The Amazing Race, Survivor and maybe American Idol are fine. At least they are interesting, although all the contestants are media whores at heart. But The Bachelor and Meet the Folks? I've not watched MTF, but I did catch some episodes of first season of TB (read all abt my recaps in previous posts). Who cares about women chasing after a man? Taste is a very subjective matter.   I seriously think that Mediacorp is running out of money, judging by the type of movies shown on tv. Ok, FYI, my parents have cancelled our cable subscription because i'm never home long enough to make use of it. No one else watches that much tv at home. Saturday movie slots are labelled "Stay at Home Saturdays", but what type of shows do they make you watch? Old (and crappy) shows like "Romancing the Stone". I've never heard of it. I mean, old shows like "Indiana Jones" are fun! I don't know why they don't show Indiana Jones at all. Oh. And this week, we have "Peter Benchley's Creature". I am absolutely convinced that the movie was shown last year. Freaky B-list movie about sharks with hands. UGH. And let's not forget the Seagal/Stallone/Swarzeneggar/Van Damme-type shows on Mondays.   I want my cable baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!

       Get Over You..    I always find the topic of relationships interesting to talk about. Mainly cos it's so fun to diss couples.. but that's another story altogether. The purpose of this post is to find out when is the appropriate time to date once a person has broken up with his/her ex. When a couple has been going together for 2 years and then decide to break up, would being part of a new relationship within 3 months be appropriate? I guess then, the amount of time needed to recover from the failed relationship is proportionate to the amount of emotions involved?   But then again, maybe people have different reasons for getting attached - for companionship, security, to boost one's ego, to look "cool", to cling on to another person, and a whole load of other reasons. If one's source of security (assuming that security is the reason) is lost, then it is logical to look for another one as soon as possible.   Wouldn't it be exhausting then, to have to start from scratch - The getting to know you bit, the phone calls, the reporting, the having to meet with that person all the time, basically the entire courtship routine? I don't know. After having a fuss-free life for so long, I feel exhausted just thinking of all the couple rituals one must go through when being part of a couple. And the very idea of having to repeat it all over soon after ending a relationship baffles me.

       Movie Review - Fight Club      I didn't intend to download this movie. In fact, I was actually looking for Taxi 3. However, with kazaa, one has to always remember that the file names aren't accurate. Taxi 3 (divx) was Fight Club. This movie was released in 1999 and stars Brad Pitt (so hot!) and Edward Norton (so hot!). The plot is basic, 2 guys decided to form the Fight Club, a club where ordinary men would come together and beat each other into a pulp. The fight scenes are gory. No CGI effects  a la  LOTR but just the bare essentials: 2 half naked men and their fists. The twist at the end was surprising, although it tied the movie up, I was still a little puzzled as there were small loopholes which can't be explained. (Or maybe I was just too lazy to dwell on them.)  Anyway, the 2 main leads are good. I've never been a great big fan of Brad Pitt but he was flawless in the movie as the brash, confident and sexually-unsatiable, Tyler Durton. Edward Norton was also superb as Jack (I think), the quiet, confused insomniac. The dialogue is witty and the overall feel of the movie is dark and disturbing. I liked it.   Ratings: I wld have definitely paid up to $8 for it.

       Courtesy of the letter C   i've been cajoled, coaxed, and downright coerced into composing this... i shall not cite names... im concerned enough about too many other things to care about losing my life as well  SARS has utterly crushed any social life i had that had always been conducted indoors in close confined spaces.  no Cleo party at Zouk... n paranoid-mummy-curfew has confirmed my absence from movie theatres, crowded restaurants etc for the foreseeable future... if we were in Iraq now, im certain i'd have been covered wif sand 6 feet undergrd by her juz in case i got cuffed by a bomb...  anyway... except the verbs "to be" and "have", all my verbs have commenced with the letter C.  No letter Cs were caused harm in the process.

       I love my SN uncles   The SN bus service is a weekday miracle. Wonderful for those coming back late on weekdays and don't want to waste money on cab fares. For 3 bucks, the SN uncle would drive you to the bus stop along the route. It works just like a Night Rider, except that the service is slightly more personal because the bus is smaller. FYI, it's a Bus Plus. The past 2 times i took the bus, i've been lucky to be the last person on the bus. Cos then the uncle would drop me as close to NTU as possible. The first time, the uncle dropped off at the entrance, before he turned to the highway. The 2nd time, the nice uncle (a different uncle) actually went in NTU and dropped off at the hall bus stop! :)

       Fashion faux pas   It amuses me sometimes to see the fairer sex fall prey to fashion. What's in right now? Hipster jeans. Unfortunately, not everyone can look good in a pair of hipster jeans. Just cos hipster jeans are in, doesn't mean that EVERYONE has to wear one. I don't wear one, mainly cos i look absolutely horrendous in it. I've tried. When i was at Orchard on Tuesday, I saw a girl wearing hipster jeans. One advice, if you wear hipster jeans, wear underwear, or at the very least a thong. Her jeans was soooooo low that she spent most of her time trying to pull that damn thing up. Whenever it slipped down, i could see her butt crack. I'm not kidding. I really saw her butt crack. It was NOT a pleasant sight, i can assure you. If she was thin, it may not be so bad, but she's on the fleshy side, not plump, just fleshy and seeing a fleshy butt is not good for the eyes or mind. I guess if i saw a thong, like those sexy triumph ones, it'll at least be kinky... but that sight was plain awful. I felt like going up to her and tell her to cover that up, but she was with her bf and i do not wish to incur his wrath, especially since i was by myself at that time.

       Good news? or Bad news?   Exams have been postponed by 2 wks in NTU! It has finally been confirmed this evening. It's quite a drag cos then everything has to be pushed forward by 2 wks. It is also odd to postpone exams but not cancel class. I mean, if the reason for the postponement was due to the SARS outbreak, wouldn't it make more sense to shut classes instead? Exams would still be postponed in the end. The reason given for the postponement was to allow quarantined students sufficient time to study. Hello? Doesn't anyone realise that those under quarantine would have more time to study because they can't go anywhere?   It's admirable to see the newly inaugarated president take some action to build a good rapport with the student body. I don't fully know what the forum held on tuesday was all about but it seemed as though he made the decision to postpone the exams without consulting the academic board (if there is one).   On the whole, the postponement means that i don't have to suffer from last minute panic attacks due to a lack of time to prepare for exams. However, it also means that i can't give the usual "no time to study" excuse. heh.

       MOVIE REVIEW   Ok ok. i don't think i'm invincible, but i've been dying to watch a movie for the longest time. The SARS outbreak didn't deter me, although i was abit worried. Thankfully no one coughed in the cinema. Anyway, i watched "Adaptation" last night. Err.. it's a plot-less movie, in my opinion. Slow and somewhat entertaining at certain points. Nicholas Cage was good, portraying the life of Charles and Donald Kaufman, twin scriptwriters. Meryl Streep plays the author who's book Charles is trying to write a screenplay about. Chris Cooper, who plays the main character in Meryl's book, won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.   Apparently the movie is supposed to be a comedy. It is funny and the dialogue can be witty at times. But I feel that the ending killed it for me. All that unnecessary drama was just plain UNNECESSARY.   Rating: 6.50 just cos it's an "arty" show.

       BLAH!   WAR! DISEASE! All very attention-grabbing headlines. In the past week, we have been pounded with extensive coverage of the WAR! and SARS! Let it be known that I am fully against the war on moral grounds, lest ppl may think that religion plays a factor. This constant yabbering about freeing the Iraqi people is a load of bull. No one is  that  altruistic. It is easy to destroy a country, but rebuilding it is a daunting task. (i shall stop my rants here. there would be too much to write and i'm too tired of talking about it)  The outbreak is a more pressing problem. What is the world coming to? It's all ending... it really is... We live in a sick, sick world.

       My (over-the-top) birthday wish list   -  Bloody 'ell, I can't afford to get them any time soon... hahaha   1) A Mac 15" iBook. Of course the Powerbook is great as well. 2) A super-duper DIY computer. Yes, I want to embark on a DIY computer project. I want an LCD monitor, surround sound speakers, Logitech wireless keyboard and optical mouse, and everything in the CPU has to work like a well-oiled machine.  3) PDA - Haven't decided which one yet. I've always liked the Palm m505 but other brands look spiffy as well. 4) Nokia 6100  5) All-paid trip to Europe including spending money  [ well, that concludes my over-the-top wish list. Doesn't have to be a birthday list. Applicable all year round...  ]  Of course.. the most important wish right now is to get  A JOB!

[ ok no more techie stuff... here comes the girly bits ] 7) A shawl (Pashmina or otherwise) 8) A bottle of Perfume.

       For those who actually care   I cut my hair! It's so neat. I look like a secondary school girl. I miss my  Meg Ryan  hairdo. *sob* Told the lady that I wanted my hair length to be below the ear with slight layering. She totally layered it and is now a layered bob. She absolutely butchered my hair with all that frantic layering and snipping. I was amazed that I had that much hair! I had to keep my emotions under wraps. There was no point in telling her that I didn't like it cos she had already snipped half my hair. My earrings got caught in her comb a couple of times. heh. That always happens. I ought not to wear such loopy earrings. *grin*  I didn't like my hair cut at first (like it wasn't obvious from all that ranting I've done in the above paragraph), but now, I have gotten quite used to it. Anyway, there's nothing much I can do about it cos it's already so short. I have to let it grow out and when it starts to curl out, I have to cut it again. It does feel good to have short hair once again, especially in this awful, awful weather. Not that it was ever long, but it was irritating with all that hair around my neck.

      Oh dear. Now that American Idol has ended, I really don't know what to do with my Thursday nights. True, The Amazing Race begins on Fri, but there would be a problem cos I usually go out on Fridays and I don't have a VCR. Damn. Damn. I have the song  Band of Gold  stuck in my mind. To purge the song from my system, I downloaded every known version of it: Freda Payne's version from the soundtrack of the movie  Now and Then , Belinda Carlisle's version, Kimberley Locke's solo version and Kim's and Frenchie Davis' version from the auditions. The thing is, I'm still not sick of the song yet but I'm driving everyone at home nuts with the songs on constant replay. Imagine listening to the same song over and over again for 3 hours.    I need help. Is there a self-help group? American Idol addicts annonymous? I am also going to miss reading recaps and disses on  urlLink Television Without Pity .  sigh

       AMERICAN IDOL   The finale of American Idol was shown on Thursday. I had been eagerly anticipating it since like forever. And I'm sure you know by now that Ruben is the new American Idol by a mere 130,000 votes.    Feelings and opinions  I wasn't blown away by their performances. I missed Ruben's first song and came back only in time to watch Clay perform. I actually liked his first song. Simon was right, it was a tad too musical-y. But you have to admit it, Clay's voice is perfect for that kind of music. I would cringe if he attempted to oversing a Justin Timberlake song, for example. Ruben did a great rendition of  Imagine  and I didn't like Clay's second song. It was sooo boring, much like his rendition of  Vincent . For their 3rd song, Ruben chose  Flying Without Wings  and Clay did  Bridge Over Troubled Waters . Let me just say this, I can't believe Ruben chose a WESTLIFE song! AArgh! That's a point against him. Clay did a FAANTASTIC rendition of Simon & Garfunkel's famous song.   I wasn't surprised by Ruben's win. Whoever won didn't actually matter cos they have all gotten recording contracts. Clay should be on a stage in a musical. This is not a criticism. I simply cannot imagine him singing a pop song, especially songs that are specifically catered for teens. Ruben may be more "marketable" in that sense.    Results show  Ohmigod. It was 2 hours of fluff. It was nice to see all the finalists on stage,  sans  Corey and Josh. I loved the recaps of all those tone deaf people. Dammit. I could have been one of them. hahah.. my 2 mins of fame. I should have watched the show from the very beginning of the season just to hear them try to "sing". Edgar Nova aka Enrique-gone-wrong was hilarious!!! He absolutely tickled me, almost as much as Keith aka Madonna-gone-wrong.

       Movie Review - MATRIX: RELOADED   My first movie since the end of the exams! And, I DIDN'T LIKE IT. Ok ok. Don't stone me all you matrix fans. I found the movie too long and too wordy at times. I am a great big fan of the first one but this movie tried too hard to impress and it failed. The action sequences are FAANTAASTIC, I must agree. BUT, they tend to be  TOO  long. For example, the scene on the moving truck. That was like half an hour long! Or the bit when Neo fought the many Agent Smiths. I don't even know why he bothered since they can't be killed anyway. One annoying thing I realised was that the dialogue and the action sequences did not blend nicely. It was like 30 mins of solid fighting, followed by 30 mins of dialogue only, then another 30 mins of action and lastly 30 mins of talking. I fell asleep during the  architect  scene. Ugh.    New characters . I love Persephone! HOT mama in that ooh-so-tight dress. Her husband is such a cad and I didn't know eating cake can be such an orgasmic experience. Captain Nirobe played by Mrs Will Smith was another Hottie. Her boyfriend, the Commander, annoyed me and so did Agent Smith. Hugo Weaving shouldn't have renewed his contract for Matrix: Reloaded and just died in the first one. Actually Morpheus was also started to piss me off especially with all that babble about believing and prophecies and the "speech" in the cave. It reminded me of the speech Bill Pullman made in  Independence Day  and George Bush's speech during the war. Unnecessary drama.   Oh! The end credits took 10 mins to roll!!!! The trailer for the third instalment had nothing to wow about which was a disappointment.    Verdict  I would pay $6.50 for the show. I did pay $6.50 for it. Despite my diatribe, I would definitely catch the third movie at the end of the year. Why? Because I've already watched the first two movies and I would like to have some form of closure. And frankly, I am eager to see how it ends.

      don't sound so dejected fluke. Sit-meister said it best, so I shan't repeat it.   ooh on a different note, bv and i were talking on the phone last night and we realised that we actually know a loser. Without getting into specifics about who the loser is, we feel that he qualifies as a loser based on the way he thinks, behaves and his general (lack of) personality. Quite sad actually.  I learnt a new word:  Coprophilia  or "brown showers" is the need to smell or view feces or the act of defecation as a primary means of sexual arousal and gratification.   As usual, I have bv to thank for this. *wink* I can't remember how we got on to that topic. I think it started with Japanese girls, then we went on to Jap men, and then something about kinky people... and so on and so forth. Well, for your education purposes, check out this  urlLink link . I had to check out the link to find out the spelling of the word.

      I hate to sound trite, but if this girl won't go out with you because you're not tall enough or because you've never been in a relationship, and basically discounting you because of what you  lack  then perhaps there isn't much basis for a relationship in the first place. Why bother? What did you see in this girl that makes you think she's so right for you and you for her anyway?   Anyway, the way I see it, you're being overly melodramatic and looking for "love" in the wrong places. Maybe you have some basis for grieving for something that was never really there in the first place, but I'm not seeing that right now.

       im so dead   juz toked to E's best fren again, who on my behalf, had tested E out..... lets juz quote verbatim wat e best fren told me:  "of u.... she say fren lor... she dun c anythin more... den i askd if she can sense anythin la... she say no la... dun tink it's anythin more.... dowan b too sensitive n oso she dun tink shld haf anythin more."  as if this wasnt bad enuf...  "Ok she like tall guys... 1.7o or 1.75 tt kinda ht... n i keep saying she so short stil wan so tall for wat... haha Den she wants some1 who is more experienced... got r/ship b4 1... dowan a greenhorn... n now she has diz thing for manly pple rather than boyish...."  to say its a major blow for my self-esteem is juz e least of it....... feeling a whole range of emotions rite now.... from bitterness, anger, frustration... to disappointment, sorrow, (self-loathing maybe?)... im not angry wif E... juz wif e cruelty of life n e arbitrariness of my God-given attributes... i've been given talents ppl wld be envious of for e rest of their lives, juz as much as i've not been given things dat i'd like to have but can neva attain.... e sorrow is of e fact dat i have to look at her from now on n see her as something dats literally so near, n yet so far...  im not e type who can instantly turn ard n say dat ppl like E dun ever deserve me.... superfiicality n looks shldnt matter... blahblah... cos as much as it helps u feel better, its only a half-truth... for wks i have sincerely believed dat i do deserve her, n she does deserve me... i had neva wanted anything more... n yes, lets not kid ourselves dat looks dun matter, cos they do... i noe dat cos im juz like E, n juz like most ppl who can see...  physical appearances does matter (in e short-run anyway)... ok, not dat im freaky-looking, but i muz admit i failed all e criteria she laid out there in 1 sentence...  time will heal everything... dats true... juz hope dat e next time, something will werk out... meanwhile, i shall go back into my shell n wait it out...  of cos, to have everything else in e world except luv, makes me wanna exchange everything for dat luv alone... Tis' the futile road to be travelled, by those blessed with many riches but cursed with lifelong loneliness...

       Moving Out   I moved out of my hostel room yesterday. Man, it was exhausting. Made a mistake of not getting boxes to pack my stuff in and I had to use all kinds of bags to store my things. I'm always amazed at the amount of junk I collect during the year. I made an effort not to buy knick knacks in my last year but I still have tons of things. I had a bag full of shoes, a bag full of bags and 3 bags full of clothes. Such a bimbo. Heh. One good thing about having a brother is that I can act as the damsel in distress so that he would carry all my things for me. Hahahah... Poor boy but it's good training for him. :p  I spent the better part of my Sunday night cleaning out my room at home to make way for my things. Ugh. I collect alot of junk at home too. Oh gosh. My rubbish amounted to 2 huge black trash bags. Now everything is more or less in its place except for loose bits that are cluttering the floor. Once my room is in shape, I have to get my computer hooked up to the internet.   May not be blogging so often these days cos my brother is glued to the main computer. Sheesh. So.. I'll be back.

Definitively speaking, getting laid = having sex. So, whatever the means you went through to have sex, if you had had sex, then you got laid - back car seat, movie theatre, her place, your place, in the park..it ain't matter...  Feeling really good - not intending to bash at anything or anyone tonight - eating a feel good dessert of Strawberry Sundae..yum yum..waiting for whose line which is starting in an hour...  nephthys babe, enjoy yourself!

       Great food, great company    Yesterday marked the end of my exams. My friends and I went to Cafe Vienna for high tea. How cool is that? Ate till we couldn't eat anymore. Loved the dim sum. We talked about school, people we know and had lots of laughter imitating certain characters. It was great fun. It had been a long time since the four of us got together to eat and chat. We took pictures and walked around Orchard Road to kill time. Orchard on a Friday was horrid. It was full of JC and secondary school kids. Ugh. There was a branded goods sale at Taka which Selin and I went to. I bought a new white top! Hee.    Along the way, bumped into old, old friends and acquaintances, one whom I've not seen or spoken to since we were 12. Everyone looks so grown up now. Selin and I parted ways. I had to wait for bv and bv being bv was late. We went to Milieu bar and I had my first taste of acid jazz-house style music. There was a live performance by  The Gordon Bennett Project . There was a couple who was doing the rock and roll to that type of music. It was beyond me as to how one can dance rock and roll to that. Jenny joined us halfway. Spotted a familiar face in the crowd. We saw the same Caucasian man at Zouk 2 weeks ago, leering at a girl who was dancing on the podium. He was there last night, lucky for us, not leering at anyone in particular. Crowd-watching can be really entertaining and I surprised myself by not feeling bored with the music. However it became house-y towards midnight, which none of us liked. Left for our usual place at HV, Breko.  Check out the  urlLink photos

I love the post exam euphoria. I can now watch all my movies and my sitcoms without feeling guilty!   Post exam plans are going to take effect now. Going to par-tay tonight, tomorrow night and every day until I get my results!

       The Eternal Damned...Have you reserved your seat beside the fire?      Yes yes...your LIFESTYLE NOW can depict whether you'll end up in the 9th Level of Hell, or escape blissfully (like me, hahaha) to the temporary holding cell of Purgatory.  Don't you dare question me - I did the test honestly. Yes, despite my horrific, prudish rants at the opposite sex and my hatred of all things that piss me, I am a good person. Just makes me wonder: would the lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, the Poo-Poo Hollywood-ians, and the Miami beach bums screw the results up? I don't care.   My seat is reserved in Purgatory with the absofartinglutely chance of making it past The Pearly Gates.

       AMERICAN IDOL RECAP   It's down to the last 2 men now. Just finished watching tonight's episode of AI2. Fantastic show since I like all the three contestants. Tonight, each of them performed 3 songs, a random choice, judges' choice and their own choice.     Kimberley Locke   Was the first singer tonight. Sang "Band of Gold", "Anyone Who Had a Heart" and "Inseparable". She did very well for the first song and the last one. I didn't quite like her second one. She has a lovely voice but sometimes she has trouble with certain songs. Tonight, however, was one of her better nights.     Ruben Studdard  He sang "Signed, Sealed, Delivered", "Smile" and "If Ever You're In My Arms Again". Ruben can hardly do any wrong. This younger version of Luther Vandross- Peabo Bryson can certainly deliver the goods. He surprised me with the ability to do an up-tempo song with "SSD". I loved his rendition of Peabo's "IEYIMAA".     Clay Aiken  Clay was the last singer in each set. He sang "Vincent", "Mack the Knife" and "Unchained Melody". I've said it before and I'll say it again, he really has the voice. However, he does tend to have the annoying habit of over-enunciating and over-singing a song. He had the worst performance with his rendition of "Vincent", a slow song which he forgot the lyrics to the song halfway. "MTK" was very well done but I liked the jazz version better and "UM" was well done only towards the end.   Results  Without further ado, Kimberley was knocked out of the competition. Blah Blah Blah, we can now look forward to next week's show.

        ATTENTION    Ok people.  PLEASE DO NOT CALL ME ON MY HANDPHONE!  Yes. I left my phone with bv last night so I don't have it with me. I'm only going to get it back from him tomorrow night cos I don't want to go all the way to Dover just to get it and I figured no one would want to call me between now and tomorrow. He has also turned the phone off so it won't ring. Feel free to bomb my mail boxes with sms-es though.   If you  DESPERATELY  need to contact me, I do check my ICQ and MSN from time to time so you can leave a message there. Alternatively, hmm, well, sorry, I can't think of an alternative. Well, if you're in NTU and want to see me in person (heh, to bask in my beauty), you can find me in Hall 2 today. Don't know my ICQ number? Haha, the number will be out for a limited time only. It's #1866167.   Oh. And  USELESS POLL #3  is out! Yay! I got sick of the X-men poll and no one seems to want to do it anymore. But good news! A grand total of 8 people took part in the poll which is a 100% jump over the initial 4 that took the first poll. So YAY to everyone! This new poll is about relationships, in reference to Cale since she has been ranting about it. *grin* Aww, Cale, you know I luv ya, hun.

       Comment   Someone 's got a bee up her butt eh? heh. Guys aren't  that  bad, you know. Granted, yeah, most of them can be such bastards, but I believe a totally platonic relationship is really possible. I do hope that people don't get into relationships for the sake of fucking. You can get that anywhere, just go to the club round the corner and find a girl/guy that looks appealing and wasted. Chances are, you can bring him/her home for some fun in the sack.   I'm not the expert on relationships. I'm not in one, I have no intention of getting into one anytime soon. I would rather have fun, enjoy life and hang out with friends. While guys can be fucked up, I think the women shouldn't be placed on a pedastal either. While the guy may just want to fuck with his girlfriend, the girl displays annoying attributes like temper tantrums, sulky behaviour, general clinginess, and tons of other unappealing qualities. *shudder*  As I'm not in the mood for ranting today, I shall keep my comments about screwed up girls and screwed up relationships to myself.    p.s  I had to alter the size of the ladder images cos they were too big for the column. So they look kinda weird. Apologies. I don't ahve the patience to find the correct proportions.

       The TRUTH is out -  urlLink The Theory of the Ladder  Part 1    Fluke: Pssst, pal....this might be the holy grail of your misery. Hope it helps, but you gotta admit it's true *grins   Dang it..i'm posting this AGAIN because the f***ed up server destroyed my A-rated masterpiece, so this version is written in deeper scorn, loathing and sardonic cynicism. Deep grateful thanks to my ooh-la-la french fry sweet potato in paris (lode) for the material....you know where we stand, right? *winks *muahs  Right. That was private. It didn't have to be up here. Then don't read it. Read here ||                                                                                                                      \/ This is the Men's Ladder:   Basically, what it means is that "males just wanna have sex with all the females they meet. That is, unless of course, you are unbearably and a confirmed gay, or you are simply disinterested or unattracted..for that reason, the female must have bad breath, weighs in at 200 pounds, smells, has unsightly growths and hair, and her appearance as a female is rather misleading and a cause for debate. 'Fess Up guys: Plutonic relationships for you are as possible as it is for me to become laid like jenna jameson...damn bad analogy, but it strikes the point. What? Do I hear disagreement? Dissent? A voice of indignance? Come on guyz..it's just us. You can tell the truth. Freud had it right.

       The TRUTH is out -  urlLink The Theory of the Ladder  Part 2   This is the Women's Ladder:   Yes, you need not adjust the glasses - we have 2 ladders. So what does this mean? We are intellectual whores. Yes. We. Are. We can differentiate men we just wanna f*** and men we just wanna be friends with. Does that make us evil? Cruel? Well, i leave that opinion up to you, except with this quote "Opinions are like buttholes - everyone has got one".  On a personal note, i might add, I have men on both ladders. I'm not a total prude and certainly not a lesbian (do  i hear a snort and snicker from the back row? *#### ###) as contrary to hostel folklore and legend. I have also, in my time, transferred men from ladder to ladder. It is, in entirety, possible to be friends and then lovers, or potential lovers to friends.  I'll 'fess up - i'm attracted to money, power, sweet talk. Yes. But my primary criteria on the list is still brains, for without them, the guy will be demoted to the lowest of low levels in the abyss. A stupid man, in my ass opinion, is intolerable.   Moral of the day: IF A MAN FINDS YOU ATTRACTIVE YOU CANNOT BE FRIENDS   Fluke - would you think so? Would you feel relegated to a period of unimaginable torture since you like E in a way more than friends? Then again, not to get your hopes up, sometimes women just ain't sure which ladder the guy is on as well. It's a simple concept of 'toss the coin" - i don't mind f***ing him but I also won't initiate that. So where does that place you? Maybe on the string that connects the ladders? Hell, i can;t do everything for you....   Publisher's comment: Due to uprising audit committments, rant blogs from me for tomorrow will be postponed to friday. You can look forward to reading about the vagina monologues, celebrity has-beens and fantasies part une. Keep your peace and your sanities in the meantimes

       More Clarifications   Just to let everyone know, this site has no censorship of any form. I'm the last person to impose a non-vulgarity rule on this site, since my mouth can be as filthy as the next sailor that comes in to town. So, Cale, you don't have to worry about me disapproving any of your materials. That won't happen. *grin* No need to ask for permission, all contributors can write whatever they wish to.   However, I do draw a line at insensitive comments touching on  politics , heh, don't want the   gah-men   (that's government for non-Singlish speaking people) rating my site as a political site and  religion  (don't want to incite any race/religious riots). But other than that, anything goes.   As for including new contributors, so far, those on the list are my friends. Anyone who wishes to contribute to my site may email me so I can get to know you a bit better. But I've not added anyone new and I can get quite anal about who I invite. This is cos, well, no reason. This is my site, and I can do whatever I want. So there.  Don't be afraid. I don't bite. *grin* Well, just teeny weeny bit and only if you piss me off.

       What he REALLY means when he says.... - The Spy Eye in a Guy's Lie(s)    Once again, the cynical sardonic bitch is out here ranting...James Hall is a freakin' bad lover whose material has failed to keep my attention even for 5 minutes...thus you find me here feeling frustrated, undernourished (in every way) and demented with hate that almost everyone I know is ending their exams tomorrow...screw it. I can't even lament at the world for being unfair (because it IS unfair and thus I'm a natural victim *duh).   So, which it has brought me to thinking - what do men really mean when they say something?? Oh, this is something that even the Gray guy who wote the Mars/Venus series can't even teach you...   When he says....   1) We've grown apart -Yeah, what he really means is that you were a size 6 and now you're up there in the 24's. So, lose it, fat ass. 2) I just need to find myself - Yeah, what he really means is that he needs to find himself with someone else..so, scoot and beat it, lady. 3) We just don't seem to have anything in common!! - Right, that secretary don't swing both ways and there's only enough there for me. 4) No, we're just friends - Yeahright...so, what did they teach you in kindergarten? Share (me) with your friends... 5) This relationship is getting too serious - What he really means is you're cutting into the time I wanna spend with checking out the others... 6) What did I do this time? - What he really means is "What did you catch me doing?" 7) Do you want to go to a movie/dinner? - He means "I'd eventually like to have sex with you" 8) I love you. Will you marry me? - What he really means is "*Phew! There! I've said it. We'd better have sex now and I also want to make it illegal for you to have sex with other guys...   Do they take us for their fools???     Publisher's Note - Guys! This is a rant.

       Wise Words for a Jilted Lover from a Cycnical Sardonic Bitch     Sweet Revenge - what does one do after a heartbreak or self-induced heartache?? Or per say, what are the things that are available for one to do in such low, crummy situation?? As for me, the emotional junkie high on the drug "hurt me one more time, baby!!!", the immediate reaction is listening to weepy sad songs that sing of hope and of love lost and found. The secondary reaction is, well of course, bugging the shit outta the bastard, and then drawing up plans for REVENGE 101...Screw the songs. WTF do they know what they're talkin' about? Do you realize that the lyrics always seem to respond in your interpretations DEPENDING on your mood? I can never figure out why... Of sending Black roses, Grim Reaper roses and Whoreweed bouquets: I prefer insults. Yes. Insults. Sarcasm cuts the other and heals me. It's a balance, as usual....le monde is always in its conservation of energy, moods, happiness/sadness, momentum, etc etc  Some Shakespearian-inspired insults for the intellectuals - please use sparingly and speak distinctly...the unchallenged one may misunderstand and the effect dost lost. 1) This woman's an easy glove, my lord, she goes off and on at pleasure (from All's Well that End's Well) 2) I desire that we be better strangers (from As You Like It) 3) What shall I call thee when thou art a man ? (from As You Like It) 4) Think'st thou, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell? (From the Taming of the Shrew) 5) There's small choice in rotten apples (from the Taming of the Shrew) 6) Out of my sight, thou dost infect mine eyes (from Richard III) 7) What a disgrace it is to me that I should remember your name (from Henry IV) 8) You have as little honesty as honour (from Henry VIII)   So, who said Literature was boring??? Apart from fantasies (hahaha, Nephthys), there's much to glean and utilize...

       The Amazing Race 4    The 4th instalment of The Amazing Race (TAR) will grace our screens on the 30th of May. I've checked out most of the contestants on the official website,  urlLink  CBS . Just from reading the bios and Q & A, the contestants all sound like media  hos  (whores with a slang) and camera sluts. Only one or two couples seemed nice and funny enough, without trying too hard.   I dunno why but gay couples love to apply for the show. There's at least one gay couple every season. This time round, it's a MARRIED gay couple. Talk about gross. I'm ok with homosexuality being shown on tv but man, I don't need to know their marital status and the fact that they're married. *shudder* There are 3 models in the show, so we can look forward to alot of bitching, catfights and bimbo moments.    [Somewhere in the rainforest....]   Model 1: "Oh. My. Gawd. I like totally lost my lip gloss in the rainforest."  Model 2: "Oh. My. Gawd. So did I!"  Model 1: "What if a hot guy sees us without our make up?"  Model 2: "I. would. just. die."  Oh dear.

        MORE USELESS TESTS    Many thanks to Cale     1.  urlLink I will leap from a tall building in my superman constume     How will you die? Take the  Exotic Cause of Death Test    2. I'm a SPORTS CAR as well!  3. I'm a Night Stalker aka Richard Ramirez. But I wouldn't get caught unlike Mr Ramirez here.    A side note:  I see Cale is back in full force! Hee.. That's totally great. Nothing relieves stress more than erm, blogging on blog. (I hear a goat bleating, it could be a frog though, somewhere in this room, I have no idea why). Audit is horrendously boring and I'm still struggling to finish reading James Hall. I think boring/dry textbooks should be outlawed for the greater good of mankind. Hell, exams should be banned. It's as simple as that.  On a brighter side, my post-exam party plans are shaping up very nicely. All-nighters are planned for this Fri and Sat and next Fri. Hee. And these aren't clubbing outings. Now how great is that? Rest assured tons of photos would be taken to capture the events, heh, for those who actually care. *grin* (The goat/frog is still here. Where the fuck is it coming from? Grr...)

       Fidgeting, Butt Scratching - A nervous wreck on the shores   The urge to rant has struck - in the midst of audit and assurance services, management assertions, audit objectives, audit risks in a computerized environment, I have the sudden, uncontrollable urge to spit, shout, curse, tear my hair out and tell the whole world to go screw themselves and each other!!!  I am thus now at a loss of words..which is, as those close to me know, is a highly and almost-impossible rare occasion...so, enjoy the peace for now....just remember that this is the calm before the storm ...   ~~~breaking up is hard to do~~~ how did neil sedaka become a genius on that, being an impossibly ambiguous gay (without the duo), writing his american idol judging comments down on paper and reading them out, all dramatized with appropriate tears and gratefulness at the American Idols for singing his songs the way it was made to be sung...I am, finally, experiencing the dismantled torment of a senseless mind and a troubled heart....and may i say for the record, I don;t like it!!!! Screw relationships down the drain, and stay there, yer hear???! Dang it. I should be part of an impossibly ambiguous lesbian duo myself...

       Clarification   First, I'm not a perv! Honest! To be fair to me and my tutor, it wasn't a make out, make out. It was more of a kiss. There was no tongue, no groping, no nothing! It was just one of those freakish dreams.   Do you get that? (hint to Morgan)  And the shitting thing, now that's just gross.

       i don't sleep, i dream    i don't know, i guess so  i don't sleep, i dream  i'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what i really need   r.e.m.  no matter how far mankind ever progresses, we'll never ever understand the idea behind dreams. yeah yeah its our subconscious kicking into play (which very much explains nefi's lit tutor dreams) but how? and why? i found out that if you actually wake up earlier and then sleep again for another hour or so before really getting up, you'd really remember your dreams (particularly useful for me since i usually forget them all). also helps a lot if you're like me when you go about your normal mundane life and something just strikes you but you don't know what.. something so familiar, yet distant.. and then you struggle to figure if whatever just flashed across your mind really happened before or if it was just a dream. its scary. yeah and remembering your dreams is so much fun. i still remember my dream of shitting non stop for goodness knows how long. i mean, i just kept shitting and shitting like there was no tomorrow. or like it was going out of fashion the next day. or like my life depended on it. well, guess that reveals quite a bit about what goes on in my subconscious, but i'm glad it's just me and not my lit tutor.

       How to......    1. Put images   Type in (img src=YOUR PICTURE HTML HERE.gif or jpg) and replace the brackets with <>. Had to do it like this cos blogger detected my fake image code as a real one...  if u want to add in alignment, type in align=left/right/center and place it after the .gif before the > size is width or height.  For more info check out  urlLink HTML Goodies    2. Not have erotic dreams   Actually, I can't help you there. :) Worst dream I had was of me making out with my Lit tutor in JC. Doesn't sound so bad right? Well it is! And you wanna know why? The tutor is a  SHE !!!!! Couldn't look at her straight for a couple of weeks after that.

       The Erotic Dream - Of Snakes and Vampires   Damn it..can someone here teach me how to put images in??? I'm starting to feel the backlash of not being a genius, but the reverse - stupidity is slowly creeping in. Help!!  Anyways, time to get inside the vault of my dreams...I classify good dreams and nightmares as one as the same..why?? Hell, i'm so perverse, even the nightmare that gets be shakin' in the morning leaves me pleasantly drowsy not to devour the world with my hatred and pimply ugliness. So...the erotic dream - snakes and vampires...have any of you had dreams involving one of these 'euw-yucks' creatures before?? Well, i have...and stop starin'. It's supposed to be sensual yet repelling...the typical 'yin-yang' combination that drives people nuts the 'ole time. My 'oh-so-delectable-i-could-rip-off-your-shirt' french guy friend who really lives in Paris told me this. The guy had a 'thing' for this..... Yeah..anyone interested? LOL ---> get in line BEHIND me.   Anyway, I had one of those last night; it involved a huge slithering asshole who's been hibernating in my flower bed (which is simply impossible - I checked this morning) and it decided to come out and start eating everyone.. (As a sideline - curses to the television who aired Python last week...F*** YOU"! You caused me this dignity-draining experience) So anyway, in the dream, i exchanged meself for my parents (which happened after the asshole kept trying to get into my house but the glass door somehow kept him in.....yeah..it's not supposed to make any sense, so beat it.) and as a last request, I asked the snake thingy to grant me a wish to go screw someone coz i didn;t wanna die a virgin (and that, by the way is IN the dream - do not relate to reality)...hahahaha..and gosh, was i thinking of a few candidates there!!!!! well, anyways, the sun came in, I woke up, and once again in the long history of my life, i turned an impossible nightmare to yet another erotic dream....*sigh..as i impatiently await the next one...

          3 non-living men and a screwed-up prude - The Universally Accepted Theorem   Gawdf***kingdamnit...back to the dormitory barracks today...after a good 2 days of accounting-detox treatment, courtesy of Mr. Bed, Mr. Radio and Mr. Television...nothing is anything more necessary than the 3 key inanimate men in my life. Which got me to thinking about some universally acceptable theorems and statements you can make at any f***ing time of the day without any f***ing proof. What about "someone is gonna get laid in the next 5 milliseconds", or "some creep's being busted just about right now"? Or "the next person who says dang is a goddamn mean bitch?" DANG. Does this mean i'm a genius? Hell, sure as mud ay' am..

       HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!   It's Mother's Day today. I'm not having any celebrations with my mom cos I'm in hall. In anycase, I've already given my mom her present and wished her Happy Mother's Day before I left on Friday.   I was invited to bv's house for Mother's Day celebrations last night. It was a big celebration with 4 generations under 1 roof and alot of moms. Baby Om is sooo cute! I had my peach drink (Oooh! I have my own drink!) and a fake long-island tea. Haha. Food was delicious as always. Jenny and I danced to her American Italiano (I don't know the exact title) song.

      I went shopping today, first time in a looong time. Boy, it felt good! My day started off late due to my late night. Met bv, his cuz and bro at Toys R Us to look for toys! Wow. Kids nowadays are spoilt for choice when it comes to toys. The selection of toys at Toys R Us are immense. It was fun looking at the barbie collection (I love the collectibles), the huge stuffed bears and all sorts of play things. If I had a kid, I would definitely buy tons of toys for him/her. After that we went to Puncak to eat. Puncak is this very delicious food stall located at the 5th floor of Far East.   Bv's cuz and bro were going to watch X-Men 2 after that while bv and I went to check out the new Zara shop at Liat Towers (I think). Was abit disappointed in the selection of clothes on display but definitely ogled at the shoes. We were looking for Mother's Day gifts for our respective moms. Checked out stores at Wisma and Taka but we couldn't find anything we liked there. Had coffee at Key Coffee, Taka. I tried the expresso for the very first time. Needed the caffeine shot cos my tongue was dead, ie, I was too sleepy to talk. Expresso was awfully strong but it was good. Wouldn't try it again though cos I couldn't make the thing last for more than 15 mins.   We went to The Heeren after that. I was looking for a gift for one of my tuition kids. Headed towards the Met shop at Centrepoint cos bv wanted to show me earrings he was considering buying for his mom. It was lovely. I bought a bookmark for my other tuition kid's birthday and a necklace for my mom. It was good shopping day. I totally love the Met and the things they have on display. The jewellery is sooo pretty! but expensive as well! Oh well.. the finer things in life are never cheap.

      Woohoo!  I have one more paper left! After moping around in my room for the better part of the afternoon, I partied like there was no tomorrow (that's just an exaggeration) at Mambo. My drink was ABSOLUTELY fantastic. I usually get the Maison Peach Soda thingie and it had always been good, but tonight it was FANTASTIC. Nicely chilled and it wasn't too fizzy. We felt very old today cos the crowd was mainly made up of JC-ish people who didn't know how to jump during jump-y songs. How  uncool .   We missed our two regular retro dancers, probably cos exams are not over for certain schools. Spotted one hot girl on the podium. She wore the teeniest skirt and her legs were very toned and very long. She tied her shirt right under her boobs and showed off a cute tummy button. Unfortunately, she wasn't very busty, but on the whole, yow momma! However, it was sad that she couldn't really dance. But hey, one can't have everything right?

       World Domination Plans    Listen up people! As part of my world domination plans, I've decided to have little mini polls so that I know the opinions of mortals. As of now,  USELESS POLL #2   is up and running and would be active till I decide otherwise (meaning, I have no figgin' clue). For those who are directionally-challenged, the poll is situated at the bottom right hand corner of the page, ie, in the right-hand column at the bottom. Clear enough? It shouldn't take too long and wouldn't sap too much brain cells.   So, I expect to receive more participants this time round as opposed to my first poll where only a measly number took part. Unless you want to incur my wrath.  [to be said in a booming voice]

       SOMEONE HELP ME  Oh dear god. I think I'm hooked on to blog and this whole blogging business. The only way I could make myself stop blogging for a couple of hours was to lug all my books and study at a friend's room. Even then, I had to take a break every few hours and make my way back to my room and blog. I find this whole aspect of blogging; the html coding, looking for stuff to post, looking for stuff to add onto my templates etc, exciting and interesting. Holy crap, I'm such a geek. *shudder*  Although I don't post often, haha, face it, I doubt anyone would want to read about the happenings of my day, I love to tweak my site. I like looking at the html lines and thinking of ways to improve it. Then I would read other people's sites and find things to add onto my site. Hence I've added a new tag board, a calendar, erm, recategorized my links and many other things that aren't probably noticeable at all.   I realise that this sudden interest to blog might also be due to the fact that I'm in the midst of my exams. Bleah. The dreaded finals. It is my style to find something new to do every time an exam comes along. So for the past 2 semesters, I found the joy in blogging. Previously, I was dancing throughout my exams and when I was younger, I loved to colour. Haha.. A little bit of trivia about me. :)   Aside from blogging, I end up reading other people's blogsites as well. Fascinating insights into their lives. *grin* They live halfway around the world and it is interesting to read about the things that they write about. Some of their sites have been added onto my favourite blog links.   I stopped working on my angelfire website (sorry to those who have visited it only to find that there are no new updates) mainly because it got too tedious and also, I want to get my hands on the dreamweaver programme. I don't have the software with me and I've made that my holiday project.   Speaking of holidays, I would be totally free come next Friday! yay for me but it also means that I've gotta get a job; a permanent job, since I'll be graduating this semester (fingers crossed) and that nothing goes wrong with my papers (knock on wood). Ok. Seeing as I have a paper tomorrow morning, Accounting Theory (YUCK! EUGH!) I oughta get my mind back on track.

        MOVIE REVIEW - X MEN 2     Yay! It's movie review time! I actually did it last night but stupid blogger screwed up and didn't load my page. I watched X-Men 2 last night, shush, all you muggers. I know I have a paper on Wed but my conscience ran away so I made use of the free time to catch a movie. I LOVE X-Men.. the movie as well as the cartoon... hee.. ok ok.. the men as well. *grin*   The Plot  The plot isn't as riveting as the first one, which was quite a shame. There was plot development in terms of the war between humans and mutants. This time round, our X-men had to team up with bad mutants Magneto and Co to fight the common enemy, William Stryker. I was unhappy with the romantic subplots that were included in this sequel. Budding romance between Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) as well as the never-ending love triangle between Jean (Famke Janssen), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman!) and Cyclops (James Marsden). The puppy romance thing between our two adolscent mutants was quite funny cos these two horny teenagers can't do much as Rogue will just suck the life out of her beau if they kissed, which they did, and she almost killed him.   Unfortunately the dialogue had bad one liners, corny at best and cringe-worthy at worst.    [oh crap, blogger seems to think that my review is too long. So i'm posting the reviews over 3 posts]

       [Part II]    The Mutants  There are new mutants to spice up the movie, with the death (I'm assuming) of Toad and Sabretooth in the last movie. As always, the mutants are the biggest draw of the show. Who's going to watch X-men for a heavy drama full of irony and pathos? Not me, that's for sure. New mutants are:  a)  Lady Deathstrike  played  by Kelly Hu. Such a hottie! Those claws, the glassy eyes. She doesn't speak much, hmm, I think she only had 1 line. But this kitten made an impression. Would love to see her hook up with Wolverine.    b)  Nightcrawler  played by Alan Cumming. Blue skinned ala Mystique, with a tail ala the Devil and fangs ala Dracula. This mutant is funny cos he had one of the best one-liners and the German accent was amusing. This mutant is a staunch Catholic as well.  c)  Pyro  played by Aaron Stanford. Ahh, an adolescent mutant. CUTE to boot! Friend of Rogue and Iceman. The bad boy of the group. He ran away with Magneto at the end of the movie, so we know that he's going to be one of the bad guys in the next instalments of X-men.   d)   Iceman  played by Shawn Ashmore. Rogue's boyfriend. Fingertips can freeze things. Pretty cool. Cute in a nerd-ish way. Not as cute as Pyro though. haha. If I were 15 again, I would totally dig these 2 boys.   The older mutants are still around. Jean, Storm and Mystique featured more prominently this time round. Mystique had the coolest scene where she slid out of the door backwards and her middle finger shown. Haha. That was funny. This lady has class, finesse and attitude. She also has the coolest power. Oh. And she may have a thing for Wolverine.

       [Part III]     The Effects  Bryan Singer didn't disappoint. The effects are great, especially when it comes to showing off the mutant powers.   On the whole, I'd pay about $7 to $7.50 to watch the show. :) The mutants played a big part in the ratings.

      Poor Nephthys. I hope your computer sorts itself out man.   I think I've got a virus. My nose is all runny and its really pissing me off because I've only just recovered from something very similar to what I am experiencing now. I suspect its Hay Fever this time though, so that's not exactly a virus I think, but all the same, its making me ill! I hate being ill cos that in turn makes me homesick. I think its partially my fault that I'm ill though. I've not been getting to bed early enough, not taking my vitamins etc. Argh. When will I learn...

      I had a tiff with my computer last night. Stupid thing threw a fit when I was trying to scan it for viruses. Let me tell you the story. While was transfering files to a hall friend last night, she informed me that I was sending her viruses as well. I decided to scan my pc to detect the infected files. I already had a hunch that the game software I downloaded from Kazaa was infected. So anyway, the scan was soooo slow at one point that I decided to cancel the scan and just delete the files that I thought were infected.   But noooo.... computer threw a fit. It hung on me when I opened the folder. I had to restart my pc and each time I accessed that particular folder, it hung. I had to restart my pc about 5 times! My computer is such a bitch. It refused to budge despite all my cajoling and my threats. It totally ignored me and continued to hang. I was so pissed that I restarted the thing, turned on the scan and left the room. That will teach it not to mess with me in future. I will not tolerate such mutiny from a mere machine. A stupid machine.   Went back this morning to check on it. Found 3 infected files which couldn't be repaired. The quarantine thing hung on me. Damn. The stupid folder still refused to work. I restarted the scan and left the room again. I will only check on it later in the evening. UGH. Damned machine.

        EUGH!      My room is so   STUFFY!!!!   I can't stand it! The ceiling is fan is not doing it's f****** job, dammit. The air is hardly moving. Aargh. I hate the humidity here. No matter how much a friend of mine bitches about the cold in Canada, I would take the cold over this AWFUL humidity anytime.   I don't mind the heat so much.. but the humidity just sucks the life out of me. The air hardly stirs in this room. I hope it will get better later on. There's no way I can study in this heat. As it is, I already find it difficult to study. This heat is just driving me nuts. AARGH

        All Hail Jackman        Do you know who's really hot?   HUGH JACKMAN   *swoon* He is the epitome of human perfection, in my point of view. God. He's hot! I have to write this down cos I've been thinking about it ever since I watched X-Men (the first one) on VCD for the upteenth time. I literally had to fan myself when I saw him on screen. God. That body, those shoulders, the arms. I love it. I usually don't gush, heh, well I do gush, but not this much, over guys' body, but Oh. My. Gawd. He's HOT! Ok ok... calm down. Breathe.    I mean, take a look at him. Ok. The hair is a bit much. But he has one of the most perfect faces I've ever seen in my life. True, I may not have seen alot of faces, especially when living on such a tiny island, but still, a good face is a good face. And that body. *swoon*  What? Can't a girl gush?

      Today was the usual Friday outing except that I went over to Bv's house for afternoon tea. DELICIOUS. Indian tea (with cardiment added), cheese sandwich and a curry puff. I caught the first episode of Buffy as well. Bah. It was a long, and somewhat annoying episode. I dunno. I felt that they were being overdramatic about the entire thing. Show didn't sustain my interest for long. We met up with his cuz and friend and when to Ikea after that. Ikea was crowded, as usual. Nothing much to write about it.  Following that, we went to San Liu Bar. A major complaint. Happy Hour is no longer until 9pm. It was now from 5 to 8!! WTF?!?! No wonder the place was half empty when we were there at 8.45pm. Like hello? Can't you see that you're chasing the crowd away with that ridiculous timeslot? I couldn't get my 2 for 1 mocktails. How unfortunate for me. Daniel decided to have his dinner at the chink (no offense intended) time and so didn't join us for our pre-dinner drinks. We did meet him on our way to River Valley for dinner. I was feeling nauseus by this time. I have been feeling like this for the past 3 days and Bv said that I was pregnant. That would be possible  IF  I was actually having sex, but since I'm not, that remark can be ignored. He was just being annoying.   Decided to skip dinner but had a very cold glass of iced milo. According to Daniel, that mee goreng place makes the greatest iced Horlicks. Really tasty and milky(?). Snitched some food from Jenny (hee) and took over  her meal towards the end cos she couldn't finish it. We headed to Breko (Holland Village) after that for more drinks and to hang out. I played bridge for the first time in my life. Never actually bothered to learn it when I was in JC cos well, I actually couldn't be bothered. "Snotty for all the wrong reasons" quote unquote Bv. Bridge was fun after I got the hang of it. Really addictive although I totally sucked since I didn't pay attention to the cards being dealt at times.   My bitchy face showed itself and without me noticing! Daniel was bearing all his grudges again. I swear, it will all come spewing out soon. Not that it hasn't already. Bv was being his normal self, ie, bitchy as usual. And Jenny, Jenny was enjoying our little drama moments. We finally found out why Daniel broke up. Haha and a consensus was formed that a crush lasting 1 and half years, is not considered a crush anymore.   All in all, we had a good time. The rain was an added bonus, as uncool as it was to stand under a bus shelter and  STILL  use an umbrella at 3am in the morning.

       YOOHOO!   Woah... blogger changed its template during my 5-day trip to Thailand. Thailand was great! Saw lots of temples, Buddhas and more Buddhas; Emerald Buddha, reclining Buddha and even a 40-foot Buddha. The night life was happening. Made guest appearances at the Ministry of Sound, a Transsexual Cabaret, a sex show and Hard Rock Cafe. MOS was ok, played lots of morgan's kind of music, ie, not my kind of music. Calypso, the Cabaret (hey! alliteration!) was fantastic. Very much like Boom Boom, with better costumes, but the "girls" had less spunk compared to Kumar's "girls". The sex show, aka, Firecat, was the least sleazy, as mentioned in the Lonely Planet guidebook. It was more of a circus act rather than an erotic show. Saw lots of breasts and vaginas, but trust me, they aren't a turn-on. The girls couldn't dance, and for 300 baht ($12) I only saw vagina acrobats like blowing a trumpet using the vagina, pushing and squeezing out ping pong balls and pulling strings out of the vaginas. UGH. GROSS. Food was utterly divine, crepes, tom yam and hotel buffet! Shopped quite a bit, although the weather and squeezy Chatuchak market drove me insane, made me really crabby that day.   Great fun travelling with bv again. Jenny was cool as well. Photos are mostly with bv since he brought his laptop so, i dumped all my photos into it. I brought speakers so that we could listen to our shit in the room. So, photos would be up whenever i receive them.

       Movie Review - The Little Chinese Seamstress   hmm... this isnt exactly ur usual movie review, since i didnt actually watch e film in a cinema, but on cable juz last nite... if u dun already noe, channel 56 does show some foreign films occasionally, n i was channel surfing in b/w wimbledon's commercial breaks when i caught a glimpse of e film 15 mins into its screening time... i neva touched e remote again... dats how entranced i was...   Synopsis:   during e peak of e cultural revolution in 1971 china, 2 uptown city youths were sent to a remote village in e 3 gorges region to recieve "re-education", where they were supposed to immerse themselves in e culture of peasantry n menial labor, while purging themselves of e practices of their intellectualist parents (labeled as enemies of e ppl).  There, they meet a gal, e grand-daughter of an aged tailor (who, i gotta  admit, is darn cute wif her elfin face), n of cos, both guys fall in luv wif her... Intrigued by her beauty, as much as her ignorance n innocence, both start to court her by reading to her from a secret stash of illegal foreign novels... Seducing her with tales from Tolstoy, Dostoevsky (however u spell his name), and Balzac, the three discover all the desires that had, until then, been suppressed, changing thier perspectives of life, as well as their lives, forever...   Gripes:   hmm.... i really cant tink of anything to complain abt... tho there were a few inconsistencies within e film, when 1 of e male leads inexplicably spoke in a standard mandarin accent, when he was speaking in a sichuan accent thruout e rest of e movie... e musical score cld have been better as well, but hey, u cant have everything in a low budget french movie... oh yes, din i mention it? director Dai Sijie is a chinese based in france... so all dialogue is in mandarin but end credits ar in french...   Compliments:   okie... i muz say this again... zhou xun, e female lead playing e role of e little seamstress, is darn cute!!! okok... *tries hard to calm down* i wld put a screenshot of her here, but i dunno how to! *wails* Besides this, e film is filled wif pans of an exhilirating backdrop of e 3 gorges region... villages perched on cliff edges dat fall away into e rushing river 1000 ft below.... its actually based on e director's semi-autobiography "balzac and the little chinese seamstress", n e plot is extremely poignant... e innocence (i prefer it to ignorance or stupidity) of e villagers influenced by maoism, is almost palpable n compels u to feel for them, as they listen enthralled to e 2 boys' made-up stories of communist propaganda films they purportedly saw.... this isnt a movie dat provokes alternative thought, but one dat seeks to move e audience into sharing e regret, angst n beliefs of e characters... from wat i saw, it has succeeded in doing so...   All in all:   u gotta watch it to noe wat im toking abt!! only way u can do so is probly by d/ling on kazaa or soemthing... unless u wait for e reruns on cable (which is God noes when) if u liked The Road Home (starring Zhang Ziyi n directed by Zhang Yimou), u'll probly like this even more... i'd pay 10 bucks to watch it in e theatre, much less 8.50 =p

      I'll be going to Bangkok tomorrow! Yippee for me!! 5 days and 4 nights of walking, shopping and clubbing. I am especially excited to shop over there and fill my bags up with tons of cheap/fake goods and clothes. I thumbed through the Lonely Planet guide to Bangkok and looks like Bangkok is quite happening at night. Definitely would want to go to my first gay bar just for the hell of it.   As for my Harry Potter, I'm stuck at page 80.

       BOOK REVIEW - HARRY POTTER & THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX      I pre-ordered my book on  urlLink Acmabooks  so that I didn't have to wake up early and queue for it. In the end, I woke up at 6.30 and reached Suntec by 8.30. I have finished reading the book and this is my opinion of it.  Being a HUGE fan of Harry Potter (although I started reading the book only last year, but I read each book at least 4 times), I had high expectations for Book 5. However, the first read has disappointed me. Now, don't lynch me, all you HP fans (hint to Siti, especially if you liked it. *grin*). No doubt the book is alot thicker than Goblet of Fire, but sadly, it is not half as interesting. I felt that JK Rowling has sold out to commercialism. It's like a big budget movie with no soul. The plot was not as riveting as any of the first four books and the whole fighting thing at the Ministry of Magic lacked depth and suspense. Even the death of the key character (you're not getting any spoilers from me) was not as emotional or tragic as Cedric's death and he wasn't even a key character.     Pace & Plot  The pacing of the book is SLOW. Harry only started school about halfway through the book. In terms of content, nothing major developed till page 400 or so. Alot of waiting involved, waiting for Lord Voldemort to make his move, waiting for Harry to start school, waiting for Harry to meet his friends, waiting for his friends, waiting for other people, waiting for time.. waiting.. waiting.. waiting.... Get my drift? Rowling devoted attention to all her characters, there's no doubt about that; Fred and George, Cho, Malfoy and other schoolmates all had book time. But it felt like she was trying to develop too many characters simultaneously, and thus, affecting the quality of each character. She also brought in the politics of the Ministry into the book, which, I'm sure is essential to the whole Lord Voldemort thing, but it takes away the magical feeling of Hogwarts, it is now a war.    [end of part 1]

       [Part 2]    Characters  Harry seems to be suffering from a case of teenage angst. A very angry boy and it's a headache to read his dialogue in CAPS. Imagine him screaming most of the time. "BOO HOO! NOBODY LOVES ME EVERYBODY HATES ME!" Ugh. Exhausting. The relationship between Harry and Snape hasn't improved. If anything, it actually got worst. Harry hates Snape now. He also hates Dudley. Like I said, such an angry boy. There is a new character, a certain Delores Umbridge. Oh my god. I absolutely hate her, which is a good thing, cos it means that Rowling did a good job of characterising her. She is awful! Her appearance, the way she speaks, her condescending tone. I was actually glad she got  (Ok, spoiler coming up)  captured by the centaurs.    Overall  I didn't like it. As I've said, I felt that Rowling has sold out or at least suffered a major block. I sincerely hope that book 6 and 7 will be better.   To be fair to Harry Potter, I shall read it one more time and see if my opinion of it changes. Who knows, it may actually get better with time.

Got myself a Passed with Merit, which, in my books is pretty good considering how much I've fucked up over the past 3 years. It's over! I don't have to worry about doing an extra semester or that my degree was only a pass without the merit.    CONGRATULATIONS  to Cale, who most likely have gotten at least a Second Lower and to all my fellow Accountancy mates!!!

       Random Mutterings   My MD is sick. I sent it to the Sony Repair Center just now. My tracks kept jumping as though there wasn't any anti-shock protection. Initially, I thought it was just the disc that was fucked up. But the problem didn't stop despite using new discs. I hope I get it back soon. I miss it already.   The plans for Bangkok is shaping up pretty nicely. For those who don't know, I'll be going to Bangkok next Wed! On the agenda is a drink at the poshest restaurant in the city. According to bv, a full meal there costs US$115 and the dress code for men is jacket and tie. Heh, so bv is gonna bring his jacket and tie. I have to think of what to wear. A good photo opportunity, that's for sure.   I saw the nicest necklace just now at Taka which would go very nicely with my new earrings that Selin, Ml and Rh gave me for my birthday. We met up yesterday for dinner at  Riverwalk Tandoor . The naan there was absolutely fantastic. I dirtied my new white blouse with paneer and it is now soaking in bleach.   bv thinks that I shouldn't tell people that I've been watching alot of Buffy eps these past few days. But it's true. I've almost finished watching all of season 7. I'm going to give season 6 a miss cos they're showing it on TV. I'm now downloading season 1. How  loser-fied  is that? Angel looked sooo much better in season 1. Not like the lump of lard he is right now. Ugh. Seriously, there's nothing much to do in the mornings. Maybe I oughta start swimming again to pass the time away.

       The Hulk review   hmm... watched e pre-world premiere of The Hulk on tues nite... was some OCBC family outing thing, n e theatre was full of middle aged folks wif their pri sch kids... got a free hulk notepad, poster n erm... green pop corn   Gripes:  boy, was i surprised by e length of e whole movie... it was freakin 2hrs n 15 mins long!!! for an action movie wif no drama, it sure was hell going thru e 1st 1 hr where too much time was spent explaining wats wrong wif bruce banner, wif weird visuals of cells being invaded by "nanomeds" n bombarded by green gamma rays... if u tot Days of Our Lives is draggy, wait till u watch The Hulk. of cos being adapted into a movie, e story doesnt really follow e comic strip, n some parts abt bruce banner's father were too inexplicable even by my acme cartoon standards. e epic battle b/w e hulk n his dad was well... so full of bright lite n scientific mumbo jumbo, i had no idea wat was going on. e Hulk's comic strip personality n utter invincibility was also not portrayed in e movie. believe u me, hes not as likeable in e comic as he is in e show.   Grudging compliments:  to be fair, eric bana n jennifer connelly were alrite... nick nolte was, as usual, relishing in his quirky role as bruce banner's deranged-scientist-dad... best actor shld go to Hulk (or as he was codenamed by e US military in e show -  angryman), wif his powerful performances n comical leaps along mountain ridges n desert plains (even tho he may be a computer generated freak).  e visual effects were not exactly stunning but wat u'd expect from movies nowadays, n action sequences had funny elements in them too... its ang lee directing so action sequences had to be gd.   Overall:  if u can, skip e 1st hr of e show n go direct to e last hr... n erm, i dun see how anyone can pay 8.50 for this unless u were manhandled into e theatre. i watched it for free =p

       When you step into a shower, which part of the body do you wash first?    Please select a body part  A. Chest B. Face C. Armpits D. Hair E. Privates F. Shoulders G. Others    A. Chest: You are a practical person. Straightforward and do not beat around the bush. To you, convenience is of paramount importance. You hate to be distracted when concentrating and are impatient with people who do not see things your way. A good sex partner and willing to try new things.

You have great fantasies about different techniques, but unfortunately are not brave enough to try them out. Your best partner in life will be those who choose B (Face).

       HAPPY FATHERS' DAY  everyone!! Any grand plans for today? I didn't buy my dad a present. Heh, it's so difficult to find my dad a present for his birthday or for Fathers' Day that I don't. The last gift I remember giving him was a thong. Haha, yeah, it came in a nutshell. One of those things from House of Humour. Thank god my dad has a sense of humour. *grin* But he did say the thong was too small. So gross.   This year, I'm going to bake him a cake. More specifically, a chocolate mocha cake. Ooh, I hope it turns out right. My baking afternoon at Selin's house last Thursday didn't go so well cos we bought the wrong type of chocolate and the fudge was BITTER! Ugh. I couldn't even swallow the cake. heh.   Oh man. I've been waking up earlier and earlier every day now. That's just fucking ridiculous. I'm supposed to enjoy my vacation. Sleep in, wake up late, laze around on the bed. But NOOO... I woke up at 7.45 this morning! And it's a Sunday!! I woke up at 8.30 yesterday despite sleeping only at 4.30am. Bugger.   Ooh!  urlLink Harry Potter   will be out next Sat! And so will my exam results!! AARGH! I'm soooooooo worried. Alot of what-ifs going on in my mind and all of them aren't pleasant what-ifs. Should I buy the Harry Potter book? But I didn't buy the first 4 books. I hate collecting books halfway through the series. And what if it's the cartoony edition? If I buy it, the first 4 books have to be like that, to ensure continuity. But I don't like the cartoony version. So, what if I buy the cartoony one, then get the nicer, meaning the Scholastic, version for the first 4 books then wait for the nicer version of Book 5 to come out and buy that. Ugh. That would mean that I have 2 versions of book 5, wouldn't it? Heh, ok ok. Too much musing over a book.   Plans for today. Hmm.. bake my cake. And possibly watch a play later at night. Haven't exactly decided yet. Bv wants me to watch it cos it is value for money. I was too lazy to watch it with him and Jenny last night. He said it sucked so bad that people left halfway. However, it was a good experience, to see how badly a play can suck. And I'm always a sucker (pardon the pun) for bad shows. Morgan should know. Always a never-ending dispute between us as to who suggested the movie " urlLink Slap her She's French ". I still maintain that it was him.

       MOVIE REVIEW - THE PIANIST         Finally watched the show! It was screened again at  Alliance Francais   this entire week. It was a very good film. There were some particularly disturbing scenes, especially when the Nazis threw the wheelchair guy out of the window and shot the rest of his family as they were running. Oh, the horror! Adrien Brody did a great job of portraying Szpilman and he had the tortured face portrayed perfectly.  Although it was a long movie, it moved along nicely, unlike the Matrix where everything just plodded on.    Characters  Heh, I can't quite remember their names, much less spell them. But none of the characters annoyed me. I particularly liked the German who saved Szpilman's life.   Verdict  Would definitely pay $8.50 to watch it.

        BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER    I have finished reading the transcripts of Buffy (BTVS). My verdict: I love it. It's a biased judgement because I was more interested in just two characters, Spike (James Marsters) and  urlLink Buffy  (Sarah Michelle Gellar).   When I first read the transcripts last year, I was shocked with the whole Spike-loves-Buffy-let's-have-sex shit. Although the transcripts sounded like a bad trashy novel, I did enjoy reading it. Plus,  urlLink Spike  is just so hot! The attitude, the (fake, James is from California) accent. He can BITE me if he wants to.   After a slow start with Season 6, the remaining episodes seems more engaging and I would definitely make a point to watch it every Wednesday.  urlLink Tara  breaks up with  urlLink Willow , Tara dies, Willow goes all bad. All very exciting! Buffy and Spike have alot of violent sex. (I wonder how much of it would be censored).  urlLink Xander  left  urlLink Anya  at the alter, Anya becomes a vengeance demon again. Buffy and Spike have alot of violent sex (Yes, I repeated it again for emphasis). Buffy "breaks" up with Spike.  urlLink Dawn  is less irritating. The season ends with Spike in Africa getting his soul back.  Ooh, Ang urlLink  el is gonna make an appearance in Season 7. Willow finds a new lover. I doubt any of the sex or kissing scenes would be shown here. Buffy saves the day, but Spike died(?), correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what I assumed.

       Movie Review - PHONE BOOTH      Aargh. Whatever you do, don't ever watch this show  UNLESS  you have the urge to throw $6.50 away. In that case, the money would be put to better use if you gave it to me. I fell asleep in the first 10 minutes of the show. Why? Cos the seat at Cineleisure was so comfy and in my defense, I always get sleepy after lunch.    Phone booth  was shot in a phone booth. Really. A lame-o plot about a sniper who was targeting Colin Farrel's character, Stu, who always called his girlfriend using that particular phone booth every day. Why use a phone booth when you have a cell phone, one might ask? Weeell, cos Stu here also had a wife, so a certain amount of discretion was necessary. Anyway, sniper-man decided to play god and demanded that Stu owned up to his wife about his little affair.. yadda yadda yadda  [skip to the end] The ending was stupid as well. The police shot a guy, whom they thought was sniper man, a twist was needed. Sniper man was still alive but Stu was too drugged up to notify anyone.    Characters  Hunk schmunk. Colin Farrel, in my opinion, is not as hot as everybody thinks. He annoys me, in the show as well as in person. The funniest parts of the movie involved 3 hookers who saw their pimp getting shot by the sniper but they thought it was Stu who shot him. Heh. They were coarse and cute. Ooh, the guy who acted in  Judging Amy  as Judge Gray's male clerk or paralegal, Bruce, had a role as one of the police officers in the show. Now, that's a hunk.   Rating  Erm, would only watch if someone paid for me.

       Update   Ooh, have not blogged for about 4 days. I conducted a workshop for a Primary 5 class on Mon and Tues. I was so nervous cos it was my first time teaching and talking to a bunch of kids. But it turned out alright. I must say, I actually enjoyed myself. I think I prefer children to be chatty and lively as opposed to quiet and well-behaved. Although chatty children turn the class up-side down, they are definitely more interesting. I realised that I also prefer small children, not those big boys that always look sweaty. *grin* Grosses me out.

        REVIEW   Title: The Vagina Monologues Venue: The Substation   Review time!  The Vagina Monologues  or as bv put it crudely,  Cunt Talk  is just a series of monologues about the vagina performed by 3 Filipino women (it was a Filipino production). And boy, the vagina was the topic of the night. A highly entertaining production, the monologues paid tribute to various women, a Serbian woman who was raped, an old lady who did not want to talk about her vagina and a Southern woman who thought of her vagina as furniture.  Some questions were raised during the monologues:    If your vagina could wear clothes, what would it wear?  If your vagina could speak, what would it say?    Some of the answers included, "diamonds only" and "Go slow". *grin*  One delightful monologue was about a woman who wanted to reclaim the word "cunt". C-U-N-T. One has to be there to hear her say it. Extremely entertaining. Another monologue spoke of a woman who loved to make other women happy. The performer who did the monologue gave very vivid descriptions of the various forms of moan, culminating in the triple-orgasm-something-or-other moan.   I thoroughly enjoyed myself last night.

       Birthday thing   woohoo. so I officially turn 22 today, at 10pm. Had my birthday thing last night with k, cor, bv and dan. Since cor's birthday is also in jun, we have one mass celebration. went to bukit timah to eat. food wasn't that great, especially mine. however, it was fun exchanging presents. cor really liked her thumbdrive, bookmark and make up. hee.. i got my 2nd LOTR book from her and a coffee maker from bv and k. hahaha! i really love my coffee maker and the coffee that came with it as well. dan didn't bring or hasn't gotten my present yet. *hint*   [The Sims]    Went to Breko after that. But we were too stuffed to eat a single thing. We didn't stay long though, cos k and cor left before 12. dan and i stayed over at bv's place. dan spun his shit while we munched on nachos and salsa. Yum! we all wore pjs and dan picked a fight with tameera the stuffed leopard. dan pretended to be a porn photographer with his awful one-liner,  "show me animal" . he makes an awful lot of noise when the flash goes off in the dark. tons of pics of him sleeping and looking just plain fucked up. *grin*    Photos will be up soon.

        Shopping Mania    I went a little nuts yesterday as I was out with bv looking for a present for cor. After lunch at the delicious  Puncak  (I love the shredded chicken noodle!) place at Far East, I made a mistake of walking into  Chaos , this little shop that sells clothes that I've always wanted to buy but couldn't afford. Anyway, everything in that shop was going for $9! Yes! Nine bucks only! I went in and grabbed 2 tops and 2 skirts. One of the tops is a lacy, toga top which I'm still figuring out how to wear without showing an iota of skin around my belly. The other top is a 3/4 sleeved velvet top. I couldn't try any of those tops on. Bleah. I never understood why shops insist of imposing such stupid rules. Why the fuck would you prevent a paying customer from trying on clothes that are on sale? Sheesh. The 2 skirts that I bought are knee-length, one brown and one silvery. I had to take a leap of faith and hoped that at least 2 of the items could fit me well. There was another rack where tops were going at $9 for 2. But I liked only 1. The lady didn't let me buy just one. How dumb can that be? In the end, I had to find another piece that I liked. So from that rack, I bought 2 tube-ish tops that I can wear under my over-sized blouses or any transluscent clothes that I  may  purchase in future.   Total cost:$45 Total time taken to shop: under 30 mins  I went back to try on my purchases. I'm glad to say that I can fit into all of them although the brown skirt is a little too figure-hugging for my liking. The 3/4 sleeved one is a little too big and I guess I could wear it as a maternity top. Heh.  If  I decide to get have kids in future. I love my toga top. But there is no way I'm ever going out wearing that top without using at least a shawl or a cardigan to cover myself. Oh dear. Impulse buys aren't always good. I always make this mistake of buying things that I never wear. Maybe I can have an online auction thing.

       C'est La Vie   Let me describe my day:  10.00am: Woke up 10.15    : Sat on the couch, in front of the tv, and read the newspapers 10.45    : Checked email on computer and surfed the net 11.30    : Watched  Jamie Oliver  (Yum!) on tv 12.00    : Was still on the couch watching tv 12.15    : Decided to blog for a while 12.30    : Went back to the couch to watch more tv 13.00    : Switched channel cos I didn't want to watch  Days of Our Lives  Contemplated if I should go for a swim. Decided against it cos I was too lazy to move. 13.15    : Fell asleep on the couch with the tv still turned on 14.00    : Woke up and watched whatever was showing on tv.  15.00    : A new show started. It was a lame drama called  Doc  16.00    :  Doc   ended. Next up was a show a la  Mortal Kombat . Needless to say, it was dumb and boring. 16.30    : Finally decided to take a shower.  17.00    : Watched more tv. The couch was  the   place for me today. 18.00    : Went to the shop to buy a loaf of bread so that I could eat. 18.15    : Had my first meal of the day. 18.30    : Talked to my parents 19.15    : Surfed the net 19.45    : Posted this message  Ah.

       Music Review    The Cardigans - Long Gone Before Daylight   Drums: Bengt Lagerberg, Bass: Magnus Sveningsson, Keyboard: Lars-Olof Johansson, Guitar: Peter Svensson, Vocals: Nina Persson whew... those names took me 5 mins juz to type...  For lovers of slow rock, wif funky keyboards n purposeful lyrics, this is THE album to get!  Nina Persson, solo chanteuse, not only performs e vocals, but also pens e beautiful lyrics for all 11 songs abt awkward relationships (aptly titled Communication), reasons to love (You're the Storm, And Then You Kissed Me) n love fading over time (Could'nt Care Less).  The not too extraodinary voice of Persson, further lends an earthly quality to e songs, allowing listeners to readily identify wif e issues addressed.  Personal favs of mine in e album include Please Sister n A Good Horse, while simple but poignant words in Communication truly strikes chords within my heart...   I've seen u, i know u, but i dont know how to connect, so i disconnect   Lead Me Into The Night is yet another which impresses...   I went too far, yes i came too close I drove away the one i loved the most now i ride the tide on a boat made of sand Im sailing for another to guide me to land   Not bad for a swedish band huh?  ppl who noe me also noe i rarely buy music cds... this is one of e few i actually own

Act ditzy. Act smart. Act kiddy. Act grownup. Sign anything and agree to anything and don't mean it. Fall in love. Have crushes. Moon at people. Color your hair. Dress outrageously. Demand for money. Stay out late. Stay up late. Not do homework. Bum around. Throw temper tantrums. Be a cutie pie. Be a bich. Be an asshole.  Sigh...i miss that year.

       Odd one out   Yesterday I discovered another thing that separated me from the rest of my family. Aside from the fact that I'm the only one in my family who's bumming my days away, I'm also the only one who's still single. Heh. My younger brother finally came clean and admitted that he has got himself a girlfriend. Of course, I could jump on the bandwagon and get meself a guy (assuming that some guy does want me) and I'm sure my mom would probably throw a party to celebrate the joy of her daughter getting a boyfriend. But obviously, I'm not going to do that. I'm not stupid.   Looking back, 18 was a nice age to be in a relationship. All that puppy love crap and I mean that in the nicest way.

      Was reading through  urlLink Cale's blog  and I realised that I have not done much bitching on my site lately. After much musing, I came to the conclusion that it was not because of a lack of things to rant about, I was just too lazy to write my thoughts down. I miss all that bitching and ranting. Jumping on the bitchwagon, I have a few things to get off my [ urlLink unHooters-like ] chest.   Not many people know of my dislike for  urlLink Gurmit Singh . Yes, I really, really dislike him. "Singapore's very own Jim Carrey" my ass. It started with his portrayal of that horrid character, Phua Chu Kang and spiralled downwards when he sang that Sar-Vivor Rap shite. Whoever composed that rap ought to be shot. But it seems that the audiences (or at least, the TV execs) love Gurmit, cos now he has his own TV show, a kids show  a la  Bill Crosby's Kids Say the Darnest Things. Unfortunately, it fails to amuse me. When having a kids show, it is important to realise that the stars of the show should be the children and  NOT  the host. It also doesn't help the show if the host tries to be in the limelight by acting like a kid (and overdoing it of course). Gurmit also thinks he is so funny, but really, he is not THAT funny. Funny in a slapstick, bang head against wall, way, yes, but funny in a witty way, NO. I guess hosting a kids show is good for him because only children will be amused by his schtick,    Next rant :  urlLink Prudential   and any other insurance roadshows. I mention Prudential specifically because I was ambushed twice by them at two different MRT stations. Their sales pitch is always the same.    Prudential (P) : Do you save?  Me (M) : No  P : If you do, how much would you save?  M : But I don't.   P : But if you do, how much? 100? 200?  M : Fine fine. (sigh) Between 100 - 200.  P : Where do you put your savings?  M : In a bank.  P : Do you know that if you put 100 a month in a bank, after 25 years you'll only get $30,000?  [do the Math yourself]   M : Oh really?  [Like i give a fuck]   P : Yes. But if you put your money in a Prudential savings plan, you'll get $48,000 after 25 years.   M : Oh really?  [I still don't care]   P : So, can you tell me which one you would prefer?  M : Obviously consumers are going to tell you that they would prefer a plan which gives more returns. But like I told the first Prudential guy, I'm not working and I would rather have the cash then to put it all in a savings plan.   P : What if I told you that at the end of the year, you can withdraw $750 from your account, no questions asked?  M : So? I need the cash now and not at the end of the year.   P : Will it be ok if I called you every 2 weeks just to keep you updated?  M : There's no point. I'm not going to get a job in 2 weeks. And it better not be a recruitment call cos I'm telling you now, I'm not interested.  Ugh. If another guy comes up to me trying to sell some plan, I'll ask him to go jump off a cliff (or fuck himself, whichever). Irritating buggers. I'm betting that it will turn out to be a recruitment call cos that's what happened with the first Prudential guy.    [A phone call]   P : Hello, I'm so-and-so calling from Prudential.  M : Yes?   P : Have you thought about our plan?  M : No.   P : So, I'm just wondering, have you found a job yet?  M : No.  P : Would you be interested in....  M : No.  P : There is a recruitment talk....  M : No.  P : Oh ok. Thanks. Bye

       National Day Parade Preview 2003            The crowd was unbearable. The fun pack had a lot of goodies. Gurmit wasn't irritating (thank god) and horror of horrors, Fiona Xie was there. The best parts of the show were the fighter jets that flew overhead, the skydivers, and of course, the fireworks.

They have annoyed me even before I started watching the show (all thanks to recaps by  urlLink Miss Alli ). She is annoying, he is boring. I hope Jon and Al win cos they are my favourites and have been racing a good game thus far.

       More Updates   In my quest to lose weight (this time, I really need to do it), I have joined a fitness club.  urlLink Amore , to be exact. I figured I have to shell out money first before I am motivated enough to actually go for fitness classes. Grand plans to continue my latin classes have come to naught cos I think paying $30 per class per week is too much, especially since I'm saving money for a trip.   So, lessons start when I pay the rest of my course fees. Wish me luck in my quest.

       Movie Review - Lara Croft: Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life    Phew! What a mouthful.    As promised, this is the review.       Ass-kicking, gun-toting Lara Croft puts the grrr in "girl". With her sexy pout and smouldering eyes, she was certainly a sight to behold. Unlike Charlie's Angels, Lara did not waste time being all girly and giggly. No sirree, Ms Croft had better things to do with her time, and searching for Pandora's box was top on her agenda. She enlisted the help of an ex-flame cum mercenary cum traitor to the crown, Terri Sheridan (Gerard Butler), and with her two sidekick buddies (never knew their names), it was vital that she found the box first before Johnathan Reece (the bad scientist played by Ciaran Hinds).    Plot  There was some semblance of a plot, thin as it may be. As mentioned above, the main plot was to get to Pandora's box. Greek mythology was weaved into the movie. The movie started with Lara finding the ancient Lunar Temple, a temple built by Alex the great and was lost when some disaster occurred. The temple now lay underwater and no one ever found it until she came along. Chinese baddies followed her and took a glowing orb, which was the map to the location of the Cradle of Life where Pandora's box was kept. Baddies worked for Johnathan Reece who wanted the box so that he could sell it to other bad men for money. (Ahh, the wonders of greed)   [Cut to the last bit:]   Lara did find the Cradle of Life. Tapping to African mythology as well, the Cradle of Life was in some remote part of Africa, guarded by African tribesmen. Because Reece held her sidekick buddies hostage, she had to lead him to the Cradle of Life in order to save her friends. Of course, she found, and of course, she fought with Reese and killed him.   But there is a slight twist. Along the way, somewhere in Hong Kong, she ditched Terri, fearing that he would betray her. La-di-da... he was at the Cradle of Life as well. Now, he wanted to bring the box back. (Think of the fortune that it was worth. The wonders of greed). But Lara said no. (More talking ensued) In the end, she killed him.    Opinions and gripes   It was highly entertaining although some parts were so ridiculous. Picture this, Lara slides down a rope and does not get rope burns. WTF? Or, a poor Chinese family living on a boat but they own a Panasonic flat screen TV. And lastly, an African tribesman in traditional African garb drives a SHINY jeep and carries a state-of-the-art mobile phone. RIDICULOUS. But entertaining nonetheless.   Thankfully, dialogue was not cringeworthy and the audience was spared from unnecessary chatter. The movie was not overwhelmed with action sequences that attempted to mask the bare plot (think of Matrix Reloaded) and they were well executed. The scenery was certainly picturesque. Who needs to travel when you can visit Greece, remote parts of China, downtown Hong Kong and the desert regions of Africa by simply watching the movie? It was like a travel guide in disguise, not that I was complaining, of course.   All in all, I enjoyed it, surprisingly. Flawed plot and improbable scenes aside, it was entertaining and Angelina Jolie did not annoy me. The fact that she looked so good was a bonus. I would actually pay $8.50 for it.

       Updates   As usual, this is for those who give a fuck. *grin*  I'll be watching a movie tonight!  Lara Croft . The babelicious Angelina Jolie. God, that woman is sexy. I didn't watch the first one, so I hope that I would not feel overwhelmed by complexity of the plot. (heh, somehow, I doubt the movie would suffer from an over-complicated plot) Will definitely do a review of the movie later tonight or tomorrow.   For the first time in like 7 years, I'll be going to the National Day Parade this year. I never understood the kiasu mentality that plagued Singaporeans whenever the NDP tickets were up for grabs. As a result, I never bothered queueing for tickets 2 nights in advance, actually, I never bothered queueing up for the tickets. Period. But having a younger brother who is always so enthusiastic when it comes to volunteering for things like Union camps and ushering at NDP has its perks. hehe.. He was given a pair of tickets to the parade and my mom wants me to accompany her. Yes. My mom is the one who wants to go. My dad is just too lazy. So being the filial daughter that I am, I said ok, albeit reluctantly. I had to cancel my chocolate buffet dinner with my JC friends for her.    My social calendar is like so filled. Oh my gawd. Am I popular or what? [snort]   Planning a short beach trip with a gal pal of mine this August. That should be fun. Fun, yet cheap. Very important. I need money.

       Fluke - Visa Thingy   Here's the reply from my friend at the Immigrations and Customs Authority...hope it's useful  >>Hi Esther,  Pl see the below response from my colleague handling visa matters.  "It depends on what type of visa. From the approval letter, it will state very clearly if original passport needs to be produced. (Only for the issue of Multiple Journey Visa then we require original ppt)  "Can someone collect their friend's visa without the applicant's passport? That's because the applicant is overseas, the visa is approved but the applicant is afraid it might get cancelled before her return." (It appears that this is not visa. It might be student's pass instead. Regardless what is it, the requirement for collection will be stated very clearly in the In-principle approval letter.

       Movie Review - Vaanaprastham (The Last Dance)   i watched this movie at e recently concluded indigo filmfest held at gv marina... n wldnt have even gone, had a fren, deeply moved by indian culture, not asked me along... apparently, e film was made by some top indian director (whose name i cant pronounce, much less spell) n e cinematographer is some reknowned french guy... despite all this, i had no idea wat to expect from an indian-french co-production, n after wacthing e movie, i can only describe it as being deeply profound...  i read this review on IMDB, n felt dat it was excellent while mirroring many of my own views of e film, so i shall cut n paste it here... besides, i cant for e life of me remember nor spell e character's names or terms in e show, so i felt this wld be best in giving full credit to e filmmakers...             I watched this film far after its release, but instantly saw it as a fantastic picture that showcased the unmitigated talent of both a masterful director and the finest actor India has ever produced. "Vanaprastham" tells the story of a revered Kathakali dancer named Kunhikuttan, who spends his life deeply longing for both the father whose identity is kept a mystery from him and the son he bore in an extramarital affair with a woman who loves only a character he plays on stage. Karun uses two cameramen for the film, the first is the renowned French cinematographer Renato Berta and the other is India's finest, Santosh Sivan. The result is a slightly disjointed stream in the visual tone of the film, but nonetheless produces some exquisite and meaningful vistas. The movie is indeed a quiet, visual poem that explores and reflects the ancient art of Kathakali dance, a sacred form of theater that originated and continues to flourish in the South Indian state of Kerala. In Kathakali, the artistes do not speak a word. Rather, they dance to music and make use of virtually hundreds of subtle facial and physical expressions to weave a tale- usually one of Hindu mythology. Shaji N. Karun tells Kunhikuttan's story in a similar manner; silent yet profound.  Kunhikuttan is born to a low caste mother and a high caste Namboodiri (royalty) man who does not accept him as his son. As his life achingly passes by, he bears this burden on his shoulders along with a drinking problem that wears away at his reputation as the finest of Kathakali dancers. Married to a woman who despises him and tormented by a mother who drearily walks around with the secret of his father's identity, Kunhikuttan finds a chance for happiness in the arms of a married woman, Subhadra, who falls under the spell of his divine dance as the character of Arjuna. That happiness, he learns, is an illusion. In the twilight of his life Kunhikuttan, numbed by the pain he has endured all his life, takes a bold step as he prepares for a last dance.  The film is about fathers and sons, about silence and speech and the space between. Karun weaves all the themes together seamlessly, and although the story is a bit ambiguous at times, the overall impact of the picture is stunning. Zakir Hussein's music is a vital part of creating the boundaries of silence and sound. At times furious and at times subtle, the genius of the composer can only be described as soul-stirring.  It is the central performance of Mohanlal as Kunhikuttan, however, that breathes life into the picture and the character. We feel his burdens and his pain. We feel the triumph and fury of his characters on stage. Mohanlal learns Kathakali for this part, and the result adds to the multifacted brilliance of his remarkable portrayal. There is a progression that exudes through his face in the course of the narrative. From a curiosity, to a longing, to a rage, a depression a spirituality and finally to a peaceful sublime. The incredible range of this actor is in full display. Karun is intelligent enough to know this and make use of it. Here, Mohanlal won the National Film Award of India, won international acclaim at Cannes and other festivals, and in my opinion confirms his preeminence among both modern and classic Indian actors. The film, quiet and moving as it is, requires an actor to step up and use his body and his soul. In the end, the picture grows so quietly intimate and the performance so engaging, we can only sit in revered silence as the credits roll.  hinducowz New York, NY     My own thoughts:   parts of e movie remain inexplicable cos of e great cultural divide, as i felt dat certain scenes n nuances have religious or social undertones unique to an indian culture, but alien to someone such as me... i doubt if any of u out there actually will have a chance of catching this movie, but if u do, pleees go watch it even if its 10 bucks...

       Computers and all their shit   I now know how to create a p2p network!! Have been trying to connect my two computers together for the past 4 days and I finally did it yesterday. All hail the great Nephthys! Unfortunately, my mini-LAN cannot work with the Internet simultaneously because there is only 1 Ethernet card on the main computer and I'm using the Ethernet to connect the computers.   I have been transferring all my shit from one computer to the other and burning them. Soon, I shall learn how to reformat a computer. Ooh, how exciting. *rolls eyes* This is what happens when everyone else in the family is busy with their own shit and I'm the only jobless/school-less one in the family.

       Movie Review - Alex and Emma    My turn to write a movie review. Before I begin, please do not think I actually paid to watch this show.    Plot  Another romantic comedy starring Kate Hudson  (How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days)  and Luke Wilson  (Cameron Diaz's bf in Charlie's Angels) . Luke Wilson plays a writer, (oops, forgot his name), suffering from a bad case of writer's block. To make things worse for him, he owes money to a bunch of Cuban thugs. He has to write his book in 30 days in order to have get the money to pay those thugs back. Oh, by the way, the Cuban guys burnt his laptop, hence the need for a stenographer. This is where Kate Hudson's character, (Oh dammit, forgot her name as well) comes in. Blah blah blah, like all romantic comedies, you can definitely expect these 2 people to fall in love by the time the movie ends.   Remarks  This movie fails to deliver, unlike Kate Hudson's previous foray into this genre.  How To Lose a Guy  was a very enjoyable show and the easy chemistry between Kate and Matthew was a pleasure to behold. Kate perkiness, which was evident in her previous movie, is surprisingly absent. Instead of a sunny, blonde disposition, Kate is dark haired and mousy. Luke Wilson is also not as charming as Matthew McCounathingamajic (heh, dunno how to spell his name).   There were some comedic bits though. I can vaguely remember laughing, but I cannot point out where those bits are in the show.    On the whole....  Bleah, it was ok. A date movie, I suppose. Only die-hard fans of romantic comedies would look forward to watching the show. I wouldn't watch this show unless it's free.   ps: I do enjoy watching romantic comedies. Unfortunately, many of them disappoint me. None have caught my attention since  "The Truth About Cats and Dogs" . Funnily, I love that show, although it's no Memento. But then again, hardly any of the romantic comedies are.

       Movie Review - Whale Rider         whew... my 3rd movie in 2 wks... tink i gotta go easy on my movie urges now... those gal frens i watched wif pressured me into eating strawberries wif macs sundae during e show too... gotta admit its kinda yummy =p   Synopsis:   The story is told abt e journey of Paikea, sole surviving daughter (her twin bro was stillborn, n mother died after a difficult labor) of e future chief of a maori tribe.  Abandoned by a father intent on pursuing his own dreams, Paikea strives to assume e mantle of chief, much to e chagrin of her grandfather, who despite his luv for his granddaughter, feels bound by patriachal traditions to reject her claim.  Destiny and perseverance, however, have other ideas...   Gripes:   well... cld certainly do wif more subtitles as they spoke in maori for extended periods... felt an urge to understand e beauty of their prose, esp when they burst into their traditional songs   Compliments:   Keisha castle-hughes as e 12 yr old maori gal, was extremely convincing in her role... simple yet poignant performances cannot fail to move e audience... i noe most reviews discuss e film as a celebration of female emancipation n gal power or watever, but i do feel dat e true strength of e movie lies in e richness of its cultural portrayals, e struggle of a unique ppl determined not to be buried by e sands of time n western imperialism... as Paikea said herself (erm... i try to recall it word for word lah): i am Paikea, one in a long line of ancestors from Hawaiki... a ppl moving forward wif all our strength".  A truly beautiful tale told at e pace n wif e spirit of a maori legend...   Last words:   if u ar a cultural movie buff, u cant miss this for all e world... pay 8.50 if u must

       Games Review - The Sims Livin' Large Expansion Pack    OOh. My first game review. I don't exactly know when this Expansion Pack (EP) was released, but it doesn't matter. Livin Large is basically an extension of the first game. New additions include more neighbourhoods, new clothes, more stuff to add to the homes and 5 new careers. After getting very bored with the first game, the new additions make the game alot more interesting. It is now possible to have themed homes or neighbourhoods. I tried creating a themed home and frankly, that was one of the ugliest homes I've created. It had medieval furniture, like wooden pews, candles and even a statue of a knight. Pretty cool, but it was utterly horrid to look at.   Because I lost the Serial number of my first sims, I could never log in to the Sims site to download additional items, hence, I had to keep playing with the same things repeatedly. But this time round, I have problems activating my account. I hope it's going to be resolved soon so that I can design my own wallpaper and tile.    Overall  On the whole, definitely alot more interesting. One good thing about the Sims is that no 2 households are the same. Heh, I know this very well, since I have the game installed on 3 different computers cos each computer kept fucking up. Each time I installed the game, I kept trying to recreate my previous game but it never turns out the same.   I would definitely buy the other EPs soon. :) Especially since I'm so free now, being unemployed and all.

          Your distinct personality, The Discoverer, might be found in most of the thriving kingdoms of the time. Your overriding goal is to go where no one else has ever gone before. Regardless of the number of available natural problems to be solved, it is not unusual for you to continually challenge yourself with new situations or obstacles that you have created. You are an insatiable explorer of people, places, things and ideas. You thrive on constant change and anything new or different. On the positive side, you can be creatively rational as well as open minded and just. On the negative side, you might be an impractical and indecisive procrastinator. Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms.   Ooh.. that's accurate!!! A creatively rational, open-minded, impractical procrastinator.

       WOOHOO!   JUBILATION! I have my PC back!   FYI, my home computer, not that bitchy datamini, absolutely crashed on me and everyone who was using it. UGH. So it had to be sent for repair and I have been net-less for the past 3 or 4 days. One might wonder why I didn't use my Datamini. Ok a little background info, my Datamini, or, as I lovingly call it, the bitch, (heee, it's a girl pc) is the pc I used when I was in hall and that bitch is a fucking cranky thing. When I brought it back home, it went into a coma when I tried to boot it up. It's now working again, and sits in my room. The home pc sits in my spare room and this is where the net is hooked up. I didn't not want to bring in my pc cos I do not want it to die on me during the transfer. Anyway, the cable modem wire was too short for my room. To cut the long story short, I no internet connection for my family. But now I'm back.  Ooh! I bought the Sims Expansion pack!!! It is SOOOO FUN!! I've been hooked on it for the past few days!!

Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms.  sheesh... really quite true leh... or at least consistent wif other tests

       A medieval Personality test      I am the black knight - a distinct personality, The Black Knight, might be found in most of the thriving kingdoms of the time. Your overriding goal is to win. You approach each task or situation as a contest to be won strategically and efficiently. Because you can control your feelings, it is not unusual for you to charm, as well as successfully delegate tasks and responsibilities to the more emotional types. You are often concerned with what's in it for you. You seldom involve yourself in activities where you can not foresee a reward for your investment or effort. On the positive side, you can be analytically empathic and logically persuasive. On the negative side, you may be unemotionally manipulative as well as arrogant, selfish and impulsive. Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms............  how damn forking true.....  http://www.cmi-lmi.com/kingdom.html

       Movie Review - City of God / Cidade de Deus   i have no idea y im blogging so much lately... either im too free at home, or im finally doing something in my life worth toking abt... hmm... anyway, i tink cineleisure is e only theatre screening this movie, n im proud to say dat its also e 1st RA movie i've seen in e cinema since i turned 21... wow... tink e staff were trying hard not to laff when they checked my ic... heh   Synopsis:   a true story of gang wars n hoodlums in a slum near rio de janeiro, e film traces e life of 1 boy who grows up to be a photographer n leaves e cycle of poverty n drugs in e city of god.  interspersed thruout e thread of his lifestory, ar sidetracks of e lives of others who were not as fortunate or determined in their struggles.   Gripes:   hmm... tink i'll write e compliments bit 1st b4 coming back to this... cant tink of any rite now   Compliments:   i kindof like e innovative method of injecting diff stories of other characters thruout e movie, sometimes wif flashbacks n at diff perspectives of e protagonists... even tho it may be abt e same event, but switching camera angles n all to show whose pt of view we ar at, makes it really cool, cos its e 1st time i've seen a movie take such a method to such lengths. based from e 60s to 70s, its soundtrack is also full of disco hits n tunes contemporous wif e times... sortof in accordance wif e whole style of e film - hippy, cool n vibrant... all this wifout any compromise on  wat e movie is really all abt ie e brutality of  life in e slums    Conclusion:   oops... tink i forgot to write any gripes... heheh... well, u go watch it n tell me if u dun like any part of e movie... its definitely worth 8.50

       Music Review - The Complex by Blue Man Group   for fans of dance-trance-chillout-lounge music ala moby, this is a muz buy, or at least, a muz listen  if u arent familiar wif e grp, its ok, cos i wasnt either till last wk when i saw them being introduced on some cable music prog... they've apparently been ard for quite awhile... n erm, if u've seen a mtv wif 3 guys painted in blue striking weird mechanical gadgets, dats juz them playing their music wif their self-made musical instruments  anyway, its hard to describe e genre of music it fits into, tho e urge to dance or simply jump according to its tunes n rhythm is almost unbearable... coupled wif surreal lyrics dat reflect e realities of our mundane lives, this is definitely not ur average music album out juz to please ur ears...  personal fav tracks include  Sing Along    if i sing a song, will u sing along, or shld i juz keep singing right here by myself? if i tell u im strong, will u play along, or will u see im as insecure as everybody else? if i follow along does it mean i belong, or will i keep on feeling different than everybody else?    Persona  cld very well have been some modern poetry written in angst n self-discovery... so true... so real...   every morning i put it on. i walk outside n im gone. i dun seem to mind anymore. i cant tink wat it was like b4 i wore it all e time. in e evening i take it off. but theres another underneath. n i cant seem to find e bottom of e stack. i might juz lose my mind n neva get it back, but at least i'll get inside. theres a feeling dat i get sometimes. its so small dat its easy to hide. its like a howling voice from e distant past. it seems i have no choice when it comes to this. its building up inside   erm... i noe i've said i seldom buy cds... i bot this one n dun tink i'll ever regret doing so

       Ahoy Mate   Have not blogged since last week. Quite an achievement eh? The last few days have been an emotional ride for me. It's too long to explain why, but I am feeling much better now. :) No more crabby behaviour. No more confusion or having the urge to burst into tears for no apparent reason. Sheesh. As I've told some friends, it sucks being a girl during times like these. Hate feeling like that.   So yay for me. Tonight am going out with Morg. Heee. We're gonna play bimbo pool. At least I'm going to play bimbo pool, he wld probably be playing normal pool.   I need to raise funds for a trip to the US. Any one has any ideas? Of course, I could just get a job, but since I'm tutoring, there isn't time for a proper job. But my tutoring fees aren't enough to cover the cost for a really long trip to the US.  I'm planning to stay with my aunt, so at least accommodation is covered.

       MOVIE REVIEW - CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE       There should be no expectations when one plans to watch a chick flick. Charlie's Angels is MOST definitely a chick flick. Fun, campy and downright ridiculous at times.  I enjoyed it in a "that's so ridiculous, it's funny" sort of way.    Plot  Basically, the girls had to retrieve 2 rings which when placed together can de-code the names of people in the witness protection program. Very useful for mafia families. Think of Mission Impossible, where whats-his-face had to retrieve the NOC List. There are subplots as well, but too thin to even discuss in detail.    Villains   Demi Moore as Madison Lee is HOT. She looks so much better with her long flowing hair, than the bald 'do she had in GI Jane. There are bunch of other villains, like Drew's ex-boyfriend, dunno his character name, played by Justin Theroux. Great body, reminded me a little of Robbie Williams. There was also Ray Carter, played by the guy who was the metal man in Terminator.    Other characters   Bernie Mac annoyed me. Never found him funny. They should have gotten someone else to play that role. Crispin Glover as the thin man, was well, silent. Matt LeBlanc was very Joey-like.    Gripes   Aside from Bernie Mac, I don't have any main gripes. The action sequences are very Matrix-like, which makes it look like a rip-off. (heh, i guess, it's supposed to be a rip-off).   Overall  Ok lah. I mean, I enjoyed myself. I would only pay $6.50 for it though.

       The night we went to the ball....         There was a point in time when balls were eagerly anticipated. Weeks and weeks of planning had to be done in order to get the perfect dress. Friends went together to have fun, couples took the opportunity to be on a romantic date, and everyone wanted to have a good time.   Last night was no exception for the many people who turned up. Gowns of all colours, patterns and sizes paraded themselves in the ballroom. However, last night's event was lacking in atmosphere. The audience was rather bland and there was no air of excitement. Not many people were enthusiastic enough to participate in the games and many even left for photo opportunities outside during the performances. There was no festivities, aside from a smattering of "yam sengs" at the end of the night. The only time when everyone seemed interested in the happenings of the night was during the lucky draw where cries of "redraw" can be heard everytime there was a no-show by the owner of the number. DJ Rod Monteiro was the mc for the night. He was ok. Talked a little too much but unfortunately not terribly funny.   My table was filled with a bunch of strangers. Two guys who kept to themselves, and 2 other couples who kept to each other. No one talked to each other. And or two even looked bored.   No body in the ballroom danced when the dinner ended as they were too busy taking pictures. This was very different from my JC graduation night where the dance floor was packed with people dancing as soon as the VIPs left. Selin and I wanted to club, but unfortunately I had 2 huge blisters on my feet from wearing icky shoes (they were the only things that matched) so we went home at 12.30am.  On the whole it was an ok night, not terribly exciting. We realised that even if more of our friends came, it wouldn't make that much of a difference, because the glory days of balls and graduation nights have come to an end for us a long time ago.

       Antisocial, snobbish, or juz plain aloof??   juz got back from a fren's 21st bday party held at Zee 10, which kindof reminded me of my own peculiar habits in socialising... or rather lack of a habit... heh...  1stly, when left alone in any grp of strangers, i'll neva be e 1st to introduce myself n offer a handshake... 2ndly, even if we've aredi been introduced to each other, i'll neva bother to make conversation juz to be polite or to relieve e awkward moments of silence...  i noe others may see my behaviour as being antisocial or even snobbish (esp after they find out im from ri/rj which kindof legitimizes their accusations of me being snobbish)... but e truth is, i really dun care abt making frens or being polite... dats juz me... i juz dun see any reason y i shld tok abt fluffy stuff n be introduced to ppl whose names i'll forget in 30s n whose faces i'll probly neva see again...  u may not like it, but dats ur prob... =p

       Updates   I am supposed to watch Bent tonight. But at the very last minute, Thursday night for that matter, a friend said that we could still get tickets for our Convocation ball. I really want to go for the ball, but that would mean I would have to cancel my Bent outing.  APOLOGIES  to bitchbert for ditching you at the last minute and leaving the ticket hanging like that. I am sure that you would still enjoy the play with your other two friends. I wouldn't cancel out on you like that if it was anything other than the ball. I really hope you understand.   So tonight I'm going to the Ball, with no new clothes. I would probably get myself a decent shawl/cheapo pashmina to keep myself warm. I'll be sure to take pictures, although I'm positive that I know no one there aside from the friend that I'm going with. Hee, two single gals to the ball.

       Movie Review - The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen     Plot  It is 1899 and the world is in peril (yet again) from a mask-wearing freak called, Phantom, who kidnapped a bunch of scientists to make automated weapons and machinery. The Queen's liege, M ( urlLink Richard Roxburgh ) gathers a bunch of highly-strung individuals to foil the freak's attempt to destroy Venice (or so they were made to believe). Throw in tons of unnamed German extras and CGI and you are done.    Characters  And so, the audience is introduced to the group leader, Allan Quartermain ( urlLink Sean Connery ), an old swashbuckling hunter hiding out in Africa. M also recruits the invisible man, Skinner ( urlLink Tony Curran ), who has an attitude very much like the black dude in any white-cop movie. Skinner is also the designated comic relief. Then comes Mina Harker ( urlLink Peta Wilson  of " urlLink La Femme Nikita " fame), a vampyress (if there is ever such a word). She is the supposed "ice-queen" of the movie, being the only female in the group and film for that matter. (Female extras don't count) She also hardly ever breaks out in a sweat while wearing those high-necked gowns of hers and that face veil. (Eeurggh. I would be scratching my neck in desperation if I were her.) The fourth member of the league is Mr Dorian Gray ( urlLink Stuart Townsend , vampire in "Queen of the Damned" aka the guy who would have been Aragorn, thank god he wasn't). Mr Gray's talent if you can call it that, is immortality and immorality. Mina and Grey are the show's designated love/lust couple. Captain Nemo ( urlLink Naseeruddin Shah ) adds international  flava  to the cast.  He doesn't say much but drives a big-ass silver ship and has a car that is the movie's batmobile. What movie is complete without a tortured hero? This is where Dr Jekyll ( urlLink Jason Flemyng ) comes in. He is only wimpy until he becomes Hyde. The process of transformation is as freaky as hell. Another swashbuckler completes the group. Tom Sawyer ( urlLink Shane West ) is your typical American teenager with his devil-may-care attitude. He is also the only one who gets to drive the freakmobile, ie, cute guys get the cool car. He also attempts to charm the lady vampire (Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake comes to mind) but it all came to naught, thank god.       Sean Connery : This 72 year old definitely has screen presence. He can be saying "baa-baa-black-sheep" and it will still sound good. It was a tad disconcerting to see him punch guys half his age without him keeling over from a heart attack. He may have been the greatest James Bond ever but sheesh,  age  should be catching up on him right? But then again, he is the executive producer, and I guess he could make himself marry a teenage mermaid in the show if he wanted to. I enjoyed him more as Indiana Jones' dad than as Allan Quartermain.   Tony Curran : Well, this guy was covered in white most of the time. He could have been computer generated  a la  Gollum for all I know. And since he was invisible, I could not see his  *ahem*  other parts. So no gushing for me.    Peta Wilson : I loved her in "La Femme". As the vampira, she was good enough. Didn't stretch her acting abilities alot but it was cool watching her feed on humans. She was a little too healthy looking as a vampire though. She ought to be a little more sallow-skinned like Drusilla from Buffy. Heck, they should have gotten Drusilla to do the job.    Stuart Townsend : Forever known as the guy who COULD have been Aragorn. Stupid boy. He was bland as Dorian Gray. He should have brought Lestat into his character. Dorian hardly sizzled with Mina and only the obvious dialogue clued the audience into their supposed chemistry. And man, what is with the moustache?    Naseeruddin Shah : Err, who?? Nuff said.   Jason Flemyng : As Hulk, oh, I mean Hyde, he growled alot. As mentioned, the transformation process was freaky. *shudder* As Jekyll he was a wimp. An ugly wimp to boot.    Shane West : Definitely too pretty to be Tom Sawyer. He had about as much facial hair as Peta Wilson in the show. Perhaps Heath Ledger should have auditioned for the role. I think he was just there for demographic purposes, to rein the millions of girls who loved him in " urlLink Once and Again " and " urlLink A Walk to Remember ".   Gripes & Comments  Watching the movie was like bad sex. Imagine, you are in a bar and you meet a guy called LXG. He looks sleek, is nicely dressed and he is winking at you. You think to yourself, "aww hell, why not? It is only $7.50." So you bring him up to your room and proceed to  ravish  him. In bed, he does all the right things but somehow, he doesn't excite. And during the climax he fails to live up to expectations. To top it all of, as soon as he is done, he rolls to the side and starts snoring. So you find yourself staring up at the ceiling wondering what the fuck happened.   That is exactly what happened. From all the trailers, I definitely thought that LXG would be the X-men of the month. There were too many characters which affected the amount of screen time each character had. As a result, they are a little thin. And while it was commendable that the writers tried to add conflict within the characters (Jekyll and Hyde is an example), these conflicts were never really dealt with. The show also never explained why "bad" guys like a vampire, an amoral immortal and a building-damage expert would want to join the sorority. I have never read the graphic novel, so I cannot say how much better the book was compared to the movie.   The storyline was a little muddled as well. And it seemed like a twist was added because in the book "Making Movies for Dummies", it was stated that all good movies should have a twist. It is also stated that in all good-evil movies, the villain should endeavour to destroy the world. Even CGI effects failed to impress, and it had improbable scenes like the Nautilus navigating through the narrow waterways of Venice. WTF??. One other thing, if Mina was a vampire, why didn't she turn to dust when she was walking on top of Nautilus during the day?? The show could have and should have been much darker with the conflict between good and evil made more obvious among the members. There was an attempt to get the characters to interact. Mina and Dorian, ex-lovers. Mina and Jekyll, unrequited crush. Mina and Tom, a Cameron-Justin attraction. Tom and Allan, a father-son relationship (more like grandpa and grandson). Skinner and everyone, the pain in the ass partner. Unfortunately, Captain Nemo was just there to fulfill his duty as the chauffeur.   To top it all off, the bloody screen was turned off at least 1 minute before the credits rolled  WHILE  the sound was still blasting from the speakers. So I didn't know what happened at the very last bit after the witchdoctor raised his hands up.   To give credit, the design was impressive. I absolutely loved the libraries, all covered in books.    Overall : Bah. I should have watched S.W.A.T instead. At least I know what to expect from such a movie. I would pay only $6.50 for this. I think I will buy the graphic novel.

       Bits and Bites   So today I went back to school to collect my  CONVOCATION GOWN ! Woohoo! Thanks to SARS, we can now keep our convocation gown and mortarboard for a mere $20.80. Trying out the gowns was fun. We pretended that we were Chinese Opera performers because of the long sleeves. We kind of waddled in our gowns because some were too big. I got my transcript as well. Another Woohoo for me! Nothing fantastic on the script only the Merit. I was telling my friend that if I had gotten a First Class Honours, I would parade around with that piece of paper with the "First Class Honours" highlighted in yellow. We were given a free gown bag to dump all our junk in; gown, mortarboard, yellow hood, transcript, invitation cards and other pieces of trash. I also ordered a shiny redwood plaque. Bah. It cost me a whopping $73 but I figured it was more worth it than the graduation bear. The bear was cute, but I have no space in my room for another soft toy. I now have to get myself close-toed shoes and a long-sleeved shirt to wear with the gown because of the strict dress code. Sigh, and I was banking on wearing my blue/yellow sneakers and a halter top for the occasion. Hee. At least shopping for shoes will be fun!  Oooh! I had my  FAVOURITE  ban mian at the foodcourt in Jurong Point. Yum! The only place I can get ban mian without the pork. My tongue is still slightly burnt because I drank the soup while it was still hot. Ahh, I miss going to Jurong Point.   Watched LXG just now. Will definitely do a review about it tomorrow morning. I can barely keep my eyes open now and I am having a hiccup as I type this post.  PS: For those who don't know, my convocation ceremony will be on the  12th of September at 3.00pm.

       Dreams   I had a bizarre dream last night. I committed a fashion  faux pas  by going out in the ugliest,  UGLIEST  pair of pants ever! It was full of printed flowers and was yellow in colour. It was one of those baggy drawstring pants that billowed around my thighs. To top it all off, I was wearing a printed T-shirt! Like oh my gawd! Prints and prints  DO NOT  go well together. The colour of the t-shirt clashed with the pants. It was orange, if I'm not mistaken.  YUCK !  I must have looked like a moron that even my dream friends commented on it and advised me to get myself a new pair of pants and shoes. So I bought a pair of black capri pants and funky blue Nikes. Hee  After that, I must have gone on a holiday or something because I was in a dorm full of  girls , sharing just one bathroom. They all seemed unwashed and when I was about to take my shower, one of them hid in the bathroom with me. Don't ask me what was she doing there because I was trying to get over the shock of having a girl share toilet space with me.

       The Many Things I Miss      Watching soccer    Sigh. I can't believe I'm saying this. For those who know me, know that I absolutely detest watching soccer on tv. Somehow, this dislike has lessened over the past few months. I got used to watching all those international friendlies on tv in the mornings. I had no idea who was playing most of the time, and the only players I could recognise were the cute players from Real Madrid and the other English teams. I definitely could recognise Casillas, seeing as how I had a MAJOR crush on him during the world cup days. Why watch soccer when I hate it? Let me qualify that I only like watching the world cup, and even so, only for one half of a game. But when they had those friendlies in the mornings, I actually watched an entire match! It was pretty exciting. I know close to nothing about all those soccer terms. I only know one has to kick the ball into the opposite goal.   Maybe I oughta get cable so I can have access to all the leagues going on. Hmm, that might be an overdose for me.     Going for lessons    Yes. I miss school in general. I miss having the "pleasure" of waking up and rushing for an 8.30 am class. I also miss cutting class and doodling on my lecture notes. I had always made it a point to cut at least 1 tutorial and 1 lecture for every subject every semester. Maybe that's why my grades weren't fantastic. Hee. Whenever we cut class, we would then go to the canteen to eat and chat/gossip/bitch. Rarely do we cut to do our readings, unless it was a major project that was due that very day.     Hall life    Living in the dorms is one of the best things ever. Independence for at least 5 days a week at only $155 per month and without having to pay for utilities and internet connection at all! I miss walking to the nearest 7-11 at 2.00am with a friend because we were bored and hungry. I miss attempting to run the horrid 179 bus route at nights, which I could eventually do without stopping. I miss blogging at 4.00am after doing tutorials for half the night. I miss crashing over at a friend's room while studying together. I miss going for a swim in the mornings when it is hot and sunny.     Playing computer games    Playing games need alot of time. At least a few hours at a stretch, a luxury I don't have right now. There was a point in time when I used to skip lectures because I was busy building my empire in Pharoah. Yes, yes, it's an unhealthy thing to do, but I can be cooped up in the room for hours and hours sitting in front of the pc playing the game. Pharoah, Sims, Starcraft, Command & Conquer were all my best friends at some point in my life. I even tried that game Counterstrike for the hell of it but I sucked. I could not run and shoot straight to save my life.

       The Many Ways of Saying No   Working in a call center is definitely not for the short-tempered, especially when customers have a zillion ways of saying NO. Such a short word, and yet the hardest to say nicely.   Three weeks into the job and I've heard many variations of the brusque NO. The customer is typically male, most likely to be working in local firm. He will usually butt in during the introduction and say "No! No! No!" a couple of times before hanging up on you without even saying good bye. If he "allows" you to go on, there usually would be grunting on his end, to show that he is listening to the conversation. After which, he will proceed to say "No. No. No." and then hang up.  Sometimes if you're lucky, you will get a seemingly polite man or woman who would listen to your speech and sound interested. But when it comes to the crunch, they will start backpeddling so fast they would be hit by a car if they were on the road. These people have an aversion to saying "No", so they invent a thousand and one excuses to reject your request. It is obvious that they are backpeddling because they try out various excuses until you back off.     "I'm not free now"  "Actually, I will not be free till the end of the year"  "I'm in the middle of a conference"  "I will be travelling for the next few months and won't be back till Oct"  Following that, you may get secretaries who screen calls for their bosses. And being the little miss bitches that they are, they assume the role of "boss" when they are on the phone. No doubt these women have gotten the green light to screen calls, but they get so snide about it. Without even asking the boss, they will say that he isn't interested.   "Oh, I don't think that Mr Lee will be interested. No need to call back. Oh, no need to ask for the address either because he isn't interested"   It is extremely annoying when the receptionist asks for your name, company and intention for calling as though she would put the call through, only to inform you that the person you're looking for has died/resigned/relocated/retired.   Three weeks into the job and I'm dying. A little part of me dies everytime I make a call. I need to get out.  HELP

       Ways to Annoy People   1. Sing the Batman theme incessantly.  2. Learn Morse code, and have conversations with friends in public consisting entirely of "Beeeep Bip Bip Beeeep Bip..."  3. Speak only in a "robot" voice.  4. Sniff incessantly.  5. Reply to everything someone says with "that's what YOU think."  6. Invent nonsense computer jargon in conversations, and see if people play along to avoid the appearance of ignorance.  7. Finish all your sentences with the words "in accordance with prophesy."  8. Do not add any inflection to the end of your sentences, producing awkward silences with the impression that you'll be saying more at any moment.  9. Holler random numbers while someone is counting.  10. Signal that a conversation is over by clamping your hands over your ears.   11. Change channels five minutes before the end of every show.   12. Begin all your sentences with "ooh la la!"   13. ONLY TYPE IN UPPERCASE.   14. Wander around a restaurant, asking other diners for their parsley  15. Inform others that they exist only in your imagination.     [Writer's note: If any of you do that to me, I swear, I'll throw my shoe at you. Other than that, enjoy!]

       Morning Madness   Are you awake early enough to even have a morning routine? If so, what do you do? I love morning routines, not because it is organised and boring but because I can accomplish a certain number of things before my brain actually starts functioning. You see, I wake up at a freakish hour of 7 to 7.30 every day, including weekends as well. There is no point telling me to sleep in because it doesn't work. The latest I can sleep until is 8.30 am or 9. However, I'm not one of those perky morning people, despite my early wake up times. And so, I have a routine that I follow fairly religiously every day so that my brain will get used to being awake.    The first thing I do when I wake up is read the newspapers. As biased as the  urlLink Straits Times  can be, it is the only source of information I have at my doorstep. While reading the papers, I also tune in to  urlLink Channel NewsAsia  for the business and other prime time news, hence, my "crush" on the dishy  urlLink Tim Go  (without the H as fluke pointed out). My other business hunk, Jack Sung, left the tv station, and was replaced by a  girl . Reading the papers would take anywhere from 30 mins to even an hour, depending on how thorough I want to be.  I refuse to go out without reading the papers first and so I'd rather be late than skip my daily readings.  Only after reading the papers and checking my emails online will I then be remotely ready to leave the house. On days I have tuition, I would leave by 9. Other days would be spent bumming around or exercising. I love bumming around and doing nothing. My weekends would be similar. My Saturdays start even earlier because I have tuition at a godawful time of 8.30am.   The routine goes down the drain whenever I have a new game to play. Recently it was  urlLink the Sims . (Hot Date & Livin' Large). I spent up to 8 to 10 hours a day playing that darned game, stopping only for food and a shower. I did the same thing when I was hooked on  urlLink Pharoah . I absolutely love that game.

      Exactly! Which is why its so ironic that one of Bush's reasons for going to war with Iraq was to quell the threat of terrorism. Well, that obviously went really well. Oh but wait, do we even know what the reason for going to war was anymore? The agenda keeps changing, its hard to keep up. First it was to remove WMD, then its to quell terrorism, and when they actually got there and started shooting at people, its to liberate the Iraqis! Wow! All these altruistic notions spewing forth from the USA. Who would have thought?

       Violence begets violence       I am not wont to write about serious issues on this site, hmm, unless one considers lifestyle problems a serious issue. But frankly I am sick of waking up in the mornings only to read and watch about the spate of bombings occurring in the world today. Even the dishy newsreader, Timothy W Goh (hee) isn't dishy enough to distract me from the news. Bombings in  urlLink Mumbai   and the  urlLink Middle East   have made this week a particularly gruesome one. Bomb blasts in Bali and Jakarta have brought the problem closer to home and no country can pretend to be free from the terrorist threat.   It's ironic isn't it that violence is used to achieve peace? But as one can see, it DOESN'T work. If it does, the world should be at peace now and Iraq should be on its way to recovery. But as we all know, that isn't going to happen anytime soon. The cycle of violence perpetuates when the warring sides refuse to rise above it. Tit for tat, an eye for an eye, and blood for blood. Everyone vows revenge. Martyrdom has never been so popular before. The promise of heaven is a good enough lure for suicide bombers to strap on the bomb vest and blow him/herself up. It is also easier to blame other people for one's own problems. Everyone is the enemy, and currently, enemy #1 is the Western world.   The roots of violence run deep and encompass a myriad of factors, economic and social problems among other things. The impacts of bombings have far-reaching consequences than just immediate revenge and death. But if no one is willing to stop and break the cycle of violence, then we will all sing:   This is the war that doesn't end Yes it goes on and on my friend Some people started killing men not knowing what's the loss And they'll continue killing men forever just because...

       MOVIE REVIEW - DOWN WITH LOVE          Ladies and gentlemen, let me get this off my chest right now, "EWAN MCGREGOR IS  HOT !!!!" There, I've said it. Now I can begin my review.    Plot  A gem of a movie starring Ewan McGregor, Renee Zellweger, David Hyde Pierce and Sarah Paulson. Set in the 60s in New York City, Down With Love casts Renee as Barbara Novak, a writer who opines that women can have sex a la carte just like men and Ewan as Catcher Block, a writer for a man's magazine and also known as a ladies' man, a man's man and man about town. Sarah and David are Barbara's and Catcher's respective bosses. The movie shows the budding romance between the two leads while they are pretending to be people they are not. At the same time, Catcher's boss, Peter (Hyde Pierce) is attempting to have his own romance with Renee's editor, Vicky (Paulson).   After being publicly snubbed by Barbara because he failed to turn up for any of his interviews with her (he was supposed to do a cover story on Barbara for the magazine), he vows to get the expose on Barbara. His "beautifully" crafted plan to get her to fall in love with the persona he created, Zip Martin, a Texan astronaut, unravels like a torn rug when the tables were turned on him. He fell in love with her instead.    Characters     urlLink Renee   was adorable as the feminist advice writer, Barbara. With her endless supply of fabulous clothes, she looked great in every scene she was in. Her perky attitude was just right and not too saccharine for my taste. She pulled her role off with aplomb, great clothes aside.   urlLink Ewan   was HOT! As Catcher Block, he had the right combination of playboy charm and new-age sensitivity. He was also able to maintain a credible Texan accent throughout the show. He proves again that he is a versatile actor, and comedy can be added to his list growing of talents. To think that this is the same guy who acted in  urlLink  Trainspotting   as a heroin addict. Personally, I thought   urlLink David Hyde Pierce   stole the show. Comedy is certainly his forte. With his deadpan face, he spouted his one-liners perfectly. He was able to get the audience rolling around laughing with just a look, without having to resort to slap-stick comedy (unlike some comedians I know). His neurotic character certainly brought to mind his other character, Niles from Fraisier.   urlLink Sarah Paulson   was also suited for her role. As Barbara's editor, she shared runway space with her.    Comments   In one word, the movie was CUTE. It was light and frothy like a pina colada on a hot day. Another plus point was the fantastic dialogue. The witty repartee between Ewan and Renee as well as with David was fabulous. Double entendres abound and it culminated in a split-screen visual that was absolutely hilarious. One thing I liked about the show was that it didn't pretend to be a serious, thought-provoking movie. With the retro backdrop - bright colours, an almost comic-like Manhattan scenery, and tons of retro-chic clothes, the movie was anything BUT heavy. Issues on feminism and male-chauvinism were dealt with so lightly that it was like powdered sugar on a cinnamon roll.    Overall   I enjoyed myself thoroughly. Worth paying $8.50 for it. Of course the biggest draw was Ewan and David. Ewas was HOT!!

       Men Psychology 101   A man is dating three women and wants to decide which to marry. He decides to give them a test. He gives each woman a present of $5,000  and watches to see what they do with the money.  The first does a total makeover. She goes to a fancy beauty salon, gets her hair done, purchases new make-up and buys several new outfits, and dresses up very nicely for the man.  She tells him that she has done this to be more attractive for him because she loves him so much. The man is impressed.  The second goes shopping to buy the man gifts. She gets him a new set  of STRONG golf clubs, some new gizmos for his computer, and some expensive clothes. As she presents these gifts, she tells him that she has spent all the money on him because she loves him so much. Again, the man is impressed. The third invests the money in the stock market. She earns several  times the $5,000. She gives him back his $5000 and reinvests the remainder in a joint account. She tells him that she wants to save for their future because she loves him so much. Obviously, the man was impressed.  The man thought for a long time about what each woman had done with the money. Then he married the one with the  largest breasts .

       Updates   There have been 2 name changes to some of the links that I have.  1) Bitchbert's Slutty Monologues is now known as  Bitchbert's Clues of the Clueless . She gave an explanation for the name change,  urlLink so read it if you really want to know.    2) Sit-Meister has done an image overhaul on her site as well. It's now PINK and PURPLE!! The new name is  Off With the Fairies   Both links can be found on my link section.    Other Updates   I am watching another play this week.  Bent  by the Toy Factory Theatre Ensemble and directed by Beatrice Chia. Another gay play for me.  A little synopsis:   Berlin 1934: Suave, debonair playboy, Max, is living the decadent and promiscuous Berlin nightclub life. Though dedicated to his lover Rudy, who performs in the cabaret, Max's one-night stand with an attractive German soldier leaves them running for their lives as Hitler's Gestapo closes in on them. Toy Factory is proud to present Martin Sherman's award-winning and groundbreaking BENT - the first play to bring Nazi persecution of homosexuals into the spotlight. R(A)18.

       The Amazing Race and other tid bits      *ahem* And the winner is..........................  REICHEN & CHIP!    The married couple clinched the first place in the least exciting last episode of TAR. David and Jeff lost out on the $1 million in the first 10 mins of the show by taking a LATER flight from Australia to Hawaii. Unlike previous seasons, the two remaining teams weren't particularly annoying (FLO!) or likeable (Rob and Brennan!), hence less drama. The producers tried to add spice up bland chemistry between the two teams by harping on Chip/Reichen's inferiority about being gays and Jon's ass-holic "anti-gay" comments.    Past Winners:    Season 1:  urlLink Rob and Brennan  Season 2:  urlLink Chris and Alex  Season 3:  urlLink Flo and Zach    Most Likeable Couples   Season 1:  urlLink Kevin and Drew  Season 2:  urlLink Oswald and Danny  Season 3:  urlLink Ken and Gerard  Season 4: None that I particularly liked but Jon and Al were ok.   Most Hated Couples   Season 1:  urlLink Bill and Joe aka The Guidos  Season 2: Tara and Wil Season 3: Flo and Zach  Season 4: urlLink  Millie and Chuck

        Schmoozin'    It seems I'm on the mailing list for  urlLink SingaporeCupid . I don't even remember signing up for it. Heh, me of all people. I have been called the  anti-relationship , and even worse, the  anti-man  girl. Once and for all, let it be known that I'm  NOT  anti anything.    urlLink   So anyway, back to the topic at hand. There will be a   urlLink French Masquerade Party   organized by SingaporeCupid.   Where?  Provignage, 30 Robertson Quay, #01-12/13  When?  30 August 2003 (Saturday)  Time?  6:30 PM - 2:00 AM  How much?  $35 if you pay online or by cheque. $40 if you pay at the door.   What's included?  Mask!     Seat capacity is only for 70. So those interested would have to RSVP (that's repondez s'il vous plait, for those who always wanted to know but never bothered finding out) to reserve your seat.   Writer's note: Ooh. I have always wanted to organise a masquerade-cum-costume party. I will eventually have one. I expect you to wear costumes if you are invited. Those interested can actually place an early reservation by  urlLink emailing  me. Don't expect me to organise it anytime soon though.

         LET'S BOOGIE    Bar top dancing is all the rage these days in Singapore. When bar top dancing and the impacts of its legalisation is a topic for Prime Time Morning TV, you know that it is the next "in" thing. Men love watching the women, women love being on the bar tops and pub owners are relishing in the "ka-ching" of the cash registers.       Unfortunately, not all bar top dancers are like the Coyotes in Coyote Ugly. Ooh mamma, those honeys are   HOT!   Some dance just by wriggling their butts from side to side, everything else remains stationary. Then there is the popular left feet-right feet shuffle, no butt wriggling involved. Have you ever seen the no butt wiggle but knees bounce up and down dance? Rather than go sideways, the dancer is actually just bouncing on the spot. Some girls are more adventurous. They wiggle their butts and torsos so vigorously that they look as though they might pull a muscle. Alot of dancing also involves audience interaction. The women would wiggle and point at various people in the crowds.  Let's not neglect the men here. Of all the bar top men I've seen, only one could dance, although I think he was more woman than man, if you get my drift. Men have their own way of dancing as well. The feet shuffle is also popular. Since men can't isolate their hips, any hip/butt movement is accompanied with a knee or upper body sway.   Whatever the dance style, it sure takes guts, alcohol induced or otherwise, to get on top a bar counter and parade yourself for the world (ok, the bar patrons) to see/admire/bitch.

       Another one leaves the nest   I spoke to Fluke today on icq for the first time in about 2 months. Heh, it was entirely my fault because I've not logged on to my icq ever since I moved back home in June. So anyway, lo and behold, what did I find out? Fluke-y is attached! Kinda, sorta. I guess it was pretty obvious based on his earlier post today. A couple tiff. How cute. Tee hee. That's really great for him. I'm really happy that he has found someone special.  Since Bitchbert is also attached, that leaves just Morgan and Sit-meister living the single life with me. Heh. Maybe we ought to have a little wager to see who's the next one to get attached. My money is on Morgan. Maybe he already is?? Ooh.. good fodder for gossip. Sit, as much as I love ya honey, I think guys would be intimidated by you, which is why I'd place my bets on Morgan. Don't bother placing bets on me, cos it ain't gonna happen honey. Of course, interested applicants can still apply for the position of becoming the  urlLink Seth  to my  urlLink Nephthys *wink*   [Send me a mail!!!]

       EXTREME MAKEOVER      Before       After      Well, Mediacorp has once again filled our tv slot with more  BAD  tv shows and adding to the ever-growing list is  Extreme Makeover . Every week, 3 "lucky" people will get to have their greatest wishes fulfilled. Tummy tucks, lasik surgery, lipo, teeth straightening, extra eyebrows, a third head, whatever you want, the "extreme team" will make it possible.   I don't even want to dignify the show with a review, which is why I'm just going to bitch about it. I hate to sound moralistic and take on a "holier-than-thou" attitude, but really, it is in my opinion that one should be thankful for what you are born with. Yes, so no one can have perfect Cup C breasts, or huge almond-shaped eyes, but at least you have two eyes and breasts right? To be fair to the participants, they do look as though they need help. But then again, it is quite sad to know that these people place such a hugh emphasis on their lack of looks such that they need to alter their appearances to make themselves feel better. But as I've said before, who am I to judge right?  If I could take part in such a show, I would shop for bigger boobs. Hee.

        We've Got the Transport Blues   So the decision to let Buangkok station remain closed and the closure of certain bus routes still stands. I mean, what do we expect? As if  urlLink SBS  will retract their decision, or that  urlLink  the Government will not stand by their side . After all, the bus operator has to remain profitable in order to provide better service right? We can't let them go in the red, or subsidise their operating costs. SBS is a listed company and is answerable to its shareholders. Public amenities be damned. Bottom-line is the company has to be profitable, so that means, increasing fares (NEL is more expensive) and decreasing costs by closing train stations due to low human traffic and re-routing certain bus routes to prevent duplication with the NEL.   Is your life made more difficult? Too darned bad for you. You should be thankful that  urlLink feeder services will be provided  to get you to the nearest MRT station. Anyway, according to the Transport Minister, taking a bus-train-bus route is more predictable than a direct bus route. In the long run, the increase in transport costs for the average commuter should be mitigated by the fact that travelling is made more predictable. The minister also warned that "if the operator keeps bus services which duplicate train routes, it'll mean higher fares for commuters." I guess he overlooked the fact that the very same bus routes duplicate the rival (SMRT) train routes. If you think that you're an important factor in any transport decision merely because you are the commuter, think again. The minister also ruled out the idea of "consulting residents before making the cuts, as bus routes cannot be tailored to individual needs but have to serve the greatest number of people."   As SBS's  urlLink profit decreased in the second quarter , we should all do our part to ensure that it remains profitable, especially if we want better service. Better service in terms of slow bus driving tactics that drivers use when they are ahead of their schedule and long waiting times during peak hours.

                                              Body Beautiful       The quest for that perfect body continues. We are obsessed with our bodies. Fat asses, big thighs and jiggly tummies are causes of concern for women striving for that perfect body. As a result, we resort to pills, diets, exercise and a multitude of "acceptable" weight-loss programs to make us feel "less fat".    Is this for health or vanity? How much of why we want to lose weight is because we are grossly unhealthy or because we just want to look good in a string bikini? When we exercise to lose weight, is maintaining a healthy lifestyle a secondary reason as opposed to the goal of achieving a toned body? Then again, does it actually matter? Sometimes, the two reasons are so intertwined that we cannot differentiate them anymore. An example: I only go swimming when it's hot and sunny. No doubt, the main reason why I swim is to exercise. But I also like the tan that I get. That's purely for my vanity. So, although I can choose to swim in the evenings, I'd rather not swim at all if I can't swim on a hot and sunny day. However, I don't like to sun-tan, because I would rather exercise and achieve the tan as an added bonus.     Health and vanity aside, who are we losing weight for? Ourselves? Family? Boyfriend? Or for the pleasure of hearing compliments about our bodies? Of course, no one is going to admit that. Ever told yourself you want to lose weight so that you can fit into that pair of hipster jeans that is so "in" right now? I have. (But gosh, hipsters don't look good on me) What about that string bikini? Ever want to lose weight to be on the receiving end of an appreciative glance or a wolf whistle? We are our harshest critic. So many of our hang ups can be derived from our perceived weight problem.    Of course, I'm not here to judge, as god knows, I've been moaning about my weight "problem" for as long as I can remember. The reasons for losing weight can be varied and frankly, it doesn't matter. Perhaps the most important reason is so that we can feel good about ourselves. If losing weight makes you feel happy, then I say go for it. However, the steps to shed those pounds should be through acceptable means. Starvation, inducing vomit and dangerous diets are harmful to the body and more importantly, it is just plain  STUPID .  So good luck for your quest. As for me, my exercise program should be sufficient enough for me to achieve my perfect body. (I hope)

         MARDI GRAS - by The Necessary Stage         A group of people come together to organise Singapores first Pride Parade  Singapores first Mardi Gras. They plan to hold the March in town, with costumes and colours; they want to shout out loud and be proud  As they plan, the tension mounts; the cracks in their relationships surface. Jokes turn to bitchiness, which turn to clawingEventually, the very event that is supposed to show their unity threatens to tear them apart.   Are they going to prove themselves to be ONE PEOPLE  of gay men, lesbians and friends; or will the rainbow represent a segregation of colours?   Is pink over?     This is a play not to be missed, starring Paerin Choa, Natalie Hennedige, Garrett Hoo, Hossan Leong, Jimmy T, Rick Tan and Corrine Adrienne and guest appearances by Kumar and Irene Ang. It was written by Haresh Sharma and directed by Alvin Tan.   Plot  Underneath the main storyline, several issues were addressed, adding depth to the potentially shallow play. Betrayals (between friends and lovers), love, friendship and kinship bound the play together. Being gay is more than just clubbing, fucking, licking, dancing and partying.    Characters  Hossan Leong as "Faith" easily had the best lines. He is one bitchy, dramatic sister, so don't go messin' with him. He stole the show, with his dialogue, his expression, his walk and even his dressing. (Gurmit Singh, eat your heart out!). Garrett Hoo plays "Ben", a 30-something straight man with a boyfriend. Being a teacher, he keeps his sexuality in the closet. He is one YUMMY dude. His body is TO DIE FOR. *swoon* Ben is best friends with Faith and Clement played by Rick Tan. He reminded me of Oswald from the Amazing Race. Like Hossan, his portrayal of the effiminate man was flawless. No stereotypical limp-wrist, but tons of "you go girl" hand gestures. Natalie plays Su, the fag hag. She was hilarious and surprisingly, her screechy voice didn't irritate me. Corinne was the token dyke, Sulin.  Straight-laced, she was quite a bore to me. Paerin Choo was Brian, Ben's straight brother. Ben's boyfriend, Alex (Jimmy T) is the other hot dude. Kumar guest-starred as Hope, Faith's partner. Sadly, his one scene was pretty flat. Irene Ang plays Glen, Sulin's boyfriend.    Comments  I enjoyed myself immensely. The dialogue was sharp and witty, with perfect comic timing and excellent one-liners. Although a good part of the play was hilarious, some parts were awfully sad. One particular scene was the breakup between Ben and Alex. That was absolutely heart-wrenching, I almost teared.   Definitely, the dialogue was the main draw, peppered with local references which made it even wittier and funnier. The characters suited their roles and although I have minor gripes about certain characters, overall, the show still won me over. It was also interesting to see gays at the theatre. I've not come across many gays in my lifetime and it's just nice to see a number of them all at one place at the same time.    Overall  Catch the play before it ends!

       Looking Back      My nickname was sharky.  I didn't pick it myself. My group of close friends then - 5 guys and 3 girls, gave it to me. Thinking about it now, I wonder why. Am I fierce? Perhaps. Do I eat people? No; maybe men a la Samantha Jones. Do I look like a shark then?!?!?  We had weird nicknames then. Lizard, Protractor, Jing Bear Bear....I squirm at each one as I type them out now. My name tends to bring to mind a whole lot of other quite pugnacious nicknames too. Ez - Ass, Esther - Esso, Esther -  Ester (chemical compound), I've given up on the explaining.  JC days were great. The first smatterings of interaction with the opposite sex. I was from the convent school for 10 years and although there was  absolutely  no way I was anything 'nun-nish' about me when I entered JC, it was still an enriching experience. It seemed to me that the people in there could be easily categorized into 3 groups: Study, Play, Find a boyfriend/girlfriend. The Study group - well, you could sight them miles away. In the library, hogging huge door-stop-like books around, always reading lecture notes before and after lectures and tutorials were always properly done and stapled. The Play group - yeah, you knew them too. Skipped lessons, always at Orchard or some bowling alley, went home late, did tutorial skimpily. As for the 3rd group - an enigma. They could also be members of group one and two, depending on their  modus operandi  to attract the other.  Crushes were as rampant as the breakups that ensue. Hearts were mended just as hearts were broken. Fantasies created as fantasies were shattered. I had more than my far share of all. I didn't have crushes on the average guys - the jocks or the dragon boat/basketball/school council guys. They couldn't make it back then; they still couldn't make it in the university. I often wonder by what curse of luck brings me to educational institutions where the guys cohort is skewed by males who simply cannot make the cut.  I don't consider myself having unattainable standards. Really.   Is asking for proper hygiene, a care of one's appearance, plans for the future, some intellectual tendencies too much???    I figure that such actions do come naturally as one begins caring for another. Won't the desire to look good and appear smart and witty be en route to impressing the potential mate?

       Blabbers   Watching High School Reunion (HSR) further emphasises that school life plays a big part in shaping a person's character. Since Singapore does not have the high school system, the closest comparison would be with the Junior Colleges (JC) or the polytechinics. My JC life was certainly a memorable experience for me and shaped some of my thinking, especially about friends.   Unlike HSR, there weren't stupid labels like "the Jock", "the Player", "the Popular Girl" and so on, at least not that I knew of. Rarely did one person stick out prominently. Groups or cliques featured heavily in school. We had the  "in"  crowd, who of course, were cool but rowdy. We also had a swimmers crowd, and they occupied a particular place in the canteen known as the "swimmers' table". Other groups included the band people, the Malay society people, rock-climbers, counsellors, exco (executive committee) members and other smaller cliques. The arts faculty students (those who studied Lit, Geog, Hist) tend to stay together because we were the minority.   A similarity might be seen in the amount of bitching that is done about people from different groups. My class particularly, wasn't known for our friendliness, and we had the awful habit of giving science students nicknames. Of course, then, the nicknames used to crack us up so much that we spent a lot of time making fun of other people. Among the nicknames created were "daddy long legs", "duck mouth" and "pornstar". Til this day, I still have no idea what their real names are, and all 3 of them studied at NTU with me. My favourite nickname has to be the one I called a girl I really didn't like, because her behaviour was annoying. I called her "Chucky". Hee, yes, in memory of the doll. Nowadays, my friends and I give nicknames to some uni mates but they are less venemous, however still retain a little humour.   Crushes, as seen from HSR and various books I've read, have a big impact on the lives of many girls. All those time spent mooning over a guy who was oblivious to the silent attention given to him by the girl. I remember my JC crush very well. I liked him for one and a half years. Never did speak to him although we had Geography classes together. I called him "His Royal Cuteness" or HRC for short.   Perhaps, the biggest part of a students' life, aside from the academic aspect of it, has got to be the friends. Somehow at that age, doing things in group were very common. Lunches were taken together, friends sat side by side in class, copied each other's homework, went out together, pee-ed together, bitched together. You get my drift? I found that to be the most exhausting part of being in a group of friends. In such cliques, there has got to be the leader, or alpha-member. As fun as such groups were, keeping up appearances and always worrying about getting on the wrong end of the alpha-members temper was time-consuming. I had to learn that the hard way and it made school life painful for a short while. However, lasting friendships can be forged in the 2 years and I've got close friends from my JC days.   Looking back, I've realised nothing much has changed. I still have crushes, my friends still form a great part of my life and I still bitch about certain so-and-sos with fellow NTU friends. However, there is a lesser need to do things in groups and I value my personal time very much. It was a nice trip down memory lane. And lucky for me, I've got tons of photos to look at, if I want to take another trip down that lane.

        High School Reunion      Oh yay. Mediacorp seems to think that Singaporeans can't get enough of Reality TV that they have to fill every available timeslot with shows from this genre. Adding to the list is the relatively new  "High School Reunion"  created by the same guy who made  "The Bachelor" . Sigh. There is bad tv and there is  bad  tv. Good trash to watch includes The Amazing Race, Survivor and American Idol. Other reality shits like "Temptation Island", "Blind Date" and "Star Search" falls under category of bad trash. Of course, this is all very biased, so don't bother saying that I'm not being objective because, DUH, I'm not. I was expecting this to be the cousin of  "Temptation Island" , or in short, just another fuck fest for horny Americans.   The show gathers 17 former classmates on an island in Hawaii for 14 days and basically, the producers must have said, "Go forth and fuck/fight/frolick" because that is what they did. No, they did not fuck/fight/frolick, but the subject of relationships  "I've had a crush on him since high school" , fueds  "He made my life miserable"  and general ramblings is brought up, and from the recaps that I've read, some amount of kiss-kiss does occur later on in the season.   The characters are as imaginative as the characters from " urlLink Sweet Valley High ". Hee, remember that series girls? Ooh, you have the jock, the player, the homecoming queen, the nerd, the misfit, the bully, the clown, the bitch, the chubby cheerleader... all chosen for maximum visual impact and conflict. Each of them want something out of this reunion, either a fuck, respect, a marriage or a good time.   It was entertaining to watch the show, in a ridiculous sort of way. Ms Tall Girl has had a huge crush on Mr Player since high school and her main purpose is to be married to him at the end of the show. I found that to be really pathetic. I wouldn't want to marry my JC crush ever. Sheesh. Especially if he is a player. So anyway, Mr Player behaves just like the player that he is. Kissed her on their first date, but at the same time saying that he wants to do that with other girls so as to explore his options. Of course he doesn't say it like that, i'm just condensing it.   I liked the nerd. But then again, I tend to favour most nerds because I sympathise with them. High school can be such a torture when you're shy and intelligent.   [Come to Singapore. The schools here wld love you]   Not only that, rumour has it that the nerd is a millionaire. Sigh. My kind of guy. Ms Popular annoys me, so does Ms Flirt and Ms Gossip. Hmm.. I think all of them annoy me except for Mr Misfit and Mr Loner and Mr Nerd.   All in all, ok to watch just for the entertainment value. Heh, if anything, I'm sure one can look forward to potential squabbles and romances.

        Sigh. I was so ready to do a review about the new tv show "  urlLink Brothers 4  " starring, Gurmit Singh [puke], Richard Ng, Tay Ping Hui and this geeky guy. The one and only reason why I wanted to do a review about that show was to bitch about Gurmit Singh.    Synopsis  A little introduction about the Brothers 4. It's Mediacorp's new dramedy about 4 brothers (hence the title. Woohoo, how innovative) with drastically different characters who try to survive each other and grapple with issues of family, love and life in Singapore (so says the official website). Mediacorp has been shamelessly plugging it's new dramedy for the past few weeks and the pilot episode was aired yesterday night after the "live" telecast of the NDP. Very strategic move, to ensure high viewership for the show.    Characters  So you have Richard Ng (he had a silent role in Tomb Raider pt 2) as the eldest brother Chung Fu. Strait-laced, stoic and self-righteous. Then you have Chung Guai played by Gurmit Singh [puke] a SNAG, and proud to be in touch with his inner (effiminate) self. Next, there is Chung Wing (Tay Ping Hui), a guy too good-looking for his own good. The baby of the family is Chung Hwa, a weirdo geek, who would probably be a child molester when he is older (in my opinion).   Gripes  Let it be known that I could not,  COULD NOT  sit through the entire episode. In fact, I turned the tv off after 15 mins (the episode was an hour long). The show was too wordy for its own good and delivery of the dialogue was flat. Despite Hong Kong bigwigs appearing in the show, like Richard Ng and Choo MiMi, there was nothing fantastic about the first 15 mins. I could not decide if the show was supposed to be a comedy or a drama. Sadly, although billed as a "dramedy", there was nothing comedic or dramatic, unless you include over-acting as dramatic, about the show.   Most of the cast suited their respective roles   EXCEPT   Gurmit. It's ironic how he said in an interview that " I dont have any problems like some actors who cant get out of their role. " because traces of Phua Chu Kang was evident. He can't decide if his character should speak in a girly way or with a Singlish accent because he uses the 2 accents/speech styles interchangeably and it is very disconcerting hearing a man sounding like a gay and then like PCK.  Not only that, in his eagerness to portray the SNAG, Gurmit also has a tendency to over-act, no surprises there. He looks ridiculous pretending to be effiminate, complete with the "limp-wrist" syndrome. Rather than becoming Chung Guai, it is also obvious that Gurmit is forcing himself to be the character and every limp-wrist movement is a conscious effort. Plus, those awful shirts do not look good on him.   He is like an ageing clown who isn't funny anymore but still keeps trying. Someone should really tell him this, rather than give him the false impression tha he is still as funny as he was in the past.

       Movie Review - Secretary     Secretary  is a bizarre love story tinged with S&M and dark humour starring Maggie Gyllenhaal as Lee and James Spader as Edward Grey. Lee is a emotionally disturbed, shy young woman in her early 20s who was recently released from an instituition because she had been mutilating herself. Upon her release, she looked for work and became the secretary for an equally troubled lawyer (Edward Grey). As the show progresses, so does the relationship between Mr Grey and Lee. One of the highlights was when Mr Grey, a stickler for spelling, spanks Lee as she reads out the letter that she typed wrongly. Rather than disgust, Lee actually enjoys it and intentionally makes typo errors in order to be spanked.   While working for Mr Grey, Lee blossoms from a shy, awkward girl to a self-confident, sexy woman. He, in turns, find a soulmate who exposes his emotional isolation and shy demeanor. The more we learn about Grey, who at first reveals nothing personal about himself, the more we oddly get to like him despite his eccentricities.   The movie juxtaposes two types of relationships: the unconventional one Lee has with her boss and the "normal" relationship that she has with her long time friend, Peter. While the normal relationship would work for most people, it clearly was not working for Lee and in the end, she rejected marriage from Peter and went with Mr Grey instead.       Opinions   I really enjoyed the show. While the relationship between Lee and Mr Grey might be unnerving to some people, there is a certain vulnerability in both Lee and Mr Grey that tugs at my heartstrings. The tension and chemistry between the two stars is palpable. Spader and Gyllenhaal are excellent, but Gyllenhaal definitely stole the show. There is very little reliance on dialogue to move this story along.   I especially liked the last 15 minutes of the movie and when Edward Grey bathed Lee. Although the movie was rated R, only towards the end do we see a nude body.    Ratings  I would definitely pay $8.50 for it. Heck, I'd watch it twice.

       Where are my bones?   Oof. I'm exhausted. Just got back from my first kickboxing class. Yes! It means that Nefi has actually paid for her AMORE fitness classes.  [Round of applause people]  I cannot imagine how such simple steps like "step kick step kick" can be so exhausting. Even jabs, hooks and uppercuts (ooh, boxing terminology) when done quickly are bloody tiring.   I am now boneless and extremely sweaty. Heh, not a turn on, unless you're one of those people who like the  au natural  scent. I'm going to take a nice long shower. Hee, if only someone can bathe me  a la  the movie " Secretary ". Gonna do a review on it later.

       Aliens from NZ...   caine n tania ar really nice ppl, n i feel kindof bad dat nobody else besides me, got e chance to meet them...  Question of e day: "hey, wats dat weird thing over there spitting water??"  n they all agreed when i said dat e esplanade looks like a pair of fly's eyes...   Things i learnt from e kiwis:   - "called" n "cold" both sound like "cold"... apparently, e kiwis dun differentiate b/w e 2 sounds n only use e vowel sound for "o" in "cold" ie in linguistic terms, e 2 sounds ar allophones of e same phoneme in kiwi-english  - "aye" can mean anything from "yes", or "uh-huh" to "huh??"  - we ar exposed to western culture cos of tv n stuff, but they noe nuts abt us since tcs drama serials arent aired in NZ  - they actually prefer our hectic lifestyle n communal unity (e grass is always greener on e other side)   Things e kiwis learnt from me:   - rojak is too spicy for them  - ppl here ar always smiling, more so than back in kiwiland (which muz be agreed tho dat there ar more sheep than ppl there, n so theres something wrong wif our sample population)  - everything is expensive in s'pore, except computers n movies  - soya bean milk is called "dou jiang" n fried doughsticks "you tiao"

"Relieved of e imminence of physical death, sure of their daily bread, people turn to e death of love n friendship and endowed them wif e weight of mortality, and equated the omens of such failures wif a portentousness which in e Sudan applied to failures of rains, crops, and e deaths of children."   kindof sad dat all e "life-changing" issues we worry or ar concerned abt, can be really trivial depending on e circumstances... which shld set us tinking abt wats really impt in life

      Thanks for the word of encouragement from various friends.   As I've said in my tagboard, there is another part to the story, which I didn't mention in the post because I was actually too tired to formulate my thoughts. I acknowledge that friends do grow up to be different, but sometimes, they retain enough common traits to continue the friendship. Yesterday's dessert thing was uncomfortable for me was not mainly due to the canoodling. Canoodling is annoying, but one gives a certain amount of leeway to couples (and their need to be touchy-feely). It was however, highly uncomfortable for me when we were walking because there were 2 couples lost in their own world in front, and me, straggling behind.  What was sad was that, my friends kept talking about things that only the 4 of them knew about (being in the same society and faculty) but I was clueless to it all. That is where the tactless behaviour comes in. It's like speaking in your native language with your friends despite knowing that one of them does not speak that language. Of course, I would not expect the conversation to revolve around me. But there wasn't any common ground among us aside from our memories of school. However, that topic alone was insufficient.   It never used to be so bad. Perhaps, it was because another friend (whom we also hung out with in school) used to come along whenever we met up, but he was unavailable last night. Funnily, my friendship with him has grown over the past few years although chances to meet have been few and far between.   There were other factors as well that screwed up the night for me. But whatever it is, the event is over. I would not rule out meeting up in future, but unlike in the past where the decision was instanteneous, I would now think twice about it.

       Has-Beens      Nephthys baby, it goes for all. The reason why we set out so eagerly on such dates is because of   memories . In our minds, we remember the good times and how it was  fun . Because our  last memory was a happy one, we set off for the  current  outing with anticipation and eagerness. Only to be disappointed. Let down. Deluded. Disillusioned.  I am learning about expectations the hard way. It's so hard not to have any. Especially those pertaining to relationships with people - friendships, new friends, potential lovers, potential confidantes. So easy to just  expect  things to come out the way we dream about or want to. But how am I learning? I'm learning it's best not to expect anything. Like just go about these meetings and dates on a clean slate. Imagine being an  innocent dummy  about it. Simple. Unsuspecting. Held enthralled in wondrous amazement. Be prepared to be surprised how things will evolve or conclude. Don't go   prepared   expecting to have a good time. Especially pertains to engagements and appointments where no external entertainment (e.g. play/movie) is involved; where the only entertainment is the  people  itself.  I realise that as we move along, with time, with our change in character, our view of life, our environment etc etc, we no longer see things the way we did before. Take for example your primary school assignments. Ever saw your handwriting and compositions back then?  Doesn't it amaze you how you   thought  then? You'd probably go "man, i   did not   write this. No way. I  actually  thought like this??? Sweet heavens" (*shoves the paper back in the cupboard and make another uncommittal promise never to re-touch the cupboard) But we  never  thought we were thinkin' wrong then, did we.  So there we have it about expectations. We change and the things we once held in truth may no longer hold the same degree of merit now. Friendships, I agree, are the especially painful ones. The type of knife that cuts deeper and leaves you bleeding internally. Because it just plain sucks that we know that once long ago, this was good, but now it's not. And being so, we are less likely to be willing to go out with the same group again.  Nephthys love, don't bother yourself about being the Fifth wheel. I see it in a different way. Because they are your friends, just be in the mood with them. Act like a prissy chaperon or something. Or else when it gets to the point where everything you see makes your skin crawl and you can feel your inner organs starting to push out your back because you are holding your scream in, then just make up a cockamie excuse and leave. They will get the idea and although it seems like a dirty low-way to do it, such things are things 'that should not be named' and voiced out. Just appear like the cool babe you always are and hope in perhaps that they will be more conscious of their 'exhibitions' in the future esp. around single friends.  Well, think of it this way, at least cheesecakes don't change so much. Haha.. c")

       Friendships   Meeting old friends is always a fun affair. You can catch up on old times, update each other about new happenings in your life and basically enjoy each others' company. The time when such reunions become awkward is when the friendship has run its course and you find that you have nothing much in common with your old friends. Sometimes, being different can strengthen a friendship, or even establish a new type of friendship. What is worst is when you realise that your friends have something in common among themselves and you are the one that has grown apart from them.   The awkwardness becomes more palpable when the friends are dating one another, effectively making you the 5th wheel. Oh, the agony of having to endure couple whispers, while you are just staring at your cheesecake, wishing the night is over. But rarely do these friends mean to be tactless. They do, however, forget that sometimes an old friend (who is also a stranger) would actually feel left out amidst all that canoodling.    It is sad when you know a friendship has run its course. It is a bittersweet feeling, remembering how it used to be and discovering what it is like now.

       Movie Review - Magdalene Sisters      Yes! finally got to catch this movie... wanted to during e film fest but it got sold out on e 2nd day of ticketing! also got my pair of complementary tix to Twilight Samurai, tho i wanted Dirty Pretty Things... but its ok, i shant complain too much since its free anyway...   Synopsis:   Its 1960s ireland, where e influence of catholicism remains strong thruout e republic... a govt-supported system is in place, which sends delinquent teenage gals to be reformed in convents... of cos, delinquency remains a relative term, which in e eyes of e irish catholic church means anything from flirtatious behaviour to looking too pretty for ur own gd... n so e brutality of e system is revealed thru e eyes of 3 gals... true stories of cos, portraying how they were deprived of all basic liberties, self-esteem, n e right to lead a life...   Compliments:   Peter Mullan weaves a depressing tale of senseless religious fervour, highlighting once more how human behaviour can at times appear so baffling n downright stupid when viewed from different perspectives... u have no choice but to sympathise wif e gals based upon their experiences alone... this is where e movie stands out, in its ability to evoke sympathy n sorrow, but is also a weakness as i shall explain later....   Gripes:   its hard to see where Mullan attempts to present a balanced viewpt of e system... all e characters appear totally evil n vindictive, especially sister bridget... cld such a person have truly existed in reality? im sure e possibility is there, but i feel dat character devt for e nuns is severely lacking, while even e motivation for their staunch religious beliefs were neither explained nor significantly portrayed (tho there was a scene in which sister bridget teared as she watched a film)...   Conclusion:   well... it is a poignant movie criticising a system dat caused suffering amongst 10000s of children... perfect for those wanting to feel better abt themselves, by seeing how much sorrier lives others have led... 8.50 shld be worth it

       BOO BOO IN THE NEWS   The Malay-language paper, Berita Harian, made a HUGE boo-boo in yesterday's edition. In one of the photographs of a local soccer team in the locker room, a shot of a player's " other " member (if you know what I mean) was captured as well. Let me explain, this player was clad only in a towel and was standing with his legs apart. Little did he realise that his penis was poking out from the towel because he was too skimpily dressed. And this peek-a-boo pose was captured in the picture that appeared in the newspaper.  Isn't it ironic how Singapore has always clamped down hard on nudity in the mass media, and unwittingly, one of the national newspapers featured a penis (at least the head of it) within its pages? Of course, it was an honest mistake, but heh, it was funny nonetheless.   Will try to scan that pic in sometime.

       CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE A WINNER!   Waking up at 7 am every morning to watch the news has its perks. Took part in a Prime Time Morning contest last week for an autographed CD by  urlLink Michael Buble . Received a letter this evening stating that I won! My prize can be collected at the Caldecott Broadcast Center within a month from the date of the letter.   On a side note, the letter was signed by Suzanne Jung and (oh-my-gawd) Timothy Go. *sigh*

       10 Things I never knew until I started working:    1) having my own office is fucking great 2) the boss' hands are  HUGE ! I reckon they can whip my head off if he were to slap me for some bizarre reason  3) work is just basically made up of itsy bitsy stuff that pile up at the end of the day 4) I would eventually have to clean the ladies toilet 5) No one else, apart from the receptionist and myself, seems to give a shit about punctuality 6) It is pretty nerve-wrecking working directly under the boss (but it's a small firm, so titles don't mean jack) 7) having my own office is fucking great! 8) The boss bites his pen, as seen from the chewed up ends 9) The boss sucks at spelling, hee, but the other one is a stickler for bad spelling 10) According to the boss, taking half off a day to settle bills at the bank is not considered a holiday, and thus, would not be taken off my annual leave.

      The time has come. I'll be starting work tomorrow and I'm nervous, which is odd because I know the people in my firm, having worked for them before for about 2 months. Horror of horrors, I actually have to use (what's left of) my accounting knowledge. Oh dear. Time to drag out those books of mine.   Fortunately or unfortunately (depending on how you want to look at it), I'll be one of only 2 ladies in the firm. Heh, yeah... imagine being surrounded by men all day. Ang moh men, because it is an expat firm. I've not met most of the people there and the only 2 men I know are the bosses. They are pretty nice and are very easy going, which is great. And they cuss alot, so heh, no need for me to curb my tongue.    Mental note to self: Don't trip and show some sign of intelligence.

       Movie Review - Camp    I expected the show to be a slick production featuring talented kids belting out songs from musicals. But I was wrong. Directed by Todd Graff in 23 days on a shoe-string budget, Camp was all about summer camp for talented teens is as campy as its name. Starring mainly unknowns, the movie had an amateurish feel to it, from the bland acting to stilted directing, but it scored very highly on talent and exuberance. With the actors belting out songs from musicals throughout the movie, one can ignore the awkward acting.    The Characters:  In the opening sequences, we are introduced to the central characters of the movie. There is Vlad played by Daniel Letterle, the only straight boy whose good looks make him the object of affection for both boys and girls at camp. Next, we have his roommate mate, Michael, a pimply, gay Latino who wore a dress to his junior prom and was beaten up by jocks. The third character is Ellen (Joanna Chilcoat), a talented but insecure teenager who paid her brother to be her date for prom. There is also the camp vamp, Jill (Alana Allen) who has her own "helper" in fellow camp mate, Fritzi (Anna Kendrick). Along the way, one will also meet Dee (Sasha Allen) who likes Michael despite his homosexuality and Jenna (Tiffany Taylor) whose jaws were wired shut by her parents in their bid to get her to lose weight.      The Plot:  Essentially, Camp was about a performance camp, called Camp Ovation, where talented teens, shunned in their normal lives for being different, had to put up a new production every 2 weeks. In between rehearsals, the teens discovered themselves and fed their passion for performing. Vlad was the central character who was the object of Ellen's, Jill's and Michael's crush. Other subplots were also woven into the movie including Fritzi's revenge on Jill, the bitter camp director and his relationships with his young charges and other smaller plots.    The comments:  The strength of the movie definitely lies in the talented cast. Their renditions of broadway hits are fantastic. Anna Kendrick was especially great in her cynical, bitter rendition of "Ladies who lunch" and Tiffany Taylor stole the show when she bellted out the finale song. The dialogue, while cliched at times, showed surprising humour. When Jill was bitching about Ellen, a fellow teen said "I think I know your sister, Cinderella". Certain scenes also drew laughter from the audience, like the feedback from black camper and his young brother, Petey, to the camp master that they could not relate to being cast as Jews for  Fiddler on the Roof . In response, the camp master cast 3 foot Petey as the dream man for the musical  Dreamgirls .   On the whole, the movie was fun and campy. It was also entertaining and the jokes were absolutely hilarious. The performances made up for the awkward acting. I would pay between $6.50 to $7.50 for it. Plus, Daniel Letterle is just CUTE!

       Movie Review - Swimming Pool      my 1st arthouse film since secretary... erm... tho secretary is debatable as being arthouse or juz plain weird... heheh...   Synopsis:   Sarah Morton is a prolific writer of detective stories (ala agatha christie)... Lacking in inspiration, she decides to have a holiday at her publisher's villa in e luberon, southern france, where she meets her publisher's nymphomanical daughter julie... 1 a typical prudish middle-aged brit wif morals as stiff as her upper lip, e other a sex-crazed youngster, a queer r/s soon develops, wif unexpected consequences....   Gripes:   hmm... e soundtrack cld have been better, tho e lack of musical accompaniments seem to be e hallmark of low-budget arthouse films (except huit femmes n amelie)... not much is shown of e supposedly brilliant luberon countryside, which makes one doubt if its really filmed there at all...   Compliments:   this is only e 2nd francois ozon film i've seen (e other was huit femmes), n i muz admit his scripts ar highly original, n being a devotee of creative storylines wif totally unexpected twists, i really enjoyed e plot... his pick of his leads ar appropriate as well... sagnier appears convincing wif her role as julie, n well, lets juz say she has a nice figure... =p rampling was persuasive too, as a strait-jacketed woman wif represssed inclinations... however, i wasnt particularly impressed by e performances, since there isnt much room for more dramatic sequences anyway.  Nevertheless, its e plot which captivates, enthralls, intrigues n finally surprises... shant tell u much more, else u wun enjoy it   All in all:   great movie to watch at 6.50, not bad if u pay 8.50, n well worth e money...

       Bennifer no more??      Is the over-played romance between Jennifer "from the block" Lopez and Ben "I can't act" Affleck really over? Are we really that lucky?  urlLink Rumours have been rife that J.Lo and Benny broke up after they cancelled their wedding .    urlLink Reports say it was due to  excessive media attention  that the wedding got called off.  Maybe Ben just couldn't handle the pressure of becoming Mr Lopez. Or maybe he is afraid that he will get blinded with all of J.Lo's bling blings. Maybe the pressure of having to make the marriage last longer than 12 months was too much for Ben to bear.    urlLink Or maybe it was due to his excessive gambling and his mother . Aww hell, who gives a hoot anyways?  I say put all of us out of our misery and either get married or break up for real. All this speculation is an unnecessary waste of space.

       A case of the over-inflated ego     urlLink What happens when one's ego becomes too big for one's voice ? Just ask Kelly Clarkson of American Idol fame. Ms Clarkson strolled into town last week to promote her  Thankful  album.   Based on the report, she was snappy and threw a minor tantrum when told that the photo shoot would take place in the hotel lobby. Reason? Because there would be  PEOPLE  in the lobby.  'It's just that I hate people looking at me while I pose,' she explains, while faking a pose and a stiff smile.   Yes, I'm sure that thousands of excited people would be dying to watch you pose. Puh-leeze, get your head out of the clouds and start living in the real world.   So much for the girl-next-door appeal that won her millions of fans.

       Updates   Time for the occasional updates about the happenings in my life because I know you care.  1) Watched 2 comedy shows.   urlLink Just for Laughs   came to town last week and I caught the show on Saturday. A night filled with 4 stand-up comedians from Ireland (Ed Byrne), Canada (Russell Peters), USA (Frank Olivier) and Australia (Carl Barron). Truth be told, the biggest draw for me was Ed Byrne. Having caught his Singapore act a few years ago, I have sorely missed his brand of humour ever since. This guy is absolutely hilarious; vulgar and rude, but funny nonetheless.   So anyway, the other comedy show I watched was by the 1nitestand Comedy Club. Australian impersonator Ben Price came to town this week and through him, a whole host of celebrities visited Singapore as well, from Bush to Bill to Arnie to Homer to Steve Irwin.   2) I will be starting work next week! Of course, travelling plans that I've made for the of the year will now be pushed to unspecified time and date. I'm quite excited to begin working (I am aware that I will most definitely complain about work soon) even though I've not been actively looking for a job. It has been fantastic bumming around for the past 4 months or so.   3) I am now a new member of  urlLink California Fitness Center ! Amore fitness was a little boring after a while because I could not use the gym nor try any of the yoga classes. So, only time will tell if I do shed those pounds by the end of the year.

       THE BACHELOR VS SURVIVOR: PEARL ISLANDS       This week marks the beginning of two new seasons of The Bachelor and Survivor (the mother of ALL reality tv shows). It is funny how great reality tv thrives on conflicts between the participants. Frankly, it makes the show more interesting. Who wants to watch 4 people getting along very well when one can watch 4 different people bitching about one another?  If one had to pick a favourite reality tv show from either The Bachelor or Survivor, death is not an option here people, which one would it be? To watch 25 women fight over some guy or 16 castaways plotting their teammates death?   This latest instalment of The Bachelor would probably be even more vicious because the bachelor, a certain Mr Andrew Firestone is actually a MILLIONNAIRE. Yes, unlike, Evan "the beast" Mariott from Joe Millionnaire. From the trailers that Mediacorp has been shoving down our throats lately, the women are no doubt beautiful, because anyone who spends at least 1 hour putting on her makeup will definitely look beautiful, and very, very catty. Of course, Andrew Firestone would be lapping it all up as it is a TREMENDOUS boost to his ego to know that 25 women are fighting over him. Ooh, so who will he choose? Let me end your misery by saying that he will choose Jen (the benefits of being about 1 season behind the US is that one can read about the show if one wishes to). Andrew Firestone is the prize for the winner.  On the contrary, Survivor is as dirty as the Bachelor is glamourous. While the Bachelor is out to fulfill the women's fantasies, Survivor will bring hell to those who can't, well, survive. In Pearl Islands, our castaways will be marooned in Panama. Get ready for more back-stabbing as all 16 castaways will be fighting for the $1 million.   So back to the question at hand, of the two, which one would be a favourite? I would pick Survivor. First, I never liked watching 25 women living in a house together. That is definitely a recipe for disaster. As unfeminist as this sounds, women should not live together because they would bitch and bitch and bitch. Secondly, bah, who wants to watch said women living out their fantasies? Thirdly, who wants to watch one man sucking face with said women? Fourthly, winning $1 million is way cooler than getting picked to be Mrs Firestone (yes, I'm fully aware that Andrew Firestone would be worth more than $1 million). Lastly, at least Survivor has games. In The Bachelor, the only games they would be playing would probably involve a naked woman and naked man, both of which I wouldn't want to see.

       Philosophers n linguists shld learn how to write in simple english!!!   okie... im sick of those protracted, verbose, bombastic diatribes, filled wif convoluted sentences e length of entire paragraphs, and written in e name of erudition n academia... one doesnt pay to be a student n have to read crap from ppl who cant string decent arguments together for nuts, n yet claim to be founding fathers of e epistemological world...  erm... in other words, e convention of academic writing appears to be sophistication, and it doesnt matter wat u write, so long as u sound chim... which shldnt be e case at all, since e whole pt abt writing expository essays, is to communicate ur ideas as efficiently and clearly as possible.  let me show u some typical sentences i have to read, wk in wk out...  Foucalt (king of pretty phrases dat dun make sense): " That should not, i believe, be taken to mean that its qualities are those of an obtuse, naive or primitive empiricism; nor is it a soggy eclecticism, an opportunistim that laps up any and every kind of theoretical approach; nor does it mean a self-imposed ascetism which taken by itself would reduce to the worst kind of theoretical impoverishment ."  - wat on earth is soggy eclecticism or primitive empiricism???  Bordieu (another frenchie who luvs loooong sentences): " On the one hand, there are the socially constructed dispositions of the linguistic habitus, which imply a certain propensity to speak and to say determinate things (the expressive interest) and a certain capacity to speak, which involves both the linguistic capacity to generate an infinite number of grammatically correct discourses, and the social capacity to use this competence adequately in a determinate situation ."  - by e time i get thru e last part of it, i forgot wat e 1st part is abt...  Chomsky (master of e circular argument): " A code is not a set of representations but rather a specific system of rules that assigns coded representations to message-representations ."  - x = y therefore y = x... wat stoopid formula is this??

       Convocation   Now that I am more lucid, it will be easier for me to describe my convocation in greater detail rather than yesterday's brief post.   Woke up with a start because had a dream about waking up late and having to dress in school. Thankfully, it was a rainy day so our make up did not melt as much or as fast as usual. Even so, wearing that many layers of clothes in this humid climate was godawful! Toes felt squashed and they became numb eventually. The atmosphere was mildly chaotic and it was difficult locating familiar faces.   The ceremony started at 3. By this time, guests and graduates were already seated, enjoying the comforts of the plush chair and the air-conditioning. I was falling asleep in my seat. The ceremony was anti-climatic. We had already received our transcripts on the day we collected our gowns and there were no performances. The only music played was for the professors who strolled in. Actually, with all the professors dressed in their robes, the auditorium looked like a scene from Harry Potter. Hee, that was funny.   Having a name starting with the letter A has its perks. I was the 5th one in my group to go on stage. My friend and I were surprisingly nervous. Thankfully, we just had to walk on stage, shake the guy's hands, receive an empty folder and walk down. As I waited for my turn, I wondered what it would be like to be naked under the gown and flash the man as I received my folder. Hmm.. Bad idea. I doubt he would appreciate it. Furthermore, being arrested on my convocation day is so not cool. It would have been fun if everyone wasn't so serious about it. The last girl had the loudest cheers. Hee.   Refreshments were provided. Finger foods abound for hungry graduates and their families. We stuffed our faces with dim sum, an assortment of cakes/kuih, and noodles.   My friends and I split up and I took pictures with my parents around school, especially at the Yunnan Garden. That was fun. Another round of photo taking will take place next week. This time, the venue will at the Esplanade and Boat Quay. Watch out for more pics.

       Orlando Bloom - Elf or pirate?   Which one do you prefer? I would take him any way I can. Blond hair with elven ears or brown hair with scraggly beard. He is yummy in all the roles that I've seen him in. Hee, which is only 2. I paid $3 to buy this teen magazine just so I can lay my hands on his poster. I can be called many things, but gay is  DEFINITELY  not one of them. I love my men too much. Haha, they aren't mine, but well, a girl can hope.

       Moview Review - Pirates of the Caribbean  (2nd opinion)     " Welcome to the Caribbean " And a lovely place it is. A lovely backdrop for a great movie as well.    The plot : You want a detailed plot review? Well,  I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request . The plot borders on being convoluted when being retold but surprisingly it makes perfect sense when one watches the movie. In short, Captain Barbossa ( urlLink Geoffrey Rush ) of the Black Pearl has been searching for the last gold doubloon so that he can end his curse. He and his mateys have been cursed to straddle two worlds; that of the living and the dead for stealing Aztec gold. They can't die but neither can they experience simple things like the taste of an apple. The gold lands in the hands of Elizabeth Swann ( urlLink Keira Knightley ) and she gets captured by Captain Barbossa. In comes Will Turner ( urlLink Orlando Bloom ), a humble blacksmith and Jake Sparrow ( urlLink Johnny Depp ), the worst pirate that ever came to Port Royale, to rescue the fair maiden. Some heavy duty canon action and sword fights plus ILM-generated effects complete the picture. Directed by Gore Verbinsky (The Ring, The Mexican) and produced by the American John Woo, Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Bad Boys, Pearl Harbour).    The Characters :  Without a doubt, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow stole the show. He single-handedly carried the movie with his portrayal of the mildly insane pirate with heavily lined eyes and braided hair. Jack Sparrow is a rogue through and through, but is definitely likeable. His morals are a little ambiguous but his love for the Black Pearl can't be questioned. Johnny Depp also got the best lines of the movie. Orlando Bloom shows us that he is as adept with swords as he is with a bow and arrow. As the straitlaced Will Turner, he is the 18th or 17th (I'm not sure which century is the movie set in) century version of a dork/nerd, which is very unlike the ultra-cool Legolas from the  Lord of the Rings . Because Johnny Depp was so brilliant in the movie, he completely eclipsed his co-stars. Orlando's character seemed a little bland in comparison. But objectively speaking, he didn't do too badly. One can see his growth as the movie progresses, from a pirate-hater to a pirate-abetter as he accepted his past. Keira Knightley, made famous in  Bend It Like Beckham , is absolutely gorgeous! Those breasts were partly enhanced by silicon bits, by the way. She pulled her role off well, and was not an irritating helpless maiden. On the contrary, she showed more spunk and girl power than  Charlie's Angels . Fashion is of no use when one can't breathe in one's clothes right? Geoffrey Rush as the backstabbing first mate Barbossa was a delight to watch. He was villainous and mighty scary at times. That gravelly voice with the pirate accent can shiver  my  timbers. Other cast members like Captain Norrington ( urlLink Jack Davenport ) and Governor Swann ( urlLink Johnathan Pryce ) were competent in their roles. They didn't shake my boots because firstly, I wasn't wearing boots when I watched the show and secondly, watching Johnny Depp and drooling over Orlando Bloom took up all my attention. I loved the ship mates as well, the skeleton crew and the motley crew that Sparrow assembled.    The Comments/Gripes : The movie was so enjoyable not only because of the strong cast, but because of other factors, namely dialogue, sets (props & costumes), musical score and special effects. How can a script penned by the very same guys who wrote  Shrek  fail? One can almost do a literature essay based on the dialogue which is filled with irony, puns, and a play with words. Credit must go to the cast who delivered their lines superbly. I loved the costumes, from Elizabeth's tight gowns to Commodore's stuffy military garb (or as Jack Davenport says "ice-cream costume") to Sparrow's unkempt outfit. The only thing I hated was that awful feather hat Turner used at the very end. Comic relief came in the form of 2 pirates, Pintel and Ragetti, a short balding pirate with his one-eyed lanky mate, the Laurel and Hardy of the movie. ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) helmed the special effects team. Creating the undead seems to be their speciality since they were behind the effects for " The Mummy ". The pirates' transition between human to rotting skeletons was seamless and the fighting scenes were captivating as they weaved in and out of the moonlight. In their true skeletal form, they were quite terrifying.  Unfortunately, there were flaws in the movie. I felt that the chemistry between Keira and Orlando fizzled more than sizzled. Thank goodness the romance bit was played down and not that essential to the movie. The movie was also a tad too long. I know that it was essential to lay the plot out in detail, but when one is having gastric pains, sitting in a movie that is over 2 hours long isn't very pleasant.    The verdict : I watched it twice and paid a grand total of $14. So, I'm sure that $8.50 shouldn't be a problem at all.    "Yes, she's safe as I promised, she's going to marry the Commadore as she promised, and you're going to die for her as you promised. You see we're all men of honor, except Elizabeth, who is, in fact, a woman."  - Jack Sparrow to Will Turner.   Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirate's Life for Me We pillage and plunder, we rifle and loot, drink up me hearties, Yo Ho. We kidnap and ravish and don't give a hoot, drink up me hearties, Yo Ho. We extort and pilfer, we filch and sack, drink up me hearties, Yo Ho. Maraud and embezzle and even highjack drink up me hearties, Yo Ho. Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirate's Life for Me

       Movie Review - Savvy?      Went to catch this highly-proclaimed-busted-over-$300-million-movie-at-the-US-box-office-over-the-weekend movie on Friday. I must say, that if I wasn't  threatened and coerced  into watching this, I would never have gone to watch it, for the following reasons:  1)  I think Orlando Bloom looks 'hello' lots better as a blonde with long hair and pointy ears and with archery skills better than robin hood any knighty ol' day;  2)  The whole show's trailer just reeked like a rip-off of Lord of the Rings, for the mere fact of a key character and the plot which involved war with the undead; and  3)  There didn't seem like a great pulling reason to  just  watch it - sure, the plot is the kind of adventure I like, but there's always kazaa....   Anyway,   despite all misgivings  , I watched the show.  And didn't regret it one bit. Why....  1)  Johnny Depp - from Edward Scissorhands to Donny Brasco to Don Juan Demarco to Chocolat, this actor has never dominated the entertainment news for any bad-boy actions or ego attitude. In fact, the roles he chooses to undertake are few and far between, and are often roles that emphasize on deep character-building. This boy is a serious actor, I tell you. No typical type-casting on him - he can do romance to mafia to poor-boy and comedy. As Captain Jack Sparrow of the Black Pearl, his role is mainly comical and yet remains crucial to the whole plot. With eyes kohl-lined more heavily than golden retrievers, a beheft appearance that onscreen looks as if he really smells and looks as disgusting as he does and walking and talking with the swagger and drawl, he's just my kind of pirate and gypsy. Bloke has an upcoming role in Desperado  II - Once upon a Time in Mexico, which reunites Antonio Banderas and Salma 'hot' Hayek. Am lookin' so forward to that one.  2)  Great swordfighting and swashbuckling actions. As far as pirates and buckaneers go, this show packs great swordfights and bucaneering canon action worth the price of admission alone.  3)  Amazing CGI effects. Especially proven in the showdown scene where the cursed pirates and the good guys are fighting in a cave with a roof that streams the moonlight in. Watch out for how the figures change into skeletons and humans as they weave in and out of the moonlight.  4)  Jack Davenport, Keira Knightley and Jonathan Pryce. It didn't click to me that Jack Davenport was the guy I  massively  had a crush on after watching The Talented Mr. Ripley. (i watched the show twice coz of that) And, to say most unabashingly, I like the guy all over again. It must be his  kind, gentle, softspoken  characters. Keira is only 18 and looks hell great, and I'm almost envious of that. But she did not to bad in the show and it's a mighty lot different from her stint in Bend It Like Beckham.

       Stripped      Do you know who you really are?   When you look into the mirror, do you actually see your true self? I'm not talking about physical appearances. Look beyond that. Can you find your very being or have you been hiding behind so many facades that you can't recognise yourself anymore?  Look at yourself. What do you see? The clown? The queen? The idealist? The romantic? The loner? The intellect? So many pigeon-holes, but do you actually belong there? You have been described in so many ways by so many people claiming to know you. But how much of it is actually you and how much is what you portray yourself to be?  Are you really sociable because you enjoy the interaction with other people or because you like the attention focused on you? Are you are funny not because you like to make people laugh but because you would rather have people laughing at your jokes than at you? Have you inadvertently created so many smoke screens that you forget who you are?  More importantly, when you do see yourself, do you like what you see? Strip away the facades and leave ego and pride hanging at the door. Can you stand to look at yourself or would you rather hide behind the many faces of you so you don't have to see yourself stripped to the core again?

       MILESTONE    This blog is 3 days shy of its first birthday. A whole year has passed and a whole lot of stuff have been written on this blog fairly regularly, save for that December where all of us dropped out of the blogging scene (hee, myself included).    The beginnings:  The blog started without a purpose whatsoever. Thanks to Morgan who himself had just started  Hysterical and Useless . The name "Tales of the Mundane" captured in a nutshell what the blog was about: Mundane stuff which came to be not-so-mundane after a while. In  urlLink April  amid not so much fanfare, the blog had a major revamp and the name was changed to its current one (again all thanks to Morgan). This blog has undergone numerous design changes from a blue square-ish one ending with this blue kinda square-ish one as well. Rest assured revamps will occur on a regular basis as I am a fickle-minded person. As if you didn't already know.    The contributors:  Many thanks again to  urlLink Morgan  ,  urlLink Fluke   and  urlLink Bitchbert  who have been with the site for about as long as the site has been in effect. urlLink  Sit-Meister , you know you have always provided great material for reading. Hee...    Remember the posts:    urlLink Mr Black Underwear     urlLink Hall wildlife     urlLink Nonsensical personality tests  and  urlLink dysfunctional games    Reviews -  urlLink movies ,  urlLink comedies ,  urlLink plays ,  urlLink songs , urlLink  tv shows ,  urlLink books    Never-ending bitching about  urlLink couples     urlLink Exam gripes     urlLink Clubbing  posts   Numerous guest posts by various contributors about a myriad of  urlLink things     urlLink no-punctuation-man

       Midweek News   It's a WEDNESDAY! Since I've pushed my tuition to Sat, I have decided to blog today. I've got a couple of reviews due and I'll just tackle the short ones today.  1)  urlLink IGOR'S  - One of the few (or is it the only one?) themed restaurants in Singapore. As you eat, you will be entertained by the musical performance on stage. I must say, I definitely enjoyed myself that night. Guests are required to take a walk through the haunted castle before entering the dining hall. Along the way, ghouls, vampires, little devils and Frankenstein will greet you.  First, I was very impressed with the crew. They wear many different hats (metaphorically speaking of course) during the course of the show-cum-meal. They take your attendance, lead you through the castle and also serve you.

        urlLink Are you hot?    Ahh.. more trash to pollute our minds with. Thanks to  urlLink ABC  for producing this show and many thanks to Mediacorp for importing it to Singapore.   The search is on for America's sexiest people. In the vein of American Idol, thousands of people gathered at various points in the USofA to participate in this new reality tv shwo. Talent, personality and intelligence are not needed, only a hot body and a reasonably good looking face. Similar to Amercain Idol, 3 judges will determine if you're hot or not.       You have Lorenzo Lamas (yes, he is still alive), he who acted in old tv shows like Renegade and Falcon Crest. Then you have Rachel Hunter, she who used to be married to Rod Stewart and also the token Brit (a la Cowell) in the show. Lastly,  meet Randolph Duke, designer to the stars.   And, just like American Idol, you have the gorgeous and the down-right hideous taking part . No surprises there - breasts, butts and biceps the size of melons galore. Unfortunately, most of the time, intelligence and personality were inversely proportional to the physical attributes.   The gem of the show, SURPRISINGLY, was the judges. All three of them had a clear idea of what was hot and the put-downs that contestants received were priceless. Comments on breast size, buts, clothes and facial features were hilarious. All three judges showed some semblence of wit, unlike Paula "Wash-out" Abdul.       "Don't distract me with your stupidity. Just shut up and let me look at you."   To a lady with breasts as big as her butt: "Did you get implants to balance out your ass?"   Lady:  Yes   Judge:  Well, I would have gone the other way. I would have gotten some reduction work instead.    Arrogance was a big turn off for the judges. Apparently, the judges weren't impressed by skankily dressed females either.    "When I look at you, two words come to my mind. How much."   Hee... such frank comments. I definitely enjoyed myself, largely due to the judges and not the body.

       More Mindless Babbles   The end of the year is approaching and I doubt I am going to win my bet anytime before 31 Dec 2003. But fortunately for me, I don't think I'm going to have to pay anything as well. You see, my friend and I made bets that one of us would get attached by the year's end before the other. Meaning, I bet that she would get attached first and vice versa. If I won it, she would give me a treat and vice versa as well. Heh, we aren't any closer to winning our bets.

       Mindless Babbles   Long weekends are absolutely  faantastic . An extra day for simply not doing anything at all. Gosh. I love it. So what did I do these past few days? Friday was fucked up. Had the most awful cramps, backache and headache ever. The curse of being a female. Ugh. Saturday was truly a " tai tai " (how does one say that in English?) day. I had my hair done! I cut and coloured it. However, neither the haircut nor the colour was shocking enough. So, now my hair is short and dyed a deep copper red. I would probably streak it soon. After my looooong hair appointment, which cost me a lot of money, I wasted more money by paying $8.50 to watch the movie, " Identity ". A review will be done when I'm in the mood. So don't hold your breath for it yet. And today, this glorious Sunday, I was supposed to meet friends for lunch. But, one had to cancel, and Daniel "I sat on a turret" Tham and I decided to just cancel the entire lunch thing. I have done absolutely nothing ever since I woke. Heck, I'm still in my PJs even as I'm writing this blog. My mom is in despair that her only daughter behaves like a pig. She keeps saying that no man wants a stinky, bad-table manners (hee, cos I accidentally burped really loudly at the dinner table) and lazy girl. To which I replied, if he can't take stinky ol me, then I probably wouldn't want him anyway.   Well, tomorrow is the official start date for the fasting month. Yes.. it begins again. A whole month of fasting, after which, I can pig out on delicious food and cakes. I'm looking forward to it actually.  It  being the fasting and not the feasting. Well, feasting is great, but think of the calories! Time to get used to waking up at ungodly hours in the mornings to eat. My mom is insisting that I eat half-boiled eggs (YUCK!) every morning. I hope she isn't going to boil any for me. Half boiled eggs are the grossest things on earth. Neither raw nor cooked, they're just so gooey and slimy and they taste horrible.   Sigh. I didn't get to watch  Kill Bill  after all. Neither did I get to watch the  Italian Job . I'll just go rent the VCD or something. I'm going to miss   urlLink Havana Night  , which is such a bummer cos I already missed   urlLink Lady Salsa  . I'm going to miss the entire  FRENCH FILM FESTIVAL . Sob.

       Movie Review - American Pie: The Wedding      After a two-year hiatus, we get to meet our horny teens (now adults) again. We have seen them through prom, then college and now, they are about to join the working world after graduating from college.    Plot   Jim (Jason Biggs), the self-confessed perv, is about to propose to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), his self-confessed nympho girlfriend, at a restaurant one night. But somehow, Michelle assumes that he wants to do something kinky and procedes to give him a blow job from under the table. Things go down-hill when Jim's dad, brilliantly played by Eugene Levy, drives over informing him that he forgot to bring the ring. What follows is one of the funniest and double entendre-filled lines from the movie.   Wedding preparations begin. We get to meet Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott). New additions to the cast came in the form of Cadence (January Jones), Michelle's virginal sister, Michelle's parents and a big gay man called "Bear". The wedding preparation is a thinly-disguised attempt to string the various gags together. Jim, in hopes of impressing his fiancee, drives all the way to Chicago with his friends to get her the perfect dress. Told that the dressmaker is in one of the bars, they split up looking for a certain Leslie something-or-other. Stifler ended up in a gay bar, and had a dance showdown with Bear, which was absolutely hilarious. Other subplots include, Finch and Stifler "swapping" personalities in order to attract Cadence.    Characters:   The cast has definitely aged a little more since the last time we saw them. Finch, while still intellectually cool, has become chubbier. Kevin is barely noticeable, especially with his lack of dialogue. But then again, he is one of the more boring characters in the trilogy. Stifler is still as rude and loud-mouthed as ever. Missing from the cast is Oz (Chris Klein), his girlfriend, Heather (Mena Suvari), Jessica (Natasha Lyonne), Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) and Vicky (Tara Reid). No mention was given as to why they couldn't attend the wedding. Jim and girl are still the same.  Eugene Levy as the father definitely stole every scene that he was in and he was still dispensing unwanted advice.  "Your mother, bless her, can still make me squeal like a pig." Hee.    Opinions and gripes:   This third instalment brings back the memories of the first American Pie, gross humour but with heart. While there is no semblance of the plot, some scenes are just achingly funny and when one laughs, one really laughs. In between the funny scenes, unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not quite live up to the expectations (if one has any) of the first American Pie. Stifler, that dickhead, is definitely the highlight of the show. Doggy doo, dog molestation and grandmother fucking are just some of the situations that he gets himself into in the course of the 90 mins show. It is obvious that the funny/gross scenes are only added to generate laughter and have no impact on the entire movie whatsoever. One example: Jim shaves his balls and procedes to throw the hair outside the window (what the fuck?). The hair then gets sucked into the ventilator and enters the kitchen of the hotel, thus rendering his wedding cake useless. No point at all, but it was certainly grossly funny.  The cast, by now, are very familiar with their roles and they carry it off well. While some characters, namely Kevin, had no development at all, others, like Stifler, were given the chance to strut their stuff. And strut they did. In the case of Stifler, he danced, fucked and ate shit all in one show.   The movie does get tiresome at times. Too much of Stifler is NOT a good thing. But the funny scenes are enough to sustain the audience throughout the duration of the movie. The best line of the show has got to be from Stifler. When told that he just fucked a grandmother (go watch to find out why), he said,   "Pussy is pussy."      Overall:   I would pay $6.50 to watch.

       Wedding of the year?     Well, look who got married during the weekend? The over-exposed couple, Pierre Png and his liver-less (well, the liver isn't hers) fiancee (now wife), Andrea De Cruz. Or they could also be known as the local "Bennifer". He can't act (just like Ben Affleck) and she is just annoying (like J.Lo). For "B-grade" actors (hee, I got this from Sunday's NewPaper), they have certainly received more than their fair share of column space and tv air time.   For small time actors, their wedding certainly rivaled that of Hollywood weddings. A grand total of $644,000 was spent, although to be fair to them, about half came in the form of sponsorships. Bridesmaids' gowns, grooms' suits and flower decorations were among the many items that were sponsored. For "private people", they sure as hell knew alot of people to invite to their wedding dinner, 650 guests to be exact. In true Hollywood style, the press was barred from the ballroom because they wished to keep their wedding "private". Everybody join me in saying, "Yeah. Right."  The only thing that was missing from the wedding was the press helicopters circling the church and hotel, trying to get the "Exclusive" on their wedding. In all honesty, this whole shindig isn't even necessary. No one outside our tiny island would give a fuck about Pierre and Andrea. But everybody seems to love them especially after the whole fiasco about her poisoned liver and the great, romantic rescue by Pierre, in the form of his liver. However, the reason why she ended up with a poisoned liver was because she wanted to lose weight and bought slimming pills which turned out to be toxic.   Yeah.. Yeah, I'm just bitchin.

       Monday musings..   bleah.. in the midst of the most boring Access course now. Brings me back to the good ol' days of school. Heh.. lab lessons were,more often than not, used for checking mails, msn-ing, checking more mails and catching up on lost surfing time. But of course, due to all those surfing, I have completely forgotten how to use Microsoft Access and now I have to attend a course on in. And so, the cycle repeats itself.   In other news, I am dying to watch at least 4 movies, all of which must be done by this week. AMbitious? I think so. I doubt I can do a movie marathon anytime soon in addition to work and giving tuition to horrid little freaks, oh and not forgetting gym as well. So many things to do, so little time. The bane of my life.... sigh  In other other news.. I've got the most AWFUL song stuck in my head... That icky, sappy one by Daniel Bedingfield,   "If you're not the one"  . In my defense, I heard that song performed by some guy at Igor's (ooh.. review will be done soon) and his voice was just fantastic! I had CLay AIken stuck in my head sometime last week. Heh.. oh my gawd.... I'm like a closet clay aiken fan.. Haven't stooped so low as to buy his CD.   Hmm.. let's see... I've got 10 mins to write my little rubbish before class resumes. Bah. I can't think of any right now. But do watch out for my review of Igor's. Fantastic place for $52 (if you're an UOB member) or $62 (normal price). Although cost of a soda was priced at $7.50.. What the fuck. FOr that amount, there should be some nudity. But i'm not so lucky....

       Movie Review - A Time For Dancing      Ugh. Crappy movie alert.  The ad in the papers advertised the movie as being similar to "Flashdance" and "Dirty Dancing". Starring Shiri Appleby (Roswell), Larisa Oleynik (10 Things I Hate About You) and Shane West (LXG), this movie centers primarily around 2 best friends, Jules (Larisa) and Sam (Shiri) who are also dancers. Jules is the perfect prima ballerina and she aspires to get into Julliard (like all dance movies, every teen wants to get into Julliard) while Sam is just mucking around. Blah blah blah, Jules gets diagnosed with cancer during one of her routine medical check ups. In time, she has to stop dancing and go for intensive chemotherapy. Sam meets cute dude, Paul played by Shane West in one of his run-of-the-mill teeny roles again. Paul barely has enough screen time to merit a character analysis.    Characters:  Larisa Oleynik looks wholesome and she can actually dance, as seen from the uncut footage that featured her dancing. I daresay, she dances better than Julia Stiles in Save the Last Dance. Trivia: Both actresses appeared in 10 Things I Hate About You.  Shiri Appleby is just meh. Well, both of them are just meh. But Shiri is more bleah. She's pretty though but she can't dance and has a dance double.    Overall:  Meh. And too sappy for my liking. In case you wanted to know, Jules died in the end.    Rating:  Pay for me and I'll watch. Unfortunately, I paid $8.50 for it. Sigh.

        urlLink Friendster    Aside from the popular ICQ or MSN Messenger, Friendster is another new way to keep in touch with friends. The beauty about this little device is that one ends up "meeting" long lost friends who are friends of friends.   Good thing? or Bad thing? I guess if it's a bad thing, one shouldn't sign up as a member, right?

       When being 7 is no longer cute....     Hurrah! I'm back! [all hail the great nephthys] Now, back to my topic:   Kids. Currently the bane of my life, having gotten stuck with 8 kids 5 of which/ whom (?) are under 8 years old. As young as they may look, they possess very adult-like behaviour and personality, namely bitchiness. It is awfully disconcerting listening to a young girl blowing her own trumpet and dissing other people.   Example:  Girl: I got 95 for Maths. My sister is very bad at Maths. She always fail her tests. She is slow and lazy.  Girl: My father is a lazy pig.  Girl: Look at my handwriting. My friend's handwriting is very small. She always get scolded by the teacher. But I have never been scolded before.  Even worse, a 7 year old girl who has a HUGE ego and refuses to do any corrections because she prefers to erase her wrong answers to make them right so that there aren't any crosses in her book. (Of course, this ridiculous request was not granted by me.) The final straw came about when said girl forced tears to roll down her cheeks because I pointed out that one of her answers was wrong. For the next 20 minutes or so, she was silently crying while her mother alternated between asking her what's wrong and getting her to do her work. She did neither. While I watched and counted the mintues till I got home. Heartless as this may sound, but I believe the girl was just trying to attract attention.   It is such a pain working with kids.

I am tired of baking cookies, peeling onions and cutting dried chillies. Hee, nonetheless, the end result is a sumptious meal which my mom says I have to learn how to cook soon. (Part of her plans to make me more marriagable.) I will wear my bright,  PINK   baju kurung today. Of course, photos will be taken at any opportunity. I also have to start giving money to little cousins and my elderly relatives.

       Updates  -  As always, this is for those who care about Nephthys.    Woah, Fluke has done a lot of movie watching lately. Exams fluke, exams!!!   Despite Fluke's review of the Matrix, I do want to watch it. I HATED the second movie but watching the third one will bring some form of closure (I hope). In any case, bad movie choices are right my alley (hee.. this is for daniel).   I'll be baking cookies from next week onwards! Whoopee. For those who want to sample a taste of my cookies, you're invited to come over for Hari Raya (otherwise known as Eid). Fasting has been uneventful. No fainting spells. In any case, there is no use fainting at work, as there isn't anyone eligible to catch me. Heh.   Speaking of eligible, I have a crush. I shall not jinx it by revealing who my crush is. Knowing me, it is probably all one-sided. But then, I'm free enough to see where this will go. Heh.

       Movie Review - Matrix Revolutions      hmm... my 1st date wif my crush, so i was understandably a little distracted.... ;ppp in any case, i was irritated by e kids who filled e theatre cos they kept gasping n moaning at exciting or gross scenes... they even applauded in e end.. sheesh...   Synopsis:   erm... a continuation of Matrix Reloaded... so if u remember, Neo went into a coma n turns out dat hes stuck in a train station (a place b/w e real world n e matrix)... kindof like purgatory for e catholics... trinity n morpheus saves him n brings him back to e real world, Neo gets out of his coma n travels to machine city (aka e source).. while zion attempts to defend against an invasion... Neo, of cos, saves e day by negotiating peace wif e machines... n e war is over... for now...   Gripes:   well... if u tot matrix reloaded made no sense... this instalment is much much worse... any attempt to rationalise e plot leaves u wif a headache n more HUH??!s then u'll ever get by watching any other movie... e worst part was when they tried to explain y e Oracle doesnt look e same anymore (e real actress died during filming, so they had to get a replacement)... there ar so many illogical bits, dat 1 wunders if e wachowski bros were intentionally trying to make e audience go HUH, or simply trying too hard to look like geniuses by bringing up e age-old philosophies of life's purpose n direction...   Compliments:   e action sequences n visual effects were cool to say e least... not e do-or-die battle b/w agent smith n neo, but e battle scene in zion itself... ironic dat humans still had to rely on machines (resembling those from gundam) to fight machines tho... i'd also like to give agent smith a pat on e back for being utterly convincing in his evil laughter... erm.. u'll understand once u watch it =p   All in all:   juz enjoy e action n cool scenes wifout bothering abt e logic, n erm... enjoy e company of e person u ar watching wif... err... ahem... yah... dats abt all u can get to like abt e film... 8.50 wld be juz abt alrite...

       Movie Review - Kill Bill Vol. 1      well... its been some time since my last review n erm... stop pressuring me! im aredi writing one now, aint i?!?!  anyway, was really a weird day at lido... saw wong lilin n allan wu, some smalltime channel 8 actor wif his gf, my fren's fren, n my fren... e theatre sure was crowded wif familiar ppl on a thurs afternoon....   Synopsis:   erm... a simple plot runs thruout e film ie kill bill... im sure u muz have read in e papers (u cant miss those posters of her wif a samurai sword) abt uma thurman (aka black mamba aka *beep*) being "killed" by her fellow assasins (e deadly vipers assasination squad), except she din really die n after coming out of a coma 4 yrs later, goes on a rampage to exact revenge... in this 1st vol, she kills lucy liu (aka cotton mouth aka O'Ren Ishiii) n vivica fox (aka Copperhead aka vernita green).  n errr.. yah, dats all there is to e story   Gripes:   ok, i noe e critics went gaga over e movie n lotsof ppl have said they liked it (most of them gals), but i gotta say a movie richly laced wif pulp culture but supported by a thin (dats really an understatement... im tinking more of zero) plot development doesnt go down well for me...  there wasnt much space for e cast to perform anyway, since its mainly an action movie, so i cant comment on any convincing or moving portrayals... fight scenes got boring after awhile cos of repetitive n overuse of e same methods of decapitation, mutilation n showerhead bloodspurts (yes, i really do mean showerhead)... e gore n violence promised by reviews neva materialised since it was more comical n funny than visually shocking (in part due to tarantino's obsession wif pulp culture in e film)... if this movie is gory, then saving private ryan muz have been totally gut-wrenching... n thanx to e non-existent plot, everything was totally predictable ie uma thurman won every fight, lost e least blood n killed hundreds of henchmen, juz like ur typical comic bk superhero (another influence of pulp culture)... how many times have i mentioned e P n C words aredi??? e movie also sorely lacked originality, since those showerhead bloodspurts were imitations of early period american horror n hk martial art flicks... uma thurman was dressed like bruce lee n u even had a jap bodyguard in highsch uniform n gothic makeup... it juz reeks of tarantino playing out his own fantasies abt pulp culture in e movie... martial art choreography is so-so n nothing new, given dat e choreographer is yuen ho ping, n we muz have seen too much of his werks since crouching tiger... sheesh.. i muz really hate this movie.. hahaa   Compliments:   well... thanx to pulp culture (again), we got 3 nice things to admire in e film... 1, e funky disco-ish soundtrack (which i have tried to d/l)... 2, some nice editing of frames n scenes... 3, a short seqeunce of japanese-styled animation which was surprising n truly entertaining...   All in all   ok, besides those 3 things i mentioned under compliments, there really isnt much to look forward to in e film, unless u ar a fan of retro pulp culture (darn i said it again), n judging by wat my female frens have said abt it, gals seem to have an affinity for this sortof thing... i tink i mentioned b4 dat im a sucker for gd plot developments, which i tink shld be e core of any movie (its a provocative n novel storyline dat wld make a movie stick in ur mind for life, not some funky music or retro colors), n since KillBill is apparently lacking in it, i have to say i shall d/l vol 2... i paid 6.50 n felt dat tarantino (aka overhyped 1 hit wonder in Pulp Fiction) owes me a refund...

       I did it!!   Finally watched Lord of the Rings - ROTK and boy, oh boy, was it good. It absolutely surpassed the first 2 instalments of LOTR. I'm still in awe despite watching it twice. Will definitely do a review (i doubt there would be any dissing) expect lots of gushing.

       All I got for Christmas is.....   a mirror a mask a notebook calendar a silver necklace a silver pendant and part 3 of lotr. Yes... bv's birthday-cum-christmas food fest was held last night. gift exchanges are always fun although looking for the gifts are a bitch. twice i went to town only to get mauled by the crowd. and this time round, i pushed my luck by getting last minute gifts (ie the morning of the party). i hate looking for gifts for guys. damn you men out there. however, i was pleased with the choice of gifts that i got for friends (with the exception of one book which was supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek kind of gift but the recepient was none too pleased about it). i am also extremely pleased with the gifts i got. daniel is 6 mths late but i love the mirror nonetheless. hee...    resolutions for the new year.   1) lose weight 2) earn more money 3) go to new zealand 4) re-learn french 5) re-learn salsa 6) go diving

       All I Want for Christmas...    Had that Mariah Carey song stuck in my head after watching  Love Actually  (hee, reviewed YET to be done).   So aaannywaay, the greatest thing happened yesterday afternoon. Received a call from  the crush  on my handphone at work. That was surprising cos first,  the crush  never calls me on my handphone and secondly, he usually calls the office. Turns out, he called me to invite me over to his house for Christmas dinner.  ------YAAAAAAAY!------  He was going to have a Christmas party/drinks/gathering over at his apartment with his friends. ( NOT  office colleagues). Of cos I said yes (did you think I would be stupid enough to turn TC down??) but since I had already made plans with another friend, he said I could bring my friend over as well if I wanted to.   sigh.  Unfortunately, he called me (again!!) today saying that he had quarrelled with his flatmate and now, he can't have the party at his place.  ----------SOB!!!------------   He will try to find an alternative venue for it but as of 2.30pm it is officially off until further notice.   Gah. So close yet so far.

       Movie Review (Part Deux) - Love Me If You Dare (LMIYD)      Staying true to my word of getting my reviews out before LOTR, the last movie I watched before KHNH was  Love Me If You Dare  aka  urlLink  Jeux D'enfants  . As many would have  urlLink read , this movie is billed as the "next"  urlLink Amelie . Well, it's more like a darker, more perversed version of Amelie.  This movie stars  urlLink Marion Cotillard  (the girl in "Taxi", I'm guessin' she was Daniel's girfriend and not Petra) as Sophie and  urlLink Guillaume Canet  (the guy from "The Beach", I'm guessin' that French girl's boyfriend, but I seriously wouldn't know) as Julien. Best friends since young, the two have been inseparable and constantly play a game of dare. When still in the stages of childhood, daring each other to "pee in the principal's office" or "wreck a sister's wedding" is awfully funny. When in teenage-hood, the dares don't seem as funny and borders on being mean. BUT when in adulthood, it is just SICK. Somehow, they do fall in love but they have been playing their game for so long that they never confess their feelings (without kidding around) till the very end.   The movie was definitely good. The use of bright colours and various fantasy-like sequences remind viewers of Amelie. But that is where the similarity ends. While Amelie focuses on good deeds and has an overall feel-good aura, LMIYD is disturbing. The love between the two leads is deep despite their attempts to bury it. The two friends also think of ways to hurt the other, by a) humiliation b) ruining a wedding and c) faking a terrible a car accident. And yet, one seems to hope that they will end up together, if not for love, but to put an end to all those "childish" games, hence the title jeux d'enfants.   They do end up together, but not in the way you would think. Disturbing. It was enjoyable but definitely disturbing, set to the tune of "La Vie En Rose". Kudos to the two young stars who played Sophie and Julien as kids. I would definitely pay $8.50 to watch it.  Cap? Pas Cap?

      *Peeks out from under the table*  Has it been over 2 weeks since i last blogged?? hee, I was supposed to finish writing my review of  love actually , but I never got round to doing it. *sheepish smile* And now, I have 3 movies to review, all of which I had better write before I watch  LOTR - Return of the King  next week. Because of the numerous movies I'm reviewing, I'll not do a detailed review. Besides, I'm sure none of you are interested in reading a detailed review anyway since tons of them can be found on the Net or in newspapers.   Most recent movie: Kal Ho Naa Ho (KHNH)    Yup, I just got back from my first Hindi movie at a theatre. Usually, I just borrow VCDs and watch them and I don't watch Hindi movies very often. Kal Ho Naa Ho stars the oh-so-famous Shah Rukh Khan. Like most Hindi films, KHNH is essentially a love story. Set in New York and tells the tale of a three friends and their families. And like most Hindi films, retelling the plot is a bitch because it is so damn convoluted and has too many characters. So read the  urlLink link  for more details.     I'm just going to add my two cents worth. I can't pretend to be a connoiseur of Hindi movies because I average about one every 3 years. Any-hoo, I enjoyed this movie. The dialogue was surprisingly funny with tons of cheesy jokes, which I don't usually tolerate but, I would rather hear bad jokes than sappy dialogue. The plot didn't have too many loopholes (none that I can remember of hand) and the acting wasn't stilted. It helps, of course, if the actors are good looking and Saif Ali Khan most definitely was.   Moving on... The music and dancing was certainly entertaining. There was actually a tragedy (yes someone died), and the ending was bittersweet. Not bad for a movie over 3 hours long. Boy, was it long.   Overall: It was good. Can't give a price rating cos all Hindi movies cost $10. Heh.

       MOVIE REVIEW: LOVE ACTUALLY   Yay!! Review time!!  Brit movies are usually great, mainly because I can't quite remember if I've ever watch any bad ones.

       It's DECEMBER!!  Wish I were anywhere but in sometimes-rainy, sometimes-hot Singapore. As usual, I have begun planning for my next big holiday (NBH). I'm always planning for the NBH. Not that I ever get to fulfill any of my big holidays. I can't even remember when was the last time i went on a big holiday. Aannywaay. NBH will hopefully be in June. New Zealand is the destination of my choice for various reasons. 1) It'll be winter in June 2) It'll be winter in June 3) I can visit the location of LOTR   It's DECEMBER!!  I've decorated my first office Christmas tree. Watching  Love Actually  (review will be done soon) made me yearn for snow, love and all things cliched. Speaking of movies, I can't wait for LOTR! Numerous eye-candy (ARAGORN! LEGOLAS!), captivating plot and fantastic sets/costumes.   It's DECEMBER!!  And my love life is as forlorn as ever. I've gotten to know my crush slightly better but not getting any closer to him. I'm not complaining though. It is improving.. so who knows, something may actually develop. However, somtimes he is like a wooden block, hints, no matter how obvious, (not that I was giving obvious hints, but my female colleague was doing the hinting for me) seem to fall on deaf ears. Men.    It's DECEMBER!!  First clubbing experience in over 3 months was not as joyous or as enjoyable as before. Trashy music is  NOT  enjoyable when one is crammed in a room full of horny teenagers. Mambo nights at Zouk sucks. (I'm sure Daniel would be happy to hear me say this.) Kids too young to watch R(A) movies are happily grinding away on the dancefloor. I'm getting too old for this shit. Next stop: Velvet.

       Movie Review - Freeze Me         okie... was supposed to be attending real estate finance lect, but hey, its e eve of e eve of CNY! gimme a break!    Synopsis:   Chihiro is a simple girl that wants to have a handful of happiness like everyone else. She has a fiance and a nice apartment where she can carry on in her private life without any worries in the world. But she has a dark secret, a rape that happened between her and three men from her hometown 5 yrs ago (hence coming to tokyo in a bid to escape those memories n rebuild her life). When these men begin appearing again one by one in her life, as they seek to recreate their past experiences wif her, Chihiro finally has to face her fears of losing her fiance, her rebuilt life in tokyo, n everything of significance to her...   My Thoughts:   well... i've read some reviews of e show n most werent impressed by it, describing it as an erotic thriller (there were a no of sex scenes) shallow in e psyche of rape victims, sexploitation (to coin e term used by ong sor fen of ST), dark comedy etc... however, all of them seem to miss out on wat i view to be an essential element thruout e film, dat every event was a direct culmination of wat occured juz b4... n Chihiro was simply caught up in e frenzy of it all, helpless against e swirl of circumstances... to escape her dark past, she came to tokyo to rebuild her life, n when 1 of her rapists showed up, she did all she cld to prevent him from revealing e episode n shattering her new life... surely u wld have felt e same despair when ur fiance discovers e truth n walks away from ur apartment wif ur rapist laffing in ur living room?  wld anyone not have done e same as she had, by trying to make everyone who destroyed her life disappear?  This is a poignant tale of how a gal (or indeed anyone) whos escapist in attitude, struggles to find a way out of a growing mess... e scary thing is it cld happen to anyone... wld u do e same?   Compliments:   some reviews said e lead actress was miscast, n i have to disagree on dat, since she was totally convincing in her role as a happy-go-lucky individual trying to get on wif life as she knows n wants it to be...  it also bears e hallmark of contemporary jap thrillers, wif those grainy screenshots n dark corridors... these when coupled wif e mildly gorry images of blood (as she whacks them on e head wif an assortment of blunt instruments) shld be enuf to make most audiences cringe in some scenes... but like i said, e main draw of e movie isnt e usual screams or lurking shadows. it lies in e whole psychological transformation of Chihiro n her actions, which were made to look inevitable n justified...   Gripes:   ok... maybe shld have cut down on some sex scenes cos some were too drawn out n looked too much like a porno flick in parts (imagine Unfaithful but wif more nudity n action)...   All in all:   u may not agree wif my analysis of e movie, but if u do trust me (i neva watch lousy shows in e cinema!), its a relatively gd watch at 8.50, considering there arent many gd shows on offer now anyway

       Movie Review - Goodbye Lenin!         my 1st movie since lotr! lots of germans were in e theatre wif me, which made me wunder if im e foreigner watching a german film in s'pore... hmm...    Synopsis:   Alex's mum went into a coma on e eve of e fall of e berlin wall, n awakes 8 mnths later after massive social devts have occurred in which germany becomes a united capitalist nation.  As she was a staunch commie, Alex tries to con his mum into tinking dat they ar still living in e old communist German Democratic Republic, for fear dat his mum might suffer another heart attack...   Compliments:   a dark comedy portraying e contrasting lives b/w east n west germany of e times, e film succeeds in satirising e whole event, despite potentially profound political/emotional undercurrents.  From e typical west german who takes everything in life for granted, to e plight of Alex's family as they struggle to adapt to a new capitalist system, e whole movie is a montage of multi-faceted views of east germany in dat era.  Performances by a strong cast add further credibilty to e story, n it shld be enjoyed by historians n e layman alike.   Gripes:   too bad i cant understand german, cos there were parts when e german audience was laffing n i cldnt get e joke from e subtitles...  grrr..... n i guess e cinematography n editing cld have been done more creatively... nothing new there plus e soundtrack is quite stale n i cldnt remember any tune from it at all.   All in all:   its entertaining n mildly provocative, n shld be well worth 8.50.... tho im extra happy dat i paid 6.50 for it!

       PHOTOS!   Just got my company christmas dinner photos. Only remembered to email myself some.. the rest are at work. But will stick it on the site once i have them. heh, got a pic of the crush as well, but unfortunately it's not in this set of pics.      Notice how my glass is full of orange juice and not beer which was the choice of drink for the night. By the time the party cum drink fest ended, I think I was the only sober one around.     He is my immediate boss. That's his wife beside him. She's really pretty.     The guy beside me is one of the Rope Access Technicians. Awfully skinny.

       HUh? huH?   What do you mean by "now that the blog has finally sprung back to life"???? Haha, in all fairness, fluke seems to be the one regularly writing stuff. Yes, Nephthys sends her apologies. She has been erm, busy and frankly, too tired to think of stuff to write. Days in the dorm are long gone, thus she has no more epiphanies to share at 3 am in the morning. Because at 3 am Nephthys is SLEEPING, like normal folks.   But the movie reviews seem to trudge along, with reviews mainly by Fluke. Thanks fluke!  A slight worry for Nephthys is that she thinks this site is no longer read by alot of people. To date, she knows only a handful of people read it. If readership declines, then she might have to take drastic action like advertising fluke's phone number. :)

       2-in-1 Movie Review!    ooh... now dat e blog has finally sprung back to life, its time for more move reviews! well... 2-in-1  cos im lazy n erm.. yah, dats abt e only reason =p    Last Life in the Universe      if u luv quirky, original stories, this wld be ideal... e movie at 1st sight seems largely unspectacular cos of its unexciting storyline (a jap guy meets a thai gal n they fall in luv)... but wat captivates audiences is indeed e plot itself, which at times blur e lines b/w reality n imagination of its individual characters... n i haven even mentioned e mildly funny dialogue n belieavable performances by the japanese n thai cast (of whom e female lead is a real looker)... so erm... i tink its quite hard to hate e show, unless u ar some anti-jap or anti-thai person...   Mystic River      another powerful story wif an all-star cast... wat movie can fail wif sean penn, kevin bacon n clint eastwood as e director?  even tim robbins got his breakthru role in this film... a definite winner for best supporting actor... its a movie littered wif emotional upheavals, subtleties n clues for e audience to discover for him/herself (it is afterall a suspense thriller) n even has a certain moral undertone thrown in... extremely heavygoing material set into e plot of a classic murder investigation... if u watched Sleepers (wif brad pitt n kevin bacon n some other ppl i cant remember) n liked it, u cant miss Mistic River... oh.. also realised something weird while searching for pics from e movie.. e 3 chilhood frens neva appear in e same scene as adults thruout e film...

       American Idol: My Own Two Cents   Up to this point, four people have made it through to the next round. Since season 3 began, I've not yet made my comments about the show. Auditions were hilarious, as usual, although I found season 2 to be more memorable.    The Hates:  I HATED and I mean HATED Scooter Girl. Nothing you can say can or will ever make me like her. Granted, she does have a fair amount of singing talent but she is just SO annoying! That exaggerated facial expression, the stupid scooter and who does acrobats on that scooter anyway? Needless to say, Nephthys was extremely pleased that scooter girl scooted out of the show. (I pray that she won't be  invited back to the wild card round.) I HATED smarmy Michael Keowyn as well. It's just not natural to love yourself that much. I also HATED Ms Boobs, Katie Webber. For some reason (I think it was her breasts), she annoyed me. Yes, she can sing and yes, she does look cute. But the problem, I think, is that she knows it.    The Likes  I actually wanted to like that cute, man-ish girl, Briana. However, Mediacorp did not telecast the episode featuring the good auditions, so I didn't get a chance to hear her sing. Unfortunately, the only time I heard her sing was in Group 2. No one should ever cover songs by Norah Jones, especially not when one wears suspenders and looks like a boy. I liked the pen salesman, only because he looks cute, in a pen-salesman sorta way.   Can't wait for group 3 because the pen salesman is going to be singing. Yay!

       The Cold War   I'm not talking about the cold war that occurred decades ago, but the "wars" my mom and I get into from time to time. Fighting with my mom can be a pain. Sometimes, the fault lies with me for various reasons namely late nights, bad grades and the occasional rude behaviour. But this time round, I firmly believe the fault lies with her.   The fight starts with either a loooong rant by queen B herself or a blow-up, but that rarely occurs. Tuesday's incident started with a blow-up with each ranting out their points but the other not listening and refusing to give in. I still maintain that the fault does not lie with me (and I've spoken to various people about it).   So anyway, right now it's degraded to plain silence. Icy on Tuesday morning, but now it's just silence. We talk to the rest of the family as normal but conversations between me and her? Heh, she moves into another room when I come in and we don't even take the same lift down in the mornings. On my part, I avoid looking at her whenever possible.  It is ridiculous to note that the fight is about food. I don't know when the cold war will blow over. In the meantime, it just gets easier to avoid.

       A shout out to......   BREASTS         What's with the never-ending preoccupation with breasts? Janet bared hers, to the dismay of countless of people, Christina's cried out for some measure of support and women at my gym show theirs off in the locker room. We-ell, not exactly showing off, but you get my drift.  Frankly, I am fascinated with breasts. No. Not in a sexual way. (Get your head out of the gutter.) I just wonder how women can walk around with the jiggly thing sticking out of their chests without feeling uncomfortable. You might think to yourself, "But she's a girl. Why the fuck is she wondering about such a stupid thing?" Let me just inform you that i'm not well-endowed. At all. Hence, my fascination with the shape and texture (heh. just kidding. I don't want to  touch  it, for heaven's sake).  You know who has a fine, fine and I mean  fine  body?  urlLink Monica Bellucci . Yes, I watched  urlLink Irreversible  but I do not wish to recap the movie. I just found out that Monica Bellucci acted in the Matrix Part 2 as Persephone; that hot, hot,  hot  lady. Fuck. I've been trying to find her naked photos from the movie but I keep having to go to porn sites and become a member first before getting the photo. That's just waay to much trouble for me, dude. Plus, I'm not  that  desperate. So you'll have to make do with Janet's ugly boob and Christina's peek-a-boo show.

       And she's back   Oh look who's back! It's ME!! (fanfare all around) Feels good to blog again. In case anyone is actually wondering, I've been too lazy to blog and work was driving me nuts.   Stress due to the work and stress due to money are two different things. While working in a small firm has its perks (namely flexible time, easy-going bosses), cashflow does get pretty tight. Having to delay payments to supplier gets awfully exhausting when they keep hounding one for money. Added to that, disgruntled employees whose wages are delayed (this includes yours truly). Anything that goes wrong financially in the company, the accounts/finance department is the first casualty in the finger-pointing game. And who makes up the acct/finance dept? Yours truly again. Sigh.   Well, now, my motto is "Don't give a fuck". Thus, life is much more pleasant. Not only that, my fave tv shows are BAACK!!!  urlLink Survivor: All-Stars  and  urlLink American Idol !!    Survivor  - I caught only the debut episode on Monday, but missed the second one yesterday. I must say it's really great to see previous contestants again.    American Idol  - Hee, where do I begin? I was afraid that I would not like this year's contestants because I grew so fond of those on AI2, even those horrid ones like Keith and Edgar. But this year's batch have yet to disappoint me. The new "Keith" has got to be  urlLink William Hung . I mean, who can forget "She Bangs" as sung by him? Adorable. This year's fame whores (trademark  urlLink Shack ) are even more delusional than the previous 2 seasons. Hee, and it makes good tv to watch them get slammed by Simon.   Updates on my life: As usual :) I outgrew my crush!! Yay!!! Why? Well, he's a jackass. 'Nuff said. I watched "Irreversible" last night. Yup, that French movie. Disturbing is a mild way of describing that show. I usually have a high tolerance level for disgusting stuff. Blood, gore, people getting killed; I love them all. But the infamous 10 minute rape scene almost had me rushing to the nearest W.C to puke. Any longer and I would have puked. One doesn't get to see any more than a breast and a peek at the rapist's penis, but the uncut scene (shot from the same angle throughout) was highly disturbing. Shudder.

       No more Cruising with the Cruz   Yeah.. cheesy title. It is official.  urlLink Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz have called it quits after 3 years . (Has it been that long already?)  You won't see me crying over this. Not that I've ever cried over any celebrity. Please, I'm not  that  pathetic. But, I digress. I've never been a fan of Penelope Cruz and my love for ol' Tom died when he and Nicole broke up. So, am I glad they broke up? You betcha. Unfortunately, no sordid tales to tell like wanton-drunken behaviour from either party. Apparently it was "amicable" and the two stars "remain friends".   So, "yay" for them.

       AMERICAN IDOL    Good Riddance to Leah "Carmen Rasmussen" LaBelle and Matt "I love the camera" Rodgers.   Next to go ought to be         1) Jon "Penboy" Lewis. Yes, I have confessed my liking for him, but now I'm doing an about-turn. He annoys the shit out of me.   2) Diana "Beauty Pageant" DeGarmo  and  3) Camile "I can't sing" Velasco

       IT HAS HAPPENED!!   Cheer for me people! I have finally saved enough money for a l-o-o-n-g trip (well, long enough for me to use up all of my annual leave) to New Zealand. Yup yup! I'll be heading off in mid-May for a 19 day trip to Middle Earth. As of now, I only have to save for my spending money. Air tickets have been booked and fully paid for. Tour package will be decided only after my friend's mid-terms. (Yes, I actually found someone else to go with me). For those who want to know, I'll be using the  urlLink MagicBus  Pass and doing the whole hostel-staying semi-backpack thing.   So YAY for me! ANyone who wants anything better start leaving messages for me.

Best Actress - Charlize Theron for  Monster Best Original Screenplay - Soffia Coppola for Lost In Translation

      Well it is certainly nice to know that this charity foundation has a cool $189 million in reserves, enough to tide it over for the next 3 years without anyone donating. And it is also nice to know that 52 cents out of every dollar goes to those who actually need it and the remaining 48 cents used to run the non-profit organization.   This is the same charity foundation that I donate to almost every month via GIRO deduction and during my days as a POOR university student, the said foundation had the cheek to ask me to top up my bank so that GIRO deductions would be successful because they will incur bank costs for failed deductions. My dad donates $27 a month to this organization and I'm sure thousands of other Singaporeans do the same thing as well, and in bigger amounts too.   No doubt, it supports a good cause and has over 2000 people to support, but I'll be looking for a worthier cause to donate my precious dollar to.    Note: This blog has no intention of offending anyone related (or not) to the charity foundation. I'm just airing my views.

      My plans for New Zealand are shaping up VERY nicely. I've got my backpack ready, airline tickets are ready and we've already made our MagicBus bookings. Next on the agenda will be making train and ferry reservations and fine-tuning our itinerary. So many things to do, so little time and money.

      The Great Singapore Sale. Truly great indeed. So great that I bought a skirt for $99 without even thinking twice about the amount. And guess what? The darn skirt wasn't even on sale! I probably could have found a cheaper version somewhere else for half the price. But I like it - every pink and black inch of it. Pink is   in  , my friend.  Pink  is  the new black.   Next on my list: That little denim Guess bag at Isetan.

      I finally watched an entire football match (well, almost). Fortified with Turkish coffee, I was confident that i could stay up to catch the  urlLink Greece Vs France match . But seeing as the match was slow and unimpressive, I shouldn't have bothered. As everyone with access to tv/internet/newspapers would know, France lost. Bleah.

      Tons of people searching for a naked j.lo or j.lo's pubic hair will now be directed to this site.   So will people looking for vagina and butt crack.  For those who have been misled, a thousand apologies! This is not a porn site specialising in naked pictures of j.lo!! Well, even if it was a porn site, j.lo will be the last woman i'd want to see naked!! Andrea Corr maybe.  Some poor soul was looking for "women who have sexy feet and nice butts" and ended up finding  a little piece of heaven...  instead.   And for the record, I don't have  urlLink Daniel Letterle's  pics!!!  Has Nephthys gone nuts with this nonsensical rambling? Well, no.

      With the renewed effort to look for a new job, editing the cv/resume has begun. ugh. it's such a bother having to think of my current roles & responsibilities, achievements and skills so that i can effectively "sell" myself to potential employers.  how do you impress without having to embellish the truth? would blogging be considered a skill for editorial jobs? just imagine SH editors surfing through this pink site. i could be the next Sumiko Tan. i don't fancy being any of the political writers. if you think i want to write about anything heavier than the weight of my shoe, think again.   thankfully for all readers, sph is not my next career choice. it would be great if someone paid me to sit at home and plan my next holiday. (ok, i will officially drop the topic of my holiday - past, present or future - from all blogs from now till.. my next holiday!)   i did think i could be an events coordinator or party hostess (not KTV!!) but then, i realised that i can be quite anti-social, which might pose a  slight  problem in that line of work.   where's the an oil sheikh when i need one? life as a "sheikhess"(??? is that what you call a female sheikh?) would be awesome.

      So, I went out on friday to Clarke Quay for food (Satay!) and Equinox for drinks/dance.   Just for the record, the music at Equinox was like a very bad retro night at Zouk. The DJ obviously did not graduate from DJ-school cos the changes in genre was abrupt. Beyonce, 50 cents and all my R&B pals did not make an appearance on the playlist. At. All. Nonetheless, we were determined to stick it out for at least a decent song. Like every other bad club I've been to in my life time, the longer one waits, the less likely one will get to listen to good music. Although, the definition of good music is very subjective. But Equinox, like all other clubs, doesn't disappoint in terms of being good fodder for gossip and people watching.   The last time I was there, I cam across a couple making out frantically in one of the booths. Heh, that was funny. They were close to dry humping and it was only 10pm!! Yesterday we were in the lift with 3 people, one Asian guy and 2 British women who were friends. All three had British accents, but it was apparent that the guy had just met the two girls at the club. On the way down, one girl asked the guy "Did you just learn that accent?" To which he replied, "I'm a fast learner" She then pointed to her friend and asked "From her??"  Thankfully, the lift door opened cos bv was desperately trying to control his laughter. oh, the ridiculous-ness of it all!

      Well, in a space of 1 day/night, I've finally have got news to tell. (I'm not a voyeur, but some things should be shared.)  1) My one and only female colleague (receptionist) tendered her resignation yesterday after a spat with one of the bosses. No, it wasn't a scream-fest, but said boss started quizzing her about long-forgotten Maths topics (conversion of mm to m) which confused this lady. She told him so. He, in turn, started cussing and muttering something about having to know this f****** sh!t etc. Already suffering from low-morale at work (and she isn't the only one), that was the final straw for her and 2 hours later, she handed her letter to the other boss. So, her last day will be on the 17th of July, after which, I am sure, I'd be ask to take over her duties as well. Yeah, I'll single-handedly be in charge of the HR/Accounts/Finance/Admin department.   This act has prompted our new IT personnel to seriously ponder about his future at the firm as his 3 months probation will be up in July. For the record, I'm doubling my efforts to find a new job.   2) After a fairly momentous day at work, I was very excited at night cos I finally went for my run and was very confident that I could stay up to at least watch the England Vs Switzerland match. (Well, mainly cos Whose Line Is It Anyway was showing at midnight.) Lo-and-behold, we received a call at 10.30pm from one of my brother's friends (he was in school for the freshman camp) who told us that my brother was possessed. Now, believe what you will (I've always been a skeptic when it comes to these things) but my brother has the "gift" of a third eye.   So we hurried to his school, which is all the way in the west, to get him. He wasn't turning his head 360 degrees or spewing vomit   a la    The Exorcist  , but was incredibly weak. At times, he forgot his own name and could only look at you blankly, but this was interspersed with long periods of lucidity. We found out from friends that the first attack was particularly bad and it took 8 of his friends to hold him down cos he was kicking and screaming.   Thankfully, right now, he is sound asleep at home and hopefully will be right as rain in a few days' time.

      I've been feeling dissatisfied with my life, especially regarding work, for quite some time now. A year since I've graduated and I can say that nothing much has improved.   My trip to New Zealand has shown that there is more to life than my 9-5 job in a firm that is increasingly becoming tiresome. But expressing a desire to travel all my life was met by disbelief and an exclamation that such a life is unrealistic.   Alarmingly, I think that I still don't know what to do in life. The idea of spending 30 years in a career related to what I've studied terrifies me. But am I good enough to make a switch to something completed unrelated to accounting? It all boils down to self-belief I suppose.  (Gah. I'm just feeling sorry for myself cos I've got no more leave and my vacation is long over and I'm missing someone.)

      Got bit by the editing bug. I've decided to completely change the outlook of this blog. A rejuvenation of some sort. Big changes have been made mainly to trim this site of excessive junk which I'll never update. (Read: stupid poll site)   I'm also sick of the colour blue and  pink  is now the new flava of the month.   This site is also no longer called "Lava Deposits..." but "A little piece of heaven..." Why? Well, cos  this  is a little piece of heaven! (I dare you to say otherwise.)  So send in your comments/suggestions and I may take them into consideration depending on my mood. Oh, and to those people on my "regular contributors" list, if there aren't any contributions by the end of the week, I'll be removing that section as well.

      Three days into Euro 2004 and I've not watched a single match. In all fairness, I did try to stay/wake up to watch them on cable tv. But i have no will-power. It was just too much of a bother. Even the lure of 22 sweaty men running around like hapless chickens chasing after a ball is not enough to make me get up at an un-godly hour of 2.50am. Anyway, what with France scoring only at the very end of the match, watching the first 90 minutes would have been a complete waste of time.

      Ooh. Blogging for the third time today. This must be a new record.  So guess where i went today? The  urlLink zoo ! The last time i went to the zoo was when i was 12!!! It was hot and humid but very enjoyable day. A good way to spend 3 hours of my precious weekend away.      Everything but the smell has changed alot since i last visited the place. Boy, do the camels stink! No one was mauled by a tiger, since all them animals were fast asleep. Which made me think that the zoo should be opened at night, but then i realised that that is what the night safari is for. ;p Surprisingly, my parents were good fun too. (We went to the zoo on a whim.)   Anyone interested in volunteering can go to this  urlLink website .

          For once, I am actually interested in watching sports on TV; especially with the NBA finals being played and the upcoming Euro 2004. (God, I can't believe that I'm swept up in all the hype of Euro 2004.) Lest you think that the reason is cos of all the cute guys, let it be known that I don't find the NBA players cute. At all.      Euro 2oo4 on the other hand, is a different story altogether. I just have 2 words: Iker Casillas. Having no favourite teams, my loyalties will change as the days go by. One thing's for sure, England Vs France, my loyalties will lie with the team that has no Beckham. Will I actually stay up to watch the matches on telly? Your guess is as good as mine.

      Well, it's been a week since i came back. (Un)Fortunately, my office didn't burn down in my absence. So I had to return to work. And I'm proud to say that I've survived the first week!!! Yay! Clearing 3 weeks worth of crap is NOT my idea of fun.   Birthday celebrations for today has more or less been pushed to next week. :( But i'm still meeting Daniel(!) today!   I've finally gotten over the "jetlag" and have stopped waking up at 5 am and sleeping at 9 plus. For those who don't think that's odd, well, it is! New Zealand is 4 hours ahead of Singapore, so do your own math. Although, I've been craving me some scones with cream and jam. Any idea where I can get it?   1 week on and i still hate the weather here. Some things will never change.

      this is for those who give a  shite . Blogger changed it's outlook! i can't handle changes!! What is going on around here?  So apparently this site has been real quiet. I think I must have lost tons of readers (yeah, seeing as my blog reaches out to millions of people each day) since my (self-imposed) hiatus.   New Zealand has been tons of FUN! 19 days is not as long as I thought it would be and returning home was something I absolutely dreaded. As expected, I took as much photos as I could, while facing battery difficulties. I forgot to get the NZ charger and I refused to buy one. So I had to borrow chargers from the hostels. Borrowed one charger in Rotorua but the current in the socket was not strong enough to charge my batteries even though I left them there for 2 days! Well, i should have known since the heating in that hostel was almost non-existent.   I bungy jumped over there (and didn't die from it)! So yay for me!   Met loads of fantastic people on the bus. And was incredibly sad to say goodbye to them in Christchurch. My photos are all ready and I'll upload them as soon as it is convenient for me. *grin* Knowing how lazy I am (which explains why this blog is almost a non-blog), it would take some time. But I'll really try, for those of you who are dying to know about my trip (again, I stress, that the site reaches out to millions of people each day). NOT.  In other news, I turned 23 yesterday. A quiet celebration for one who had to go back to work and was still slightly jet-lagged. (Humour me. I refuse to return back to Singapore time, in the hopes that I'm dreaming and will wake up snuggled under my blanket in Queenstown). Hopefully, a big bash will be in order this weekend. Well, not a big bash, but a night out would be more than preferable.

       (Hey! More new blogger features! I just love this website!!)   &nbsp;          I watched   urlLink  Mean Girls    last week. It was surprisingly entertaining, especially since I'm not a Lindsay Lohan fan. The girl who plays "Regina" is hot, but when did Lacey Chabert (Party of Five) grow up to be so ugly? Well, not ugly, but her face isn't going to launch a thousand ships. What's with her nose? Is that tan even real? (ooh. bitchy)  &nbsp;  Anyhoo, thinking back to my good ol school days, I definitely didn't fall into any popular group. Not that I'm bitter about it. Someone recently commented that I'm anti-social cos I love solitary sports like swimming and jogging. But I'm not. I like being around other people as much as the next girl&nbsp;but only up to a certain point. After that,&nbsp;I'll get sick of them and prefer my own company. I think that's the thing, I can actually tolerate doing things by myself; shopping, swimming, jogging, cycling, even eating and watching a movie. Plus, I really don't see the need to hang out in&nbsp;a big group and be perceived as "cool". (Maybe I'm just getting old.)  &nbsp;  In any case, I'm thankful that I'm not in school anymore and having to deal with young bitches like that.

      Ok. I finally watched it a few days ago. Now time for my two-bit comments.     They don't make racers like they used to. I seriously think the best group of racers came from the first Season. Season 2 was not too bad, but it all got down hill from there. Now, with the fifth instalment of this Emmy-winning show, the racers are going to be grating on my nerves very soon.   I like  urlLink Linda and Karen  (Self-proclaimed bowling moms). Positive throughout the race.   I'm neutral towards  urlLink Bob and Joyce  (internet dating couple),  urlLink Chip and Kim  ,  urlLink Colin and Christie  and eliminated couple,  urlLink Dennis and Erika .  Now comes to the good part. Young all girl teams have never made a good impression on me. Remember Leslie and Kim from S1? Or what about that Jaree and Tian in god-knows-which-season? They have a tendency to be bitchy, mean and manipulative. So far, twins  urlLink Kami and Karli  have not been too annoying (but they were a little slow in reading clues) but I would not put it past them to annoy the hell out of me in the coming episodes.    urlLink Marshall and Lance  - the token brothers. We had good ones so far, Kevin and Drew (S1) being the most notable pair. Then, Ken and Gerard, Al and Jon and my other fave, Oswald and Danny. Somehow, M&L aren't going to be that likeable, especially judging from the way they complained about the bad night in Uruguay.    urlLink Charla and Mirna  are just weird and screechy. More so Mirna than Charla. Charla's spunky but Mirna is WHINY. So far, the team I dislike the most. And that whisle.. god, lose the whistle!  Ok. getting lazy now. I'm dumping all the other couples together. The ones with the pretty girlfriends and their so-so partner/boyfriends. Father-daughter team is a little irrtating mainly cos of the daughter.   But there's always Phil. I like Phil. (YUM!)  Well, folks, that, in a nut-shell is the amazing race for you.

      By now, all the furore over the Euro2004 must have ended. (If you're still raving about it, check yourself to the nearest  Euro2004 annonymous  centre.) But I forgot to rave, not about the game, but about the eventual winner ( urlLink Greece ) and 1 player ( urlLink Angelos Charisteas !!) in particular.  All should be proud that I (me, the non-football fan) managed to not only stay up to watch the last match, but also to actually yell when that ball hit the back of the net. Of cos, it also helped that I have got the hots for the scorer. Say what you want about their tactics, but they won the cup.      Anyhoo, no  urlLink Copa America  for me. I'm not a big fan of Brazil and I don't actually care who wins.

      Not done my movie reviews in the longest time!!! The movie that has the honour of being my first review in 7 months is " urlLink Super Size Me ".     Super Size Me is essentially a documentary about the growing fat problem in America, largely due to the booming fast food industry. Director Morgan Spurlock also embarked on a 30 day, 3 meals a day McDonald's diet, to show how harmful it can be. Some rules to follow: he had to eat everything on the menu at least once. He must also super size his order if asked. I have never actually seen/eaten a super sized meal (the "upsize ones here look like Happy Meals in comparison). The portions are frightening. Who eats that?! Apparently alot of Americans, if the statistics are to be believed.   As hilarious as the movie was, it was incredibly disturbing. Not only did Spurlock gain an unhealthy 10+ kg in 30 days, his cholesterol level shot up from 165 to 230 and his liver was turning into pate. Similar to the effects of binge drinking. Spurlock also highlighted the fat-laden cafeteria food found in some schools, with a teenager claiming a plate of french fries to be her vegetable intake.   Interspersed with his McDonald's diet were interviews with various people (i can't remember off-hand who they were) and sobering statistics about food and food-related topics. He also interviewed a guy who ate 19 000 Big Macs (averaging about 2 a day) for the past donkey years. That was absurd!  Critics and Mcdonald's fans can claim that it was foolish of him to even start that ridiculous diet, which would obviously lead to adverse health consequences. But then again, the amount of fast food consumed by Americans is unhealthy to begin with. Anyway, 2 months after the movie's screening at the Sundance Festival, Mcdonalds recalled its "Super Sized" meals. Whether or not it was due to the movie is anyone's guess.

         We've jumped on the  Idol  bandwagon. Over the next 15 weeks (I think), we will be subjected to people butchering various songs in the hopes of becoming Singapore's first ever Idol. So how was the first episode? Are contestants as delusional as their American counterparts?  Quoting from a recent  urlLink article  in the New Paper,  "Indeed, to most of the panel, the biggest eye-opener at the auditions wasn't the discovery of the next Singapore Idol, but how untalented and thick-skinned most of the also-rans were."     Wanting to be the next William Hung isn't the most ambitious dream. But Mr Lemon Tree (only those who watched it will know) did have his 15 minutes of fame, at the expense of all sane people watching the show. Nothing was as bad as the guy who took the song "Careless Whisper" to heart and sang it no louder than a whisper.  What about the judges and host?  Paula, Randy and Simon can rest easy. While some judges did try to incorporate acidic remarks into their speech, Simon still holds the title for being the meanest judge. That music producer, Ken has the bad habit of looking at someone through the top of his glasses. I HATE that. But maybe it's all an act to seem condescending and mean.  WHATEVER . Nothing particularly remarkable about them. Unfortunately, just like the contestants, the judges were very bland as well.  I guess I should be thankful that there wasn't a whole lot of Gurmit. Ryan Seacrest he isn't. That's for sure.  All in all, Singapore Idol is turning out to be like past remakes of any American-made TV show. (Think Wheel of Fortune, Pyramid Game etc). Bland and the aspects which should be copied (I mean, you're already re-making it. Why not make it as true to the original as possible?) aren't.  For those interested, Singapore Idol will be showing on Channel 5  (tanx mediacorp! i luv u 4eva n eva!!! ;-) from - sunnysunshine girl)  on Wednesday at 8.30pm.

         For those of you who love me.    General updates:  1) Say hello to the new  finance executive  at Global AirFreight!! That's right! I got a new job, starting the 6th of September!! Problem is, I've not given my notice of resignation and will have to do it tomorrow. Kinda feel bad cos I just got paid last Friday and my boss gave me a small bonus as well. But I hate working there anyway, so i'll just grit my teeth and be done with it.  2) bv will be leaving this fair city for an even colder city this thursday. Say goodbye to my karaoke buddy for he will be Montreal for 9 months or so. *tear*

       Yay! the only reason why i'm so happy that it's national day is cos of the public holiday that comes with it!! No work. No school. Nothing! :-)  As i was looking at the   urlLink  NDP    website, i came across the photo gallery and went to the emcee page. Guess who i saw??!?!?!? Gurmit "f-ing" Singh. AGAIN. He was the emcee last year.       Don't we have enough talented hosts around? Whatever happened to Kumar? Djs? Not only will we be subjected to 15 episodes of Gurmit on Singapore Idol, we have to hear him on NDP as well?!?! Crikey.
