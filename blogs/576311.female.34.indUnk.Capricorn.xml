      Great weekend! Friday went not so well, because nick had some amp problems...   But saturday rocked! I can't believe how many people were at the Homestead! The ad in the paper worked! We played for tips, but made a tidy sum on them. Well, at least covered our gas to get out there.  If you were there and liked us, tell your favorite bartenders about us!   We got video, we got pictures. Got lined up on doing another wedding.   We were only set on stun..   The two songs we learned this week went over very well.  Keep watching for us... we try to add new songs every week. We still don;t have a complete set, but give us a few more months, maybe two, and we'll be up and running full force. We have originals we are working on, too.

      The wonderful Lascivious Loretta ... or perhaps her husband, will be there at Mary's on Friday to videotape us, so we will at least have  that  for a demo. Also, i did hear that one of the bar owners in town is interested in seeing us, so she may be there, too. As long as the friends we have at Mary's keep talking us up, things should go well. We really do rock, if i do say so myself.   I have not been seeing the flyers up that i so nicely asked owners of establishments to PUT UP. What meanies.   Loretta and Tom are also going to head out to the Homestead on Saturday to see us.    Thursday afternoon, the band will have a quick cram-jam to nail the two songs we just learned so we can add them in on Friday. Then, it's haul the stuff up to Mary's and set it up for Friday.

So, from the Department of Rendundancy Department of  Manifest List , once again, for good measure~   4/26, Mary's Riverside Tavern, between the 11th and 12th mile markers on the Allegany side of the Coos River, 9 PM. 4/27, The Homestead Tavern, about 3 miles out from Four Corners on the way to Laverne Park.   Gnarly drives both times, so drive safe! You are our fanbase, and we wouldn't want to lose ANYONE to the tree gods!   The band has been working on some new material, things to make you DANCE!

      Friday's wedding went.....  okay.  It was great and everyone appreciated that we learned the song we hated and we played it well but the band, to me, really seemed to be elsewhere. In my opinion, there were only a couple of *great* band moments... not including this one~  Parking was weird. Everyone just parked in the yard. There are 3.4 acres of yard, though, but those acres were crammed full of cars. I parked somewhere i figured i'd be safe and able to move if i had to.. so later i have to, and i'm carefully trying to unwedge myself from between two brand new cars on either side of me and one old truck behind me.  Not, yknow, particularly worried about my own truck, but it was a hard place to get out of.   In reverse, check all the mirrors for side clearance, check rear-view, peer out window, let off the clutch, gently .... gently.... CRASH  yeah i hit a wedding members truck. Left some paint on his bumper. he was parked in a stupid place, though. MY truck, though, has a fist sized dent in the tailgate and some blue scratches across the top of the tailgate. no damage done, really.. more comic relief for a stressful day, i guess.   but still, now everyone up there is gonna call me Crash. They've already started.

      Band practice today!  Also changed the obnoxious color of the page. I couldn't look at the yellow anymore. Soon, i hope to replace the rocks with pictures of each of us.   Possible leads for us: Lloyd's of Bandon  IS  interested in us.                                  The band at the Blue Moon wants a break, so i hear.                                  New owner at the Homestead.                                 Jeef has talked to the people at the Fun Fest and the Gay 90s festival. I'm supposed to handle the rest (of course)                                 We can go up and play any old time at Mary's.   If you know any of these places, or frequent them, blab about us.

      In case you missed it, the List went out today. If you aren't already on it, you should be able to click on the "get on the list!" link off to the left, there.    We think we might have something going for Coquille's Gay 90s deal. Not sure.   Check out Gluttn over at the Bachelor's Inn on Sunday nights. Some pure rocknroll fury outta Danny. Good stuff.   Silverhawk has also been rocking. Saw them last week, once at the Wanda's jam and then again on Saturday night. The new stuff is great, guys :)   The inimitable BeBe Bardot has gigs all summer down at Lord Bennett's too, to round out the local rocknroll experience..   And, as usual, a plug for my favorite place in town, Mary's Riverside Pub in Allegany. Great food. Wednesday music anarchy. Sunday games (Cribbage tournament this month.. beat Neil and Pancake for some serious bragging rights).  Last night's practice was mediocre.. we're all recovering from some nasty cold. I was the last to get it. We did, however, get two new songs nailed down, and a good grip on another one.   yeah, not much about the band in this post. Just wasting some time here, givin props to all my friends and the like.

      We got the Run.  Friday the 19th.  Six PM.   Be there, or be elsewhere.  And April is also going to be seen yukking it up with BeBe Bardot at his Lord Bennett's B-day Bash in Bandon on 7/5.

      ahhh.. i love the riverside, even though the patrons all moan about how we're too loud. Well, yeah, and most of the people who have seen us in there know we're loud, and i don't see why they come if they're just going to complain about something they already know about. There is no line we can draw with our equipment in that place to get the guitar sound we like, get over the drums, and have Tammi heard. the place is just too small with too many weird angles.    soooooo anyway, those of you who missed it, we did lay out a rough version of BTO's "Let it Ride". Except it's Big Sugar's version of the song, which rocks 10 million times more. We think it'll be well-received!   My friend Dean came up and brought his recording equipment, and he has some  nice  stuff.  We ran the bass straight from the amp into the mixer, and the vocals straight into the mixer, and Dean set up two ambient mikes to catch the rest, and i have to say, the dirty, straight recording sounded damn good. I can't wait until he cleans it up.  Beeb was there (heya Beeb! Thanks for comin! We LOVED it! I think everyone else did, too!) and we jammed a song with him and it rocked. I even played my part perfectly, which i was unable to do the last time we jammed together, for whatever reason.   Nick's dad was able to come up, and that was really cool. So far, Ron's the only parent whos been able to see us. (sad face). Mine live out of state, Tammi's mom lives kinda far away, and Jeff's mom lives kinda far away, too. But soon, probably in the next week or so if all goes well with Dean, we'll have a CD we can send our families, and whoever else might want one. It'll be the show at the Riverside, the best songs we did that night. These are all covers, so we can't sell this. Just ask, once i give the word, and i'll get a CD to you. There is a little bit of a waiting list, right now..  ah, still working on scanning the logo for the shirts. i have not perfected it yet. I do the artwork by hand, being of the old-school DIY punk-rock type ethic. I haven't been able to balance and straighten it to my liking yet.   Onward... The Coos River Run, i am assuming it is ON.  I'm pretty sure that Friday night is going to be John Chamberlin and a guy named Jack. John's a great git player, so he's worth seeing. More on this later...   Musical progress- Our first original is going to probably be a re-working of the song i wrote and often sing with Beeb, Home. It's also going to be available soon. Well, the original version of it is.   That'd be all the fits that's news to print, guys.

      I don't know who's going to be playing Friday. Something makes me think it's Bev and Jerry's Brick Pig Family Blues band. It could be the Joneses or it might even be Bigfoot Blues. I wish i knew!   ahhh.. the big mystery...

      Finally got the band to do a Big Sugar song! Actually, we have two we're going to work on, but we worked on the best one tonight. Y'all should recognize it, even if you've never heard of these guys. Learning it tonight made me realize what a kickass band we really are!   We'll add it to the set at the Coos River Run. It'll rock. Trust me!   and while you're waiting around... buy some Big Sugar!

       Excellent News!   We're on for the Coos River Run, as far as i know. We talked to one of the guys last night. Of course, i didn't set this up. The rest of the band did, i just did some leg work on it here and there, but i guess we're on for Saturday.  I don't know all the details. I wish i did. Will email this out as soon as the email address is working again (damn thing. I may just get another one).  The run is July 19, 20 and 21.    we've got three new songs to blow-dry your hair with.  And finally started work on an original.  April recorded this original with BeBe Bardot this last week, and she actually sounds kinda good singing. In a Bob Dylan sort of way, i guess.

      the stupid mp3 isn't working yet. Sorry.   We played at the Coquile Valley BPOE #1935 Annual Golf Tournament on Saturday. It went pretty well, considering..   ... that we got called to do it the day before ... that the average age of the audience members was 70   It was a good little gig, though. I'll tell ya, the elks have it made down there, they have their own golf course!

      Still haven't fixed the MP3. I have no idea what the problem is. Shoot me an email if you want it and i'll email it to you. Yeah, long process, i know, but it's all i can do right now. I thought of going onto audiogalaxy at a certain time for a few hours and letting anyone who uses it grab it. Any takers?

      i'm not sure whats going on and why you can't download the song. Harborside is having problems with a T1 in Brookings, but i don't see what that has to do with this.  I'll keep trying. Someone else try, and if you can or can't get it, send me an email at reebdogpril@partlycloudy.com, please :)   (later...) ok i think its a problem with harborside. The filename path is right. It is where it says it is. the HTML is right, as far as i've been able to tell... I'll keep bashing away at this until i get it fixed.

      oh, hey, someone was searching for "version of let it ride song" and came across this page...  So, lemme just say that the version you may be looking for is by Big Sugar and is available on the "heated" album, and i do seriously recommend getting that album, and any OTHER Big Sugar albums that may be available in your area.    Each of us band members is grounded in different music-  Jeff loves 80s metal.  That's where he's from, musically.  Tammi likes a lot of stuff, a lot of classic rock, just GOOD music in general.  Nick, the l'il bro of the band, grew up on Green Day and music from the early 90s.  And I love all kinds of stuff.  But firmly rooted in 80s punk rock and dirty blues.  And all of us adore Big Sugar. And it shows in how we approach the band, our gigs, what we play, how we play, and our general attitude about music.  because, as the Mighty Gordie says,   There is no alternative to rock n roll

       Fun Fest News   Well, we're on for the Sunday slot, from 2 to 6 PM.  We're kinda hoping we can move it to Saturday, but who knows. Sunday is good enough. It'll be a blast!   For anyone who saw us wa-a-a-a-y back when (march! haha) at the Homestead, seeing us now would be an experience, because we're 500% better, so come check us out!  We've added a ton of new stuff that'll make you HAPPY! we like happy.   The Fun Fest is in downtown Coos Bay and runs on the 20th, 21st and 22nd of September.    We're working on something for Tad's.  Lloyd's totally blew us off. Their loss. :)  Hear that, dude who owns lloyd's?! YOUR LOSS! Muahahaha.   Oh and ALL the pics we had done at the run turned out icky.  The light was not conducive... in that the shadow from the canopy on the stage cut all our heads off.

This kind of snuck up on me, personally.  hehe. Should be oodles of joy, though. Tons of people.  wee!    other stuff  for now, i have removed the MP3.  i haven't had the time to get on harborside about why it didn't work, and i haven't checked to see if it worked.  So, hang on, it'll be there eventually.    Also lost my scanner access, but hopefully we'll be able to have some stickers or hats or something for sale.  we have a logo now !

Lots of people got pictures, we'll see if any turn out.   urlLink Dale  did a fantastic job running the sound. People liked us.

      Yow!   We're still alive, still playing, although only at the house.    Just a reminder that we're gonna be at the Coos Bay Fun Fest on September 22 (That's a Sunday) from 2 to 6 at the main stage in front of City Hall, downtown.   If you've emailed us at the dazedandconfused.com address, i've had problems with it. Like, i can't always log in because.. well... they suck.  That's all.    We played a wedding a couple of weeks ago in Myrtle Point. At the fairgrounds.  We had the whole fairground to ourselves.  It was great!   We seem to fill an odd little niche around here that isn't getting filled.

       More fun than shootin fish in a barrel   Hoooey.  Just got back.  Here's  my  personal review:   ML  (just picture me tooting my horn, or greasing my head to leave because it was too big to squeeze through the door)  Silverhawk  As usual, fan-fucking-tastic.    Avogadro's Number  Ooh.  FINALLY got to see these guys, and now i know what all the hoo-hah was about.  Dude makes me wanna put my bass away and cry.  (as if... I will torture people with my playing as long as i have fingers).    Muffalo  I think they only played three songs? But they were three damn cool ones.    Black Chrome vs. Death Mask  Had no clue what to expect from these dudes, but it wasn't disappointing.    Zero Set  They cancelled.  I was bummed.  I wanted to see them.    DJ Josh McGrady  Last, and certainly  not  least, the man played some seriously rad shit, and i'd hire him in a sheep's eye if i ever needed a DJ.  Tomo took what looked like tons of pictures and is going to put them on Avagadro's Numbers web page, so when they're up i'll link to them.    There were a lot of really great costumes, too! There are probably a lot of pictures of those, too.   So, it was a rad show.  I hope we get to do more stuff like that.  We were the odd ones in that we played covers and everyone else has originals... but, hey man, our covers are cooooool.  thbbbbbt. (i was kinda self-concious about that. Erm, i'm an idiot though and can be self-concious about some stupid shit)  And Dale got to hang around and see us! *Smooch*  He didn't get to run the board for us, but it was nice that he got to come see us, since he usually has to work on the nights we play.     Next Weekend:   Saturday 11/2 we're off to rattle some glassware at Tad's in fabulous downtown  urlLink  Coquille

       Morning Fastlane, Hershey Bar, and the Jade Plant   last night i sporadically worked on some stuff for the cafe press store.  without a scanner, the stuff is ugly. I'd rather do drawings by hand and use them than struggle with PSP.  All i've got right now is a sticker, and i'm takin it out today and tryin to add some more stuff instead.  Maybe by the end of the week, there will be something up for sale.    What's up with the MP3 you may ask.. well, that annoyed me, and when something annoys me that much, i don't tend to deal with it again for a while.  Plus, it's embarassing now to listen to that CD, because i think we're so much better.  I don't really want to share it.  Hrm. If the rest of the band wants to, i soitinly will, but for now, no.  Its terrible.

      Well, everything has sort of ground to a halt.  We're not playing anywhere NYE.  (Which i'm immeasurably bummed about, but only because of my disease... that  need  to play in front of people).    Tammi has torqued her back up.  Nick is starting school.  So, when/if we start back up again, info will be forthcoming.

       Don't nail that coffin shut, yet    We've been busy, individually, and not-so-busy as a band.  Things were sort of on hold a bit with Thanksgiving, i guess, and some other stuff, and we are unsure what's happening with the holidays.  Good news- We are going to be playing at the  urlLink  World's  Christmas party this weekend.  Today i went and measured out the stage, asked for more room, checked out the acoustics (no way we'll be buggin the bar, as far as i can see...) and figured out where the outlets were.    More good news - Our first original song is probably 3/4 done.  We're still working out the chorus.  Well, it's changed a bit from how i wrote it, and i still have my version in my head, so i screw up when we work on it... but, it's coming along nicely.  Working title is "Get the Hell Offa My Porch or I'm Calling the Cops, Tread".    Bad news- There is no bad news!

       Upcoming gigs   I'm quick this way.  I got torqued on my birthday AND managed to book a gig with the fine folks who put up with the "kiss my ass" song and dance for 20 minutes. I think i got help from Jeff and Tam, though.  So,    January 18  we'll be gettin rowdy at the Free Souls MC club out on Empire Blvd.  Its next to the Fleetwood.  Or, the Fleftwood, as some may remember it.  This is a private club but we can have our fans come out.  They do serve liquor, on a donation basis.  While you are there, you will probably be asked to buy a sticker or button from the club.  They're cheap, so go ahead and buy one.  These dudes are nice guys.  They didn't toss me out on my birthday, and i would have surely tossed me out.     February 14  once again with Sam and John Densmore and their bands at Roger's Zoo in downtown North Bend.  I have no details other than we're playing there. The fabulous DJ will be there again, too.  When more is known, i'll put it here.  We're finally got "Tread" into its final stages.  We smoothed out a couple of rough bits on it this week, played it through 80 million times, and i do believe its ready for the big time.  So, hopefully, we'll be playing it at both of those gigs.  We're also about to start on a song Tammy wrote about a week ago.  Someone said, and i think it was Jeff, that after you write one song, it gets easier.  Seems to be the case :)

      Yup, its on.    March 22 (saturday) at the Free Souls clubhouse in Empire again.  Open to the public, no cover charge.  9 PM. Be there or be elsewhere.    See ya.   I'll have the flyer up here in about a day or two.  Its the only really good one i've done.     apropos of nothing factoid : Those songs you get stuck in your head, the ones that drive you insane... Germans call them "earworms".  I think thats Ohrewurmen. (umlauted u?)

       Until further notice:   I'm done booking, i've made my last flyer, all calls for us to play will be forwarded to other members of the band.  The energy i have for that has to go into something else for awhile. It has very little to do with the band, but it ain't nobody's bidness but my own. I'll keep up the page and the mailing list.

      Speaking of pics, I was devastated to discover that the beauteous seedy, run down, partially torn up hotel in Bunker hill that we were gonna photo shoot at has been torn down all the way!!! since when does a hideous project like that get accomplished in a timely manner??? well, in "Overboard" lingo, 'way to hustle, guys'.... yes, our shows this weekend were definately fun.. we also got the added pleasure of watching Chris and his new band, 'Downshift' perform, when our gig at the Freesouls club was breifly turned into a kamikaze jam session.  Thanks for the break, guys!  The contrast they provided was nice too.  Definately a good evening....i really like those 'souls, they treated us dam good.  Tonight we begin building our album, as it is TIME!!!!! see y'all later...i'm going to attempt to wax an aging ford pickup with oxidized, chalklike brown metallic paint.....actually, at this point i think i'll wash it down with gas, then do an allover spritz with armorall!!!! luv, t

      what a fantastic weekend, man.  Good shows, guys!   And i have a confession to make.    There are days that i want to choke the living shit out of everyone in the band.. (of course, its hard to wrap your hands around your own throat and squeeze...) but, Lawd have mercy! Shows the like two we just had, it's all worth it.

      Check this out: Sara is a fan.  I guess they had a corporate Valentine's Day party where Shawn works and whoever put it on hired some terrible DJ... for  $500 .  Everyone was disappointed with him.  Sara let the party organizers know they could have had a rad live band for our price.  They proceeded to kick themselves all over the mall parking lot.  Sara rocks.  It's cool having a friend work in the local paper's advertising dept.    Well, she loves me, so she's gonna foam us up whenever she has the chance.  You'll have to come up and see her with me some time.  And Nick can rummage through Shawn's cords for that one he lost.

      au contraire, mon sorore (bitch slap me later for the lack of french)  I never called you back because i was busy  Busy cruising around in  urlLink  LL's '02 Vette  .  All day Sunday.  Busy drinkin beer at the beach.  Busy enjoying the sunshine.    And then on Monday i was busy again.  Writing another song.  This one will have to be explained thoroughly, though, because it has to be  exactly  the way it is in my head.  It's complicated and has a couple of extreme tempo changes in it. Words are only vague right now, but the music is all there.  Jeff is going to kill me because of the timing changes. And Nick is going to because...  GASP  there is no guitar solo in it. Oh yeah.  and its rather longish.

Pril, we shoulda just went to see the F/S guys the other night or something instead, since gussies was so lame....please forgive me for temporary loss of sanity-well, temporary return of self-centeredness, that wasn't cool atall, no wonder you never called me back....

      Have any of you chicks been clothes shopping lately?? I mean  new clothes...I don't do that alot, I'm a thrift store momma, as are the few females I allow near me. But anyways, every once in a while, a girl needs a new pair of pants-not just any pants, but some brand new Levi's ect, something that  fits  nicely....   So what's the deal with the skank~show faded streaks/front thigh wrinkles...I especially  hate the ass fade-horshoe thing. I think that if I wanted to look like a bulimic party orifice, I would, well,  be  one.   heh heh heh...strike one 'gainst the Bimbi...well, look out you over-maintained pretentios 'ho's, cause I saw something that will chill your little artificial hearts. . .    Out of desperation, I ventured over to the, well, call it the minivan mom section, I guess, in hopes of escaping the slutfade.  Guess what? Thats right, it's finally been long enough that They're starting to don slutfade wear too.  And  the dangly scarfy belts etc...I'm really pissed about the belts, cause I've always worn those, I like the look, but now I must abstain, as the party ho's have appropriated it....Owell.  The minivan moms will swiftly make them uncool again. Then it's just a matter of time, so hold on to your belts out there O wimmen of class! Well, at last I scored a skirt y'all should dig, with minimum fades on it (its a long denim fitted thing) that I may or may not dye over.  Nick likes it the way it is...........(.!!dudes!!)  But then again, he likes me the way I is, so there's no question he has impeccable judgement! That's the end of the latest adventure, see y'all around!!!!!

      ah, well, it seems i have unleashed a sort of monster.  No prob.    We  can  say "Powers" in one syllable.  "Pee".  as in, "I'm going to Pee this weekend, would you like to join me?" Should we go bother the Timberline about playing there? I'd like to have another one of those tomato things they have.  It may have to wait till after the 15th tho.  (*smacks head against wall repeatedly*). Wanna go to Bald Knob and see some snoooooooow!   We will have more fascinating pictures when we can corral some poor schmuck to take them, while we are all in the same place.  Some will be gotten on   Valentine's Day  when we play with the Densmores, of course.  (That's 2/14, folks, at Roger's Zoo again, in beautiful downtown North Bend)  and more will be taken    The Day After  (that'd be the 15th, for those of you with swiss cheese where your noodle should be, like me) when we grace the Free Souls with our presence again.  At 8 PM.  At the clubhouse.  Next to the boat.    Pass some of those fliers for the Free Souls gig out to your friends, mmmkay? Don't go posting them all over town, cos it is what it is... .  And i'll get the List List out probably this week sometime.

      Helllll~O Home Slice (s) !!!!  I am now the proud owner of a sophomoric attitude, cause of my recent return to higher education. I also have some new vocabulary for evryone....it's my 'efficiency lingo' Kout!         (look out) Gway!        (self explanatory) Scroff!          (screw off!!) Doon?           (what are you doing, what the hell do you think your doing ect) I think that most things worth saying can be compressed into one syllable.  Like that wonderful town, Powers-aka 'Magical Powers', as Pril, Steven and I like to call it....anyways, we should all aspire to say Powers in one syllable. That's all it deserves heh heh heh. Damn it to hell, when are we going to have more fascinating pictures of ourselves in here? (well, namely, pics of  me  cause I just don't feel that Christmassy anymore.)  I kind of want to bite a bats head off or something...but in a good way...that pretty much describes mah mood as of late. Speaking of moods, Luscious Nick has composed an instrumental entitled 'Tammi's moods'....it's kind of a strange peice, and I'm still debating resenting it...well, y'all, that's about it for now. BYe, and I'll miss you!

      well, we flyered our asses off (ooh and got BUSTED for it, but the buck was skillfully passed, so its ok). we told myriad people.  we were early and got soundchecked early.  the only problem was that april was DOG-SICK and had a terrific case of CRS most of the night (i was just completely not able to concentrate.  All i could think of was "i feel like my head is full of blown fiberglass insulation and i hope this blob of snot can stay in my nose for another minute and a half"), but the show went pretty well.  The turnout wasn't as high as we'd hoped it would be, and i think that was just because a lot of people stayed home and watched the war.    That's weird, isn't it? I certainly wouldn't have wanted to be watching the war if there was live music and good times to be had.    So, thanks again to the fine guys at the local chapter of the Free Souls! And thanks to everyone who showed up for showing up!

       Note to those searching for  Gluttn  :   I have not found a web address for them yet.  Dave says they don't have one.  They have a demo CD done, but haven't played anywhere in months, that i know of and Dave says they have no upcoming gigs. Pat is back playing with Dammit Jim, and I saw Pat about two weeks ago.   So, there's your Gluttn info that i know.  _____  ML update: Nick's Rivera crapped out on him.  He's in the process of getting it repaired.  Until then, we're not really doing anything.  In the meantime, Djeef and I chomp at the bit, and try to figure out some way to keep our own chops up, since the practice space is off limits for now and we have no where else to practice.  (Well, i suppose if i got off my butt and cleared out my back room, we would).    I've got three songs in various stages of being written.

      I think we're going to start playing again.  Yay!   Nick & Tam are gonna die when they hear the 100-pound EFX unit.  Except for the nasty hum on it...  Oh yes, did i tell you about the EFX box?   A friend of mine gave me a Yamaha G50 4 x 10 guitar amp.  Something is wrong with it that it doesn't put out as much sound as it should, and it has a nasty hum to it.  So i ended up running it between my bass and my bass amp. The Yamaha has some tone controls that the Peavey doesn't- reverb, trem, distortion and some more fiddly knobs i'm still messing with.  It also has  just enough  oomph to really boost the Peavey, so i don't have to drive the bass amp so hard to be heard over Jeff and Nick, now.    The Yamaha is rated at 120 watts, and i think i'm only getting about half that out of it.  So, now, in total, I'm pushing 130 watts.  If i ever fix it, i'll be just over 200.   There's just this problem of the hum in it, now.    But here's the best part: I can get the Jack Bruce tone without the Jack Bruce mod on the bass, now.  *yeeeee*! (stimpyface)  ********  Also saw Ea$y Money last night.  Boy, have THEY tightened up!

      Harborside, the ISP I am with, had some sort of problem last night and I lost TONS of stuff in my remote directory.  This included probably half of the pictures.  Since the band page isn't hosted on Harborside, it's still up, but all the peripheral pages that were attached to it are... *poof*... El Gone.   To anyone from AB: if you get a red x on something i'm hosting for you, lemme know at the band email address and i'll get it back up and give you the new url for it.   Everything is on my computer, so it's just a matter of getting it all uploaded again and into their directories.    everyone else, well, just be patient :) Tschao!

      Hi everyone! Well, I must settle into the uncomfortable task of eating my words: I thoroughly enjoyed Chris's new band the Reindawgs at...yes, you guessed it, Gussies...on both friday and saturday this weekend, so I was Way off. sorry gussies!  Sometimes I'm a jackass...that's one of my endearing traits tho. So those guys are playing the   magical  Powers Tav on white cedar days...load up the camper and go party and check em out! Nick's working in Portland for a few days, getting everything ready for the Warp tour..wish we were playing it...we'll get some all access passes tho...so he left friday, and i had a good ole time fri and sat, but i woke up this morning Lonesome!!  I was supposed to wait till the fourth, but i'm gonna jam up there today, cuz i   gotta  see him or perish. so i'll catch y'all later!!!

      We're not dead.  Really. I swear.    In fact, we'll be rockin Florence this weekend at... um.. the Bay Bridge Steakhouse, i believe its called, at 1150 Bay St.  That's in Old Town Florence, on the water front, right near the bridge.    So if you're so unfortunate as to have nothing else to do this weekend, come on up and watch us tear something up.    Friday & Saturday night, 9 to 2.  Be there or be elsewhere.

      I'm terrible.  Sometime in July, i got an email from a local guy in a band who wanted to be added to the links over to the right, there --->  Since we hadn't been doing much, due to the CURSED OLCC's new ruling on underage entertainers, i hadn't checked the band's email much.  So, i did today, and now i will add a link to the page of local band,  urlLink Malishous Mentality.  I guess they are going by Undertaken, now? Straighten me out, Luke.  Is that Anthony the same Anthony that played in the band with Nick and Ethan? Brother Abe, wasn't it?   Thanks, Luke! If i see you guys playin around, i'll be sure to drop by! Keep in touch, too.  I promise i'll be better about checking that email address :P

      First i wanna thank all the intrepid souls who braved the weather to go to the gig in Coquille.  You Rock n Roll party pigs on pizza, you.    Then i'm gonna tell you that i think we have a couple of dates coming in january, (and we will be playing some new stuff for these, i think).

      Last Sunday the band lost one of its biggest fans.  He was in a bike wreck while we were playing that Saturday night, and he didn't make it.    Fred- This weekend's for you.  I'll have a shot of BV on the amp for ya.  We'll all miss you.  And who will i dance with, now?

      no really, i want to do a family night with the band at the skate rink.  Two band members have kids, and most of our friends and frenzied fans do, too. So, while we wouldn't get to play, we could all hang out and have SODA AND PIE.  I hope no bad people come.    I'm slowly putting that together.... so be patient.     Upcoming gigs:  In  lurvely  Winchester Bay at the Oasis. Directions are thusly- go north on 101 from Coos Bay.  Pass Hauser. Pass Lakeside.  Pass the Umpqua light house.  Ok slow down because there's a speed trap in another quarter mile.  You need to anyway, because if you go too fast, you'll blow right through Winchester Bay and never even know it.  Once you're in Winchester Bay, make a left.  Any left.  I think there are two.  The northernmost left is the one you really should take, though.  Once again, go slow, because you won't see the Oasis if you're going toooo fast.  If you can't find it, pull over and listen.  Follow the din.    Anyway, that's  March 6.   That's a Saturday. We're on from 9 to 2 or 2:30 or so.

      well, DAMM. Blogger finally let me back.  I couldn't get the login page loaded for weeks! Pah.     As of yet, no shows are planned for Feb.    But January went fantastic! Boy, the one weekend we did play, we had a nice-sized crowd.  Thanks everyone who showed up! That's: People from Wal-Mart, ACS, fans of Pril's blog,  folks from the Cap'ns Cabin, folks from Everywhere! That was so cool and we all really dug it- which you may have been able to tell if you were there.  The more people, the spazzier we are.   Everyone seems to adore the new songs we came out with. Hope we get that same sort of reception when we finally roll out one of ours. I know- i've been going on about these so-called originals for a while, but i think the time has finally come that there's some seriousness about it.    heeey- in March or April, the band will have been together for two years. That's pretty cool.  I think we should celebrate it somehow.  maybe a party at the skate rink! rofl

      Alright, well, the Oasis is a rockin little place.  Had a good time.  You people need to stay the hell off the stage though if you're going to be pulling your pants down, mmmkay? You do that outside or something.  I'm not interested.  I'll KICK YOU next time.   And if you have a problem with THAT, we can go outside, and then i'll come back in and play some more bass. Oh yeah, and bring your fat little boyfriend out with you, so i can kick HIS ass too.    Anyway.

      Alright... Happy Humpday! (Um, Wednesday , you sick pervs)   I have not gotten around to fixing the links to the pictures of us, BUT, elsewhere, i have something hidey-like for a lot of the pics that get taken with my camera.    If you go  urlLink  here , you'll get to see a lot of "candid" pics of the band members, some of other bands we're friends with, the flyers for the band, pictures of Coos Bay and North Bend, etc.   It's a catchall for the interesting pictures, so go peep.

      nothing coming up in May that i know of for the band.  However, by the end of this year, i hope to have something done with Ol'  urlLink Beeb  that i've been slowly putting together.  All i need is for ONE of my electric guitars to work and some time with the Lambaster of Locals.  I do believe six songs is enough for an EP type thing?   And.. residents of Lakeside- invest in ear plugs, cos if you bitch to me, i'm just gonna turn it up LOUDER.    Note to everyone else: Stop asking about the fork embedded in my ass cheek.

      Here it is a Wednesday, and we have NEWS.    The 11th and 12th at the Oasis is off.  That's right.  No gig.  Go out and bust the chops of a whiny bitch (of either gender, preferably male) for us.  We hate them even more than ever before.  Losing that one, though, landed us in the best one we could have gotten.  Fourth of July weekend at The Oasis.  That's the 2nd and 3rd of July-the 4th being a Sunday this year and all.  It's a weekend of MANY, MANY happenings up and down the coast, including a festival in just about every single town from Florence to Brookings.    So screw all that and come to Winchester Bay to see us. We got what you need.

       wow Blogger has made some neat little changes.      Coming Up: Not only the  Oasis  in  August (12th & 13th, Winchester Bay ), but we got a slot at the  Coos County Fair  in  Myrtle Point on July 31.  4-5 Pm.   Oh yeah its only an hour... but i'm lookin at it this way.  It's only an hour of the hot, miserable mugginess that MP is this time of year.  It'll be loads of fun! Just prior to us going on there are going to be things like alligators and lizards nearby.  The Little River Band is the headlining band at the fair this year.      Site stuff: When i changed the template i lost all the links that were on it.  So a call to any Coos County bands who come across this place to drop a note at manifestlistATmusicianDOTorg with your link.  I'll see about finding as many as i can.        Ooh, am i getting nutty with the bold or what? tee hee.

      Two things:   Site's gonna change looks      and   We are gonna be back at the Oasis in Winchester Bay on August 13 and 14.  Bring your lucky charms.  Follow the bass player home, and watch as she gets pulled over. For the 8th time this year.  Indeed.  No ... really... we have found if someone pulls over with me, the cops let me go.  Why do they pull me over? We don't know.  Shits and giggles on the part of law enforcement, i suppose.

      It was only warm, but muggy.  Of course it was 20 degrees hotter on the stage we were on than anywhere else.  Of course, no one had even the vaguest idea of which stage we were supposed to go to or where it was.  (not just band members.... FAIR STAFF).  Of course the first thing i did upon arrival and unloading was SMASH THE SHIT out of one of my fretting fingers.  Of course that still hurts like a mofo.  Um and we were pretty damn good i gotta say.   Oh and clickie clickie on my profile over by the contributors thingay, cos there's a really freakin rad picture of me there.  I mean, pictures of me this good roll around once a century.  Damn i look good.

      A dozen years or so of cultural flimflam passed me right by.  I sometimes feel like Death must have when he went for a visit. I don't relate with most pop culture unless it has something to do with music.   Speaking of Death.... there's something very strange about Death being a virgin.   You can call me... RumpelPRILskin.

      ok.  Blastin the Posies and the Toadies for a shot of "aaarrgh" for this afternoon.  Got Xtra Super Strong coffee on (and steaming down my gullet).  Preparations for fried egg sammiches on toast, with toast on the side, are underway.  I have my clothes laid out.  My hair is a fine  scarlet.   I got some sleep.  Bass is ready to go.  Tuner:  Check.  Drums  are  ready to go.  Amp is not yet unplugged.   I'm not nearly half this freakish when we play.  I have no idea why this one-hour show at the county fair has me all wound up.   but   I'm Ready To Rock.

      Yesterday I was subjected to propaganda.  How To Sell Crap type propaganda.  Or, it could have been any speech by any politician.  Any idiot on the phone who i did not ask to call me.   There are proven methods to selling your stuff, your ideas, your platform, your self.  They are interchangeable.  You consider yourself a savvy shopper? Look what else you're buying.  Look what other slop you're happily eating.  You bought it.  It's crap.  You like it anyway.  You like it because it's cool to like it.  It doesn't matter if it tastes like cardboard and looks like reconstituted bloodmeal worms, everyone else says it's good so you eat it.  You pishpaw the peer pressure and your peers are all drinking the same lukewarm swill as you.  You can never escape it, and you will never escape it.  "Better than them" is an addiction and you're the hype.   We will always be around to sell you things you don't need, and we can always convince you to buy them because you NEED them.  Everyone else does, and if they aren't buying it too, they just don't know any better.

      I'm talking about YOU.  With the out of state plates.  Driving your house around.      You may have noticed as you entered the state, BIG GREEN SIGNS that say you are to stay in the right lane unless you're passing.  Ignore this at your peril.  You make me pass on the right, I'll dig around behind my seat and find something, some slimy thing or some big thing, and throw it at YOUR LAME ASS as I speed past you.      Thank you.

      I was never really a drooling Bratt Pitt fan, but i gotta say, "Meet Joe Black" might have turned me into one.      I think perhaps *TALVK would have suited the part well, too.            *The Always Luscious Val Kilmer

      Ok well it's been like a month since Nth of Pril went down the tubes.  In the meantime, i've been entertaining myself til it hurts.         Tam and i have spent a total of about 12 hours in the luxury yacht. (that's canoe to you city folks).  It shows.           I missed the cardboard boat races.  Was just too lazy to go outside.           It got warmish here. Some might say hot, but the worst part wasn't the hot, it was the humid.  Then we got slapped with hurricane force winds.  Typical.           Tam and I invented and worked on a setlist for our new project, T&A Productions Co, Inc, LLC, Etc.  A veritable entertainment conglomerate. You'll see.           The Wyrd one and I have plotted and schemed, but the world is still not our oyster.  Don't worry, you'll soon be on the BBQ, floating in butter-garlic-tobasco-parmesan sauce.              Greatest garage sale find in years...   "Asterix bei der Schweizen" .  For a dollah! For Dale and I, reading this is like being five years old and being given a big book full of big words.  We both excelled at German in high school, but having not used it regularly in a good 10 years or so, even a basic comic book is a slog.  Good stuff, though.

       It's really just too bad they can't decriminalize pot for the months leading up to the election.      1. Stunts gag reflexes, making it possible to vote without vomiting all over the booth.    2. Feeling of well-being, to offset the feeling that no matter who you vote for, you're just screwed.  3. Removes any bits of guilt that might be left over after voting with your concience instead of your party.   4. Makes you hungry, and able to order "Potatoes prepared in the Belgian manner" with a straight face.

      oh did i mention yet that i watched part of the DNC on the tee-vee tonight? It was all "blah blah blah John Kerry blah blah". Just like that Far Side cartoon about what you say to your dog vs. what your dog hears.      Of course, i'm sure the RNC will be similar, except it'll be "Blah blah blah George Bush blah blah".      And all the people will look, or did look, like they are expectantly waiting for the sacred Kool-Aid.      My questions:   Will Jesse Jackson ever learn how to speak?  Will Hillary ever speak in a manner less than completely condescending?   What's with the goofy hats?

      Not too long ago my little spot, Nth of Pril, simply disappeared.  It was slightly more complicated than that, but that's all anyone needs to know.      So this weirdo i know, she and i cooked up this plan for this thing you're staring at.  There may or may not be the old usually incoherent rants emanating from this little corner of the round room.  It depends on how busted we get for mentioning one of the myriad ways we manage to avoid time clocks, dress codes, middle management, service industries,  lunch breaks, 10 minute rest breaks, bosses staring over our shoulders, piss tests and people screaming about deadlines.  Yeah, you know, at some point, you just look at that crap and go, "Screw this".      That'd be my introduction. Or, reintroduction, as the case may be.   But wait! There's more! I also play bass in  urlLink this band .  And I spend a lot of time typing, mostly off line.

      well isnt that the most disgusting irony.  The only ads i ever see in the adbox are for the  pink people.     Only one thing needs to be said... AVON has over a hundred shades of lipstick.  The  pink people  do not.  Can you buy toys through the  pink people ? NOOOoooOOOO.  Can you buy diecast models of Elvis' favorite cars from the  pink people ?! NoOoOoO.  Can you buy 1:24 diecast classic Harleys? NASCAR slippers? Popeye watches? NOOOOO! Do the  pink people  have things for dudes? Of course not.   Would you rather aim for oooh... one of three cars chosen by the company of  pink people , or would you rather aim for... an $800/month car allowance?  With which you can buy..  pretty much whatever freakin car you please!    I rest my case!

      Went and hung out with my beauty parlor friend.  I gave her pretty stuff and she trimmed my hair for free.  I told her she could sell for me if it behooved her.  You could tell she was thinking about it but then she says, no, you get to do it.  So I have my own lovely shelf and managed to hand out a few brochures to customers who asked for them.  She put neat stuff in my hair.  I'm goin to her reception Sunday, a party of course.  A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.

      As i await the arrival of one of my custies to collect her order, i'm sitting with my bass and engaging in some eye-candy watching.  Saw 12 monkeys last night.  Rather frustrating ending. I was all up in arms about it.  A Terry Gilliam movie, so of course it was totally weird.   The local video store does not have True Romance.  I was disappointed.  Even more disappointed that the hipster at the counter, Mr. Tarantino fan, had no idea it existed, and was looking in the Romance section for it.  I'm all.. Dude... i'm pretty sure its not a romance, it being by Tarantino and all.  I must see the movie though, because i have not yet.   Recently someone said they weren't into things like Mary Kay and AVON parties.  Au contraire, mon sorore! (Um yeah i suck at french!).  MY AVON parties would be.. orgies of tasty beer (as opposed to swill), the slathering of many lotions and pampering of tootsies, with some nice looking dude with a perty mouth on the Tee-Vee.  Wait a sec.  That's what my mom's product parties are like, and she's a Passion Party consultant.   Well, so mote it be... i'm a 21st century AVON lady after all.

      You think George Bush is evil? You maybe think John Kerry is evil?  You're wrong. WRONG WRONG WRONG.   I know evil.  She's my AVON upline, and the other contributor.  Never have i met a woman so deserving of my admiration in the manipulative arts.  I love a girl with a gun in her hand and a party on her mind.

      well, not really.  Just dusting off the furniture at the  urlLink old place  and there you can once again experience the pril who is not acting.  Because, yes, i am an  AVON INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVE (!!), it's like... a part. And i'm in a movie, see. Like the whole rock star thing- that's another part. And also the good wife... another character role.

       Ms Exec. Leader Upline person called today and relayed the following info:    Item #1:  When advertising,  ANYTHING , paper, sign, window decal, one must always put AVON Independent Sales Rep. Always.  Item #2:  One can sell in one's own business, flea market table, etc., but not in another's business. She herself has been setting up at local flea markets.   Item #3:  Very happy we have circled all the bases with our wagons, in our AVON takeover of the planet. Mostest happiest because we were the bestest girls to our DM.  Pril, tomorrow scares me. Be my clone and take the kids to the dentist for me?

      I'm a rooster.  I can't help it. I was born in the year of the Rooster.  I tend more toward the masculine descriptions of Roosters than the feminine, too. I only say this because i keep opening up the picture of me thats on my profile and cackling with glee at it because i like it so much.  You could call this being an egotist or something similar, and you'd probably be right.  But hey, when you go through 34 years with only probably one really great picture of you once every three years, (although i think this year i've had two...) you really dig it when there's a good one.  Some lucky jerks are so photogenic that nearly every shot of them is fantastic.  They will never know the feeling of "Good Lord, i had no idea i was so good looking.  Must be the light or something. "  I can't stop looking at myself.  It's insane.   When i was about 4 my mom took me to Sears for some portraits.  Gramma was with us.  Gramma was appalled because i was dirty.  Typically dirty, for me. I was a filthy little child.  So there was this series of pictures taken of me, with my always bad hair and some smears of dirt under my nose.  My mom likes to say, "It's you.  You weren't a clean kid, and we could never keep you clean.  You were happiest in mud. If you had been clean in the picture, it wouldn't have properly reflected you at that time."    And so i will leave you with this, seen on a sign around town:   "Be yourself" is bad advice to give some people.

      Another case i remember being bombarded with when i was growing up, this one while i was in middle school.  The Laurel Canyon murders as they were known at the time, The Wonderland murders as they seem to have morphed into.  I was about 11... i had no idea who John Holmes was, y'know? "Adult film star" didn't have much meaning, either.   I watched Wonderland last night.  Ok i rented it cos it's a Val Kilmer movie! So kill me.  But it was trippy.  He did a good job as a lying, sniveling piece of shit basefiend.  And i've known enough of them in my time to know exactly what sort of subhumans they are.  Which brings an interesting thing up.  At times in the movie, you feel profoundly sorry for the Holmes character.  I mean, you go, "jeez, dude, if you could only see yourself".  Other times, you wonder how someone like that managed to stay alive long enough to be such a sheister.  You could kill him yourself for showing his weasely face.   So now i have a little more understanding of that particular LA murder case, and the Onion Field one.  I have no real desire to learn anything more about the OJ one.   My homesickness seems to manifest itself by the need to watch movies filmed in or about Los Angeles and the psychos, freaks and weirdness that have inhabited its landscape for the past 100 years.   Someday, i'll get back there.  Til then i continue my love/hate relationship with it from Oregon.

      i've had this song stuck in my head all day. I've had the Jane's Addiction version stuck. I'm listenin to it right now, too...  ARTIST: Rolling Stones TITLE: Sympathy for the Devil    Yow! Yow! Yow!  Please allow me to introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste I've been around for a long, long year Stole many a man's soul and faith  And I was 'round when Jesus Christ Had His moment of doubt and pain Made damn sure that Pilate Washed his hands and sealed His fate  {Refrain} Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game  Stuck around St. Petersberg When I saw it was a time for a change Killed the Czar and his ministers Anastasia screamed in vain I rode a tank, held a general's rank When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank  {Refrain}  I watched the gleam while your kings and queens   Ooh ooh, ooh ooh Fought for ten decades for the Gods they made   Ooh ooh, ooh ooh I shouted out, who killed the Kennedys   Ooh ooh, ooh ooh When after all, it was you and me   Ooh ooh, ooh ooh  {Ooh ooh's continue throughout}  Let me please introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste And I lay traps for troubadors Who get killed before they reached Bombay  {Refrain}  Oh yeah, get down, hit it  Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah But what's confusing you is just the nature of my game  Just as every cop is a criminal And all the sinners saints As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer 'Cause I'm in need of some restraint  So if you meet me, have some courtesy Have some sympathy, and some taste Use all your well learned politesse Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah  {Refrain}  Mm mean it, get down  Tell me baby, what's my name Tell me honey, can you guess my name Tell me baby, what's my name I tell you one time, you're to blame  Ooh hoo, ooh hoo, ooh hoo, all right What's my name Tell me, baby, what's my name Tell me, sweetie, what's my name Ooh hoo, ooh hoo, ooh hoo, all right

      i'm very happy to say that the bohunk town i live in does  not  have a Starbuck's.   Blasphemy! I hear from the ranks of the urban cool.   Fuck that.   I've had the stuff.   We are not impressed.   Besides, there are a lot of local people who have little 'spresso drive-thrus, and i'll happily continue to take my money there, if a Starbuck's should ever appear locally.  Last time Dale and i were in Los Angeles, we counted Starbucks on PCH/Katella between Long Beach and Disneyland. Some 25 of them. Overkill? You decide.

      Check out that Life in Armenia link. Very cool one. There's another one here that makes me wish i could read Farsi, just so i could see what it says.   I've been invited to tell the tale of how and why i joined TCFX on a guitar players site, Guitarnoise.com. That's a great site, though, so check it out.   TCFX stands for Too Cool For Chris. Chris was the main thing keeping me from joining these guys a year ago. It started because there is this maroon 84 Camaro roaming around town, with pink and sky blue pinstripes, and its so cheesy looking, and on the rear spoiler fin it says "Too Cool 4 U" or something. I freakin laugh every time i see it. Prime example of the Oregon genus of Dorkus Maximus. Somehow, though, Tam and i thought it was a killer band name.   TC4X?   We're going to do Fortunate Son. Its been an obsession of mine ever since i started playing music, that some day i would be in a band and we would do Fortunate Son. the irony would be lost if there was a male singer. We have a female singer. And on top of that, the song just seems to fit the times. Kinda like, just after we started bombing Afghanistan, we jammed on Universal Soldier up at the tavern one night.   Never understood the "need" to play a certain song. My friend Mike (now Mike Odd of Rosemary's Billygoat) was obsessed with playing "Earache My Eye" when we were in High School. He got to, on his first album "Pizza of Doom". Check them out. But anyway, i understand now.

      Is it me, or is there a ton of self-concious soul-searching going on in blogs? Damn. I already did all that. I'm the weird one again.  I wrote this song, probably another of my terrible bits, about the 11th. I've showed it to people. They like it. It's only lyrics. I know how i want it to sound. I don't know what the chords in my head are called, though. I hate that. I think i'm getting to where i can stand looking at the thing again, and maybe do some work on it.   anyway its always really funny when i sing with Beeb. I love art. Entertainment is an art. I never thought i was any good at, and still sort of question the whole thing, but people dig what i do, even my singing, and i'm certainly not going to take them down for their taste, or lack of it, or whatever. The new band makes me sing a bit.. gawd i'm so bad at singing, too.. you can't even imagine.   For now, until a real name is decided on, i'm going to stop calling the new band 'the new band' and call them TCFX. They don't have to know. they can't decide on a freakin name themselves.   i have a picture online somewhere of the band. before i joined up.

      oodles of folk have these, so here's my concession to the madness-            Celeborn   If I were a character in   The Lord of the Rings  , I would be Celeborn, Elf, King of Lothlorien, husband of Galadriel and grandfather of Arwen.  In the movie, I am played by  Marton Csokas .  Who would  you  be?   Zovakware Lord of the Rings Test      with  Perseus Web Survey Software           A sun shiney day outside. Like a Partridge Family sun shiney kinda day. C'mon, get happy!   Mostly a collective shrug of the shoulders at most of the names i wrote down. Almost a whole page! Extreme disinterest in Vaporlock as a band name. I hate not having one, though. Might have to use Too Cool for X anyway.   Yay i finally got another printer cartridge, so now i can print the flyers and entry forms for the regatta thing, print out the lyrics and tab for some of the songs we do.. gotta have the lyrics, i need that point of reference.  i think today i'll hole up and play my bass and violin for a bit. Nick wants to play the greenie sometime, so i'll drop it off down there one day when we practice.   I'm a pretty uninteresting person. I just play my bass and i'm married. I live in a town next to another town with a combined population of just around 25,000 people. Sometimes i hate it. Sometimes i can't imagine leaving it. I have an ocean, dunes, mountains, a river, a wild river, forests- all mine to play in. Well, not really, but you know what i mean.  I wish i could canoe more than i get to.   Last time i canoed, we pulled the thing off the truck too fast and lost it (caught it again before it hit the ground and busted up, though) and sheared off the mirror on the driver's side. Damn dealership wants $55 for a new one! So i found one on ebay and got it for $36. Deal.   Sometimes i read the paper and wonder what the hell is going on, and when, if ever, is it going to stop. What are we, dumbasses?

      Yay got to spend time with Dale today. He got his A+ certification in the mail today, so we went out and got a nice frame for it. So damn cool.   Last night's jam at the tavern was particularly awful. I just couldn't pull it together. But some other people showed up, and they were great. I took our drummer up there (drummer from the new band) cos the dude just needs to get out of the house more than he does and he got good and trashed, and got to play drums all night because the other drummer wasn't there. Nubs was late, because he didn't realize anyone was going to play, and when he walked in, EVERYONE clapped, so i'm sure that shocked the shit out of him.   What else.   Two in the new band agree that Vaporlock is a good band name. we have to run it by the rest and see if it flies.   I got pictures back from my trip to St. Augustine. hehehe. yikes. But they're family pics, and we never get those because we all live all over the country.

      Great! My third shot at this, and i think it may finally prove satisfactory.   Here is my first ever Blogger post.  Nothing really on my mind today. I've had sort of a whirlwind week, I guess. Working, practicing with the new band, playing with the old band, bouncing ideas around for the First Annual Mighty Millicoma River Regatta coming up in August, trying to sleep, trying to stay awake, forgetting to do necessary things like return a borrowed CD and entering transactions in Quicken. Willfully neglecting doing my taxes, since i will again have to pay an insane amount of money to a government i didn't vote for, don't approve of.. etc. Regarding that whole mess, and what else could you possibly call it, i can only quote Johnny Rotten- "Did you ever get the feeling you've been cheated?".   I've been listening to a terrific rap song that came out in the early 90s lately. By the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, this particular song appeared on an Alternative Tentacles Compilation of Dead Kennedy's songs. DHoH covered "California Uber Alles", and man, it's wonderfully scathing. It came out around the time Pete Wilson was running, or pondering running, for President. I was living in Los Angeles for awhile before this, having returned home from Nashville in 1992 (or was it '91? Hard to remember, i only recall events, not necessarily dates), one day after the Big Riot.I stayed for a year before heading to Arizona, where another good year or so passed before i heard this song. I never liked Governor Wilson, and i was appalled that he would make the run for prez.   I have an assortment of adventures to write about, and a plethora of opinions to spout, and a large selection of oddball tidbits i throw in occasionally.  I started keeping on online journal sometime in 1998. It has mostly been removed, and redone, and this would be the latest incarnation of it. So, enjoy. Or don't.

      no really, i'm going to bed now.  If you should happen to drop in, go past the stupid quiz things. I was bored today. There might actually be something interesting to look at. Who knows. i wanna see some new stuff on my site meter thingie, dangit.   there is a woman, up at the tavern.. we'll call her poof. She likes to tell stories. The one i heard today, from someone else, i also heard come out of her mouth, and its a funny one.  Because i'm directly involved and it's completely a lie.   last year i drove my band members (before they were my band members, when neurotic chris was still in the band) up to the tavern in a borrowed limo. I gave this poof person a ride in the limo while the band was playing. Then she goes and tells everyone that she knows stephen king, and it was his limo, and he was in it that night. What the? I go up there all the time.. she's telling people this, and its getting back to me, and i'm fuckin rollin about it.. YEAH!  i should ask her how ol' stephen is doing. then we should borrow the limo again. rofl.

      i still have not totally recovered from this last weekend. Canoeing this coming one, on the high tide, around 4, so that will give me a chance to do stuff i need to beforehand, and maybe get some stretching in, else i'll feel like the truck-slamming victim again. Its usually fairly easy to canoe, but we haven't gone upriver yet. The last few times its been downriver, with the tide. Or at slack. This time, we need to get the canoe upriver, so we were trying to get a good high tide. This weekend promises a good one. Maybe we'll just go up past the tavern to the store and then back down again. Hell, from the tavern to the place the canoe is at now is 6 road miles.. who knows how many water miles it was, since the river lopes so much.   anyway, this little monkey's going to bed. Weird, since i'm never asleep before 2 anymore.   must....  sleep..

      There are days....  When i wish i lived somewhere else     (But where... by now i know all places are the same) When i can't sit still and can't get no satisfaction    (a hey hey hey) When i need an hour or so just to do nothing    (Something always interrupts us when we're talking so we better draw the stupid line- X) When the boundaries of the county seem to encompass the whole damn world    (And the gas tank is half full, and i want to go  far far far) When i write lyrics, and then i'm surprised at what i've written    (Where did that feeling come from? That must be a leftover from '92) When every person i meet seems to deserve a punch in the face    (Really. I think some people just need to be smacked occasionally) When my body doesn't fit me, seems to belong to someone else    (It was never mine to begin with)

      wow man. great weekend. I'm really sore today. I missed canoeing. I had to wait around for the other band members to get their shit together. i hate waiting. i hate when people make me wait around. They're my friends and all, but i really don't have the time or the inclincation to stand around while everyone else fucks off. There is nothing in the world that will set me on a slow boil like being told "I'll be there at ____" and then having to wait around for them. In most cases, i'll just leave. But often,  someone has to be at some place to deal with something while the other people are out fucking off. like today.. the tavern where our stuff was opened at 3. the owner had to run to town before then. Jeff and i were there and had our crap loaded and ready to go by noon. Dale needed the truck at 1, and i was supposed to go canoeing at some point today. I didn't want to leave their stuff there, in case they didn't get there before the owner had to leave. But, i think next time, i'm going to just leave and let them do the waiting. Already i had driven 100 miles over this.   another thing is that jeff always has to take the PA. He's tired of it. I'm sick of it. There just isn't room in my truck for Jeff, the PA mixer, the PA amp, my bass.  I have a two-seater toyota. With bucket seats. Nick and Tammi go around in a truck with a bench seat and he has a case for his guitar. Since Tammi sings, and we haul the speakers around, i think they are going to have to take the freakin mixer, at least. I aint taking it anymore. I can't shift right when jeffs leg is crammed against the bass which is crammed against the shifter.    when we left, we left the PA stuff there, except for the speakers. Jeff felt he had to tell them why. I was like, fuck it, dude, all they have to do is look in my truck. I'll take tammi in the truck one time and she can hold the PA and mixer.   I have a minimum of equipment to drag around. i take jeff, his drums, and whatever else. i take my own shit and carry my own shit and hook my own shit up. All i want is a little consideration.

She was going to bring me a viking hat with horns but couldn't get them into her suitcase. SO, i got other cool stuff. A shirt from a Harley shop in Puerto Vallarta.. its white with freakin orange flames and stuff, and some skulls.  also got a silver ring with 3 skulls on it, and   AND  the crowning, best gift of all..  A little Dia del Los Muertos figure, sitting at a typewriter, with blue hair. Its MEEEEE!

      Diaz Ano  My spanish, while existent, is horrible. But here, almost ten years...   I got the last set of tires on a Chevy Suburban around 3:30, and cleaned up the bays, clocked out. Here in Nashville, it was 2 hours ahead of the West Coast. I walked home. I must have got in around 7 or so. I was pretty happy. A long year of this and i was sick of it, ready to go back home, feeling defeated. Pearl Jam was just making it BIG. Ren and Stimpy were on MTV. I missed all my friends. Greg's family was just too damn demented for me. My plane was leaving the next day. Greg's feelings were hurt. Mine were so inflamed, yet numb, that i didn't care anymore what he felt.      I finally got home.  I don't remember if anyone was there or not. There was nothing to eat, and i had no money. So i flipped the TV on. There was fire everywhere. FIRE. on every channel. What the hell? There, a building recognized, a vista of mountains, the brown sky tinged with black smoke.. What the hell? This was my home... It was on fire. I was going home to an inferno.    That was 4/29/92. Almost a decade ago.. in a few more days it will reach that milestone. That's what i saw of it the day before i left Nashville. People were surprised i was still going home. I said to them, "Say you were in maybe Minnesota, and something like this blew up here, would you go home anyway?" They all answered yes. I just shrugged. The image of the guy being pulled out of his truck is forever burned in my head. I can't tell you how many times i had driven through that very intersection, going to hollywood the long way. RIGHT THERE.   There was a stop in Phoenix, because there was too much smoke for my plane to head on to LA. I was flat broke. I was starving. I had one cigarette. I looked outside the window at Sky Harbor at the desolation of Phoenix and wondered who the hell would want to live there (I didn't, but i ended up doing so almost exactly a year later).  Flying into LA, we flew over the freeways downtown, as planes do. To my surprise, not a single car was on the road. I wasn't sure what i was expecting. This was in the middle of the day, on  Saturday, i think. Not one single car on the freeway. I wondered if my friends were going to be able to meet me.   They did, but it took them forever to get there and we didn't find each other right away. Hanging out with them on the way home, life had the appearance of normalcy, for that 45 minutes. The destruction didn't touch where we were going.. ooh, no..   But i divide my life by that date. There is "before the riot" and "after the riot" as far as where i went, how i felt, and how i looked at LA. I'd never been scared in Los Angeles. My friends and i went places together i wouldn't dream of now, and i think "Damn, we were brave or stupid".  Two weeks after i had been home, we were robbed at gun point in an area we had previously been safe in. That never happened to me before. My friends bought guns and took self defense classes, they got scrips for things like valium. I just kept on going as i always had. Things happen, right? You deal, you move on... Well, sort of.. I just drank harder. I did more drugs.   Los Angeles is in my blood, in my bones, literally. Word has it if you lived there for more than 10 years, especially through the 60s and/0r 70s, you have deposits of lead in your bones from the air. So, i carry that around with me. I've never been able to explain why i love the place. I was dying to get out, but i miss it so much. When i go to visit, it feels good to be back. After a little while back, i'm dyin to leave again. I feel like silly putty or something. Pulled in different directions about it.  There is a lot being said about LA in the papers this week, how it has done since then. I will tell you, though, that nothing has changed. Those riots, the fires, could happen again at any time. They just need a spark. There's plenty of fuel. Anyone who tells you different is fooling themselves.

      Criminy  Dunno why i say that. I just think, sometimes, Criminy.   I didn' t do the usual jam up at Mary's tonight. i was soooo beat. I just couldn't have stayed up for it.   This morning i have to make a bunch of phone calls and straighten out some evil bills, and start paying them again, and get caught up on some others.   I want a new 4runner. I don't want an automatic transmission with it. C'mon.. it's a 187-HP V6. Mostly gutless. At least a 5-speed would give it some balls. Of course, this coming from someone whos first car had just under 300 HP. That one had an automatic. I can deal with that. But the Toyota i have now, an 86 4x4 truck, rocks. It has the 22RE (most indestructible engine on the planet, and i'll vouch for that) and a 5-speed, and the thing really moves. I've driven the automatics from the same year.  the lack of power is extremely noticeable. I think the last year they made the manual trannies in 4runners was 2000. i may settle for one, JUST so i can have that transmission, although HP is only 157 for that year. Trade-offs.. trade-offs.. i tell ya what, if i take it off the roads here, i better be able to haul its little ass through muck, sand AND get up over the passes on the I5 with a minumum of effort. I'm sure if i test drive one, the guy who has to ride with me is gonna crap his pants, too. i'd be all mellow through town, but as soon as i hit the dike on the way upriver, he better have his belt strapped on. Good place to test drive a car.. you can check the handling. Would have to crank up that 6-speaker system too and hear it jammin some Big Sugar.   I don't want an SUV just to have an SUV. I have to haul around our drummers crap, and the PA speakers, and the PA amp and the PA mainboard, so i need something that will protect the stuff from the ubiquitous rain here. I ain't havin a minivan. Toyotas rock, so that's my main choice.

      You know, i just have a amateur musician peeve i want to share.  When you don't have a band, often desperately want to just PLAY with other people and have fun at it. This is why we have jams and jam nights. So everyone can get up onstage and have a blast. So, actually this may be a short list of peeves, but here goes.  1. When the person you are called up to jam with will neither tell you the name of the song they want to play or what key its in. ONE or THE OTHER is nice. BOTH are great. But it sucks when you just look at me and say oh you'll figure it out. What it does is make you look good, and make me look like shit, because you're too caught up in yourself to be bothered to tell me what you're doing. It's lazy, in that you aren't looking good on your own abilities. You're looking good at my expense. If i walk off stage because i have no idea what i'm doing because you won't tell me, i look like the asshole, i look like the bad player, and i look like i don't know shit. So if any musicians out there recognize yourself in either situation, do something about it.   2. Club owners and Festival organizers- You people are the worst. You ask local talent of all kinds- in the dimensional arts, painters, crafters, chefs, to pay you for a booth to show off their talents. You pay out of town bands room, board, and travel time, on top of for playing. You spout about how important the local arts scene is, but never lift a finger for the ones IN IT. Local musicians get the shaft. We get nothing. You expect us to play free for an hour, and we live here... We aren't doing this to entertain ourselves. Most of us work day jobs, and this is often the little extra money we need to get through a month without stocking up on Top Ramen. We bothered to learn to play these songs, which we may actually hate. We want to see the festivals and clubs be successful, and we love to see the booty movin.. But goddamn, it  RESPECT YOUR LOCAL MUSICIANS! PAY US!   You advertise the best local talent! and then pay out of towners to come?!   anyway, i have to get clean and go practice and make these flyers. Those are my two biggest peeves. The rest of my peeves are directly related to them, so they are only sub-peeves and sub-sub-peeves.   I got a blue shirt at walmart yesterday that has FULL SERVICE on it in orange. eheh. its fugly.

      nah, i'll have a shirt made for her.. with four little bees playing instruments ... a Meat Bees shirt.  what is it with the Meat Bees you might ask? (or might not).  It just sounds funny. So it'll be a shirt for the greatest band that never was.   Nick got a job too! So everyone is employed.. just about. Tam is semi employed. she details cars. the weather hasn't been particularly conducive to that lately, though. So she has a job, but isn't working i guess.

      Tam and i went and saw pam today. Poor kid. She woke up to a Meat Bees sign, though :)   Al had pictures of the truck and the tree and they were gnarly. Transmission parts all over the seat, the transfer case was mashed up into the truck bed.   practice was mediocre. That damn heartbreaker song.. if i don't think while i play it, i get it right on. The Cake song always rocks though.. it gives me chillllls whenever we play it. We just jammed right down the list and when we stopped for a sec, nick was all "oh i can't wait that long to play fortunate son" because it was the last one on the list. hehehehe. So we played it then. We gotta make a set list i think. I'd like to play seek and destroy last because i suck at it so bad.   And that stupid part in Jamie's Cryin. i think once i get my work done i'll just run through the stuff a few times tomorrow.  jeff started his job today so he was all whipped. he's cutting fire trails.   When pam gets out of the hospital i'll have to get her a crazy straw. At least it's when and not if!

      Damn, rough two days. Friend of mine was in a gnarly car wreck on tuesday night. She completely torqued an early 80s full size Ford pickup.  i mean, there's not a scrap of salvageable parts on the truck at all. the engine ended up in the passenger seat.  she shoved the steering wheel up through the window. The EMTs thought she had been carrying an engine block in the bed of the truck.  The truck itself is bent, frame is toast. She's relatively ok, in that she's alive.  She busted herself up pretty damn good though. Of course, she had been drinking. She ran into a tree. I want to tell her if she ever does anything that stupid again, she better hope her number is up, cos i'm gonna kill her myself.

      oh i forgot to mention... the other day at band practice Joe showed up. Joe's a *GREAT* guitar player, really fuckin good...he hung around and watched us practice a few songs and said "you guys rock", and that makes me feel good, cos i really respect his opinion about stuff like that. So i was on air about that for awhile.   Actually, in general i feel much better in this band. I have something to look forward to, we all have a great time. the music we play is great, stuff i always liked, and not the same set list thats been floating around for 7 years.   oh wow, this is cool... reading through yesterday's register guard in the 20 below section there's an article about an interesting music school.  i'll see if i can scare up a link for it

       The band is just fantastic That is really what i think oh by the way which one's pink?   Damn. M list rules. It's incredible. we are an amazing band. Indeed.  Added another song to the list today, Fortunate Son. We listened to it like three times, went downstairs and ripped it out three times. No mistakes. No redos. We just freakin rawk. Not that it's a particularly difficult song or anything, but i'm the only one who listens to it with any frequency and the rest kind of hear it on the radio whenever.  We are going to add another verse to draw it out a bit so people can dance some more to it.   Got some adventures of toast on film last night. i wonder if they are in my email now. i took them on someone elses digital camera. Also decided on doing guerilla pr for the band, for months before we even start playing out, probably. the trick will be getting the paper to print the ads. tee hee.

       i need a picture of toast. like a cartoony, clip-arty, ink drawing type thing. Or something that looks like a woodcut. but it has to be toast, on a small plate, with a pat of steamy butter on it and a bit of maple syrup. i would consider a photograph if it was well-done or used something like panchrome or ektachrome film. Infrared pictures would be excellent. But toast! It's got to be toast. Doesn;t matter what kind.  if you know where to find one use the contact button up there at the top.   we are  manifest list "now, more than ever before"  "Enough vowels, but not too many syllables"   Its redundant.  thats part of its charm. We are all passengers, or cargo. we all have originating points and destinations. like cargo, we may not know our destinations.   best band name in the world was Cargo Cult. i think someone took it, though.

      the blue isn't holding up very well. It was Fudge Paintbox Blue Velvet, and just proves something i've known for awhile. Blue dye doesn't have the stick that red dyes do. So i'm thinkin maybe this weekend of just dying red over the blue and seeing what happens. So much blonde is showing now that there will be purple bits and red bits, i guess.   Sorry about last nights post. I was a little excited from practice, still.  Tonight, my friend Mike's band is playing at the casino. their first gig there.. so i gotta go and check it out before practice. They're all excited. Hell, i would be too!

      Sorry. i simply can't see the "right" in either side of the Israel conflict. I just can't. I've looked at both sides, probably superficially, and it's just insanity, plain and simple.   Any rehabbers, can you recite the definition of insanity for me?   "insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results".   Now. Look at the middle east, and please, someone, tell me that any of that is sane.   Yeah. It really bothers me. Do i have any answers? No, i'm just a lowly american citizen, hated by god, despised by the third world, a tool of (name your evil minority).   Can i say why i can't see either side?   Both sides blatantly disregard their holy writs. God is on our side, my white ass. God hates it, if he's even around to watch the carnage. He's probably gone out for a walk these last 10 billion years, and we keep getting his answering machine. "Your prayer will be answered in the order it was received. Current waiting time is expected to be five thousand years. Thank you for your patience".   When i lived in Arizona, i spent a while, a good long while, living among white power people. I won't say skinheads, because they weren't all skinheads (as all skinheads aren't rascist, not all rascists are skinheads, or even white). What did i get out of that experience? Well, first and foremost, the white power people are just as prone to ridiculous propaganda as anyone else. get past the indoctrination, and they're confused. Losers, really. Anyone who allows themselves to be sucked into belief=fact is a fucking moron. "?" exists for a reason. More people need to excercise their right to "?".   It would be interesting if anyone in my family ever stumbled upon this, because they will probably find out things i never bothered to tell them, and might be shocked, nay, dismayed, at the life i led away from them, as i continue to relay stories of my past, present and at least 30 minutes from now, here.  I got one name for all the confused people in the world. Ram Dass. Another word- That Hindu monkey god.  his name was just in my brain. Hanuman. Yes. Hanuman. If i was a Hindu, i'd be in the cult of Hanuman, or maybe Kali-Durga. But I'm not! I'm NOTHING! No religion, no political party, no special interest group. All i want is some god damn stability. I want the little guy to win, ONCE. I want the Enrons and Dick Cheney's of the world to be shit on, like the little guy. Pay Congress minimum wage. Outlaw soft-money and lobbying. How fast do you think minimum wage would rise if Congress had to live on it? Those fuckers. While i no longer make substandard paychecks, i've been there. It sucks my ass.   EEE  TEE  SEE

And you will be like me- 32, eating green tic tacs at 3:45 am, wishing you were still  a. playing your chosen instrument at band practice b. living wherever it was that you had the most fun c. working at that one lame job that, while utterly shitty, was fun because you liked everyone you worked with, and getting beer before a gig was an adventure. d. 5'7", 115 pounds.

      practice rocked. ok first, we ran through stuff i'm still learning, and i was pissed because i haven't got it down yet. so we took a break. we drank some coffee, listened to some other tunes, and went at it some more. much better. we went through stuff i'm familiar with, and i played them just about perfectly. so, now we officially have four songs *down*. Only twelve to go... these are the ones i have down: Hair of the dog, I will survive (cakes version), black leather, and another song, that i don't remember, but is written down somewhere. Definitely going to do Fortunate Son, and will try to get the band to play Blondie's "One way or another".  By consensus, we are now Alibi.  It's cheesy, but not spandex/big hair cheesy, and we can all deal with it. There are probably 50 million other bands called Alibi, but so what. If we get big and need a new name, we'll find one. As if.

      Hey, great jam up at the tavern tonight.  i didnt play much, but thats ok. what i did play tonight, i played prefectly.  I brought up the H27 to play, and after i got it tuned i was looking at it and was dismayed to see that the neck has bowed a bit, so, it's off to Vinnie for a truss rod crank. I guess the coldness in the back room had something to do with it. I'll have to remember to store it in one of the closets, or loosen the strings or something, since i don't play it as often as i used to. Well, warmer weather is coming up, so i can probably store it back there for the summer.   What i wouldn't give for 48 million dollars. Guess you can't win, though, if you don't play. hell. even 1 mil would be fantastic.

      a swell morning. Light fog outside, obscuring the houses below. As the air warms, the fog settles, and trees become visible. it is pink and grey outside. dew on the grass and the truck and stuff. far off, the clanging of the buoy at Pony Point. No planes yet. No traffic sounds. no sirens. just the thud of the dryer and the whir of the computer.   Now, back to work. my hands are killing me.

      Some piece of shit in France has written a book called "the horrifying imposture" detailing the fact that a plane never crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11.. that it was all some sort of fabrication, a great big joke. I'm not even going to dignify the piece of shit by linking to his site or printing his name. Just search for the book name if its important to you. The dude is some left winger.. politics, and the idea that people involved in it know everything, are both retarded. This man has no brain.   No wonder the English hate the French.

      when i was a kid, i lived in a place that was really the opposite of where i am now.. i.e. not your white bread manufacturing gritty neighborhood type place. A lot of my friends were from elsewhere in the world.  Places repeated every time i asked someone new.. China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Persia. I knew an Iraqi guy who was pretty cool, but took to telling people he was from Jordan when we were seniors. Iranian people tended to say they were Persian. I think the idea was to not make any waves. Here they were from places we were being taught were our enemies. What's a stupid white american kid gonna know about where these people are from, anyway?   But i realized how cool that all was when i lived in Arizona and my room mate had a blind date with a girl he had met, and he was all "She's Persian, what does that mean? I've never seen a Persian person.. where is Persia?" i was flabbergasted. How do you live 22 years and not meet a person from Iran? I guess its just where i'm from. I'm happy i spent my childhood around so many kinds of people.

      aagh, i need to make a background or something. upgrade my html skills, i dunno.. too much other crap to learn. Music theory, some 16 new songs (bass and lyrics of them..) the violin sits unplayed lately. The regatta suddenly got very, very big... just printed a bunch of crap out for it and need to go talk to sponsors and thingies this week. Want to have it all presentable and ready to go by the end of the month. Right. If Tam doesn't come up with the money for the LA trip, i have all month to finish planning this thing. If she somehow magically does, i'm skrood.   the laundry is done.  two more patients on this list to go. Then return the tape, enter all the crap in quicken and write the rent check, maybe get some sleep or something.   This blog thingie is either too trivial for folks, i guess, or not trivial enough. Well. ce la vie, peeps.

      alright, i've gone back with this template. It has the predone links thingies and i'm lazy, so its perfect. i will probably change the colors.   Damn, i've been listening to Grand Champeen.. great stuff. I get into funks where i think i'll never find any music again that feels fresh, makes me feel good, etc, and i'm always wrong. in the past, i found the misfits, janes addiction, dinosaur jr, and then there was nothing, absolutely nothing, for almost six years, then i found big sugar, the deftones, big chief, therapy? now grand champeen. I was on a Cream kick for a LONG time, being too young to have heard much of them (was 26 when i discovered "fresh cream" and just learning how to play the bass). Cream still freakin rules, and jack bruce is still making amazing music. Wish i could say the same thing for Clapton.   today i got some piccies back, some from the first gig the band did together a few weeks ago.  here's what happens when you hand a drunk a camera- you get a lot of pictures back of people you don't know, and none of the band. no prob. i couldn't get the second roll loaded, so nothing on it came out. One came out of me and tammi, but that's about it.   need  more   film  one of my cats is totally demented. She used to bring me dried leaves. Now, i think she's peeling roof moss off the roof and bringing it in. I keep finding huge blobs of it in the hallway. What the.... ?  uninteresting day, mostly. got some terracotta pots to replant some of my herbie plants, and some dirt, and then took dale up to the tavern for lunch. Mass wonderfood there, for sure. mary roolz.   don't look at the links.. cos i have to fix them. maybe tomorrow.  cripes, i logged in today to show dale the template thingie, and there were so many people on i kept getting 503 messages. (server too busy). So hey, y'all, fuck off, i wanna update MINE.

      Last night i finished the most recent book in Jean Auel's  Earth's Children  series.   Ok, lemme stop and say some stuff before i get into this book, and why i disliked it, and why i liked it, and why it sort of irritated me.   I'm a voracious reader. Compulsive, you might say. I read everything in front of my face- beer cans, cereal boxes, car part installation instructions, maps, books, whatever, sometimes over and over if its in front of me long enough.  Series books are cool, it seems, for the first four. Harry Turtledove's series about the Roman Legion magically transported to a different world is probably the best series i've ever read. Then comes Tad Williams'  "Memory, Sorrow and Thorn" books, as well as his Otherland series (which really only seemed to get  better  with each book). The Narnia books, the Little House books, and another series i read a couple of years ago that i can't remember the name of, in which the main character was a despicable whiner, but the books were terrific. These are all great book series. The Sword of Truth series is pretty good, but it's getting boring now, some 6 books into it.   Which seems to be happening with the Earth's Children series. Ms. Auel seemed to be running out of things to say. The book is huge, at least the hardback version, but it's repetetive. I skipped whole sections of it because things had already been explained once in the book.  If one took out all the repeated bits, the book would be some 300 pages shorter, i'm thinking.   why this is annoying- because it isn't just in books, the repeating things over and over. It's in newspaper articles. How many times have you read in the last eight months (made up example, here), "Bibi, like most Afganis, uses only one name". Any article in which the writer is speaking to an individual Afghani, we're reminded that they usually only use one name. Ok we know that now. Myriad articles have remided us. In ongoing stories in the news, there's constant repetition. Timothy McVeigh has another part of his name. He isn't just Timothy McVeigh anymore, he's Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City Bomber. Yeah i remember.   Reminds me of boring Top 40 pop music... eh? Oooh baby baby, baby baby, ooooh.   It's filler and fluff, for whatever reason,  Personally, i don't like being treated like a non-comprehensive moron. Are they writing for today's audience? If that's the case, it's goddamn scary.   But i do like the Earth's Children books. My favorite one is still probably Clan of the Cave Bear, though. Auel has a terrific imagination and must be a compulsive researcher. Plus, she lives in Oregon, so she can't be all THAT bad. Her writing, at least up until this book, was actual craft, and not the terrible Dean Koontz style, rehash the same plot for 50 books just change the names of the characters thing. I can appreciate that, as a secret writer of fiction.  But i would not dare to assume my readers were idiots by repeating concepts 4, 5, 6 times in the same book.  Ok, i'm done with that, now.

      "So, you're married?"  I get that comment more than i kinda like.    While camping this weekend, Lori "Hoov" Carillo, my drummer friend, and i were talking about music and bands and our bands and stuff, and this guy was kinda fucked up sitting near us. She knew him, i didn't. But after a while, he said that. So that's weird and all.   And i was getting change at the laundromat so i could wash Truck on Saturday. I dropped a $10 in the slot and was collecting my quarters, and the laundromat-nazi was hovering over me. "Are you going to do your laundry here?". I told her no. She said they wanted to keep the quarters for the customers and not to do that. So i started a spiel on her. "Well" (says I) "I'm taking these to another  locally owned business  to deposit quarters into their machines. You'll get them back, since i'm pretty sure at least one of their employees uses this laundromat. But i can always tell them to use the other one. " (big, shit eating grin on my face) Then i just left. I know. Anticlimactic and all that.   Something else happened today that i pondered sharing. hmm.   I'm starting to feel low again. That's not what i wanted to say, though.  hmm.  hmm.  hmm?   I need to write this stuff down. I've been telling myself that for years, though.   i hope its nice this weekend. i really want to canoe.    oh i know what it was. i got to watch the S. Carolina vs. Toronto hockey game tonight. SC got the spot, and on they go to the Stanley Cup! Wild, man! I love hockey. i forgot how cool it is to watch it. The fluidity of the movement on the ice juxtaposed with the violence.. it's just cool to watch it.   Oh and i started watching Das Boot. First time i'd ever seen the English version of it.. the dubbed one. I haven't even seen the subtitled one, only the one in German. That movie's fuckin rad, though. I think i got about halfway through it tonight.

      went camping this weekend. Everyone got drunk except for me and Dale. Dale doesn't really drink. I drink a bit... not like i used to, but damn, when you're out camping, it's nice to have a buzz, at least. Someone consumed all the beer i brought. I don't mind sharing, but i don't know who i shared with..   Got the canoe up to the tavern. weeee. Not by paddling it, either. Hopefully this week i'll be able to get into it and go up river or something.  Oh. pic at the top most recently added is me in hmm October i think just after getting the canoe. yeah, my hair looks about a month long or so.. it might be November. Can't really tell.

      its been what, eight months. I still balk when i think about it. It never really leaves my mind, the planes.   a few years ago, when dale and i drove to Illinois, we were in... hmm.. i want to say Madison, but its not.. but a city on the Missippi. I looked out the window of the truck to see a plane making its landing approach, and for a moment it was framed between these two buildings, and the sun behind it, and the clouds were poofy and they had that sort of bright outline to them, with those bars of light (that have a cool name - crespicular or something) and i snapped the pick. So i'll find it and scan it and put it here somewhere.   and when i was, hmm, probably 14, there was a company that advertised oddball stuff in the back of RS and Creem.  They were called Burning Airlines. I think someone ran it out of their house, because the catalog, while HUGE and featuring TONS of music-related goodies like posters, buttons, t-shirts, photos, etc- the catalog had been hand typed and xeroxed. But my mom happened to spy the catalog one day while i was going through it and was annoyed at the company name. She said it was in Horrible Taste (so, what was new for me... she who lacks the slightest iota of any kind of taste, bad or good)..  i wonder if she remembers that? I have all these dumb little bits of things people said to me.. and its weird that i catalogued them away like i did.    My ex-uncle, we'll call him Hartley Kern, once told my mom she was a bad parent. We should have pounded the shit out of him while we had the chance. I also have an ex-near-uncle, who fooled everyone in my family cept me, and we should have stashed him in a canal or something in PHX. No one listens to me and that's always just pissed me off. Lotta people just totally discount me. Mostly relatives. i guess. I just remember thinking that below the "i'm a nice guy" was a raging creep.   i sure miss the art of xeroxing. I try to use it in MLs stuff. Nothings quite as cool as a nicely laid-out photocopy flyer.

      it's very strange, all this talk about the middle east and loose nukes and what if's...   I was a teenager from 1982 to 1999. In my eyes, there were scary times between '82 and '86. "The Reagan Years" they call them. The Soviet Union was a tangible enemy, the "Evil Empire".  We knew where they were. We could find them on a map. Most of my friends and i knew how long it would take for an ICBM to reach its target from the moment it was launched. We all understood what would happen if one of the guys at the top pressed the button. We understood the layers of safeguarding the US had to guard against trigger finger, and we were pretty sure the USSR had something similar.   So, now, we get to relive that weird "back of the head" fear we had in the 80s, that was blithely coked away in the 70s... etc. But the enemy isnt on a map anymore. We know they don't have safeguards against accidental launching. We know they actually WANT to use this kind of stuff. I'm pretty sure that if we DID know exactly where to find the people we were looking for, we wouldn't hesitate to flatten them with conventional weapons.   I'm rambling. I'm a bit scared, the kinda scared i was in high school, when we woke up every day and thought, "Well, it could be the day".   That kind of behavior, that thinking, i think, had a lot to do with the misconception of "Gen-Xers" as apathetic. Yeah, the wall came down in what, 91? But until that time, we went on with life, thinking well there really isn't any point because some maniac is going to push the button, so i'll just go on and do what i want. When the USSR crumbled, it was unbelievable.   On that note, which was the better movie? "The Day After" or "Threads"? I made my stepmom watch "Threads" with me. She kept trying to hustle me out of the room. I wanted to scream at her, "This is your generation, you need to own up to what you people unleashed on mine". If it makes you uncomfortable, you need to examine why.   I thought "threads" was the better movie. It didn't have the sugar coating that The Day After did.   A great book in the same vein is "Swan Song" and i can't remember the authors name.   ugh. today my musings make no more sense than usual, i guess.  well, i never did say i could think coherently.  Dale goes in for his MRI today.   Might go campin this weekend. Get the canoe out in the water again n stuff. yeeeeee haw.

      but anyway, i sent it out.  Probably three weeks later i got this fat manila envelope back from them with all my shit in it and comments from all their staff. Not a single nice one. Ooh man they ripped me a new one. But without good reason, i think. It really upset me.  one wrote, "Get away from the computer and use a pen".   I thought that was very funny. I was thinking, and i wrote back about this one comment, but i was thinking "Man, i've written shit in my own blood with a gun to my head..maybe that's more like something a poet would do" (sarcasm dripping from my teeth). But i had done similar things at that time, i mean writing this crazy shit as a means to not act on it physically.   I've had those little outlets for a long time. I didn't always use them when i should have, but i think i'm most creative when i'm in one of my  X-treme ends of the feelings spectrum. For some reason if i'm on an even keel, i don't write well. Or draw.   I guess a lot of that has to do with not knowing what to do with feelings. Or maybe not. Who knows.   I just know i desperately want to write over the last few months and haven't been able to work myself into the destructive frenzy that i need to do it well.

      Frozen Moment: (In which April loses the car, the keys, and her boots)  I went to some fair in urlLink Hermosa Beach  with Capn Crusty and it must have been John Hamm. We ate pizza and then drank large pitchers of beer. Many of them. We all got separated. I couldn't find my boots. Or my car. Or my keys.   I had Michelle's phone number, though. Made her and.. i think her middle brother? come all the way out from Gardena to save my pathetic, drunk ass.   This may have been the same time i ran into Michelle "Piece" Yacoupian. She was at a booth selling incense. I was sooo happy to see her, but too drunk to realize how fortunate i was to see her. That was the last time i ever saw her. I guess she's doing good now, has a kid and got married. I hope she's happy. I've heard from a lot of the rest of the crowd i used to hang out with, and i hope we're all happy, cos we freakin ALL deserve to be. My tale seems the "easiest" of times in the last 10 years after hearing about some of theirs, but mine sure wasn't the "easiest" when it was at its most insane.   In AZ one time, when i was doing a lot of writing and sort of dancing around the fringe of this arty kinda crowd, i was encouraged to submit some of my writing to a local poetry 'zine. We'll call it South Ash Press. I had relatively high respect for this thing until i actually submitted something to them.  First, they ask all of their submisions be typed. So i took my books of scrawl and typed out maybe four poems and submitted them. I think my query letter had some kinda attitude about it.. maybe i had submitted something before and they didn't even bother to send a rejection letter...

You may get an old-fashioned bottle of coke with your hamburger, which, by the way, is as fresh as it gets in Texas, and the size of saucer. You will probably get a complimentary piece of pie for desert. I never can remember what this place was called, but i think it was the coolest place i've ever eaten at in my life. If its summer time, it'll be warm inside. I bet if it's winter, its kinda cold.

      This town is too damn small. I wish my drummer would realize that. And keep his mouth shut to bar owners about how GRAND we are. Because there ARE bands better than us, and that kind of talking comes back to bite you in the ass, always, especially here. No one can afford to go talking shit about any other band. cripes. fer fuck's sake and all. Check this out, he blabs to a club owner, while a band is playing. I know the band. i don't know the club owner, but someone else i know knows the club owner.  So this someone else tells me what the club owner told her the drummer said. Not only do i know the band, on a kind of small-talk hey nice to see you sound great kinda level, but THEIR drummers dad teaches bass at the college, was my teacher. *smacks face, drags hand down chin, going aaaaaagh*. Yknow, there's a time to shine, and that's onstage, not standing around bad-mouthing the competetion. So, there's probably only a small chance we'll ever get to play there, which is why i think i may go down to this club over the weekend and say hi to this guy and maybe smooth it out, if it's smoothable. I'm not sure what he's expecting. we've only been together as a band for hmm maybe three months. i still haven't got all the songs i learned in that three months totally nailed down yet. (well, you pack in 30 songs in 60 days and see how much you retain, ok?)   There is, however, one place in town i simply will not ever play. If they want to play there, they do it without me, because i've taken so much shit from the owner of the place i'm just not going to play in her shithole.

      we get to see pictures of bullet-ridden neighborhoods in the middle east sometimes.   But they like to go out and shoot their guns in the air sometimes, and we all know bullets come back down (we get to remember this every 4th of july and new years eve, too, when a few of the more stupid americans go outside and shoot in the air)  So, how many palestinians are killed by their own bullets falling from the sky? I've wondered that for a long time. Does the falling bullet law not apply to them? I'm really serious. its one of those weird questions, i'm sure...

      yay. finally. though i have not got anything to really say....   band problems were worked out for the most part. i think a large part of our problem is arrogance. er, yes, we are all arrogant. But i know i'm arrogant, and i know that being that way all the time is going to get me shot in the foot, bandwise, so i try to keep my arrogance to myself.  That said, i'm unhappy with how i sound on the disc that was recorded at the tavern.  Therefore, i'm not adding any of the MP3s to the band site, unless the bands tells me to.

      and yknow what else?   someone else can book the fucking band. All i hear is whining. So, someone else can do it. Fuck it. I ain't got time to wait around for these people to fill out forms that were due two weeks ago, or to tell me one price and then complain when the misunderstanding is on the venues part. Or tell me they can't talk about it right now because they need a fucking drink of water. Book yer own shit and i'll just play my bass. Christ on a stick. Or make deals behind my back and never tell me about it, so yea, i do look like the fucking asshole once again. "well we told that guy we'd play for $X", Why the fuck didn't you tell me when i had to turn the application in that you'd already quoted that price?!  'oh its not worth it to play way up there for that much, and we don't have that much music' Sorry? Exposure to a group of people from all over the state and various other MC clubs that put on summer gigs like this isn't ENOUGH, on top of the money? If we have dont't have enough music, why have you been nodding and smiling about it and saying we did for the past two weeks?  "They want us to go on at 6 pm and drive that far?" Hell yeah, do you want to play or not? *I will go up and entertain them for four hours by mySELF*.   Oh, yeah, i understand now why some people just say "Screw the band" and buy a CD player and run their own tracks all night on originals. I sort of understood before, because i've lived in a house with a band, and i've lived with large groups of people before, but really, until your in the middle of it, it just doesn't sink in.  you never really see how shitty your "friends" are until these big nasty one-eyed green things with big slack-jawed heads always hanging open called EGOS suddently float to the surface. Sure, i have one too, but here i was thinking these people were actually serious about being in a band? And doing something with it? Fuckin laughable.   ______________   I'll be okay tomorrow. I have to put it somewhere. If i say it aloud, it'll be venemous and cruel and people will cry. Either i'd do that, or i'd be so pissed, like steaming out my ears and eyeballs popping out pissed, that i'd only be able to say "glaaaaaah!" and wave my arms frantically, and turn purple and spit and drool and stuff. So. The walls will remain intact, because this gets it out of my system. And, it's not something that belongs on the band page. Its my thing. I have to deal with it. Tomorrow, i'll be able to present this problem of mine to the band, and we can work on a solution for it in a reasonable manner and we may not all be happy about it, but at least it won't just be ME being unhappy about it.   I have to post an  MP3. I still havent decided which one. I have a stack of requests for copies of the CD we recorded at the tavern, too.   (makes loud, quickly deflating balloon noise)

      whoa, my post times are askew again, and some are missing, and they aren't the ones that were missing earlier.   oh well.   so, i've been reading a lot about the RIAA lately. And the record companies. and big piles of money. and napster and other peer-to-peer networks. let me get this straight-  1. in the late fifties, DJs were busted for taking payments to make songs top 10 hits. This is payola, in its original form.   2. somewhere along the line, RIAA was founded to protect artists and labels. ASCAP and BMI were simply not enough. Harry Fox Publishing Companies lawyers were not enough, either, because  3. A couple of years ago an online guitar tab archive called OLGA was made an example of, and shut down, basically for the same reason napster has been shut down   4. which was shut down because the record companies and some artists thought people were stealing the music instead of buying it, because sales have dropped   4a which is really caused by the fact that modern pop music sucks  5 because no one listens to people who listen to music  6 because the record companies are picking the songs they want to get a hit out of  7 and paying radio stations large piles of cash for the  chance  to maybe get a hit out of it  8 and so the record companies are pissed at the radio stations because they have to pay them all this money and they aren't guaranteed a hi6t anymore  9 so they have shut down the two best ways to get FREE distribution for their artists (peer-to-peer file sharing services and webcasting)  10 because people WERE being exposed to new music, for free  11 and the people in the record companies and RIAA didn't like the fact that  12 because THEY have to pay to have the music played  13 the rest of us should pay EXTRA to merely hear the music, that sucks anyway.   and i'm confused, really, because all i see is the record companies just bent themselves over and were happy about it. They got what they wanted. And now they're complaining about it.

      yeah, damn, for sure i'll miss Lori if she ends up taking this new job. *grumble*.    I often grumble about having no friends here, but i do have friends. they just aren't the kinds of friends i used to have. Perhaps in all my moving and relocating i've laid up a line of some kind, and never allow my friendships to progress past that, because i may end up moving again. There will be no more Michelles, Christians,  Terrys, Vals or Glennas. No more Andis, Lillis, Taras.  The friends i have now have kids, husbands, jobs.  So, i'm, as usual, a bit on the outside. I have a job.. I have a husband. But my life is still very much outside theirs. I hang out with the ones i have now, Sara, Tammi, Joan and Lori (yeah. that's it.  really only four good friends now) and their lives are totally alien to me.   but this isn't what i popped in to blab about. i wanted to blab some more about people.    Its weird to live in a place thats mostly white. I spent most of my life around all different shades. Racially mixed marriages bother a couple of people i know. My stepmom is black, and my brother and sister are, too. They're adopted. I can't deal with my stepmom, but it has nothing to do with what color she is. She's a school psychologist, and she always treated me like a case study. I was never able to pop off with a rascist excuse when she pissed me off, because it was always something that had nothing to do with race. She never listened to me. She seemed like a golddigger. (funny, finding out now that appearances in this case are not deceiving, as my dad and stepmom are in the process of a divorce, and she's not only screwing my dad, but me).  In fact, in my family, there is so much to make the "white, protestant, het" crowd cringe that i think its funny to tell them about it, with great relish in my voice. "Check this out- My dad married a black woman and they adopted two black kids. My brother and sister. My aunt Jane was a nun for some 20 plus years, and she got out and married a jewish guy (who i also didn't like, but it was because he was a jerk, not because he was a jew), my aunt judy's ex-husband is now my aunt Amanda. No longer Uncle Bill." All that makes them turn all kinds of colors. That's just my immediate family. My family, i think, defines an american social ideal. No, we aren't perfect. We are co-dependent, addicts, lofty-nosed at times.  Just not afraid of what the rest of the world thinks. We do our own thing, and if the neighbors don't like it, they can shove off.   What brings all this thought on? I just finished reading a story in the Washington Post about a town in Montgomery county (AL i think) called Damascus. Where the town has been so white for so long, and is now no longer so very white, that people just don't know how to deal with minorities. As if there's a way to  deal  with a minority. For fuck's sake, you treat everyone the same. That's how you deal with minorities. everyone deserves the same amount of respect. And anyway, this sort of thing seems to be in so many headlines, and its shameful. A quote in the article from a PTA person said "We need to increase tolerance". That struck me as totally retarded. As if there's a lever with "tolerance" labeling it, and you just inch it up a bit until its acceptable. What BS. You don't "increase tolerance". You teach your kids right from the get go that people are all the same, and it's the goddamn 21st century.    i feel this way not just about color-based rascism, but religion and sexual freak-outs. Who gives a crap what someone does in their house. Or what god they worship. And people don't want to hold themselves accountable for teaching their kids a bunch of lies, either.   I just get pissed.  When i was younger, a teenager probably, i would take my brother out and cruise around the mall with him and stuff. He's the right age that he could be MY kid. And we'd be toddling around and people would look at me like i was a pariah for having this little black kid in tow. "That your boy?" They'd ask. "hell no!" i'd say. and i could see they were beginning to approve, like maybe i was taking the housecleaner's kid out for the day. "Hell, no, that's my brother". And this kind of shit in Los Angeles. In upscale, million-dollar home Palos Verdes, full of people of all different shades. Rich people in all different shades. What the? Ignorance and stupidity come in all demoninations and sizes. ANd i can't even begin to tell you the garbage that poured out of the mouths of the white power kids in knew in AZ. Why did i hang out with them? They were entertaining.     ------------------   done with that. i may occasionally go on about something similar to that. I'll sometimes be hanging out with people and they'll say something retarded that just makes me fume. Course i wait til i get home to fume. Only after saying to them, "Well, that's totally retarded of you, but if you like being a dumbass, that's cool".   ABATE had its meeting Sunday about which band to have play. No one has called me yet. So, i have a sinking feeling about it. We did have six people in the group who said we had their vote, though. I'll ask Mary tomorrow. I almost don't want to. I don't want to know unless we got it. So i'm on edge about that. Also on edge because we have to move, fairly soon, pay off the rest of our taxes and Dale may end up needing surgery on his knee. The surgery is paid for, but the time off work... ow. Up to two months. I'll just have to work harder, i guess. Time to buckle down. I can do that, but it takes extreme pressure for me to do it. and the water is boiling.   hey i actually cooked some food tonight. Got bagels and eggs and cheese, so i fried up some eggs, toasted the bagels and put the cheese on it and that was our dinner. I need to fix or replace my stupid washing machine. it never knows when to change cycles, so it'll wash clothes for an hour or two if i don't go out and kick it into the next cycle, or it'll spin for an hour or so... goddamn annoying thing.   No work tonight. vacation for the doctors? again? Every time that happens, that there is no work in the box for me, i secretly panic and think Val has fired me without telling me.

      one of my friends may move to a city in Washington. I'm sad. Unknowingly, and though our opinions differ on how things are done, she's made my life in this town a bit easier, and i'll miss her so fucking much. She has no clue how much her friendship has meant to me, and i'll be real upset if i lose contact with her.

Then found the sodas.. we both got Stewart's root beer.  I got a stewart's key lime, and dale also got a Jones blue bubblegum. Topped it off with a pint of Umpqua Dairy Blackberry stuff, and we were set.

      i live in a conservative, "good christian", "family oriented" type area. Not going to bother detailing why those phrases are meaningless here, because thats not the point.    One thing in town irritates the shit out of me, and it'd be better if i took a picture of it to get the point across, but some weirdo has this trailer he made a sort of big wood box out of and its covered with stuff from the bible (taken totally out of context, as usual).  This person parks it in store parking lots, moving it around.  Everytime i see it in a lot, i go tell the manager that i wont come back until that thing is gone. Well, if people can be offended by pictures of naked people ( i guess they close their eyes in the shower or something), i can be offended by having someone elses religion shoved in my face when i go to buy junk like tampons and beer.   anyway, i digress....   I saw a minivan plastered with obnoxious "conservative" bumper stickers today.  I want a new one. I want one that says "Fuck you and your opinion". Regardless of what kind of opinion it is.   This from the person who used to get hasseled regularly in the Metro Phoenix area for having "Republicans don't need abortions, they eat their young" on her bumper.  which reminds me of the funniest reactions i ever had to that bit..  i was delivering a pizza one day, driving down the main drag in Mesa, tokin, cos i could. Yuppie freak in a white BMW pulls up next to me on the passenger side, and starts freaking out in my general direction, yelling something.  i couldn't hear him, and i was stoned, so THAT was funny, but i rolled my passenger window down so i could hear what he was going on about, and he was totally incensed by the thing.. the republicans thing.   conversation went something like this -  yuppie freak- Hey whats that fuckin supposed to mean?!   me- Whats what mean?  YF- that stuff on the back of your truck.  me- What, you can't read it? It means what it says, dude.  YF starts yelling and screaming at me and gesturing wildly, i mean the guy was really torqued over it. All i could do was LAUGH my ass off and reach over to roll the window back up, as this freak, this pillar of the community in his brand new beemer, was cursing at me  and perspiring in my general direction. i still laugh about that.

      Yuck. a bug just flew up my nose. Lucky i know about the Farmer's blowjob.   well, heres the news.    Last week i recorded my part for my song, "Home" (for lack of a better title, it's been Home).  We did it on a Yamaha MD8, which is a very cool little pretty-shiny kinda thing. Multitrack recording in the privacy of your own home.. what a concept.  ok anyway, i have the rough cut of it, just my singing and the guitar/drum track with some backups by Beeb.  Saturday he came up to see us clear the dust out at the Riverside (we were too loud. NO! The place is just TOO small!) and he had the newest mix of it and played it, and it sounded pretty cool.   However,  it  felt  weird as hell listening to myself sing. I've never fancied myself a singer, but i'm doing more and more of it now and this is not really the BEST song in the world or anything (but i wrote it, so its ok). I sort of wandered around feeling... hmm.. stunned might be too strong a word, more like the ground of reality shifted a bit in one direction and left me standing somewhere else. What's weird about hearing a good recording of yourself  is that its like being in two places at once.  It really made  me feel (oh hell, i know there's a word for it.. criminy) off-kilter? Off-kilter is the closest. It sorta rocked my world. Tammi adores it. She says i sound cute. ick. I have a pretty weak voice, as far as forcefullness of it goes. I'm not real consistent in my breathing and stuff.  Ok, now on to update the ML page. Some good things happened last Saturday.

When i went to those search results, the first thing that popped up was  urlLink 1750 Maryland Ball Family to Geo. Washington , which is sort of what i was looking for about them.  In the Ball book, there's no history further back than a anecdote about the six brothers coming to the US on the ship. So, yeah, i think this is what i'm looking for. I'll compare it to the book later.

Search for Pele and see how long it takes me to get to a page about the biology of tree frogs (any kind of tree frog). Rules: can click on a link on each page once to get to the next, er, degree.

      band played rad tonight.   We dropped "Let it Ride" on them, after only two or three practices of the song, to see if it was worth it, and it is. We dig it. They dig it. It confused them. :) whatwhat? A BTO song with a reggae chorus?! Anyway, it's rad how big sugar does it.   I'll update the band webpage sometime tomorrow, i think. I'm too tired to really say anything worthy about it, yet. It was taped, though. and the tape sounded really, really good.

      yknow, when its late at night like this.. or is it early morning? Anyway, i do a lot of writing when its still, quiet and dark outside.    i was talking to my drummer tonight about the things you hear late at night in neighborhoods.  At one point, i had these neighbors who lived below me (i say below because the house i live in sits on a ridge, and people live directly below me at the bottom) and they used to fight. They'd haul their drity laundry out at 3 am and fight and holler and argue in the middle of the street. I'd usually be working. So i'd hear them start outside. And i'd get up and lean on the windowsill and yell "Yeah! Kick his ass! Tell him what's up! Yeah!" and stuff at them, and they'd be quiet for a few minutes.. i guess they were trying to see where the voice was coming from, since the house i live in isn't visible from their street.. hehe.. but i always thought that was fun. I hear all kinds of noises this time of night. I've heard gunshots ("from what?"Jeff asks, "pistols or rifles or what?". "Large caliber handguns, man") the double crack of gunshots... hmmm... and no sirens? But i hear sirens other times, because there's a short cut to the main drag here that runs about two blocks away from me. So i hear them. I hear people partying up and down the block. Occasionally i hear someone sitting outside playing an acoustic guitar, very, very quietly. I'd yell encouragement for them, but i don't want them to be self-concious and stop. It's a nice sound. One i wouldn't  mind hearing.  In the mornings, around 7:45, i hear the bell for the high school. The warning bell, i guess, but i don't know because i have no idea what time school starts here. Was 8 am sharp for me. Warning bell at 7:50. And in the daytime, during the school year, you hear the bell on and off, depending on how the wind blows. I also get to hear the marching band practice, the crowd at the games.  At 4 AM, there's a weird sound that i think must be a shift signal at the port. I've never figured it out though. It kind of sounds like a train sound. I don't thinik there's a regular train through here at 4 am though. Its every 4am. You hear the Coast Guard helicopter sometimes, probably off to look for a fisherman who's gone off his boat.  Around 10 am you start hearing the puddle jumper planes from the airport, and my house is right under the flight path. They aren't that loud, but i can hit a plane with a rock and a slingshot from my front yard when they fly in.  After 9/11, it was really weird because the plane traffic was grounded. it was mostly silent here for a week. When its foggy or stormy, i can hear the Pony Slough buoy and its bell, marking off every four or five minutes.. lemme digress here and tell a funny story, or at least i think it was funny.   My first real job here was working at an answering service. I can't say which one, and i have to be sort of vague about this whole thing because i signed a confidentiality clause, and even though the boss was a raging bitch, i have to respect the clause to some degree.  anyway, one of the clients was one of the things that makes the port work. Ok so there was a campground at the end of Pony Point, which is about a mile and a half away from me, where the buoy is. Its at the top of the "North Bend" of the Coos River, or very close. That campground is closed now due to airport expansion. So i'm working one day, and this irate lady calls me up and starts complaining about the Pony Slough buoy and the noise it makes. I told her there wasn't anything *I* could do about it, so maybe she should call this other thing.. She already did, she said, and they said to call these people (who we answered the phone for).  The noise was ruining her camping trip.  I explained to her why the buoy was there. She was from some shitass landlocked state where shipping safety simply isn;t an issue, i guess. I mean, the ships have to pass under a railroad bridge right there, and then the McCollough bridge and its piers.  After explaining to her why the buoy is important, she didn't care. THAT pissed me off. I spieled on her. Nicely, of course.. but along the lines of "Hey, yknow, we have a working freakin port here in case you didn't notice. If the ships can't tell where they are, and it DOES get dark and foggy here, they'll run into stuff. And then we'll have crap on the beaches and stuff in the water and people will be all up in arms and the oysters will suffer and there won't be any healthy fish for dickhead tourists like you and your husband to catch. So shove it and camp somewhere they appreciate a lack of safety and people enjoy their pollution. And what kind of maniac camps in the middle of a harbor?". SHe made all sorts of threats and, hell, i couldn't have done anything for her if i wanted to or tried anyway. Bitch.   I hated that job.   Hear that Jan Purvis? I hated the job. I hated you. You and your spiel about how none of us will ever find a better job in this town... well i'll tell ya what, you drunk.. i did. Anita did. We did. And you still suck my ass. I can work in my jammies, at a better job, i get paid 10 times as much and never have to look at a customer or listen to some idiot yell at me on the phone. Fuck you. Maybe you'd never find a better job, because your so lame, but i did,   because   i    rule.  (maniacal laughter)

      i left band practice tonight at about midnight.  It was a good practice. We did our famous "well, lets give a listen to this song.. ok.. now, let's go play it" thing and almost nailed a new song.. so that makes it a good practice.  anyway, it was dark outside the House of Libner when i left, cool, but not cold. A nice summer night, for here. And the smell.. not the usual poopie diaper smell of the Cities at low tide.. when the mud flats are all out, after they bake in the sun... no this was the smell i like. There was the sea smell. The pine smell. the smell of warmish air. flowers.  a very sweet smell. I just stood out there by my truck and inhaled for a while.   another smell- as you pass the chipyards (where the forests they log go to be chopped up and shipped overseas, to be returned to us as pressboard furniture from Malaysia and Korea), your eyes water with the smell of the chips. A couple of blocks away, it's actually a pleasant smell. But right as you pass by, ooooomygawd.   One of my favorite smells i first smelled in the Riverside, CA area, before it became the tract-house bedroom community for middle-class LA commuters... the smell of orange orchards in the spring time.  When i lived in Phoenix, i used to wait until spring time and go driving through the orchards outside of Mesa. Man, what a smell. Intoxicating. There is a perfume that has a similar smell called Ciao!. Smells just like orange blossoms. MmM.   And there was the smell of the harbor in San Pedro. When you went down by Warehouse One, in the old berths, where the fuel loading terminal is. Not the fuel smell that i liked, although i'm a sucker for 102 octane.  But the smell of the harbor is one i always associate with pleasant things. My time in Pedro was difficult, at times, but for the most part good. A whiff of fuel oil, or heavy diesel, even the smell of the fisherman's wharf area, with it's drying nets and gas and diesel and fish smells. Fish markets do not smell good, though. I sometimes go to Charleston here to see if i can smell that smell. It isn't there. They don't haul out their nets and let them dry in the sun. Charleston has a funky smell most of the time, anyway.  Sometimes in the spring there's a breeze that brings the sweet, salty ocean smell in, but not often. It's usually the low-tide poopie diaper smell out there.

      You make a lot of money. You build a big house. You demand to be able to enjoy it. And the little people who fish for your delicacies lose.  urlLink An Oyster and a Way of Life, Both at Risk   This essentially happened where i live now, except it wasn't the rich who brought it about. It was a combination of the government and an attitude that the plenty would always be available. So the fishermen lost the good fisheries and went to ground fishing, and now the ground fish have gone to pot from overfishing, and the government has offered to help by buying out the fishing boats. Which still leaves a lot of unemployed, impoverished people behind.   But in Palos Verdes, affluence has destroyed the beauty the place was once known for.

      i dyed the blue again. I bleached my hair twice for it this time. Seems the only way it sticks well is if the hair is damaged and porous. So i bleached it once, waited a day, and did it again, then conditioned the shit out of it.  Then i left it alone for a week. Just washed it. Then dyed it on Wednesday afternoon. The shit is DARK. A nice, dark royal blue. Hopefully it will stay that way for a couple of weeks, at least.

      I would love to see an American diplomat, preferably Colin Powell, head to Iran.   In '79, when the "students" stormed the embassy, i was 9.  30% of Iran's population is under 30, and so wouldn't remember the "revolution". It appears they don't care much for it, anyway, if the article in Details is right. A mostly bored, unemployed, well-educated mob of young people could do more for the US in the middle east than the CIA or FBI (especially in light of recent events in THEIR bureaus).  A couple of seeds planted here and there ~ The water and dirt already exists there for explosive change~ is all that would be needed to toss out the current regime.   What a slap in the face to pan-Islamists and anti-americans if our relationship with Iran improved. But politics don't work like that, of course. American politics, at least, don't offer up pulic humiliation to countries like Iran. We only do it to our own political people.   Nonetheless, i still think it's something the US needs to look at.  Iran doesn't need a propped up Shah again. Iran needs the clerics hung by their hamstrings in the bazaars. And a decent government. One that can distinguish fantasy from reality. Come to think of it, that's what all those theocracies need.   Plus, if we had access to Iran's oil, we would no longer have to rely on the two-faced Saudi government, would we?   On the Saudis- someone on a site i'm a member of says we shouldn't judge the whole country by the actions of the 9-11 hi-jackers.. or i guess and of these other Saudi nationals that keep magically popping up in terror plots.   No, we shouldn't. But it's hard not to, given recent evidence against them.

      I'll beat that river. then i'll take on the west fork. WIth a kayak, because i KNOW that ain't no canoeing river, either. That thing goes bananas in the winter time. It's straight white water from 17 miles up.

      Today's adventure was supposed to be canoeing from the 20-mile mark to the tavern. It looks much easier than it is. We got about 30 minutes into it, after pulling up and hauling out 4 times, and we got hung up on a rock.  The rock was sharpish, and we were wedged against it by the current. if we got it out and moved it forward, it would hit another rock from the front. The one we were stuck on was under us. i could hear the fiberglass trying to flex around it. We could NOT get the freakin canoe off the rock, and couldn't see how deep we were around us. We padded like maniacs, tried pushing the paddles against the rock to lever us out (while remaining mostly calm... i was more concerned about the canoe than us) to no avail. Suddenly i heard the crunch and saw the rock poke through the bottom. Damn! There it goes, bail out! No idea still how deep the water is, just went over without taking the canoe over and pulled it to the rocks.   Now we had it out of the water and assessed the damage. After dumping it out, we found an x-shaped compromise in the integrity of the hull. (i've been dying to say that, ok?)It was about fist-sized. Grumble. Damn. Look around, how are we going to get this out? The shore on our side is flat rocks below the road, which is almost a vertical climb about 15 feet through firs and brambles. Ok. So we plan our egress, stash the canoe, and start walking back to the truck, about a half-hour walk. Get the truck back to the spot and tie the new rope onto the front. Tammi throws the other end up, she pushes the thing and i haul it up from the top. It was comedy. But we succeeded, and even got the thing back on and tied tight. No problems getting it off.. which i forgot to mention.. when we first unloaded it, it shifted and dropped off the truck. With great crashing noises! At least it didn't shear the mirror off. So the stupid canoe had managed to survive being dropped four feet but not some shitty little rock. aaargh.  Anyway, i'm thinkin it's a kayak river, myself. At least til about a mile up from the store. Smooth canoe water from there on down.  So i guess we're gonna fix it up this week and maybe see about stiffening up the bottom just a bit with another layer or so.   The kayaks my friends dad has are thick-ass plastic, and short, good for all around kinda stuff. They'd be easy to take over the pools and wouldnt bust up on the rocks and stuff. There are three small rapids to deal with, and i think the kayaks could easily handle them. The highest is about 3 feet. So i will see if sara will let me rent them for a weekend.

       urlLink  Diane   These are the lyrics to the one song i sing with the band.  originally, i just loved the song.  Husker Du did it first, and when i first heard it on KXLU in er, 1984 or something like that, i thought "What balls".  HD based it on some crime that happened in Minnesota around the time they were writing the album it was on.  Then i discovered therapy? And THEN i found out they did a version of it (i now have 5 different ones) and became enamored by it.    But while i was on stage at the ABATE run, singing this, another little girl was kidnapped.  So i did feel kind of weird singing this, but then i doubt anyone was really listening to the lyrics.  Then, i just figured, if anyone was, maybe they'll watch their own little girls a little closer.   The band takes a few songs and gives them new life in a present context.   Fortunate Son  was the one that got us moving in this direction.  When you have a woman singing it, in times that we live in, it's similar to the original, but not quite.

       urlLink  ellelee   has been a qwerty pounding maniac tonight.   I think when i was about the same age i was sorting a lot of stuff out and separating the friends from the enemies, and generally trying to scrape my ass off the sidewalk, so i often read her blog and quietly commiserate. I did tons of writing and tons of art about the same time.  then, suddenly, the muse fled, and i seethed until learned the bass. Now i have little to say because i pound it all out when i play.  And there's something really cathartic about singing "Diane", even though its twisted as shit.

       urlLink Live : Throwing Copper   I just dragged this out of the CD shelf after about three years.  I forgot how GOOD this album is.  Lyrics notwithstanding, the music is great, too.  But whatsisname really has a good grip on using words.  He uses excellent words, and sprinkles a bit of alliteration in here and there.     I got this CD when i lived in Arizona.  Just after i moved into the house at 10th and Horne, before John the roomie moved in.  So the CD reminds of me bright, warm, spring Phoenix days and spending inordinate amounts of time lazing about with friends and getting tanked.  I wasn't driving at the time, so that wasn't an issue, and clubs were within walking distance. Cheap booze, usually, too.    So, John, Tom, a Fastlane toast to summer nights drinking Kaluha, watching World News Tonight and vanilla ice cream... to Sunday morning nutcase radio, waiting for Jim Hightower ("If i shoot a guy on my porch, should i bring him inside?")... To Negativland, Corey, DanDan, Ivars, and Foreskin 500... IRC parties and Goldschlager, more pot than we knew what to do with... Four Peaks and rabid javelinas... escaping Luke and Matt, monsoons on the roof with the tripod and 3 AM roofers. And Tom's backyard adventure with the ghettobird. ROFL!   Today is ebay day at bobs, so check out the link to what he's got on later... probably after 5.

      ok here goes, the drums, ex-boyfriends, etc thing.  When i was like, hrm 16 or maybe 17, i lived in this house full of punks.  I guess there were a dozen of us sleeping there at any one time.  The guys whose dad owned the house had a band, and the one of the brothers i was dating was the drummer.  the other brother was the singer.  he was an ass. Thats beside the point.    So one day billy decided he wanted to teach me how to play the drums. cool. i'm on it. i couldn't play anything, except a little piano and some easy french horn stuff.  he was all serious about it, battening down to teach me to play, like it was goin to be a lengthy process.  he showed me how to hold the sticks, and how to organize my limbs and stuff, and then demonstrated an easy 4/4 rock thing.  After about 20 minutes, i was pounding away on the drums, and he was standing there with his arms crossed over his chest, frowning.  turning red. steam coming out his ears.  So i stopped. "What's the problem?" i asked, innocently.  "What's the problem?!" he said.  "I just showed you how to do that and you're already jamming away.  You aren't supposed to be that good, or learn that fast.  You're a girl."  So he was pissed at me for days, because i learned to play some shitass basic drum beat faster than he did, and because i was a girl.    So now, whenever i get to play the drums, and i take the opportunity whenever i can, i get a sort of smug satisfaction out of it.  hah billyboy! Well, it shocks everyone, usually, when i grab some sticks and pound.  i don't play well or anything, or do anything fancy, but i keep the beat good.  That's all i care about.  i try to throw in fills once in awhile and they always foul me up.

       urlLink  The World Newspaper    This is the local "newspaper". It's a fucking joke. About six months after i moved here, they got a new editor, and i stopped seeing the typos and  spelling mistakes  all the time. The paper centered itself, politically, which was nice.  About another six months later, the mistakes started popping up again, the letters to the editor were all about god, and we ALL OF THE SUDDEN had a serious drug problem here. They got a new editor. One who thinks throwing god at any problem, like some people think throwing enough cash at a problem, will do the trick. It might as well be a church newsletter with a BIG sports section and only the shortest, tersest articles about what happens on this hurtling rock we call home.   I once sent them an email, and asked if they had a proofreader on staff, and if they did, did this person actually proofread or just stare at the layout for 20 minutes and call it done. They answered that they didn't have an official proofreader, but everyone at the paper was responsible for proofing. Well, that splains it then. They all need remedial english classes.  I see mistakes in the paper that no self-respecting sixth grader would make.    And two of my friends work there. From what they tell me, it sounds like a bigger gossip cesspool than anywhere else i've ever been, with one fatass blonde in particular having a mouth that never shuts up. People thinking they're big fish or something, it's almost funny, if it wasn't so pathetic.

      the Good news- The truck is back home now :) It has new bearings and seals and new rear brakes. Most important,  it stops .  No more weird groaning/grinding when i make left turns, or even go straight at high speeds. I feel sorry for the poor dude who did the job. He said it was really gross. Hell, yeah, i know it was. I've unfrozen them before, and upon getting the drum off, found the hardware packed with grease so bad you just scoop it out with your fingers and then spray four cans of brake cleaner on it.    The yucky part is they weren't able to get the brake booster, and are going to order it Monday, so i'll have to take it back.  So i still have to kinda lay on the pedal to stop it, but it does stop, and that's all i care about.    So, i guess probably the next big thing it'll need is the clutch.  Then i think i'm going to start working on the outside, get some new bumpers and a new front quarter panel and passenger door. it'll cost as much to give it a new paint job as it will to match and feather the sheet metal, so that'll probably happen in a couple of years, too.  tootle-oo for now.

      tonight we were supposed to pratice, but it ended up a "listen to one person and their fantasies" for 4 hours kinda night. It started out nice, kinda warm out, some clouds out.  I got to the band house and Nick said he felt sick and wasn't sure if he wanted to practice. Ok. no prob. if you're sick, you're sick. So tam and i went to Chebron and bought some stuff to drink and when we were walking back noticed lightning off to the southeast. Lots of it. TONS of it. it was awesome. it was far enough away that there was no thunder.  I hadn't seen a good lightning storm since i moved up here.  But i hung out in the GMS lot and watched it for about an hour, and then it started getting windy, so i went back in. It hasn't rained yet, though.  Every flash showed huge sheets of rain laden clouds.  It was, once again, fucking awesome. I got a sort of adjustment.   Then we went in and the thing with being blabbered at incessantly went on for awhile, and my pants were too tight, so i was uncomfurry. hehe. Tam gave me a pair of pseudo-camos i've been coveting, to wear instead, but i have to give them back, which sucks, because they're WAY comfy.   I'm at the point where i just want this thing on the 19th to be over with. I'm so fucking sick of hearing about it all the freakin time. Yeah! It's a "big" show for us! Yeah! It's an audtion for a bigger one! Yea! Stuff may go wrong! Shut up and play fer peets sake.   Sweartagod, i'm getting a shirt with that on it, and i'm going to wear it all the damn time.

       urlLink Found    Well, good that they were found.   If you're near the river up there, you're never more than 50 feet from the road. There are three fairly easy trails that lead up to the Falls (there are two of them).  At the top above the falls, if you wander around for awhile, you'll come across old homesteads and the remnants of a road.  Personally, i think it would be difficult to get lost up there. Partly because you can hear the falls for a couple of miles in any direction, and could orient yourself to get back to them. But it is rather hard going off the trails. The hills are rocky, and where you'd think the forest would be just a muddy floor most of the time, you have to hack your way through the berry bushes.

So he had piles of rolled dough with shards of glass all over it and he had to clean it all up before he could roll anymore. What next? The gremlins even affected the place thats supposed to do the work on my truck. Someone forgot to order the parts so i have to wait until saturday. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was the gremlins...

       urlLink  Missing.     X imitates X    Tammi and i went up to the tavern to jam tonight.  It was a warm night, but not as warm as last night. And the spirits are abounding up there.   I parked the truck and stopped to talk to one of the guys for a few before heading in.  The air was cool and still. The river was at slack tide. Pouring out of the tavern was  urlLink  Dwight Yoakum's   "Streets of Bakersfield". I had the bass over my shoulder and we were walking slow, and i said 'I feel like i'm walking into a movie'. Little did i know...  First, i hadn't heard anything about these missing people yet. They were last seen about 7 miles up the road from the tavern. There was a detective up there for a while tonight.    Second, something unsettling happened with the tavern's back door last night.   There were a lot of people there having fun, but there was a sort of undercurrent of tension. It all felt vaguely unreal to me, at least. I felt like i had somehow been shifted one degree to the right of reality or something. People said weird things.  But i wonder about these two missing people. It was pretty warm all through the Fourth of July weekend. Even warmer up the river.  They were a little overdressed the last time they were seen, in parkas and wooly hats.   There are also two campgrounds on the way up to the Falls. The campgrounds were pretty full, this weekend.I imagine a lot of people were picknicking up at the Falls, so someone had to have seen them.  There sure isn't enough water in the river up there for a body to float very far, either. And they haven't found anything in or next to the river.

      welp, i've put it off long enough. It's time for the truck to get some kinda major work. The axle bearing and seal on the passenger side have been bad since i got the truck.  the seal has been replaced more times than i can remember, and every time, within about five months, it blows out again and starts flinging grease all over that brake drum. So, lovely truck is getting two new bearings, seals, wheel cylinders and four new shoes. (i'm so happy the fronts were okay, and waay surprised, and also waaaay stoked that i don't need new drums or rotors.)  It's also getting a new power booster. *whew*. Should hold it off for awhile. It'll be soon time for a new clutch.  I think the front end needs work again. But these can all wait, for now.    Poor thing has 210K miles on it.  and somehow i broke the transfer case nose cover and a piece of it is hanging off the front driveshaft. I dunno how that happened. it hasn't been off road forever because of the bearings.  My driveway gets pretty bad, though.... Come to think of it, the truck made a lot of weird noise when i went out poodling around in the snow this winter, and it may have been that piece dragging along the driveshaft. *shrug*.  Coupla minutes with a screwdriver should fix it. Bah.

He's going to paint it for me, and says he will fix the hole, too. i went up today hoping to fix it and clogged up the one piece of sand paper i had.  damn latex house primer.. that was smart, Keith.. so i sanded for like two hours on the damn thing and got about an inch around two sides sanded to the glass.  blech. I'll take duct tape next time. if i had duct tape this last time, i coulda hauled out, dried it off, laid the tape on both sides and made it back to the tavern without having to drag the fucker all over the place. The things HEAVY! It's 14, almost 15 feet long!   if i had more time, i'd say lets just sand all the freakin paint off, smooth it up real nice and gelcoat it, rather than paint.  cos if i punch another hole in it, i'll have to sand the shit off, again.

It was clear as the sun came up, and i looked outside.  10 minutes later i looked again, and the fog was so thick i couldn't see the neighborhood below me.  I chalk it up to a good size creek running about an 8th of a mile away, and a trickle of a creek less than 100 feet away. Plus, the slough is about 1/4 mile away, too, so i guess the fog just crept up here. I'm above it, so that's why its weird. I'm only at about 50 feet above sea level, too.

      well. the blogging community has gone on about the 9th circuit court's decision that "under god" in the pledge of allegiance is unconstitutional. Maybe. Maybe not. But we did ok without it being there until 1954. And it was only added to appease the McCarthyites who feared our turning to godless communism. When i was in high school, i stopped reciting it. The "under god" bothered me. I put my hand over my heart and stared at the flag, but didn't recite. How were the teachers to know i wasn't over the monotonous, un-comprehending drone of 32 other kids? Did any of us ever really bother thinking about the Pledge? Probably not. I just know the religious undertone bothered me. It seemed a sort of test. And, i suppose when it was added, it was a sort of test. How American are you, really?! Hmm? Let's just see.   well. no word on what's up with my remote directory on harborside. yet. i'll call as soon as i think tech support is open. if i can get anyone to help, that is. "yer what is what? Can i transfer you?" yes. preferably to someone who knows something about computers besides what's in the script, thanks....

Right. So that's the rough one.  It went through two other rewrites before practice tonight.    For the record, it isn't about my relationship with Dale.  this is the one i wrote for a friend, from her perspective.  I dunno how she's gonna react to it, though.

       urlLink LORD OF WOLVES: Music Rant   Someone else bemoans the loss of good Los Angeles radio.    This person was able to receive KROQ where they lived, but because i was on the west side of the PV peninsula, KROQ never came in worth a shit for me.  My station was 91X, KROQs sort of sister station in San Diego.   There were several other stations that i listened to.  Instead of KMET, i got KGBFM in San Diego.  Similar format.  I was never able to get KXLU out of Santa Monica unless there was a full moon, 5 mph breeze and all the damned planets were lined up.  Occasionally i'd catch the Brain Cookies show when i was supposed to be sleeping.    There was also KNAC, a purely hard rock station, out of Long Beach. Now an all-Spanish station.   KWVE in San Clemente had a 3 or 4 hour show for about 2 years that played great punk rock and stuff... it's where ifirst heard New Model Army, the Descendents, TSOL (code blue, of all the songs ...).  They went to a religious formant, but for some reason kept the 3 hour punk show for about four months, then it went all Christian.   Another station in Santa Barbara came in real well, and it was between KNAC and KROQ, format wise.  I can't remember the call letters.. 102 something, i think.    MARRS FM replaced... let's see... i think it took the old KLOS frequency.  They played stuff like Thrill Kill Kult. They lasted probably five months.  Then Pirate Radio took over (and i found a Pirate Radio Party Pig pin in my crap in LA last year...) and it was good for a while, playing mostly unheard stuff in the crunchy category. Then, blam, they went to a Guns n Roses LA metal type format.  I was heartbroken.  Pirate Radio also went off the air, about a year after the riots in LA ended.    I was driving to Phx with the moron i moved there with when Pirate went off.  We got it all the way out to Inyo or so before we lost the signal.  The first song Pirate played in its metal format was "Welcome to the Jungle".  It was the last song they played when they went off the air.  Two hours later, i arrived in Phoenix.   welcome to the jungle, indeed.

       urlLink XTRA AM 690   When i was a kid this was the radio station we all listened to.  i discovered FM radio in probably 1980 or so, when i was 10, i guess.    The MIghty 690 is where i first heard stuff like Blondie's "rapture", Queen's "Another one Bites the Dust" and Devo's "Whip it".  But i'm a little bummed out, because the rest of this page seems to be gone.

      oh yeah... the Charleston seafood pic was taken at the end of the life of the red i had dyed my hair.  as it fades out, it turns pinker and pinker.  Sometime last week, it was looking really terrible, so i took the last bit of blue i had, splorped it into my hand and scrubbed it around my head, did the same with the remainder of teh red, and kept doing it til they were gone.   No salon could do for $100 what i did randomly and for free, i tell ya.    if i had a buck for each person who said i had cool hair in portland, i'd be out of debt right now, perhaps.  could at least pay my tab at the bar, or pay what i owe a friend for helping with my car.. n stuff..

       Thing that is driving me insane, Number 3,102   A stupid bass solo. See, i'm trying to work one out for Diane, because it's an easy song, and even if i laid down two measures of solo along with nick in the solo bit of the song, it wouldn't be so busy as to detract from the song.  i have to get with nick on both of these, but this is what i'm thinking.  (* why the hell isn't this on the band page?!  because it isn't BAND STUFF dammit  . It's April stuff*)  Anyway, onward.    Idea one.  And this would be the one that's doing the driving insane, and the other one must just be a passenger... i want to run a walkdown under the solo.  Not just some bluesy thing, cos it isn't a blues song.  I can't figure out where to begin the damn thing.  Nothing sounds good.  Idea two.  which i REALLY need to sit down with nick and work out, or it won't work at all.  If nick kept his solo moving from the low end of the neck and worked it up to the higher parts, i could take it the opposite way and i think that would nicely capture the feeling of the song.    This is retarded. Agonizing over this. I can't believe it. *slap slap slap*. Oh, fer peet's saaaaaaake.   And shit. i hafta walk down to get some smokes, and i think it's raining?  Saw Sara and blaze yesterday.  Sara and shaun bought a house.  Why she's still with the guy, i have no idea.  I'd have beaten him to a bloody, reeking of cheap beer pulp by now.

      seems this last weekend was mighty unfortunate for a couple of people, i know, including D in Portland.  One friend booted her husband out because she caught his ass out  again  with another chick.  Another friend spent some time in the hospital with pleurisy.    On the other hand, i learned three people who i really like respect me.  Not sure what for, but it's a nice feeling anyway.   I've decided to try making my own set of tarot cards.  Can't afford to buy any right now.  I have paper, pencils, and know what the cards are supposed to look like. wee. It may take me a while. oh well.    I need to win the lottery. It's imperative.  Not specifically the powerball one or anything, i just want, say, oh, half a mil or so.

      regarding Ashley and Miranda, missing (now found buried under a neighbors concrete slab in his backyard) from Oregon City-  The fuckwad responsible for their deaths is merely following in his father's footsteps.  Apparently, Weavers father is in prison in San Quentin for murdering a girl and burying her in his backyard, and laying a concrete slab over the evidence.    Yknow, i can't help but think that if the parents of children kidnapped and murdered were allowed to get their hands on the killers, it would be a far better deterrent than just "court, jail, prison, parole", which is what tends to happen anyway.

      man.  what a weekend.  It's still saturday, too.. still have to get through sunday. ergh. Friday and Saturday were draining in every sense of the word.    Here's what i did.   I went to Portland with a friend of mine.  She needed someone to drive her up there, because she's sans license right now, but has a car. So i jumped at it, since i'd only been to Portland a couple of times. She wanted to hit the garage sales and then her sister's friend, a psychic, was going to do a reading for each of us Saturday morning.   Went up Thursday afternoon and got there around 9 PM.  Was introduced to everyone, then i immediately hit the sack.  Read my obligatory three pages of   urlLink "The Robe"  before my head turned into a lead weight.  (Not a particularly difficult book to read. Sometimes hard to digest.  I usually read at night before i fall asleep and three pages at a time seems to be what i've been able to average with this book.  good book, by the way. Interesting premise).   Saturday, i was up at the ungodly hour of 8 am.  I wasn't totally coherent and awake until around 11 or so, after we had been out hitting the garage sales for a couple of hours.  I scored some cool stuff.  Some Harley engineer boots, a pair of red spandex bell bottoms, coupla cool shirts, coupla kites, coupla pooka shell necklaces, a beavis and butthead necklace charm thing, a wicker purse i think will sell itself on ebay.  Total cost: about $15.  The pants still had the tags on them.  The boots are at least $100 new, and these, while not new, are still in really great shape, and were $3.  While we were out ogling other people's castoffs, we pondered what to do that night.  After consulting the entertainment thing in The Oregonian, we decided it might be fun to head up to Vancouver and see a friends band, Hookah Stew, play.  I haven't seen them in a while.  I really dig those guys.    So we got showerd and i got some decent clothes on, and, btw, it was unbearably warm in Portland this weekend.  Not Phoenix hot, but fuckin hot anyway.    Here's a little background for later... my friends brother-in-law is a recovering drug addict.  He has health problems related to his past problems.  Like, i think he's on a waiting list for a liver.    Anyway, we're about ready to go, when LD (we'll call my friend's sister that to help keep this straight, friend being LM) gets a phone call, and there's dead silence.  All i hear is "Did you call 911?".  LDs husband isn;t there. (he's the bro-in-law).  He's at a friends house, has been for most of the day, i guess. The deal is the people he's hanging out with think he took some morphine that they have a scrip for.  Obviously, someone whos got 15 years sober and a bad liver has no way for his body to process this.  The friends kept saying "oh, he's breathing"... right well people in comas often breathe on their own, yknow.. and he had been like that for at least four hours.  So we head over there, and no one's called 911 yet or anything.  The idea is we're going over to pack him into a car and get him to the hospital.  We get there and the D looks like, and i'm not trying to be funny, but he looks like if he isn't already dead, he was real fucking close.  He isn't breathing right. Totally unresponsive.  Stiff-limbed, dead weight.  They can't get him into the car.  They get him out to the driveway.  No one's called 911 yet. I'm in the street, just kinda going.. yknow, this is scary, cos i've seen people OD on a couple of different things.  The friend dude i hear him say "I''m on hold"... right.. 911 has you on hold.. not.  So one of the other women that we headed out there with got her cell phone out and called 911, because it seemed this guy was just stonewalling everyone on this.  D is still totally unresponsive.  Not breathing right. Irregular pulse.  He's taken morphine because he's been hurting, and upset over his treatment, apparently and this guy had some and offered it to him to help him sleep. Right.  Anyway.  To make a long story short, the EMTs showed up and i got to see the magic of a drug called Narcan in action.  They injected him and like, not 90 seconds later, he was awake again, though not coherent yet.  They toted him off to the hospital, where we waited a coupla hours until he was stabilized.  LD stayed there, and the rest of us went ahead and went home, because there wasn't really any point in hanging around.  The psychic stayed with LD because the other lady had to get back to the house and take her meds, and the rest of us were just dead on our feet.  It was pretty damn draining, just this incident.  I think we got back around 2 AM.  No hookah stew for us. No biggie.  As long as D was ok, we didn't mind missing the Stew.    Got back, hit the sack, read my three pages, and fell right to dreamland.  Around 4:30, i guess, i woke up to LD telling LM that she was back, D was back, and he was in their room, still not quite right, in a sort of waking dream.  Cool.  I just went back to sleep, and my sleep was much easier.    There was a lot of weird energy in the house this morning.  Not that i'm unusually attuned to such things, but, yknow, you can tell when its up and about.  The spirits are afoot, i like to say.  Like the first thing i noticed when i got up was that the windchime was moving, but there was no wind.   So, the other three got their psychic readings early, and i'm not sure what i was doing, but i didn't do it.  But LM had told LD that i knew how to read Tarot and runes.  Yeah, i do, but haven't dealt with either in any kind of seriousness for about 8 years.  LD asked if i would read for her.  I agreed to.  She had a sealed Angel deck and some runes. I've never used an Angel deck. Never even seen one.  I'm totally unfamiliar with it.  I usually used a Golden Dawn or a Thoth deck.  So i kinda read the little book that comes with the cards, flipped through them to check them out, shuffled them and went outside with them.    Now, i'm really kind of only half serious about this kind of thing anymore, though in the past the results i've gotten have been startling, but the thing with either of these oracles is that they can be very broad, very vague, or extremely direct.  LDs reading was... fucking right on.  So i do my little ritual i always did before, ring a bell three times to get the attention of whatever is in charge of this stuff. Cut the deck.  I do a simple three card reading- question, problem, outcome/answer.  I don't ask the person to ask a question.  I usually point out what the cards signify and let the person make the interpretation themselves.    So, the first card i pull for LD was one called "focus".  My fingers tingled.  It was weird.  This was the question card.  Next was one called Support.  Now, not only my fingers tingling, but my hands are shaking.  Last one was one called "Study".  The interpretations for these cards are pretty obvious.  It's a nice beginner deck or a deck for someone dealing with a lot of people and things can be read right into them without much thought.  This one was weird, because if you looked at the cards left to right, they pointed to Friday night.  Read right to left, they pointed to Saturday morning.  The Support card has 6 figures on it.  Six of us were involved the night before, and there are six of us again Saturday morning.  We figured Study was a direct shot at D, because Study also means a dreamscape, what you learn when you dream, and D was still in his other dreamkindaworld Saturday morning.  He wasn't, yknow, in the same world as the rest of us. And focus went either to LD or D, because they were scattered all to hell the night before, and they both had some very serious business ahead of them, with buckling down on Ds doctor about his treatment, and D buckling down on himself to make it long enough to get through it.   When i get weird readings like that, i'll pull the runes out and lay them over the cards and see if there's any clarification.  My brain is pretty numb right now, so i'm trying to remember exactly what the runes were.  But they really did clarify the rest of the reading.  My arms ached after all this, and i totally can't remember what the runes were.    LD was impressed, and so was LM.  So LM asked for one.  It's kind of not mattering now, what their readings were, because on the way home LM told me that i read pretty much exactly what the psychic had told them earlier.    Ok, i'm not a flim-flam new-agey person.  I don't use the vocabulary.  I don't pry information out of people and then use it on them.  I don't  know  these people all that well, so i can't read much into their personalities and tailor what pops up.  i mean, LMs totally baffled me for about a half an hour when it suddenly occured to me just how obtuse it was and managed to figure out what was being gotten at.  (Her first card was one called "Music"... baffling, since she isn't a musician of any kind, but the rune i pulled over it was eha reversed, which means a sort of stagnation). I popped up and asked her if she had been doing anything creative at all lately, and no, she hadn't been.  She's into crafts and needlework.  But that was the question spot. The sticky area, i guess. Her outcome card also baffled me... a card called Divine Guidance. The rune that went into that spot was eogh, "defense", reversed. It says set your house in order and wait on the will of the divine. Again, in a conversation on the way home, she said she'd been feeling like a headless chicken.  Again, what the cards and runes said was what the psychic had told her.  The reading had a sense of humor to it, because right after i asked her, i grinned and said she had to boogie down.  Cut loose, i guess.  She's really tied to a bunch of crap right now.    But i found it pretty bizarre, even for one who expects the bizarre.  I don't take a whole lot of stock in the whole psychic-fortune-telling thing.  I used my cards and runes for myself in the past.  I didn't generally read for other people very often because there's always this idea that people have that it's future-telling, when really you're just reading a current situation into some rocks or pieces of paper and forcing yourself to see something that maybe you don't want to, or another way of looking at a problem.    It was fucking exhausting.  I shook like a goddamn aspen leaf for a good two hours after this.  I put all the cards back in their box, the runes in their bag, rang the bell again and recited the Law and all i wanted to do was hit the pillows again and sleep for a week. I still had to drive the five hours back to Coos Bay, and i'm still dead tired now.  I can't sleep, though.  I'm overtired.    I'm going to get another deck, though, to see what i can see.  I still have my runes.. and.. here's something else that's funny.. i've been through three sets since 1989. Not because they get worn out, but because one of them tends to escape.  it's always the same one, tyr.  Sounds dramatic and all, but it represents the warrior energy.  Yeah. That one always just runs away.  So i've had three sets and that one disappears, so each time, i've gotten a new set.  The set i have now is missing it.  However, i have it tattooed on my hand.  I got it when i got out of rehab.  I'm going to make a new set, and maybe i'll be able to keep that one.   Things are weird.  The spirits are afoot. The rational part of me says it's all coincidence.  The Catholic in me says, "oh girl, but don't you just sin all over the place.. tsk tsk tsk" but the piece of me that believes there is a divine will, and it's a very small piece, peeps up and gleefully cackles "told ya so!".    for shits and giggles, when i pulled a card for myself that morning, mine was "Forgiveness" and i went, WTF?! I've already been through all that. Even the frustration i feel at my stepmom, i just move on with it.  I just figured i've been so eaten up over the last year about the towers, the planes, everything, maybe i just need to give it a rest.  That's what the Forgiveness card says.    Earlier, the first rune i pulled out of the bag was the blank one. For Odin, and the Unknowable. The first rune i pull in 8 years and it's that one. A symbolic death.  Ralph Blum's "Book of Runes" says about it, "Relinquishing control is the ultimate challenge for the Spiritual Warrior". (kinda flimflammy..) But what rune always escapes my bag? the warrior spirit. WHY???!   the stone is the path of karma. I'm progressing in whatever my aims are.   And one more thing.. before LD asked me to read her Angel deck, i was heading upstairs.  About halfway, i had one of those thoughts pop into my head, one that pushes everything else aside and says Pay Attention, Fool.  "Bright Angel".  So i stopped and thought it a couple of times, and it completed itself with "bright angel falling".  That was it.  Why's this so damn weird to me? Aside from the Angel deck thing, we'd all spent large amounts of time in Arizona. The psychic and the other lady had come up from AZ. LD lived there for several years.  LM had visited more than a few times. D lived there with LD.  I lived there five years.   Arizona is the home of  urlLink Bright Angel Trail .  Make of it all what you will.  I'm still sorting it all out.

       urlLink Parent permission initiative challenged     Read the last line in this article.  Backers of the initiative said it's aimed at maintaining parents' authority .  Shut the fuck up and go back to church. I think kids have enough problems without this implied left-field smack at other peoples parenting skills.  Stuff happens.  Kids need to know how to deal with it, and this certainly isn't going to help them.   Every election, we get all these dumbass ballot measures to help regulate and legislate everything we do in Oregon.  I like the idea that the average joe can get something on the ballot, but it never seems to be the average joe anymore.  it's these self-appointed moral police groups shoving their agendas on everyone else.  I'm about sick to death of other people deciding for me what i can do, what my friends kids can do, and blah blah blah.    Oh.  I got the text of the new ruling put forth by the OLCC about minor entertainers in places where alcohol is served. It's going to take me a couple of days to wade through it and get a grip on what it says, but on a cursory glance, i'd say the ACLU has a good chance of fending it off.   I may go ahead and post the whole thing here. it's some three pages long.   By the way, i had to ask for the ruling to be sent to me.  They don't yet have an online copy of it, and my local OLCC office is full of slackards who go home at noon.

       urlLink Linking Up   hope this goes to the post Dale made about the spirit vs. letter of the law, because if have something to add to it for him.  If the spirit of the law, or regulations, is not understood, the letter ultimately can't be followed.    And even more than the problems he mentions, i do think this is the root of it.  The people he works around are pretty well-indoctrinated that the letter of the law is to be followed without question, without understanding, and without further thought as to the true intent of it.  Sam Walton understood the power of the individual to make a change in his immediate environment.  I think that, despite the rule asking all managers to read his book, people are failing to understand it, thus blindly following what they are told to do, sticking with inefficient practices (because they work, they always have, they always will) and failing to see inefficiency and lack of forethought in the jobs they do every day.  They fail to see how what they do, or don't do, affects their fellow workers.  All that matters is the hourly wage, and the bi-weekly paycheck, and that in six months, they may or may not get a raise.  No one, it seems, has the gumption to look at how things are done and see the problems.

      Had a fabalus jam tonight.  I sang diane, the best yet, with the dudes.  then we played sunshine of your love.  Then i took the drums away from spike an he played bass and we did a jam that i just kinda played real simple on, and then we did red house, which i went bananers on.  its funny to watch someone who can only barely play an instrument go bananas on it, i'm sure.  But that's why i love the dudes.  I can be a total idiot the whole time i'm there and they're happy as long as i'm doing SOMETHIN.   take that, Billaaaaaay!  Tammis gonna work on jammin electric guitar.  That'll be rad.  She wants to do some rhythm playing.  We're gonna rock so damn FUGLY hard when she gets it down.  We'll be the loudest, tightest, in your facest band in the county.  NYAH! Hey man, gotta have goals... gawd that's just gonna be the shit. four piece band with a rhythm player/singer, lead player, bassist/singer and drummer.  can't beat that with a day-old salami.   funny part now about me kinda branchin into singing and drumming up there, it's a sort of well kept secret.  By the time i get to do it, the place has emptied out and we're down to like 7 people. pretty much always the same 7, too. so, even the people who know i play, and have watched me play for the last six years, they don't know about it either.  hehe.  can't wait to spring it on them at some point.  hey i can play bloodhound gang's fire water burn on the drums and sing it. i'll have to bust that out on the band one day.  they'll die.  rofl.

       urlLink Jim Marrs   Last night, while i was DESPERATELY looking for something interesing to listen to on the radio, i flipped over to the AM dial and came across a "Coast to Coast PM" or something like that, and they happened to be talking to this guy.  He didn't sound like a UFO weirdo on the air.  He sounded pretty grounded in reality.  He actually seemed like someone who approached the stories of UFOs with some kind of scientific mindset, which was pretty refreshing.  He cited stories going all the way back to the 1800s, up to a year prior to the Spanish-American War.  And he had done some ground research on his own, quite a bit actually, and some of it turned up some weird findings.    On the other hand, it's stuff like this that feed the conspiracy crazies.  Yeah, i did say crazies.  For a time in Arizona i spent a while learning/being involved in about a movement called "Constitutionalism", which is basically a group of people who totally discounted anything that wasn't in the original Constitution and Bill of Rights.    You wanna talk crazies?! Find these people... The US militia movement is a sort of shoot-off (pardon the pun) of the Constitutionalists.    In several of the seminars i went to, the only thing that seemed to separate the hardcore militias and the Constitutionalists were the fact that the militias firmly believed the world was run by Jews.  But the Constitutionalists had a lot of weird ideas outside how to interpret the Constitution.

Yukki Gipe was a madman onstage.  He never stopped moving, i mean really moving, like leaping, jumping, thrashing around, for the whole four hours.  He drank at least two gallons of water.  Some of my friends wrote them off as cheese metal, but i, having seen them, knew their secret and why they were so freakin rad.  I have their CDs, too, except for the last one.  It took some hunting over the course of about two years to find them, but i have The Gift, Swandive, Gimme Danger and another EP.  Insane.

       Excruciatingly boring non-event of the week   I bought a new sticker today.  i put it on my bass.  yes, i get excited about stuff like that.  this one happened to be a "Virgen de Guadalupe" sticker i got out of one of those machines you see everywhere for fittysint.  It's grey and black and silver.  Mui Catolico.  I dig it.  Its right below the pickup on the Ibanez now.  Virgen Maria is very latina looking.  dark hair and eyes.  I love it.  I'll have to get more.  the restaraunt i got it from is the best Mexican food place in town (and believe me, i've LOOKED) and a really swell lady runs it.  She gets Norteno and Pop bands to come up and play in the community center.  she was telling me she was trying to get a larger venue, so i told her about the new performing arts center at the college.  Better to have bands there anyway, since the sound at NBMC sucks SO DAMN BAD.  (nothing like sitting in a wood rectangle that just bounces the soundwaves all over the place, rendering it all as MUD.) I've seen some great bands in there, bands i know rock in a different place, but the stupid center just has the WORST acoustics.  Good for actual acoustic gigs, or vocal performances, but get amps and stuff in there and it's just shitty for anyone.

      So, after all that, i guess what i'm trying to say, dammit, is that i feel like i'm drowning right now.  That terrible feeling of pointlessness that leads me to consume entire bottles of liquor and inadvertently distance myself from people.  Not the terrible grey void i feel in the wintertime, but just as disturbing, with the potential to probably go that way if i let it, which i can't.  Because i get self-destructive.  And that is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, BAD.    And, no, i will probably not come on here and unload my problems.  That's just stuff i don't think the world needs to be aware of.    I unloaded a good deal at practice tonight, even though i felt listless and frustrated.  We jammed a good bit of an original song tonight that we hadn't ever done before.  Then we looked at the set list and thought, Man, we're all gettin so sick of some of those fucking songs, we don't even want to practice them anymore.  Hows that for the attention span of a common housefly?! Five months and we're ready to dump half our set because we're bored with it.   Er, sorry, that was a bit dropping off the dump truck (picks up the trash and tosses it back in the truck).  We'll have that dealt with in short order.  Indeed.

Oh well, in rehab they told us WHY? is one of those questions you can never get a satisfactory answer for, because the answer is never what you want to hear.    So maybe the fact that i always find myself pondering the blogs of other women is that i'm trying to figure us out.  I don't give a shit what color or preference they are, just that there are chicks out there doing it and sometimes i get a flash of understanding.  And, yknow, i can crawl out of my hole of bafflement for a second or two and think, "ok.. well, there's something i understand".  The joke amongst some of my friends is that i have a cold, little piece of granite for a heart.  I like to say i lost my soul somewhere and it just didn't feel there was any reason to come back.     I left my heart in San Francisco and my brain in Los Angeles.  My heart just made me bitter, my brain just made me dangerous   So they joke about this with me, and how cold i seem to be, and frankly, it's a sort of self-preservation effort.  If i let myself get drawn into other people's problems, i get drained of all my own energy, and that dumps me into a terrible state of mind.  So, i have certain levels of, er, well, intimacy with people, i guess.  People can tell me all the problems they want to, and i just have to let them go in one ear and out the other.  Nod. Smile. Because if i start offering things up, like possible ways out of a situation, i'm getting more involved than i can mentally/emotionally handle.  It's enough to keep my own head above water.    And this is where the cold-hearted april joke came from.  Tammi once said it straight up to me "You're a cold person". hmm. I nodded.  My friends only know the things i allow them to.  Sometimes that drives me nuts, because i'm not one to go unloading my shit on my friends.  But it has to go somewhere.  I try to put it all in my playing, but a lot of it needs to be verbal, i guess.  It's not enough to answer "is everything alright?" with "NYAAAAAARRGHHHHHH FUCKIT!".  that just invites people to start prodding, which pisses me off.  So, i'm F.I.N.E.  Fucked up, insecure, emotional and neurotic. i'm FINE dammit.  Fuck off.  (please give me a hug).

Doh... watch what i say, i guess, he may get his stamp out and send me off to camp.    Can i get a big "Fuck you, Ashcroft"?  He has no fans in Oregon, so far.  \  Perhaps the editorial is a little hotheaded, and maybe somewhat inciting, but the point is.... camps.  does that not send a chill down your spine?   What would constitute enough suspicion to make him take notice of you and send you off? Dissing the administration? Sitting in front of City Hall with an anti-war sign? What exactly is UnAmerican enough to warrant being sent to one of these camps? What state would ALLOW such a camp on it's land?! Gulags, stalags, redoctrintation camps, whatever.

Dale's a huge NASCAR fan, but i hate the circle track racing and only really like it when they do road courses, cos they all suck at road courses.  but IMSA! Yeah! And the cars are waaaay cooler looking, too.  NYAH!   Got to see a bit of PJ Jones racing in the Watkins Glen race on Sunday.  I dunno if this is the same PJ Jones i saw running one if his first races back in 1989-90 in the Volvo series at a Del Mar IMSA race, but if it is, great to see him still racing again.  The Jones kids all lived in Rolling Hills.

      Today was spectacular.  We had the regatta.  i was afraid no one would show up, but we had five other boats or so show up.  It was rather tough, further than i figured it to be, and took a bit longer than i calculated at first.  The other boats kinda ended up stopping about 3/4 of the way up (and 3 of them laid in wait for us in the canoe with Supersoakers..) .  Everyone had a blast and was happy they did it, even though Lori and I were the only ones to complete it.  No biggie.  It was meant to be a fun thing.  I wanted to do the race bit as a sort of confidence builder for myself.  I'm not a particularly athletic person, but i found kayaking and canoeing to be right up my alley and had something to prove to myself, i guess.    So, my arms feel like they are gonna fall off, i'm sunburned (even with sunblock), my lats are screaming, my belly aches, and my ankles are upset too over the fall down the stairs in my soopaflops.  (flipflops with 2.5 inch platforms... guh).  But i feel good, because it was one HARD race, even in the canoe.  When we hit the shallows it got difficult to paddle and make progress, at one point we grounded it was so shallow.  The way back was against the tide, and that was hard enough, but we had the wind against us, too.    We passed everyone else fairly early with a minimum of effort and soon they were out of our sight.  Coming back, we first ran into Mary and Francois in the paddle boat.  We were surprised they got as far as they did.. but they were having a grand time.  Then the Mayor was steaming upriver in his motorboat with Dale, Charlie, and a few other people on board.  they ended up towing the rest of the racers back.    So, yeah, it went really great, and everyone had fun, and i'm hoping before winter sets in we can get out and just hang out on the river for a couple of hours one sunday afternoon.  EVERYONE thanked me for putting the regatta together, and so i had a double whammy feel good moment.  1, i pushed myself further than i had before and succeeded in finishing. 2, i had no idea anyone would show up, like i said, so to see a bunch of people waiting was great!   The paddle i decorated as the prize will remain at the tavern. it has the winners names on it and everyone else signed it.    It was hot as shit up there, today, too.. the thermometer on the shady wall outside said 100 at noon.  I think its 10 degrees high, though, because it sure didn't feel like 100 to me.  Dale had a good time too, even though he was worn out from working all night and being up most of the day, out in the sun.  he'd never hung out with anyone up there and ended up with two of the bigger weirdos, the mayor and Charlie. The mayor isn't REALLY the mayor.  we just call him that.  Hizzoner Pancake.  Dale also got to watch the NASCAR race at Watkins Glen, so he was happy, and he got a bunch of pictures, too.    A terrific summer sunday.  If no other day for the rest of the summer is as nice, it'll be ok, because today really made up for it.    It was the inaugural race for the Allegany Yacht Club (har har!) and we are hoping to be able to do a couple of paddle 'n' picnic floats here before the rain starts.    Then, when the river gets wild, imonna borrow a friends kayak and take it out for a few hours.   Elle , move to the west coast.  :)  That;s right, pack it all up and head west.  I did it a couple of times, but went east, and always came back to the west coast.

      i often forget how many people i actually know around here, until a name comes up or something.  My ears are always open, though, to anyone talking about my band.. yknow, if they like us, what they think of us, what they don't like, blah blah blah, because i take all this information i've gleaned from other bands who've been around town here for ages, and i take the bits i hear from individuals who've recorded around here, and i listen to people who play when they talk to me, and i take all this info and file it away, because its shown itself to be extremely useful since March.  It's easier, and less painful, to learn from OTHER people's mistakes than it is to learn from your own.    So, today i went out, dropped the tape off at the clinic, then decided to stop in and see Hoover at her office.  Hoover is the drummer for another band that hasn't played much lately, and she was married to another drummer (what i wrote "get the hell off my porch or i'm calling the cops" about). Over the five years i've known her, every time our conversation turned to music, my ears went up and my nose twitched, and i paid attention.  She knows a lot of other musicians in town, more than i do.  Turns out that there were quite a few of these guys at the Sunday gig, and i just didn't see them or whatever, because i was actually pretty focused on playing.  One of them, a guy who i really dig- i dig his style and stuff- was there, and mentioned to Hoove that he though he could offer us some direction.  I.E. Booking.  Hoove told him to talk to me, but i told hoove it's the whole bands' responsibility since the BS with booking the run this summer. Since i don't know how to get ahold of this guy, i let her handle it and once i got to talk to him, or the band got to talk to him (we know where he regularly plays) we'd see what we could see.  As a four piece with a soundman we pay (yes.  even though Dale is my husband, we will still pay him for easing our load, which is what he does. it was so nice to NOT have to worry about how we sounded while he was doing the board), we don't end up with enough to pay someone to book us, which is why we do the work ourselves.  if this guy booked us into place that paid twice our usual, then, hey, yeah, we'd probably pay him for his trouble.    So, there is that.  While i was talking to Hoove, SH showed up (i'm using initials and nicknames because these people could actually get in trouble for anything i say here).  SH is an ad rep, one of my best friends.  We hooked up and started talking, after i berated her for not being there on Sunday.  Turns out she needs a band for the company picnic. She took me out for some grub, and thats when this was presented.  She asks me, "You know any bands that'll play for the company christmas party?"  I look dumbly at her. "How much is budgeted for entertainment?"  "$XXX".  "SH, girl, I dunno how you can sit there and ask me if i know any bands who'll play for a company party for $300. Let me get you a CD.  If anyone at the paper has any questions, you tell them to talk to GL on the CoC about us. "  So we talked about what kind of music we play and stuff like that, i got the dates, the price, the venue, and i'll be bringing it up with the band tomorrow, probably. i just thought it was funny that, after i good-naturedly tell at her about not showing up on Sunday, she asks who i know that would play this gig.    There is the question of the somewhat nasty emails i've fired off to her place of employment, but i think that can be glossed over fairly easily.  they couldn't be bothered to take notice of any local talent before, and now we're going to be right there under their noses.   _______  been reading The Grapes of Wrath.  I never got to read it before.  I think when we were reading Steinbeck, in school, i was reading Crowley. *rofl*

       Bovine update:   Apparently, the critter was okay.  I scared the shit out of it, literally, according to Loris husband, who went up to check the spot on the road on Sunday morning on his way to church.  (Allegany church i'll have to explain sometime.  It's not what anyone thinks...).  he said there was cow shit all over the road, but that Boyd's wasn't at the dairy.  Boyd's is a mobile slaughterhouse.    Talked to some other people, though, and they said a few days ago that guys cows had gotten loose and there were four or five of them on the road, which she had shooed and herded back into the pasture and then told him about his gate.  fabbalus.  It made me feel not-quite-so-bad.  If this dude can't keep his damn cows in their pasture (not a free range area), then he better not get upset when a cow/bull gets hit on the road.  I feel bad for the cows, but not the owner, in this case, who had been warned about his malfunctioning gate.  Cripes.  People.  Someone else mentioned that if i wanted to be a jerk, i should roll up to his house in tams truck and show him what his misguided cow did to it and ask him to pay for it.  Times are tough... i'm not gonna do that.  If it happens again, though, and i don't care what time... you better believe i'm gonna be bangin on that dudes door about it. If it had damaged her truck much worse, yeah, i would have been at his door at 3AM bitching. As it is, we can probably come up with the money to fix the truck.

      Saturday, we had a sort of gathering up the river.  a ladies meetin, of a sort.  It was a full moon, and the equinox, so it was focused on Hecate.  I read cards, and i'm not all that good at cards, and read runes, and marked the new runes.  I'm pretty good with runes.    We did this for Mary, because she's been in need of a lot of energy lately.  There were five of us all together, and my bits of thelemic/crowley-an teachings always drop numerologic symbology into everything. EVERYTHING.  It isn't even anything i can control.  Even funnier is i'm not a math person, but i see two digits and i'll add them up in my head and boink... "X is the number of, and with this astronomical phenomenon, and this card right here, you might be looking at... " So, i can get very confused sometimes when i'm doing this kind of thing, as i have the core teachings of 7 or 8 paths residing in my head.    We were having a goddess ritual... and here i was outside sacrifing beer to Odin (his rune came up more than once, and for Mary..) In fact, i got a ton of harvest/fertility/turning readings for her, including her personal card for the night.  Even when she wasn't there... Outwardly, yeah, she's got a big change coming, and we all knew it, but the purpose was to give her the energy to make that change intact.  All mine was gone by the end of the night, i'll tell you what. So, i do hope it went to her, because i was totally drained before we were three hours into this.    And i had a really strong sense of impending doom, was jittery and anxious, for a good week before this, and that thursday it got really, really bad.  It was carrying over to the people around me.  Mabh said it was because the moon went into pisces on Thursday night.  good enough for me... But the sense was still there saturday night, and i just figured it was all bout the gig on sunday.   Here's when it went away...  I had borrowed Tams car to get up there, an S10 truck.  Told her i'd take care of it and bring it back intact... etc.... Bringing Lori home, i was coming around a 25mph corner (doing the speed limit, because you never, ever, ever take the allegany road for granted...) and looming in my headlights- i mean i barely had the time to react- was a bovine.  I don't know if it was a bull or a cow, but it was big, it was red, and the fucker was right in my side of the road.  Here i made a split second decision- hit the thing full on and total the truck, or swerve and risk swerving too much and going over the side.  I swerved... hit the brake and kicked off to the left just a bit, and tagged it anyway.  If it had been in my truck, i would have destroyed my front right quarter panel (which has already been destroyed).  Luckily, Tams truck is lower, and in clipping it, i think i hit the shoulder. When i got lori home, we looked, and all i saw right off was that the front turn signal got mooshed.  The next day when tam came to get her truck, she was worried something had happened (after dreaming all was okay! my mom always said i was a psychic, and i spew my weird energy off to people far away)  and i had to tell her what happened.  She was upset first off, but then she was cool with it.  Nick was looking over the truck and said 'oooh yeah it was a red cow' .. on the side of the bed, where the tiedowns are, some red fur, and another dent.  No blood, though.. so i'm guessing the bovine just got stunned, and i really hope its okay.   I've only hit an animal once before, a squirrel, and i still feel terrible about that.    Then, Sunday... this is  good   They had come to get the truck sunday, and i was up really early.. unusualluy so... like, 8:30... so we arranged to go down and run through a few of our songs before the show.  We practiced til 11:30, i ran to get dale, came back.  Jeff had everything ready to load up, we loaded up and headed down.  Got there at 12:30.  The last band was just getting off stage.. they got kicked off, apparently.  Not quite what the committee had asked for.  Quite not, actually.   Looking around, i knew a lot of people there.  I knew some of the guys in the band we were following.  We set up, soundchecked, and had 15 minutes to stand around before we went on.    Everything went incredibly smoothly.  People loved us.  When Jeff did his drum solo, he did his barehand thing and hit his crash cymbal, and CRASH! It broke off the stand, flipped in the air twice, and landed on his lap.  End of solo.    Geno said he really enjoyed us and that he'd like to work with us again in the future... good things.  Yes, very good things.    The people who know us, and the ones who have seen my go from only knowing one or two songs and stuff, 6 years ago, just foamed about us.  It felt really, really good.

       urlLink theworldlink.com - Serving the Great South Coast of Oregon  Stupid local paper.  Look, i'm not annoyed that my band wasn't mentioned specifically. I'm annoyed that NONE of the bands were mentioned.  They took a picture of some dork doing karaoke, but couldn't mention the bands.  They managed to squeeze in some article about the stupid fucking emmy awards, (so VERY local, too) but couldn't be bothered about the local bands.    I sent the paper an email.  I also sent them one on Friday about misprinting my bands name. It wasn't corrected.  The one i sent, though, i just shot off that it was pretty lame that the hard work ALL the bands put into playing wasn't even acknowledged.  As if we somehow just magically swoop our gear down and plug in and just PLAY a bunch of music.   I hate the local paper. It's such a fucking rag.

       Confession:   I often have no idea what i'm doing.  I get by on pure bullshit.  Amazing.  Not, like, lying on resumes and wotnot... Just having only the slightest clue sometimes and then going for it anyway.    Which vastly overdue bill to pay first? Power bill? Water bill? Les Schwab bill? Garbage bill? Student loan is covered.. at least.. Internet bill? Maybe buy food? Nah, who needs food... Rent check for october covered, barely.    This sucks shark eggs.  Both of us working, too. Well, i'll scrounge up more work i guess.  Begging doesn't seem to have helped much in scaring it up with my regular job.  All this and we're looking at buying a house? Life is weird...   oh yeah... the house... our #1 pick is a choice little beastie.. and i spent a couple of hours talking to the realtor tonight.  Cool guy.  Place is about 5 minutes out of "town".  almost 5 acres on a salmon creek.  quite a bit smaller than where we are now, but, hey, it'd be ours.   hrm..   pros- salmon creek, deck, patch o land, ours, well water, near woods and golf course, less than 70K. payments cheaper than rent, i'm guessing about $200 less than rent.  Wildly guessing.  cons- 1 bedroom. no garage, baseboard heat.    haven't gone out and looked at it yet, though.  Ron says to do so, and get my W2s into WAMU and get back with him.  Exciting indeed! Everyone says he's a great agent.. a no BS guy.  My kinda agent.  I want no BS.   Found my old runes today.  Pulled them out of the bag and what did i pull first? The one that  ran away  several years ago. sweartagawd.  Caught LL as she was leaving and showed them to her, and in pulling a handful out with the crystals, felt my feet tingle.  Tingled all the way up to the top of my head.  Good thing :) I've missed them.  They've missed me.  They're going to be retired though, sadly, and a new set is in the making. I'll keep the old ones, but can't really use them because they aren't a complete set anymore.    Mary adores them.  She wants a set.  She wants the Ralph Blum book i got with my first set, too.  Which will be fun to find, since he's released a second edition with the simpering babbly name of "the healing runes".  have to find the first edition for her.  The newest one is all coo-cooey and like talking to a hardcore member of CoDA. (no thanks... gimme my "viking runes" please)

       urlLink Linking Up   permalink won't work, but the post in question is for 9-18-02.  Dale had sent out some emails asking candidates what their stance was on the brewing cauldron of intellectual property rights.  Two bounced, and he had to go searching around for different addresses, but the libertarian candidate did take the time to answer his question, in a pretty satisfying way... he's got it posted.  One thing Mr. Fitzgerald mentions is the "grateful dead model" vs. Metallica's attack on napster.  This is funny, in sort of a ha-ha way, i mean the whole metallica issue.. because..  I saw them twice on the "... And Justice for All" tour.  Once at Irvine Meadows with Faith No More (where i was in the nosebleed meadow seats) and once at Long Beach Arena with Queensryche, where i was 12th row on the floor, center.  At both of these shows, there were 11 rows of seating reserved for people who were recording. Not record company recording, FAN RECORDING.    Until Metallica did that, it was virtually unheard of except in Grateful Dead concerts.  When i heard Metallica was jumping on Napster, i was, to say the least, taken aback, considering my memory of both of those metallica shows.  That was... i would say, 1990 or so, maybe 1989, whenever it was that they were supporting that album.

I'm writing this as sirens go by on the street below.. are they all showing off their sirens?   Does this have something to do with the interagency narcotics teams? They're trying to figure out how to make the difference up now after having their free money (illegal searches, seizures, and auctioning of property belonging to people arrested for drug crimes).  Maybe that's it.  We don't allow that kind of shit in Oregon anymore.  Gotta have a conviction now.

      i had a really bizarre dream last night.  I just remembered it.  Some people (i don't know who they were) and i were at the Timber Inn (local bar) and there was a guy sitting at the end of the bar near the wall.  I recognized him as joey burns, of Calexico and Giant Sand fame.  Told him i had the 611 & the SOS album.  He was kind of a jerk... he said, "I'm not sure what you're getting at, do you want an autograph or something?" and i was like, no, i just wanted to let you know i have it.  I love the record. I STILL Love the record. I dig your bass playing, and i play bass, too..   but he was a jerk in the dream.  He acted like a typical PV surfgang dickhead, and it irritated the shit out of me.  Because in the dream, i wasn't trying to approach him as a fan wanting an autograph, but as a fellow bass player who i wanted to give some kudos to, as someone else who went to the same school as he did, and as someone who's admired his musicianship since 1984 or so.  He smiled condescendingly at me and acted like an asshole.    So, i don't know what it all means.  I didnt know him in school.. i think he graduated the year i went in as a freshman.  I know that when Dan had the record, i missed it.  It really is a very good album.  I'm annoyed because i can't find any way to get hold of him and say hi.

      One of my favorite things to do anymore is tell the people i deal with on a daily basis, Barb and the guys at the Mobil station, the Coach House Crew, Val and Sam, etc to come see my band when we play public events.    It's hard to explain why.. on the surface, i'm sure it seems egotistical.  But i'm always genuinely excited about playing, and i think our band is worth some attention.  Its partly a "look what i can do". I've never been so proud of myself. :P  I want people to see us.. yknow, to see that there's a group of local people doing the stuff we do.  Personally, i'm the least accomplished musician of all of us. Tammi's a terrific singer, and she gets better and better... Jeff is a great drummer, and together he and i make up a formidable rhythm section.  I do play fairly simply, because both Jeff and Nick go all out.  Nick's an incredible guitar player- at 19, give him 10 years and he's going to be one scary mofo.  What's cool is to see how his playing has evolved since we started.  He's been doing a lot of soundscapes... got a grip on the negative space of a song.  I just... i'm the glue.

      they ponder what to do with the WTC site.  I have my own humble idea.    If a building must be put there, and no owner of such a pricey piece of property would want it sitting there not collecting rent for him.. do so.  I'm no architect so i can't tell anyone what or how... but the memorial itself, i would say, a great limestone globe on a pedestal with all the names of the people killed engraved on it.  A shallow, narrow moat around it, with several bridges to cross it, and stone pavers on the inside ring. Perhaps, instead of stone, take the way a lot of people here pave their gardens, and reuse slabs of broken concrete from the WTC. and place a couple of stone blocks near the globe.  For sitting on. Or, if someone found a name near the top that they couldn't reach, to make a tracing of it, they could stand on one.    I take my idea from the Wall, which i want to see someday.

      Something else about trees.  We've had a really dry summer.  It's only recently, in the last three weeks or so, that we've had the morning fog.    Near the end of summer vacation, a couple of trees fell down on the road below my house.  Just fell over.  There are now seven or eight of them in various states of being cut up after falling down.  The other day, one came down on a power line up the river.  I don't know why, but i'm guessing (and i'm certainly no expert) that the ground is so dry that there isn't enough support to hold these trees up that are growing in sort of precarious places anyway.  It doesn't seem to matter how big or small they are, either.  They're just falling over.  Perfectly healthy ones.  I peer out behind my house at the bank.. what was once sand, now on its way to become sandstone of some kind, and the trees at the top... if any of them fell, it would land on the house i live in.

       urlLink Oak-tree killer found in redwoods, Douglas firs By BRIAN SEALS SENTINEL STAFF WRITER September 5, 2002   First.. i love santa cruz.  i fell in love with it ten years ago, just after the quake that leveled the downtown mall.  Now, the reason i linked to this.  It has been the policy of the timber industry to replant clearcut with Douglas fir.  Only Douglas fir.  Because it grows quickly. In Coos County, there are huge pieces of forest now planted with only Douglas fir. Timber farms.  They like to call them forests, but in reality, they aren't much more than timber farms.  I got nothin against loggers tryin to make a living.  They have to.  In an area where a good job means knowing the right person at the right time, i'll not begrudge anyone for taking what they can get.    But that's not what this is about.  I'm wondering what's going to happen to these timber farms when SOD makes its way up here.  We're already losing Port Orford cedar to another bug.  the fir and cedar tend to be big moneymakers.  Douglas is what the average christmas tree is (the other is noble, and there is one other kind).  I've always had a sneaking suspicion that monocological "forests" were a bad idea. The proof is looming, about 70 miles south.  SOD spreads in wet weather.  You know how oregon winters are... I'm wondering how long it will be before some of these replanted areas become big brown swathes of dead timber...  giant fires waiting to happen.

      My mom tells me...  that when i was wee, she could never get me to stay in bed.  So, her way of remedying this was to let me run myself til i dropped, literally, somewhere in the house.  then she'd pick me up and put me in bed.  It got easier as i got older, the getting me to go to bed thing, but not much.  Even as a teenager, i'd mope off to my room and just lay there for hours reading or listening to the radio or doing some stuff or whatever when i was supposed to be sleeping  I wasn't really afraid of the dark.  I think i was more afraid of the sleep.  I recall extremely vivid and terrifying nightmares, and i still have them.  I talk in my sleep, kick, flail around, turn myself into a blanket burrito.  When i was younger, and i finally managed to sleep, i'd wake up in the middle of the night facing the wrong way in bed, or on the floor, or crammed against the wall.  I still tend to run and run and run until i just drop.  I don't really like going to sleep.  I like being asleep, i think.  But only when its that sleep that nothing wakes you from until your good and ready.   Pot helps.  A lot.  With being able to sleep, among other things.  if i didn't  like  downers so much, i'd willingly take them to sleep.  But one of those is too many, and a thousand is never enough.  Valium makes me eat and eat and eat and eat.  That tylenol PM stuff.. i've used those a few times, but i get a sort of hangover from even the recommended dosage of them that i don't like.  Uh, i do know that it's a bad idea to drink even one beer and take one of those and try to drive anywhere.   ***  Dale and i looked through the real estate magazine and found a few that looked interesting.  It's exciting.  Our very own house! We also need a second car, or the bike running.. this one car thing is getting hard.  I'd want to buy him a new helmet too, when he gets his bike running.   ***  Last nights jam really was great.    ***  This is what *i* want in a house.  Dale has different wants, but essentially i think we want kinda the same thing.  A sort of wish list- 3 bedrooms.  A bit of land- space to try to grow things a dishwasher a washer and dryer a garage OR a basement.. or BOTH!  A shop for Dale  not too much to ask.

      terribly sorry for el silencio the past couple of days.  It's been... well, one of  those  weeks.    Tonight was the Wedensaday (ok, sorry for mispellings... 7 pounders of Red Hook will do this to you.. .blearg) night jam at the tavern.  For some reason, we all played with an unbridled passion and joy, heretofore unheard of since this time last year.    Started out with Spank Spike and the Nubtones, which is the usual crew of suspects... Me, Nubs, Spike, Bihner, and woody. Spike, the drummer, was late, so i was glad i brought Jeef (ML drummer, and drinkin buddy extra-ordinaire), because he did the drumming for the first few songs we did.  Then, we took a break and got safe.. because we tend to be dangerous... and stuff... then i sat down, because i was really whooped... and read through the current house-for-sale listings book... cos dale and  i pre-qualed for a nice size home loan.  then, Bev and Jerry (Brick Pig Family Blues Band, or at least 2/3 of it) arrived, and i played some drums to "red house". That was cool.  weeeeeee. i do love pl;aying drums...  hey man, not knowing how to do something never stopped me from doing it in the past.. ok? i'm a bass player, not a drummer...  ok so B&J played for about an hour, and rocked the house with the fabbalus blues they do.  Then Jerry said he  needed some audience participation for the next song, he needed some "ooh oohs".  As in, they were gonna do "sympathy for the devil" (how fitting).  I'm all over THAT. so we did that.. and at the end, after i had snuck in various other bits beside the "ooh oohs", when the original song has all the yows and whats my names... i wanted to sing but didn't knwo what, so i followed the bass line and just sang "dit diddly dit dit dit dit dittly dit doooo" kinda shit.. and, fuck, it ROCKED, ok?!!!! it freakin fuckin fe-doodlie-ooh-doo rocked.. pictures will be forthcoming, i think, and you will laugh, becuase i had no instrument to play.. all i had was a wood canoe paddle and a pen, so i was wackin the padle with the pen goin "doo didddly doo doo de doo doo what's my name" and shit...  so, after 7 red hooks, i'm like fuckin primed.. ready to go... I get to do some songs, and here comes Dave Carillo to do some jammin on bass.. no prob... i stood off and did some tamborine solos and maracas bits and shit.. Larry Eusted was there and that was fantastic because we never see him THAT far up the river... he plays acoustic usually...  but we did "Diane" and everyone fuckin freaked because we were finally able to do it while there was a bar full of people... and all those people were all "damn, april, how come you never sing?!" and the truth of the matter is that, hur hur hur, i can't really sing all that well... just on that one song, and sympathy for the devil.    I'm rambling. I'm fucked up.  gimme a break   So, for a few hours, it wasn't 9/11... it was sex, drugs and rock n roll, islamofascists be damned..   I'll tell ya what.  If Sharia was ever implemented in the US, if they ever got what they wanted, i'd be out there rockin, cos FUCK THAT. Take my bass and my music from my cold ass dead hands...   So i took the "dollar-a-sniff" pen and scribbled all our names on the ceiling with todays date, and "sex drugs and rock n roll" as my own, personal, heretofore immortal protest against religious oppression and blah blah  blah.    and the necessary  urlLink  reference   to what is, i think, the spirit of the US... i mean, regardless of what happened in the past, this is what i think defines us, still, over 200 years after the fact.  the big old FLIP OFF to those who dare trespass.      You probably know the story.  Rock is rebellion.  Get out of our way.  Music is straight from the soul.  A gift of the Creator.  We play because we have to, we've been given something that makes people groove, and dance, and be happy, and forget for a few hours the troubles of the day.. and we forgot... believe me, we forgot, and it felt so goddamn good.. i may have to go change my fuckin pants, kay? Dig.. and SHIT...  On top of it being the day it was.... it is also the a sort of celebration of the last year.  My friend Mary has run the tavern for the last year, and made a valiant effort of it... but she's giving it up at the end of the month.  The tavern is the first place i ever felt completely welcome... where noone ever questioned my motives, or why i might choose to do what i do.. in fact, they loved the oddball-ness Mary, Francois and I gave the place, and that made me feel really, really good, because i never had those kinds of feelings before.. no one... or, at least, no GROUP of people, has ever whole-heartedly embraced me as a family member as the people up the river have, and i'm eternally grateful for all the support and humor and love and unconditional understanding they gave up for us.    It has, without a doubt, been a year to remember.  I;m honored to be part of it.    So,   Mary, Francois, Nubs, Spike, Bihner, Woody, Terry, Sandy, Lora Lee, Neil, Bob, Kim, Jerry, Patrick, Polaris, Tom, Loretta, Bev, Jerry, Jeef, Tammi, Nick, Tammy, Howard E 1, Howard E 2, Fluff, Goose, AJ, Freya, Larry, the B-ball kids, Chuck, Pam, Al, Lori M, Lori B, Charly M, Steve, Tonya, the Floaters, Dave C., Carla, Ron, Uncle Jim, Mike K, Sharon K   and anyone else who i may have left out, i just wanna say...  Thanks for a spectacular year.  Even in the depths of my despair and bio-chemically induced frenzies, you guys were the part of what kept me going.  No doubt. Truth.  Thanks for more than i can even begin to list.  I doubt any of you realize that you've managed to help pull down years and years worth of self-doubt.  You folks never once resorted to maudlin sentimentalism.. were never less than straight up honest, were always there to laugh with me, even when all i wanted to do was cry.  It's another world.. and one i'll probably not forget any time soon.  The river folk were the ones who loved me before ML came together, and the ones who pushed me, musically, far past the point i ever thought i would go to.    *sob*  I'll miss y'all for the time the tavern is closed, but, S.S & the NT will be back... and we'll keep surprising you, and you better wear iron socks, cos we're gonna knock them right the fuck off.. no matter who we play with..   RAAAAAAAAAWK!

       urlLink frontline: faith and doubt at ground zero: transcripts | PBS   I was happy to see this.  Yknow, it goes on since then, that there were all these victims, and, i think by collectively relegating all those people into one word makes it easier to discount them.  Which i think is why we tend to just call it 9/11.  It's a sort of easy way to deal with and get over the collective terror of the day.  It wasn't one event, although it was one day.  It wasn't a big group, it was thousands of individual people. It was myriad little bits of coincidence, bad timing, good timing, planning, chaos.. all of this, killed all of them.   Those people had names.  That great, huge collection of victims was made up of individual people.    I liked the "Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero" transcript because it addresses a lot of what people feel.  It reminds us that those thousands had names, family, etc.  And i think anyone who says the US deserved it, i think they should have gone to ground zero, and seen what we "deserved".  I certainly don't think any of those people "deserved" it, and they were us, in the sense that they were like everyone else in the US that day, going to work or whatever, maybe planning lunch with friends or a weekend away from the kids or a vacation somewhere green and beautiful and cool.    One of my friends, when i go out with her, tells people i had family on one of the planes, and i wish she wouldn't, because it immediately sets me aside and turns me into something that draws pity.  It immediately makes other people uncomfortable and unsure how to talk to me or whatever.  And all i really want is to enjoy this bottle of Porter or whatever in front of me. I don't really want to think about all of it.  because since that day, that terribly bright shiny day when everything turned black, i've thought about it almost every hour of every day, and i've distilled a sort of rage into a little pinpoint of anger, instead of an all-consuming screaming hatred.  So, no, i don't really want to think about it anymore.  I'm out having a beer because i want a couple of hours where i don't have to dwell on it.   yknow, a kid from here was killed in Afghanistan.  I believe he came home in his box in January? Not sure.  I wonder if his parents friends introduce them to people as "Their son came home with a flag over his body".  it isn't really any different.   I don't understand.  I can't tell people i know how they feel about something, because i probably don't, unless i've had the exact same experience.  I don't understand how George and Diane's kids feel about what happened.  It's beyond my ken, as it used to be said. I don't understand how the families of people killed in the towers feel, either.  I just know how i feel, and that's simply a vague sense of losing something that had the same DNA, sharpened by the little knife of anger that i'll never get to spend time with those people, and how utterly unfuckingfair it all is.

      Finally, i can breathe today.  the last few weeks, since the beginning of August, i've been beset with sneezing, runny nose, etc.  No clue what causes it, but until i moved here, it hadn't been a problem.  Only in the fall.  When it's dry.  Last year, it went away in los angeles, and while it's probably funny to hear this about LA, i was able to breathe there.   It wasn't a problem last night waaay up the river at Bihner's house, either.  But it is at the tavern.  It isn't at the 22 mile marker.  It is in Eastside.  It was REAL BAD in Myrtle Point.   But anyway, i can breathe today.  It's foggy and damp.     _____  Bihner and Sandy are probably two of the coolest people i've met since i've been here.  They have a great house up on the west fork.  He's done all the woodwork on it himself.  Gonna have to drag Dale up there.  He'll  die .  They offered to let us house sit for them when they leave over Thanksgiving.  Hell yeah.

       a small moment, ingrained. Inappropriate emotional response in a moment of severe stress   I went to the tavern on 9/11.  They had a TV.    Steve and i watched the footage.  the channel had live feeds of amateur video taken that day.  One, in particular, and the subject of this post, actually made me laugh so i hard i almost fell off my chair, and it was hard to laugh, because i was trying so hard not to just fall apart.    A guy had his camera pointed up at the towers when the second plane hit.  You can hear the crowd around him, yelling and screaming, and you can see bits of chaos in the periphery.  As the second plane hit the tower, the guy yelled "Holy shit! Holy shit! Fuck! Holy Shit!" on live feed network TV.  When the screen returned to the newsroom, the anchor people looked like deer caught in a headlight of a speeding semi, and one, in a very serious voice, said "well, you can't fault them for the obsenities".  And i laughed. In all that scary shit, all the terrible stuff that happened, i had tears streaming down my face, and it wasn't because i was crying.    I sometimes feel terrible for laughing. But i try to rationalize it... i had watched so much up to that point, i was totally unable to even think straight about it.  All i could think of was "what the fuck?"  Then i bought a beer. and steve gave me a quarter for change. and it was a New York quarter.  I have it somewhere still.

WANTED: ONE EYEWITNESS TO HISTROY by Deroy Murdock  Have you seen this man?  I would like your help in identifying and locating the short-haired young man whose face the Associated Press beamed worldwide last September 11.  In an award-winning picture, AP photographer Suzanne Plunkett captured this gentleman running like hell as Two World Trade Center collapsed. Clad in a white shirt and dark tie with his backpack's straps over his shoulders, he races east on Lower Manhattan's Fulton Street with a look of sheer horror on his face as a menacing, white debris cloud races up Church Street, one block to the west.  I have wondered since I saw this world-famous image who this guy is, where he was that awful day, what he saw and how he has recovered from that trauma (if he has). Unfortunately, Ms. Plunkett knows neither his name nor whereabouts, nor has either of us ever seen him interviewed.  If you have any contact information or other details on this man, would you please pass along whatever you know? You may e-mail me at deroy.murdock@verizon.net  Feel free to forward my request to anyone else who might be able to help. I will write about whatever I learn from this eyewitness to the horror of 9-11.  Best wishes,  Deroy Murdock Syndicated columnist, Scripps Howard News Service   Just passing it on.

      the wedding we played at last saturday went great.  everyone loved us.  They couldn't believe they got us so cheap, either, so we'll have to fix that :P   Dale gives me a lot of input on the band, too, and i appreciate it.  It's hard to see the band from outside the band.  I see how things are setting up with us, too, and a couple of things i hope don't get entrenched as normal band behavior.  Like, totally discounting everything Jeff suggests. He does have good ideas.  he's just pretty bad at articulating them.  No prob. i can translate.   Missed monday practice, though, because tammi and nick were out of town.  That kinda annoys me.  i made the effort to be back from portland in time for band practice.  I was tired as shit, but i was there.    Need a drummer at the tavern tomorrow, so i have to figure out how to do that.  I might be able to get tammi to drive, or lori.  lori needs to go, though, so i'll call her tomorrow. We'll grab jeff on the way out.  if tammi wants to go, she can drive herself. blah.

      the other night, i had a dream.  a strange one.  i think i only remember my dreams if there is something in them i need to learn from, and i have bits of dreams in my head that i remember from years ago, still there, waiting for me to figure out what's been said.  I now have someone who is very good at interpreting dreams as a friend.  So, when i had this dream, a couple of days later i sent her a short synopsis of it,    In this dream i just remember feeling it necessary to find something.  I searched everywhere for it.  My house wasn't in the dream or anywhere else that was familiar.  At one point, i opened a door and saw a room full of thousands of raw chicken eggs.  In one of those eggs was what i needed to find.  And i had to break them open one at a time.  I don't think i found what i was looking for. I remember in the dream thinking to myself as i started frantically breaking eggs, "Holy Shit, i'm gonna be doing this until i die". A disturbing sentiment.  I wish i could remember what i was looking for.  A piece of jewelry or some trinket of some kind, i think.   It was disturbing to wake up to, because that was the only piece of it i could remember, and there was an urgency about the dream itself that bothered me.  i took a couple of hours to remember it, too.  At first, i just remembered there were eggs.  Then i remembered how vividly colored the yolks were and the sounds of them cracking.  Then the door and the feeling of needing to find something.  That's usually how i remember them, they rarely all come at once.  But this is what she said about it.   I find your dream interesting, especially at your age. You are beginning to consciencely understand what your unconscience has been knowing for some time, that you are searching for the complete and true "self". The door you spoke of symbolizes the opening of the conscience mind to the inner you. The eggs you describe (I find truly  Freudian you use the word "raw") are indeed all the complete "goddesses"  you will live out through your life. The "raw" you. But among those is the "one true self". The one you need to find. The true complete egg that is your wild woman, your complete self. The ancients have always described the egg as a symbol of the completeness of the self. It is complete in it's shell. You go rooster! Good dream and very important. Your unconscious has sent you a power sign that you are on the right path.   we are both of the belief that dreaming is the only time the subconcious can talk to us, in symbols. She's more versed in Jungian psychology than i am, but i know enough to understand about his archetypes and things.    Every year i do feel a little closer to "finding myself".  With the music over the last few years, it's really accelerated.  There's a comfort i didn't have before, a sort of purpose.  Of course, having a husband who loves me in spite of all my quirks has a lot to do with it, too.  But it doesn't solve my questions. Only makes it easier to pursue the answers.   oh.. I'm the rooster.  In Chinese astrology, i'm an Earth Rooster.    Cock a doodle do!   have a good halloween and a satisfying samhain, everyone.

There are 72-78 cards in a tarot deck, depending on which ones you use, i suppose... jesus sent out 72 disciples to do his work... 7+2=9 and 9 is 3 x 3 (er, that's rather arcane to go into here, actually), but, like none of it actually makes any sense in respect to islam.  Does islam take any stock in numerology, cards or issa/jesus?   Holy books don't often just drop numbers around without any sort of meaning behind them.  So, i ask, if anyone can tell me why its 72 doe-eyed virgins/pure white raisins (whichever it promises, that's not even my issue, mmm'kay?) instead of 34 or whatever... let me know.  It'll bother me.    look, i never said this blog was socially important, or a fount of current information, or even slightly interesting.

       urlLink Wallace & Gromit Films   ahhh...   First saw W&G in "Grand Day Out" at an animation fest somewhere.. might have been santa monica, who knows.... before i split for nashville.  1990? 1989? I worked in the defense industry, if you can believe it, making parts for missiles.   But before then i had seen his work on PBS one early ,early, morning on some weird show that had the acid pits in the CA desert and some near flooded town on the Salton Sea... but i saw his thing where they were interviewing zoo animals... damn, i can't remember what its was called, but it was probably six months before i saw the animation festival.  That particular period is quite blurry.  I lived in one of four places, all in Pedro.  I may have known Michelle by then, maybe not.  I knew Scott (Aicher), but we may have still been friends or may have started suffering from his "girls and guys can't be friends neurosis", which ended with me shoving him into a jacuzzi at a party when i was real drunk, and that party may or may not have been the one i saw the offspring at...but i'm pretty sure it was at the same house.  I believe i was working at Lunada Bay Unocal then, and that was before it became a Mobile station (And i worked there when it was a Mobil station, too) and now its a Texaco.  That was before i started smoking crack, so it was a  good  time.  Did i have the Galaxie? The Suzuki GS 400? The toyota corolla? Terry and i were still friends, Val and i were not.  Christian and i had parted ways over the Greg and Albert scene at 7-11.  Was it before or after i gave Ian his tattoo while we were both drunk on tequila?!   Man... oh man... So, it was before Nashville.. probably either just before the Gulf War or during, most likely before.

      i don't know whats going on in my band when i'm not around, but its pissing me off.  Two people seem to throw up all manner of barriers to anything the other two might suggest.  We book gigs, they bitch about them.  We have ideas, they shoot them down.    the thing with the booking still goes on.. neither of them do anything to further our getting our name out, but they feel they have every right to bitch about it when people come to us and want us to play.  They don't do any work for the band.  One, in particular, is really bad about it.    I see this as something of a generational problem, actually.  The two i'm complaining about have this sense of entitlement, the sense that if all they do is the bare minimum, everything else will be handed to them.  Both of them are under 30.  the remainder of the band are both over 30.  I'm not sure how else to put it.  An inflated sense of self-worth, or something.    So, we have practice tonight.  I've decided i've wasted plenty of time putting up with petty bullshit. We practice at 7.  I have stuff i have to do.  If we don't start by 7:30, i'm just going home.  I no longer try planning things around practice, since practice gets moved around, depending on how someone "feels".  I make plans and if no one can work around them, tough shit, but i've worked around the primadonna crap for three months and its getting fucking old.    I've already gotten worked over once for trying to book for us.  It's about to happen again.  There will be no third time.  Someone wanted a halloween gig.  well, halloween is on a thursday this year, and god forbid we play a weekday show, because lil wimpy has to work the next day (oh, but its fine for me to stand around and wait two hours for him to decide he wants to play at practice).  So i got one, for the weekend before.  What do i get for it? Grumbling and bitching.    I've made enough concessions to the spineless. Someone can bow to me for once.   Don't want to play in bars? Book gigs somewhere else.  Yknow, its not like i have nothing going on in my life that i can run back and forth appeasing these people while trying to get somewhere for us to play.  I have a job, too.  I have a husband.  We're trying to buy a house.  My house is a mess.  We need a second car.  I need better equipment.  I feel like i'm neglecting Dale.    This is hard to type, because i'm tryin not to sound like the asshole that they've, once again, made me out to be, but i'm pretty fucking pissed right now.

The paranoia of fire i have comes from living in dry, grassy areas prone to lighting up in late summer.  Got busted in school for setting fire to a bathroom trashcan because the smoke wasn't all the way out.    So, Bob, some of us have this ingrained need to NOT chuck our butts.  heh.

But no one would want Bela :(   talkin with dale about the eq situation.  i know i need stuff, but i know WE need stuff more, so i put it off, knowing eventually, i'll be able to get one.  Dale needs stuff first, though.    Egos in mirror are larger than they appear...  bwahahaha

      the maryland guy did it again.  Hindsight is 20/20, but i honest-to-gawd on sunday thought "he'll be back monday".    In a moment of dementia last night, i thought this:  When they catch this guy, they can kill two birds with one stone.  First, catch him.  Then send him to Iraq.  Tell him, if you can take out Hussein with your famous one shot one kill MO, and then get out of the country alive, we might reduce your sentence by 10 years.  (assuming he'd probably get life in prison for what he's done, 10 years is not that big of a concession).  If you don't come out alive, well, we've just saved the taxpayers money on your prison stay.  Either way, we win.    In my mind i've started calling the guy Union Sniper.  Cos he don't "work" on weekends.   I know, this is all terrible, a chortle at the expense of innocent people, but, cripes, man, just how much death and destruction can a weak westerner handle before they crack? Just like after 9/11, when i found myself hunting down people and things that would make me laugh til i cried, so i wouldn't start crying over it all, because i knew it would be difficult, if not impossible, to stop.     I know two people in Maryland. One is a very close friend.  The other is  urlLink Brown Crayon , who i don't actually KNOW personally, but enough to say if i met her in person, i believe i could call her a friend.  Lord and Lady protect the both of them.

      When I was a young man I carried my pack And I lived the free life of a rover From the Murrays green basin to the dusty outback I waltzed my Matilda all over Then in nineteen fifteen my country said Son It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be done So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun And they sent me away to the war And the band played Waltzing Matilda As we sailed away from the quay And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the cheers We sailed off to Gallipoli   How well I remember that terrible day How the blood stained the sand and the water And how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well He chased us with bullets, he rained us with shells And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell Nearly blew us right back to Australia But the band played Waltzing Matilda As we stopped to bury our slain We buried ours and the Turks buried theirs Then we started all over again   Now those that were left, well we tried to survive In a mad world of blood, death and fire And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive But around me the corpses piled higher Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit And when I woke up in my hospital bed And saw what it had done, I wished I was dead Never knew there were worse things than dying For no more I'll go waltzing Matilda All around the green bush far and near For to hump tent and pegs, a man needs two legs No more waltzing Matilda for me   So they collected the cripples, the wounded, the maimed And they shipped us back home to Australia The armless, the legless, the blind, the insane Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay I looked at the place where my legs used to be And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me To grieve and to mourn and to pity And the band played Waltzing Matilda As they carried us down the gangway But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared Then turned all their faces away   And now every April I sit on my porch And I watch the parade pass before me And I watch my old comrades, how proudly they march Reliving old dreams of past glory And the old men march slowly, all bent, stiff and sore The forgotten heroes from a forgotten war And the young people ask, "What are they marching for?" And I ask myself the same question And the band plays Waltzing Matilda And the old men answer to the call But year after year their numbers get fewer Some day no one will march there at all   Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me And their ghosts may be heard as you pass the Billabong Who'll come-a-waltzing Matilda with me?   - The pogues  Probably one of my favorite Pogues songs.  There's information to be had  urlLink  here  .  Including the fact that the last known survivor of Gallipoli died this last May.

       urlLink VH1.com : Artists : A-Z : Crime & the City Solution : Biography   aaah. actually, i'm surprised to find them here, of all places, on VHI.  They got ZERO airplay in the states, that i can remember, at least in LA.  I only found them because one day in the LA Calendar there was a blurb about them, because they were coming to town.  Looked interesting.  So i went out and bought the Bride Ship album, which totally rocked my world.  Still does.  man o man.  Must have been the year i was going in as a junior, because by then, music had become the only i gave a single shit about.   _____  Hmm. Yes.  Music being the only thing i gave a shit about.  I would drive my friends nuts.  they would haul out their records and i'd always have a stack of blanks.  They would sit and BS with each other and drink, and i would be glued to the stereo, just pounding beer after beer.  I often got so caught up in the sounds i never bothered paying attention to them.  I once listened to Bauhaus' "In the Flat Field" on acid in a completely dark room, with only the red light of the stereo for visual stimulation.  It was gone, so gone.    This is where the synesthesia plays out.  My friends all enjoyed the utterly visual aspects of LSD, but i was always planted in front of the stereo, and my mind wandered the fields, stairways, skies, plains, mansions of the notes.  Being in the black, dark room was the best trip, i thought, as long as there was some kind of great music playing.  How many times i've listened to the Moody Blues "Search for the Lost Chord", sober and high, and all the places it took me, all the things i saw.    The very first time i took acid, i asked what it was like, and my friends all said, "oh, its neato... (blah blah blah) see the sounds and stuff".  And i said, Hey now, wait a sec... see the sounds? That's a big deal to you guys? And they looked at me like i was some kinda nut... because for them it WAS a big deal, but for me, its an everyday occurence.  And its difficult to explain, because everyday sounds aren't as pronounced as music, of any kind, is. Every day sounds have muted shades, perhaps because i hear them so much.  Some of the sounds drive me completely up the wall, because they're colors i simply dislike (hm. like yellow.  Shades of yellow.  And some oranges.  I don't much like the "hot" colors, or the sounds associated with them). I never much liked listening to Spanish because its sounds are in the yellows, golds, oranges, etc.  It sort of hurts my brain.  Spanish music, on the other hand, the Mariachi, Flamenco, Tejano and Norteno stuff, i tend to enjoy, because the vocal sounds, those awful hot colors, are muted by darker reds and purples, and the threads in them are fluid and pull it all together in a way i can stand to listen to the bits i don't appreciate.  Well, Flamenco has no vocals, of course, so i'm all over that... and its mostly arpeggiated chords and fingerpicking, so each note and its colors and shades make a nice weaving.  Sometimes they bleed into each other.  The notes ARE the weaving threads.    This is frustrating.  Its difficult to explain how things are with it.  Like explaining a sound to a deaf person.  because people who don't have the experience, or never have induced it chemically, don't get it.  They laugh. They cock an eyebrow at me.  They nod and say, "ok, yeah".    I think i met another synesthete recently.  I think Sandy is one.  The way she cooks, and how she described the whole cooking process, makes me think she's got her taste/shape/color wiring all screwy.    Which brings me to dinner at the Bihner house last week.. FABULOUS.  Dale and i had a great time.  She was one of the people involved in the equinox night with mary, Laura Lee, Lori and me.  ANyway, the night before this, i had cooked my fabulous San Pedro chicken for Tammi, Nick, jeff, Dale, etc at Tammis house.  We got to Sandy and Jeff's house the next night, and she's cooked up something VERY similar... All these weird little connections we have.  Must spend more time up there with her and LL.  I can learn a great deal from both of them and i shouldn't be afraid to, if you get THAT at all.    the previous friday and saturday, tammi and i and steven (tams bro) took off the Powers for the night.  We had gone with the intention of finding a coat of mine, which i think is there, that was stolen out of my truck one night.  Very unique coat.  If any of my friends see someone wearing it, that person is going to be minus a coat.  I want it back in one piece, of course, but its okay if there are blood stains on it.   So, we went down there, but the coat was not to be found.  Instead, karma was pushing weird things around in front of us.  There was the man who tammis mom had married, who used to beat her, who had hit tammmi at least once.  Tammi finally got her mom to divorce him, but not until he'd pretty much wrecked the ranch.    So, this guy was there.  And we had much, much, MUCH fun messing with him.  STeven wanted to pound the crap outta him. I don't blame him.  But he said something to him.. we call him the parasite.. and the parasite went off about steven dealing drugs off the ranch and shit.  i was right there, in my blue hair and camo pants and looking weird for Powers, and the dude was saying this shit, and i just had to say "Oh, but its ok to hit women".  And i just smiled at him.  That's all i said to him.  The rest of the night, i just stared at him.  Cos it makes people nervous as shit if you just STARE at them. Tammi said he was trolling for new victims.  He trolled me, before i said that about the women.    But he was one of those BACs... born agains.. probably the most irritating christian of the bunch.  And yet it was okay for him to hit his wife and her daughter.  After we ate some onion rings, i went outside, and i had always wanted to say this to him, or send him a postcard with it on it, or something, but i wrote in my greasy fingers on his window, "God hates you".  Because i'm an asshole.  But thats not half as bad as what tam and steve did, and i won't go into that.    Like i said, Steven wanted to pound on him.  First, stevens on parole.  we had to remind him he just got out and pounding on people is just a bad, bad, bad idea when you're on parole.  reminded him the guy is a nonperson, and not worth the emotional expenditure.  So then Casey took to playing pool and roundly beat his ass at pool a number of times.  Then, the bar closed, and we left.   Next morning, there's the parasite, sitting on a corner.  He lives out of his truck now. poor guy (please note dripping sarcasm- karma's the bitch on wheels).  We were on one side of the street, steven on the other, and parasite on the corner directly across from us.  We hear a ting! There's steven, chucking rocks at the parasite.    fun weekend.  No, really. I hope his sleep friday night was not very good. I doubt it was. tammi told all these dudes she knew at the bar who he was and what he did, and they had been talking to him prior to that.  So, Powers being the 2-block town that it is, i bet he's some kind of pariah now.  Most of those country people dislike men who hit women.

Then we started talking about who and why, and what was funny is that we both get our information from essentially the same places, but what we actually absorbed was completely different.    If you read his blog, he writes stuff that's well thought out, pretty logical, non-whiney, etc.  You read mine, and i babble ceaselessly about stupid shit, i whine, i never shut up.  I'm not necessarily like that IRL, either.  In fact, i'm pretty quiet in person.

      Ok, even though Coos Bay is a port (or, well, it used to be, before the two local main industries bit the dust, but ships still come in for some reason... wood chips, i guess), there didn't seem to be much affected by the ILWU strike.  There were signs all over town supporting them, though, and one day i gave the thumbs up to a couple of guys with signs at the CB dock. There are usually two or three ships in here a week.  Not container ships, just chip and log ships.  And, in my eyes, barely ships, having grown up watching supertankers and container ships at LA Harbor.  ..anyway... the port has reopened today, and i've been hearing the ships blow their horns as they come around Simpson point at the bridge and again at Pony Point, which is about the halfway point to the actual port.  Sounds cool.  i like the way they sound. Happy. A "hellllloooooo! we've been sitting oustide the bar for a weeeeek!" sound.  (in this case, not the local bar where you can swill Hamms, but the bar... where the bay meets the ocean.)

      there was a "protest" at the city docks along the 101 the other day.  an anti-war protest.  Complete with No War for Oil posters and blah blah blah...   Had i realized ahead of time that i would happen to be at the docks that day, looking at a fabulous private yacht called Discovery, i would have brought a large supply of blindfolds with me for these people.  As it was, i had to walk past them, and it made me physically ill.   Someone on Instapundit mentioned this as the core of what peace-protesters don't understand- that if we send soldiers to die, they might, and it will probably prevent civilian americans from dying.  If we send no soldiers to die, american civilians probably will die.    Not much of a pundit, am i.  Nope.  Maybe the peace protesters don't need blindfolds. Already, they seem blind to the fact that there is someone who wants to kill them for no other reason than they are american.  It's okay with them, though.  Just don't send our "kids" off to kill for "oil". kind of reminds me of someone standing around saying "love your neighbor" while the neighbor has a gun pointed at their head.  Which, in turn, reminds me of the sad Native American cult mention in Seven Arrows.. that these magical shirts that the shamen dictated designs for repelled the white man's bullets.  With that in mind, the tribes rode headlong into battle with their spears, arrows and coup-sticks, only to be slaughtered to the last for it by the bullets.

       urlLink FM Query / FM List          Audio Division (FCC) USA   This is the process of apps for a station we've just started hearing in town.  Yay, its a hard rock station, plays zep, STP, Deftones, AC/DC.. it rocks.. but i never looked at one of these app things before, and it's kinda innerestin.  :P   First app is on the bottom. the one at the top is the most recent.  I can figure this out by how many kW its had going out.. til recently it was only 28... not enough to get over the mountains to hear.  Now its 100 kW.  plenty, though our reception is fuzzy.  Plus, i heard someone say FUCK on the radio on this station yesterday. *chortle*.

      Just heard a song by a band called Hi Standard.  The song is a cover of "california dreamin".    It sucked.    The singer is awful.  There is almost no bass in the song.  It just sucks.  Is the rest of their stuff that bad? It doesn't suck because its punk. Nope.  I do like that stuff, a lot.  It just sucks.  They could dump their bass player and it wouldn't make any difference in the bands sound.  If i was that bass player and heard the mix on that song, i'd be fuckin pissed. The lame singer and the guitar player get the front of the mix. Frankly, they ought to dump the singer. He sounds terrible.  His diction is shit.  He strains, and you can hear it in the song.  Sounds like he's singing through his nose.

Both drives involve scary rides on connector highways that wind along side rivers through mountains and such.  from 101 to the 5 is a white-knuckler sometimes.  during the winter, you watch for mudslides.  during the summer, you're always stuck behind some scenery peering idiot from British Columbia or something in a motor home or pulling a boat.  bah.   !

      sigh.. if your looking for the mixerman/lance diary, just click on the link for mixerman over to the left.  They've moved the lance chronicle link, and i'm just not gonna fuck with it.  There is a link to the lance chronicles on the main page of the mixerman diary, now.    My opinions?  Mixerman is a better writer, spelling problems aside. The band being called Bitch Slap is fucked.  Oh yes, in a big way.  They already have over 2 mil in recoupables stacked against them.  their record BETTER be a number 1, or they'll be paying it off for the rest of their lives.   Reading the diary makes me NOT miss Los Angeles that much.  Lance's attitude is too prevalent.  blech.   Lance is an idiot for making the move on Harmon's gf.  Whether its "just friends" or whatever, it's a stupid thing to do.  people who practice modern paganism live by a code called the three-fold law.  This just means that every thing you do comes back to you, three times as bad or as good as your original action.  Ow.   Lance is an idiot, for being pie-eyed at Shortypants' office.  Think, now.. the man has gold records all over the place.. so he's managing quite a stable of artists.  If he has 10, and 3 are making him a lot of money, why bother with the other 7.  Eeyore has found a drummer he likes, and exchanged numbers with him.  How much you wanna bet that Eeyore ends up dumping Bitch Slap and starting something with this new drummer?! hey, man, we do that kind of shit all the time in our small ass town with musicians.  People get passed from band to band all the time.  like the stupid girlfriend who dates all your friends after you dump her, when you got her after some other buddy of yours dumped her.  Harmon has a reasonable amount of smarts, i think.  too bad no one took that into account on the cruise when they were laying new bass tracks.

Now, i can identify some of them myself.  I can tell the difference between a Port Orford cedar and a red cedar. (the Port Orford ones are the dead ones).  I now know what a yew looks like.  Myrtles look like trees you drew when you were 5.  Wax Myrtles do not.  Hemlocks droop at the top.    So, i'm proud of myself.  I also finally saw what a real shaggy mane mushroom looks like.

It was some kind of spruce that we don't have here, but we have its relatives, Sitka and Norway.   I find this kind of stuff fascinating.  Don't ask me why.  It just does.

       I like  urlLink LGF .  I don't like  urlLink Greatest Jeneration  that much.  I think this is partly an age thing and partly that i just dislike her writing  style .  Charles is the quietly enraged guy, not particularly prone to exclamation points and clever twists of people's names. Jen reminds me of someone who is gripped with righteous outrage.  Charles is closer to my age.  Jen is closer to my mothers age. I see the same  types  of comments in both comments sections, though.    I also like  urlLink  Wil   a lot.    What i find disappointing though is that amongst the "unwashed masses", so many people find the other sides view to be SOOOO morally repulsive that they simply cannot abide a mere conversation with them.  I haven't actually seen this happen IRL, yet.  And its not just  pieces  of their view, but the whole thing.  I find i agree with and disagree with each side on a lot of issues.  I can't call myself one or the other, because neither of them fits me.   I'm so confused.    But there's this whole delinking thing happening, and thats actually what i set out to write about.  I think it's kinda funny.  Carnival of the Vanities, indeed!

       urlLink APOD: 2002 November 28 - The Supermassive Black Holes of NGC 6240   Here is why one should not get high and look at things like this.    How long ago did these galaxies collide? If you subscribe to the idea that with all the stars and systems there are in the universe, there simply has to be life, intelligent or not, somewhere, then you might look at this and think "Whoa".  Imagine being on a planet in one of those galaxies, and perhaps knowing that you and your kind were doomed, but perhaps not quite with the technology to know  why  you were doomed.  You just know that perhaps the stars in the sky have shifted dramatically since you were younger.  And maybe you would see the clashing of stars at night in the sky.  And there was nothing you could do about it.  For all you know, your gods have gone insane.

Yeah, i sounded selfish going on about traffic... but, as rare as traffic problems really are, here, it was astounding.  Sad to see we lost some guys.  I hadnt realized, actually, until about 20 minutes ago, that people were killed.  I went to drop some stuff off at Salvation Army.  To get there, you pass the Fire Station, and there were wreaths laid out and a table of food brought by local people.  SA is right next to Farwest Truck, and there were flowers on the sidewalk, and the street was closed off- they were doing some kind of press thing or something.  KOIN was there.

      ooh. i did have something marginally of interest to say today.  Normally, it doesn't take more than 15 minutes to get anywhere in town here.  I mean, one can go from Charleston to Eastside, and maybe that would take, oh, a half hour.  Today, there was STUFF happening.  It goes like this-  I decided i'd take some money i owe a friend.  She lives in Eastside, about ten minutes from our house.  Went to FL first, grabbed some caffeine.  Took off out of the albertsons lot, went left and headed toward Ocean blvd.  Ocean curves around and you can get a good speed up and its fun, and then it drops you into downtown Coos Bay onto Central ave.  Criminy.  About halfway down Ocean, there's a goddamn traffic jam.  Of all the.. we simply don't have those here.  I resigned myself to sitting in this and creeping along, wondering what was happening.  I toggled from the radio to the CD player and sang loudly to both, with the windows open.  We must entertain ourselves.  I finally get to where i can turn left onto Central, and see a bunch of cop cars, but no accident or anything.  *shrug*. So i toodle along down past BofA and onto.. what, 5th st i think. There are cops EVERYWHERE but.. all the engines are at the fire station there.  I finally wake the hell up about a block down 5th street and see a big cloud of smoke.  Jeez, it looked like beloved Salvation Army was on fire. Nooooo! Ok, its not SA... and its not the new Harley shop.. its Farwest Truck.  Farwest is a truck shop, full of neato stuff like fuel and oil and other things that burn and blow up.  But criminy, they have all the streets blocked off for three blocks any direction all around.  i didn't have my camera, so i didn't stop to take any pictures.  They would have been cool, though, because the ladder trucks were all out and they had their ladders up! And dudes up top with hoses! neato.  Anyway, another 10 minutes goes by as i try to figure out how the hell i'm gonna get to the 101 from 5th, because i've followed the nice little recently re-painted anti-traffic BS and ended up stuck on 5th.  Had to go ALLLLL The way down to Southwest Blvd (which has actually two or three names, depending on where you are on it) and come out by the pawn shop so i could get over the slough to Eastside.  Where, of course, i was stuck behind a yokel with in a gasping station wagon.  As i passed, i yelled for them to "get a godamn tune-up, will you?" and then was home free, and on the way to Lorettas.  Charlie was at the Roach.. er Coach House.  (i shouldn't say that. they have fine, FINE food... no, really.).  After i took loretta her money, i pondered stopping to bug Charlie for a bit, but decided to go on home instead.  This time i was smart and took the 101 all the way back home, but all the side streets were still blocked off and people were rubbernecking and it wasn't fun.  I did pass the El Conquistador, though. Neat boat.  Captain is possibly in a bit of trouble.  If you have a private vessell over a certain tonnage (300? I think..) you have to have a pilot come out and bring your boat over the bar and into the harbor in Coos Bay (not Charleston, for some reason).  That costs a shitload of money.  Anyway, this guy didn't do that.  And apparently, no one was at the Head watching the bar.  People are UP IN ARMS over this breach of "security".  We have a Coastie station here.  People are flipping out at the Coasties... but, hey, this guy didn't call the CG and mention he was bringing this boat into the bay, so, blame the dude, not the CG, fer pete's sake.  ooh.  i sound like a minnesotan or something FER PETE'S SAKE!

      Here's someone else with  urlLink Synaesthesia .    I don't really think about it anymore.  When i was a kid, i didn't think about it because i thought everyone else was the same way.  I tripped about it as a teenager when i realized everyone  was not , and then mostly forgot about it for awhile.   It wasn't until "The Man Who Tasted Shapes" was published that i gained an interest in it, in that sort of "Whats this all about?" way and then i pretty much quit thinking about it again. Once in awhile, i think about it.    I don't know what mine is called.  It's visual-aural.    I don't think of it as a "condition". It's just another facet of me.    anyway, i got this link from  urlLink  Cut to the Chase  , another PNW ring person.

      guh.  one of my friends was just sucked in by a conspiracy theorist. I really dislike these people.  they spout the most  absurd  shit.  My friend was told by this ignorant dork that "no one knows anything about the masons!" (because freemasonry is his current "conspiracy") and that he was unable to find anything about the masons anywhere online.  He must have searched with his eyes closed, because google returns  138,000  links with the search word freemasonry.    What a fucking moron.  Next on this guys list of things to do, of course, will be learn about and expose the Illuminati! The TLC! onwards to Constitutionalism and independent militias.  guh.  suckers.

      Apropos of nothing, i love Rain-X.  So much so that i can't wait for it to rain, so i can watch the water bead off my windshied.  Maybe its because the paint on my truck is so far gone that no matter how much wax i apply to it, the water no longer has that beautiful beading effect.    Demented, i'm sure.. but, whatever.   Should wash the truck more often, though.

      was just reading through the lileks "backfence" column, and the board they have there.  one subject is bad smells.  i couldn't register to post for some reason, so here are some bad smells, and where they come from.   Number 1 on my list of bad smells is the tide flats here.  Ugh.  In the summer, to have a high tide in the early morning that retreats throughout the day until most of the flats are exposed, and there they sit and stink until the evening.  Oh. Ma. Gawd.  Its like having someone wave a diaper under your nose.  Over and over and over. Its only worse when there's a fog.  Because the fog seems to carry the smell its its foggy body.    Then there's the paper processing factory smell.  There used to be a paper plant in Gardner, about an hour north of here.  You had to go through Gardner to get further up the coast, where, i forget, past Reedsport i think.. whatever.  The smell was enough to take your breath away, and the little town of Gardner was almost literally across the highway.  There's a paper plant on the 5 on the way to Eugene, too..   Port of LA smell.  I don't know what this is.  Its a large conglomeration of smells.  Some parts of the port smell very petrochemichal.  Some parts reek of diesel dust.  Some parts smell like tidal flats, fish AND diesel fumes.  A large part of the smell is the refineries.  (For truly icky refinery smells, try Carson).  One road around the port, i believe its the Road to Nowhere, the Henry Ford Freeway, goes  through  the Arco refinery, or did, i don't know anymore.  But you'd be driving along, come alongside the refinery, and there would be, like  no air .  You'd squeak a few hitching breaths, hoping for some oxygen, but there wasn't any.  It was a scary smell, i guess.  Not even a smell, really.  A state of non-air.    Another local smell is the chip piles.  Sounds wonderful.. yes, it sounds like piles of hmm, buffalo chips or something, but it isn't, and actually, in small doses, it smells good.  The chip piles are at the docks in North Bend. They are towering piles of wood chips.  Fir and Cedar, i guess.  For some reason, when its cold out, those piles reek. Like straight Pine-Sol.  It burns your eyes to drive by them.    Now, for some good smells.  the chip piles are  a combination of good and bad.. so, nice segue, i guess.    Racing fuel.  Specifically the fuel used by the IMSA cars.  i dont know what this is... 105 octane or something, but i love the smell of it.  Just  remembering  the smell makes my heart pound.  Its vaguely sweet, very strong, pungent and not very burny smelling.    Dirt. Local dirt. The dirt in the woods.  i guess its loam.  The floor of the woods here is so packed with pine needles and moss that in some places, its springy.  and every footstep brings forth that wonderful damp piney smell.  It smells like mushrooms, like a blanket that was hung all day in a cedar tree.    Ocean.  This is weird, because there's only one ocean smell that smells really good.  i first experienced it in an incense by Airs, called, of all things, "ocean".  It smelled so good, i thought, i wonder what ocean this smells like?! Now i know.  Out by Empire there's a little spot called Fossil point.  At low tide, the good ocean smell sometimes emanates from here.  Some days, its the stinky tide flats smell, but others, oooh.  It's vaguely salty, and fresh but slightly musky.  If you're wondering, get some Airs "ocean" incense.    Really good pot has a smell all its own.  like oranges sort of. piney and orangey.    Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee has an unbeatable smell.  So does organic Kona. Having had both, i'm deeply disappointed by all other coffee now. Nothing comes close to either of those.  Kona reminds me of my friend John Porter, whom i still miss very, very much.  Maybe he'll google himself one day and find this.    New leather.  Nothing smells so good!   ok, i'm done.

      and, you'd think, after seven months, i'd have more than 4 comments on this thing.  *rofl* ..   just like real life, i just watch, and no one sees me. :P   Do you ever go anywhere and sit and watch the people there, and think, "wow.  it's like a movie."  There was one night tammi and i went to the tavern this summer that was so surreal and weird...   it was warm, rather humid, with no wind, but the air had that bite to it.  It was early evening and the sun cast a goldness on everything.  We get out of the truck, comment on how bitchen it is there (because we do it every time).  I haul out the bass and lay it across my shoulder, like a billybag or whatever they are, with the curve of the side resting on my shoulder, hand holding the neck at the body joint.  From the inside of the tavern, one could hear some lynrd Skynrd song blasting out the door from the jukebox.  It was bright outside.  I stopped about halfway there and looked around, listened, turned to tammi, and said "it's just like being in a movie". because it  was .  it was unreal feeling.  I dont remember what happened the rest of the night, but the whole evening was like that.

      gah, i don't want to come across as some foaming christian-hater.  Because i don't hate them.  I often mistrust some of their motives.  I've been flagrantly, personally insulted by some of them in public places. Speaking to some of them is often like beating on a wall, or listening to a scratched record.  Some of them  openly discriminate against people who aren't "like them".  But some of them are (i think) excellent examples of their faith, adhering to the "jesus said love your neighbor, so i do" school of thought.  The only time you even get an inkling that they might be christian is after they give you a ride home in the rain and say "Good night! Jesus loves you!".  These people truly believe we are all God's children, and i appreciate that more than having someone else tell me God hates me for not acknowledging his book as The Truth.  These people, i feel, are the ones who truly "get" the teachings of Jesus.    that's not to say, of course, that i think they are the ONLY christians.  If someone says they're christian, that's cool with me, and i don't much care which splinter they come from, as long as it isn't being poked into my flesh.  I can't say who is and who isn't.  That isn't up to me at all.     I even sometimes wonder "what would jesus do?", but more like "What would i do if i were Jesus?" Who knows, man?

      Harborside recently introduced a spam filter.  it rocks.  really.  It catches stuff that looks suspicious and stores it elsewhere.  Then you just go there and check through it to see if anything isn't spam, and delete the trash, delivering what may be any good.    Today i went and checked my spam.  There was one email from someone at MSN titled "Whats up".  So i checked it to make sure it wasn't someone i knew, and it was one of those fabbalus big penis emails.  But what caught my eye was the address of one of the intended deliverees.  "Firstchurch@blahblah".  And i almost fell out of my chair laughing.  See, porn spam is entertaining sometimes.

      Its fabulously stormy this morning.  The rain has been on and off, but heavy when its on.  The sky is that purplish gray that says, "I mean business".  There has been lightning and thunder.  My gutters are still full of leaves....   Last winter, i had a terrible time.  Just terrible.  A mental thing, i probably have some version of S.A.D. or something and it got difficult to even get up and work.  I'm hoping it'll be easier this year, partly because i have this as an outlet (my work tends to isolate me... when you don't work with other people, you don't see other people, and you retreat further and further away from the world) and partly because now i know that it  could  be a problem, so i know to take action if i start feeling  that  way again.  The regular meetings up the river, although only once a month, will give me a day to look forward to.  Dale has now seen the depths into which i can plunge, so he knows what to watch for, too.  There's the music thing, too, and hopefully that will keep on keepin on.  With all of this, i'm hoping there's enough to keep from that nasty feeling.

       urlLink The Runes  I've linked to an interesting story about a person who was told to vacate her shop from a shopping area because her beliefs ran the wrong way as far as "the community" was concerned.   In my experience, "the community" is usually only the Christians of any given area.  I've run into this while putting flyers up for my band.  Excuses for "no" run something like this-  "we only advertise for community events" (translation- church sponsored activities)  "I don't mind, but i have to let the manager see it first" (translation- I'd put it up, but there's no church name on the flyer.  The manager is just going to throw it in the trash.  have a nice day)  "What kind of music is it?" (translation - if it isn't simpering praise music or God's own country music, you're going to hell)  So, you see, its insidious.  It creeps up.  "the community" doesn't include me and my band, even though we live here, spend our money here, send the kids to school here and patronize these establishments regularly.  Places that have let us advertise with them, we happily plug when we play.  I've even worn a T-shirt on stage from a great local coffee place because they've been so supportive of us.    Most of the time, i just end up thinking, "keep your stinkin "community", your self-imposed Christian ghetto, and shove it".

      Nice storm today.  It kinda built up all day, with some rainy bits here and there, and then blew in tonight.  Not particularly impressive, but, *shrug*, at least it was something.    Dale brought me back two candles from work this morning :) See, tol' ya he loved me.  One is a black and orange pillar candle and the other is a... a.. hmm, square candle holder with facial features like a cat and an elongated black pyramid candle.    Two things:    I'm always surprised to find black candles in big stores now.  It used the be  very  hard to find black candles anywhere except occult shops, and those were often the kind that dripped everywhere.   The candle holder was made in China.  It got me thinking.... they don't really have halloween in china, or celebrate christmas with the orgy of green and red like we do in the US.  What must these people think who make this stuff? Aside from, "oh, i can use today's wage to buy a bowl of rice"....

      the blessing of cloud layer.   as i write, its 39 outside.  its clear, though.  But its this weird, connivingly brutal cold.  Not like Minesota where cold really is fuckin cold, this is sneaky cold.  you think, oh, 39 isn't that bad.  It reeally isn't.  But its fuckin cold anyway! Is it like heat? where, once its over 100, its just HOT, and the degrees don;'t matter anymore? To me, it seems once it gets to 40, it's just cold.    Strangely, 39 when its overcast or "precipitating", it feels warmer.  Sometimes.   Um.  duh, well, shit, its cold, ok? I spent most of the night outside in front of a fire.  It was still freeeeeeeezing cold! whine whine whine   the big bad blue bathrobe of doom can't even keep one warm right now.  (its a royal blue, faux fur, ankle length bathrobe i use as a coat.)  its totally a pimp daddy coat, and really warm.   and my hair is Fudge "raspberry beret" now.    I don't know if i like it yet.  its more pinkish than purple. i think i have a beret this color? eek. Geez, i could dress up like a Go-Go with that.

       urlLink All Music Guide: This Picture   I just put a song by these guys on a CD for someone.   A Violent Impression  is actually a pretty good album.  I heard "Naked Rain" about the same time i first heard Big Sugar.    Which was about the same time Pearl Jam's "Alive" was getting a lot of play on MTV.  Hey, in Nashville, one finds the rock n roll refuge where they can, and that's where i was.    Once again, right then, music was all i gave a shit about.  More than usual.  Some people drown themselves in their work to escape reality.  I need/ed music.    I kinda think i must be rude or something sometimes.  if i'm driving someone somewhere, i don't really say anything.  I don't have much to say i guess.  (right, you'd never guess it...) but the stereos always on and its usually loud.  Someone once told me they liked driving places with me because they got to hear all this music of mine.  Made me feel all warm n fuzzy n stuff.  I had friends like that when i was younger.  I always wanted to hang out with them and hear STUFF.

      Whoa, it's really fuckin windy outside.  *prays the trees make it another winter*. S'posed to be 55mph gusts at the headlands (what exactly  are  "The Headlands"?) between Florence and Cape Blanco.  Oregon's bucolic Bay Area is right about in the middle of those two.    I made 5 CDs as gifts last night for people.  None of them have the same song on them.  That's obscene, isn't it?  Probably 3/4 of the songs i used we own the record, CD or tape of.    That's nothing, though.  My ex-roomie in AZ, last i talked to him, was working through ripping all his stuff, from vinyl mostly.  I can't imagine there would have been a hard drive big enough for his stuff at the time.  He lined the walls of a 10 x 10 room with crates of records three crates tall.  The wall on the right side of his door, i think, was CDs, and he just had bags and bags of tapes.    Dan Dan the Taxi man used to record all his stuff to Hi Vi videotape.  If John and Dan merged their collections? fuck.  Actually, i think Dan ended up selling off quite a chunk of his stuff.  Sarah walked away with a bite-sized piece of Johns.  Sarah - now that's a tale.  But this chick had such a negative effect on me, that 7 years after the last time i saw or heard from her, i still fervently wish she was dead.  All the sudden, it will pop into my head, "I hope that bitch is dead".

       Men and Toys   Dale wanted a ZipZap car for Christmas.  I got him something similar, but mostly because i didn't want to wait to order a ZipZap and i didn't want to go hunting around for one.  But he loves it.  All his dude friends love it.  Two of them have ZipZaps of their own.  These are grown men... :) They love their toys.  Legos are  THE  gift for any man.  No shit.    So i was watching Dale and Mike gleefully play with this little car, and i wondered where the hell are the toys i want? Are there even any?  I would like Legos.  I would like tools.  A nice set of socket wrenches (that had both English and Metric, and included the always elusive 10, 12 and 13 mm sockets... why do sets come with one or two of those, and not all three?!)   I heard Gluttn's CD last night.  Great production.  I think i'll have to get Nick over to Lori and Mike's so he can hear what Esperance is doing.    This song is stuck in my head today: (well, here's a bit of it, anyway)   I got up for a bite to eat and found my clothes inside the icebox   I used to stand on my two feet, but now i sit when my new wife talks      The Posies "Suddenly Mary"  Some 13 years after first hearing this album (courtesy of Mr. Scott Aicher) it's still new every time i listen to it.  Amazing that it came from the same place and time as Soundgarden and Nirvana.  I turned him onto NiNs "pretty hate machine" about the same time.

      At the last meeting of the Wyrd Sisters of Allegany, the discussion was about things we wish we could bring back to life about ourselves, and things we would like to see in ourselves die.  We all had very similar things we would like back.  It boils down to "where did our passion go?" for life, for getting up every day- just things in general.  I personally feel as if at some point, it was beaten out of me by "Real Life".  I once wrote a poem in which i said i felt like all my sharpened edges had been rounded off and dulled.  So, 5 women, and we all felt like that.  Some days you get up and wonder how you can go any further, and its great that you can, but why bother.    As for things we wish would go away, the things we make an effort to rid ourselves of, that was all very different.  For me its my cynicism (perhaps that's where that passion went, it curdled and fermented into cynicism), my narcissism (which is funny, because i had a degree of selfishness, but after rehab, selfishness became something necessary).  No, perhaps narcissism isn't the word, because i don't think i'm "the shit".  it's straight up selfishness.  Solipsism.  I have to make an effort to put other people high up on my llist of important things.  This is hard when your married... the other has to have equal importance, and what they like, want and need has to be remembered and thought about.  I have a hard time with that.  I REALLY do.  I find myself apologizing a lot.  I hate that.  not the apologizing, but the doing things that need apologizing, without even thinking about it.  Sometimes i probably take Dale for granted.  That he will be with me forever.  I forget that if i fuck up, really bad, that may not be the case.    The thing with keeping this, this online journal, that differs from keeping a book, is that you can lose or throw the book away and forget everything that was in it.  But as long as i keep this, i have to own up to whatever i've said in it.    If i say in 2003 i'm going to try to be less selfish, Dale can call me on it whenever i slide, because he will have read it here.  Because i have zero self-discipline.  he knows it.  I know it.  Jeez, do i know it... to that extent he keeps me out of trouble.  But i'm capable of getting into all the trouble i can possibly imagine if i discount what he tells me.  I don't call him the Smart Half for nothing.  I recognize idiocy when i see it, because its familiar as a pair of old Levis.  hehe.  That's awful, innit? I have my bouts of idiocy.  I have days where all i can do is be an idiot.  But, i figure, sometimes you just NEED to do something really stupid to get through the day.    So, i was thinking since the 5 wyrd sisters so fervently wish we had the lust for life and passion we once had, that we should get together more often and do silly stuff.  Like fly kites.  Play with legos.  Play dressup.  have slumber parties.  Doing silly stuff is important.  We did not have miserable childhoods.  We just missed out a lot on being kids for one reason or another.  freaky parents, working parents, inattentive parents, catholic parents- that's what we all had.    We aren't all the same age, either.  I'm the youngest.  The age range of the wyrd sisters is 32 to 54 (i think...) .  So there's a wide generation range with different issues.  For me, it's like hanging out with a bunch of moms.  Maybe that's why i like it so much.  My mom is far away and i miss her.  She doesn't have the URL for this blog.  That would be weird.  Some ways i guess i'm still a rotten 13-year-old, i guess.    Ok.  There's my heart emptying for the year.  This probably happens as often as i wear a dress.

About a week after i started learning about the Sex Pistols and Sid Vicious.   An information hound, i was familiar with the library.  There was no public access to the internet in 1983, either.  So, off i went, searching for information about Sid, and Nancy, and the rest of the Sex Pistols.    No luck in the books.  But the library had a collection on microfilm of the LA and New York Times.    So, i read about Sid and his death at the Chelsea, then i read what happened on my birthday all the way back to 1944.    Microfilm was pretty damn cool.

      and i thought this was hysterical.   This sticker is on a Coos Bay Police car.  I surreptitiously got the picture on night at Chevron, when there were 4 cop cars sitting outside and 6 cops inside savoring coffee and biscotti or something.     I took it because i thought it was funny.  "yes! This police car is smoke free! Good to know while your crapping your shorts because your  going to jail "  I'll tell ya, the last thing on my mind when i'm in the back of a police car is whether its smoke-free or not. Thanks, though!

      It's been raining steadily since yesterday afternoon. Not pouring, just steady, with some pouring here and there, and high winds, of course, once in awhile.  I went and tried to get some pictures of the waves today. First the jetty, because in the right conditions and in the right place, you can get a sweet side view of a curling wave.  I kinda did, but i think the waves were just coming from the wrong direction.  Went out to Land's end today! There was seafoam flying up the cliff, you had to lean forward at about 45 degrees to walk, it was hard to breathe if you faced into the wind.  Sometimes it was impossible to move forward, so i just stood there and  leaaaaaaned  with my foot in the air in midstep.  Had to open and close the truck door with both hands, and all my upper body strength! Was neato.. and there were, of course, other nutcases out getting soaked and blown around.

      Friday the 13th has never been a "bad" day for me.  Its never even been remotely weird.  Today it was bad once, and then weird later.  It was bad because my lead wire on my stereo made contact with my clutch pedal and burned up.  In the parking lot at walmart.  while i was trying to leave.  nyah.  It got weird later after band practice.  i went over telegraph hill to 10th st to make the right and there was something in the road.  I stopped to look because they had been working on the corner earlier with trucks n stuff.  But its a dude, laying in the road.  Right in the middle of the other lane! gah! So i asked if he was okay and he just seemed really, really drunk.  i told him to get in the back of the truck and took him up the road to a residental area and dropped him off.  He really didn't need to be walking.  But he left his backpack in the truck bed dammit.  so i should probably drop that off at the house i dropped him off.  but, tomorrow.    So that was the bad and the weird.

      i was looking through some webpages of synesthetes.  I hate how they call it "syn".  It seems to cheapen the experience.  Whatever.  A lot of them have their "color charts" out.  Cool.  I'm not going to go through all that hassle, but i will do some explaining.    As i mentioned, for me its sounds/colors.  Some sounds have shapes.  Some phrases have  scenes  attached to them, but i won't go that far with it yet.  For now, just the musical notes.     A  is mahogany.  Almost maroon.  But woodier.  The Ab is a duller hue, A# is more bright. An A minor chord is primarily mahogany, with some velvety maroon and threads of gold.    B  Deep, dark blue.  Bb is off-white, though.  A B chord is like the deep ocean colored.  It's always a very round sound, too.  C  Mustardy. Like French's mustard.  C# is slightly brighter.  Cb has more orange.   D  Green. A leafy, healthy green.  Like a fern.  Variations on the D chord (Dsus, Dmaj, Dmin) are shades of green.  Dsus4 is green like a spruce tree with silvery bits.    E  is brown.  Like chocolate. An Eminor chord has a reddish tint, but still brown.   F  Close to B.  Darker, probably could call it indigo.  Has hidden purple shimmers that come out when it's made into chords.  G  G is hard to pin down.  It's a olive-y, brownish, loamy color.

My leather from cripes so fuckin long ago  Now, i have been on a search for a long time for the perfect coat for the Oregon Coast.  I may have found one.  It was at Penney's.  It was a Carhart coat. A black one.  It was $80. And, i tell ya, i think i would sell off all my coats to get that one.  I would at least  get rid  of all my coats for that one.  Give the fringed one back to LL, sell the trench to Jeff.  I would keep my oldest leather, because i'd have to, but i would find homes for the rest of them.    Maybe tommorrow i'll get pictures of all the coats.  Make me an offer :)

      From today's  urlLink World  paper:     Bandon Cheese to be made, packaged elsewhere   By Amy Moss Strong, Staff Writer  After announcing last week that Bandon Cheese will no longer be made at the Bandon Cheese Factory, Manager Brad Sinko learned that packaging will no longer be done at the site.  According to Sinko, the Tillamook County Creamery Association, which owns the Bandon Cheese Factory, halted cheese production at the plant and will phase out packaging of the various cheeses made at the factory within the next month.  "They are shutting down packaging, too," Sinko said.   The last vat of cheese was made at the historic factory on Nov. 30.  "They are shutting down all the cold rooms and the packaging building and trying to out-source the flavored cheeses to be made and packaged somewhere else," Sinko said.   Tillamook Creamery will continue to market cheese using the Bandon Cheese label, but the product will be made at the association's plant in Boardman, he said.  Cliff Brady, Tillamook's vice president of operations, was in town last week to look at decommissioning the cheesemaking and packaging equipment, which will probably be sold, Sinko said.  The decision to move cheesemaking operations will likely be bad news for some of the 18 full-time employees, Sinko added.   "There's going to be layoffs," he said.   "Right now it will only affect packaging and cheesemaking employees and we won't be hiring any seasonal employees; just a few in the summer months for the retail operations.  "Eight employees will be affected and either reassigned or laid off," he added.  The Bandon Cheese Factory has been a popular tourist stop for travelers on the South Coast for many years. The retail store will continue to sell cheddar, flavored and specialty cheeses, among other items, according to Christie Lincoln, communications director for TCCA.  The Tillamook County Creamery Association purchased the plant and retail operations in May 2000 from Joe Sinko and Leo Mottau, both of Bandon.  Brad Sinko, who took over as manager last May, said a meeting to announce plans to employees has been scheduled by Tillamook executives for tomorrow in Bandon.  _____________________  Sucks.  That's part of the fun of Bandon.  They make killer cheese, too.

      yeah.  I'm gonna fight 35-40 mph winds (in town, probably closer to 50 steady out at the bluffs) to get some pictures.  Well, anything for the reading public, i guess.  Actually, its cool as hell to go out to Simpson Reef park during high winds.  There's always a stiff breeze there.  i mean, it could be dead still in town, and you go out to Simpson Reef and the wind is blowin.  It's at the very end of Cape Arago Highway.  I call it Land's End, because it reminds me of Land's End in Pedro.  There are other Land's Ends, of course, one in the south of Wales, i think.  But, i digressed again!   I've gone out there in  high  winds.  Probably on the stupid side, because trees blow over and block the road and with no cell, no one would know i was stuck out there... I've gone out and watched people  leaning out over the cliff , that's right, the 100 foot cliffs, leaning over them, and being held up by the wind.  Ok, i've done it myself.  What a feeling.  The ravens do it, too. They leap off the trees with their wings in, spread their wings when they get out, "stand" in the air and get blown back onto the cliff or the trees.  And they're having fun doing it.  They cackle and caw and and chuckle and do it over and over.  It's crazy.  But neat!

            This is why i look forward to big storms here.  I think the lighthouse is  behind  the wave, if it's where i think it is.  For perspective, the cliff is about 100 feet high.  Perhaps more.  I'm not very good at judging that kind of thing.  I know falling off it would be ... uh.. painful. One of the south facing coves, probably, since the best swells and waves seem to come out of the south.    This picture was taken last november and was in the paper on Tuesday.  The photographer was Susan Chambers, who i think works for the  urlLink  World  .    I'm not sure  exactly  where this was taken from.  I know the general area it's in.  At Shore Acres park somewhere.  I need to go poke around this weekend for some good wave pictures.  i haven't gotten anything like this, ever, and not for lack of trying i tell ya.

      I've had four songs rotating through my head for a week.    Audioslave's "Cochise" A Foo Fighter's song i don't know the name of yet The song the band is working on (we wrote it)  and this one which pops up about every two months:   Faith No More Angel Dust (1992) RV  Backside melts into a sofa  My world, my TV, and my food  Besides listening to my belly gurgle  Ain't much else to do  Yeah, I sweat a lot  Pants fall down every time I bend over  And my feet itch  Yeah-I married a scarecrow  I hate you  Talking to myself  Everibody's starin' at me  I'm only bleedin'  Someone taps me on the shoulder every 5 minutes  Nobody speaks English anymore  Would anybody tell me I was gettin' stupider?  I hate you  Talking to myself  You don't feel it after awhile  You take the beating  I'm a swingin' guy  Throw a belt over the shower curtain rod  And swing - - -  Toss me inside a Hefty  And put me in the ground  A drink needs me  I don't  I ain't about to guzzle no tears  so kiss my ass  newscasters, coakroaches, and desserts  I hate you  Talkin' to myself  Everibody's starin' at me  I'm only bleedin'  Where are the kids?  maybepregnantorondrugs  oronwelfareontopoftheworld  onthehonorrolonparoleontheDodgers  onthebackofmilkcartonsonstakes  inthemiddleofcornfields  oncoversoffuturehistorybooks  onoldlady'smantleswalkin'onwaternailedoncrosses  I think it's time I had a talk with my kids  I'll just tell 'em what my daddy told me  YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA AMOUNT NOTHIN'   ---- That's one of my all time favorite albums.

      April is, once again, late to the revolution.  I worked with film and a 35mm for so long, and had the joy of working in a darkroom at one point, that it's difficult to use a digital camera.  I'm used to composing the picture, setting up the light (usually in a roundabout way, because all of my 35s are old and unpredictable), bracketing 3 or 4 just to be sure at least one came out, and then throwing $11 away on maybe 3 good pictures.  There was a certain craft involved in getting a good picture, and then enhancing it or making it weirder/more impressive in the darkroom.  Now, my darkroom is paint shop pro 6, and i can do a lot with a digital and PSP, but things like long exposures or film pushing for grain and the like... can't do it.  Digital has its fine points, of course, and being able to look at what you've just shot is one, as is the lack of developing costs (this new digital will probably pay for itself by January.  I can easily spend $300 a year on film and processing, and that's using restraint...).  But the hands on, the craft, of photography, isn't there.  That's ok.  I certainly didn't sell any of my 35s off.  I don't intend to, either.    I have taken and manipulated some cool stuff in the last couple of days.  I have it in a Yahoo folder, and haven't put it on the harborside server yet because i have to clean it out.

       help meeeeeee   no, i don't personally need the help (well, unless you want to send money, in which case, drop me a note and we'll negotiate ;)).  I'm going to go on about insecure people online.    No matter what kind of site or group it is, there are always a few people who must have certain information step-by-step, or need their hand held through the process of choosing strings, wood, resin, spells, incense, whatthefuckever.  I dont know if they are incapable of experimentation, lazy, stupid, codependent, immature or what, but they're always there.  They clog the group boards on yahoo with demands for details any idiot could figure out on their own.  They clog the boards at PSW wondering what the red freakin buttons are for and what page of the manual has certain info.  they clog the boards (repeatedly!) at Active Bass with the dumbest shit you could think of pertaining to playing, buying, selling or learning bass stuff.    nah, it's hardly a new phenomenon, i know.  It just seems to be getting worse.  Maybe, or maybe not.  I'm not a hand holder.  i firmly believe in common sense and experiencing something for the experience.  If you need a goddamn manual for turning on your amp, either you're an idiot or your amp is just too complicated for you and you should go back to pumping gas, or whatever, maybe take up the drums or something.  (Then of course, you clog the drummer sites with stuff like "My foot hurts when i double pedal on this song, WHY?")  Maybe people think the internet is a magic wand.  a lot of people have no clue how to use a search engine.  They can code crap like MySql all day long but have no idea how to use google.    Rant's done.  Only half serious, of course.  Or am I? muahahaah

      i just got back from "test driving" the flash on the new digital camera.  (woohoo, btw).  Perhaps with a full battery i'll see better results, but either the batteries in it are supremely weak or they simply refuse to charge completely.  Good thing we got extras, i guess.    and, well, no, they aren't up yet.  because the dock thing-ay is on dale's computer.  I DLd the pix onto his, shut it down, came in here to mine to work with them, then realized i couldn't access his files unless his machine is on.  So, being lazy as shit, i don't feel like dealing with it right now. Maybe tomorrow.  pft.

      Today, on the way to the store, Dale watched an old dude in a conversion van with California plates make three dangerous and illegal maneuvers in the space of a mile.  He was in a hurry to get to Wal-Mart, i guess.  So Dale told the police and gave a license number.  Basically they said the guy was "driving while elderly" or something.  I don't see how that makes a difference.  As far as i'm concerned, he was driving while stupid.  If i can get a ticket for going 52 miles an hour in a 45 zone, i get annoyed when i see someone get off pretty free because their elderly.  That's BULLSHIT.

      haha!   My letter to the editor of The World was published!   This voting season, we had the opportunity to vote on funding SCINT (South Coast Interagency Narcotics Team).  Funding was going to be through an addition to the property tax. This additional funding had to come about because last year the people voted to make it illegal for law enforcement entities to seize and sell the assets of people accused of drug crimes.  Now, they can't take those things without the accused being convicted.  Which is how it should have been all along, because the old way was simply state-endorsed theft and sale of stolen goods.   Since they can't sell this stuff off now without a conviction, they are forced to actually do work for their funding, and get actual convictions.  This, hopefully, will give them the impetus to go after dealers, cookers and generally other people than the lowly addicts.  Not that i adore the addicts or anything.  Around here, the drug of choice is meth.  I won't even go into how much i hate meth or the people who use it.  Suffice it to say i wouldn't object if they were rounded up and shot, ok?  But, i digress.  I was talking about my letter.    So in the last few weeks there have been several letters wondering how in the world SCINT is going to fund itself now!? Oooh nooo! I think also if the community was involved at all, SCINT wouldn't have to work so hard, therefore would have to be funded less, but... whatever...  Something had been on my mind about SCINT and its funding "problem".  So i succinctly put it into one line and sent this off-   "Perhaps SCINT can take a cue from the chronically underfunded American public school system and hold a bake sale"   I went after them on two fronts, with one sentence.   1.  Much of the money that used to go to schools has been diverted, because of cuts, into law enforcement. The schools suffer, the law enforcement agencies stand around with their hands out, and kids go on unable to read at a reasonable level, unable to do long division by 10th grade, etc.  No education is a good starting point for someone who is going to end up using something like meth.    2. Enough whining, already.  The agencies that have suffered the longest as the police agencies have grown have gotten creative in how to get funding.  There is simply no reason SCINT should just have money handed to them.    People in this area are depressed.  Its not just the local economy.  There is a quality of despair you see in someone who used to make enough money to buy a house, support two kids and a wife and drive a decent car who is now reduced to working for $8/hour at the gas station.  Or has been looking for work for a year.  Or has had to sell everything they have to leave.    You see a new business start up somewhere.  You watch it, maybe go in and buy some stuff and talk to the owner.  They are ecstatic they have this opportunity, and chances are, they have one shot at making it work.  After a few months, the shop is gone.  It happens over and over.  They've probably bet the farm on being successful, and lost it.    The last thing any of them want to do is tack on another chunk of property tax.    So, yeah, let SCINT hold a bake sale.  Let them go door to door selling candy bars and citrus based cleaners.  Let them stand out front of Safeway with a bell and a pot.  They get no pity from me.

      having women as friends has done something strange.  Made me want chicky stuff.  Like, i want some sweaters, and i want to cook (there's a frightening thought) and do it well, and the gardening thing started a couple of years ago. So this is weird for me, because for a long time i've been happy with sammiches (if it can be made into a sammich, i will eat it as such, including spagettios and mashed potatoes).  And i'm very interested in procuring a salvia divinorum plant.  I'd like to add some to a meditation incense i plan on making.  It costs far too much to buy the dried leaves, and they do not grow from seed, but i found a place online that sells mature plants for $15.00.  Perhaps i'll do that in the next couple of months.

      haven't had much to say the last few days.  day? whatever.   exciting news: got pulled over for being a one-eye tonight.  Had no license on me (at friends, where i left my book thingie), expired insurance... usually a one way trip to a cab ride home and the impound yard, but for some reason, the officer was really, REALLY cool and let me off with a ticket.  I stopped and bought a headlight at wal-mart (a cheap one).  Amazingly, it was an OSP officer (state police).  It's not like i turned on the charm or anything.  I just sort of assumed this air of "harried, late, abesentminded single parent" or something and *poof*, no prob.    My friends adopted son (not legally or anything, he just spent more time at her house than his own house) is getting shipped out this weekend.  He's Army airborne, but not sure what division or where he's heading out from.  I met him finally at Christmas this year.  She put me on the phone with him. I told him good luck and to kill a bunch of bad guys.  Well, wtf else do you say? "Be sure and take out as much collateral damage as you can, and then dance on the corpses?!" He's not particularly worried, which i think says a lot.  Either we face a wet paper bag or he's lying.  Who knows.

       urlLink Wren's Nest - Article Detail   Wren's news tidbits are nice.  The comments always floor me, though.  The pagan community gets in an uproar about anything resembling "the burning times".  They've conveniently forgotten another faith who had a far worse burning times in the 40s, and its starting up again.  Just seems very small-minded of some pagans, and is one of the reasons i don't affiliate myself with any groups, covens, etc.  They fear the burning times so much, and it seems some of them really think it's going to start in the US (mmkay, whatever), but i think it belittles the experience of that certain faith who are still around.

      I'm going to make Chevelle her favorite treat tonight.  Chicken, tuna and cream cheese, all mashed up in a blender, with (if i can find them) some red rose petals, cos she likes to eat THOSE, too.    I'm sad.    Yknow, when i would get upset, or yell or cry or something, she would come up to me and meow at me.  It really upset her to see me upset.  I was screaming at my uncle on the phone once when she was still pretty small, and she really freaked about it.  Came up next to me and just meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow.  She has a bark, too. She has very good timing, i found out once, when we were listening to FNMs "Be Agressive".  She sat in front of the speaker and mracked at each kick drum for the whole song.  She never minded being on a leash, which probably happened three times. Her first ride in a car, she sat on the back of the front seat and berated me for my driving.  When i lived in Chandler, and i would come home from work, she was always sitting in the window near the entryway, waiting for me.  If i had to leave for a weekend, or any length of time more than a day, Dale said she would make him open all the doors and she'd search the house looking for me.  She's always been happy to see me.  She doesn't mind being in the cat carrier as long as she can see me.  She doesnt mind being in a car while its moving, but doesn't like the carrier all that much.  In fact, at the vet today, when i was waiting to check her in, she was howling about it, but as soon as i sat back down with her, she was fine.  And she rode all the way up from AZ in a carrier and was mostly mellow the whole time.    This really sucks.  I'm going to cry.

      Chevelle went to the vet today.  She has a glandular tumor of some kind.  I'll be taking her back tomorrow to put her to sleep.  I couldn't stand to watch her get worse and i can't afford the surgery, which is a 50/50 thing.  It may come back, it may not, if they excise it.

       A few months ago, my friend Lori got a canoe.  She was all stoked about it because we like to take my canoe out, but its huge to move around (16 ft or so).  She got one that was smaller.  She got a 12 foot "sport" canoe.    About a month ago, she took it out with someone who wasn't very good at canoeing... i.e. had never done it before.  She said it was really unstable and they ended up not staying out in it for a long time.  Mine is  unbelievably stable .  Tam had to stand up in it to flip it.    So we took Lori's canoe out today, to see if it was them, or if the canoe really was unstable.    It really is.  We went out together, and it wobbled and bobbled the whole time, so we took it back in.  I took it out alone, and it's a fucking hog. a 12 foot fiberglass water hog.  You get no pull on it. It reacts to your paddling so slow you wonder if you did any good. I can whip a canoe around in a circle pretty good, i must say, but this thing, jeez, it took probably 20 strokes to do a 360 in it.  Mine, at 4 feet longer, i can usually do a circle in about 5 strokes.  You give it a hard pull, and you go, like, 10 feet.    So we decided we didn't know what was up with it.  I can only think of two things: It's a child-size canoe (judging by the stern seat...which even my bony ass barely squeezed into), or its just totally a defective piece of shit.  We'lre leaning towards the total piece of shit theory, but she is going to see if she can take a friend up on an offer to trade it for a bigger one, and if he has problems with it, we'll know.    Its weird because proportionately, it seems ok, although maybe they could have shortened the angles at the ends and given more width in the belly of it, that might do the trick, but i'm not interested in customizing someone elses fiberglass thingie. It has a wide bottom with runners on it.  Real wide bottom, so i was really surprised at how unstable it was.    blah blah blah.  Here's a pic of me with the evil boy-scout canoe:       Its at Empire Lakes Park (now known as John Topits Park), and it's in my truck.  Thrilling, isn't it?   ____  apropos of nothing, did anyone see The Accomodator on Conan on Friday night? It was band practice night.  we were taking it  break.  it was on. we ALL almost soiled our drawers over it.

      well.  the gig at the Free Souls MC club went great.  In a rather funny way.   We aren't a well-known band around here. Mostly because there are certain places we will  not  play and we don't play every week.  We have a bunch of fans who REALLY like us, though, and they remember us when they stumble upon us again.    FSMC wants us back.    But anyway, jeef had complained a few times that people don't really get up and dance to our stuff.  We have some very danceable stuff, too, so its been torturing him.  It finally occured to me why this happens, and not just to us, but to other bands.  The audience is being passively entertained, like they're watching TV.  Ok.  Now that we know that, we can move on and figure out how to get them actively involved.  If i had a wireless system, i'd go out and boogie on the floor.    Another thing is that i think people are just plain old stunned by us.  Maybe that sounds arrogant, but you look out at people while we're playing, and their staring at us, gape-mouthed a lot of the time.  Stunned, i tell you.  Once we start seeing more return fans, i think this will change.  But, for now, people are still getting to know us, i think.  So, onward with the FSMC gig.. it went great! I'm not sure what they expected, but they were  very  happy with us.  Some of the people who have seen us before told us we keep getting better and better.  That's always good to hear.  They're listening, and letting us know how we're doing.  I'm all for it! Tell us when we suck and tell us when we're good!   We got some pictures and probably later, maybe tonight, i'll get them on the band page.    I decided my dream gig last night: At a hotel, where we could leave our stuff out overnight and it would be safe, where they gave each of us a room, and after we played, i could just roll into my room and  crash .  Cos that's how freakin tired i am after we play sometimes.  And you get all your energy drained by playing and talking to people, and at the end of the night, you turn and see  all this heavy-assed crap , like PA speakers and bass amps and guitar cabinets, and you have to somehow squeeze up the energy to haul that crap out and into the van & truck, then drive to where we practice, and haul it all out again.  Then drive home.  I tell ya, its usually around 4 am when i finally get to fall into bed after a show.  And i'm nearly useless the next day for it.  If Dale is home, he'll give me a backrub, which i ALWAYS need after i play, either that night (best) or the next morning.    The very worst thing is when you're coming up on a part of a song you know you always have a hard time with, and from where you are now, everything looks fine and you're heading into that part just right, on the right notes, etc, and GAAH! get an impossible itch on, like your neck or the middle of your back, or your hair ends up in your mouth.  Or, like what happened at the River Run, while i was singing my one song, a skeeter landed on my cheek and got a nice LONG dinner cos i couldn't get at it. By the way, the thing about dryer sheets really works.  After i got bit, i got a dryer sheet from someone and stuck it in my pocket.  had no more skeeter problems for the night.

       urlLink Astronomy Picture of the Day Today's picture is cool.  (btw, if the desc doesn't match the pic, go to the home link, and then cruise the archives for the day's date).  Anyway, the picture is a 'puter sim of a fullerene (buckyball).  It's a carbon fullerene on a hydrogenated silicon surface.    I read here and there about buckyballs and fullerenes in Dale's SciAm magazines.  I do love that magazine! I don't understand probably half of it, but the fun is in the reading and the trying to understand it, and then talking about it with Dale, who understands a lot more about it all than i do.  I say, "ok, so the blah blah from blah blah has this thing to it and then it does blah blah?" and Dale will say, "No, the thing has the blah blah, and the action of the thing causes this other blah blah, and the study was about the blah blah, not the yackety-schmackety" and i absorb about a quarter of the explanation, and my eyes glaze over, and i go, "duh?! What a wonderful thing! I dont understand it at all!"  So, my understanding of a buckyball is something like this:  Its a little ball of stuff, with more stuff inside it that got stuck there a long time ago.

So Strawberry Fields gave me hair like this:      Going from the red to the green at some point is going to be difficult without turning it shit brown.

      My mama kitty is sick.  She has a big cyst or tumor on her chest and she'll go to the vet Monday for it.  I may have to have her put to sleep if the ongoing treatment for it is going to be out of our budget (most likely, unless its a cyst they can just drain, but the lab work is going to kill me).  I'm not looking forward to that. She's still really spry.  She's 10 this November, i think, and came from Arizona.  She came up with Dale.  She doesn't mind staying with other people.  She stayed for two months with a friend in AZ at one point and was totally happy, and she was happy staying with Dale when i first moved here.  She rides in the car without any problems.  (don't really need a carrier for her). I found her when she was maybe 5 or 6 weeks old near a canal in the general area of 10th street and Indian School Rd in Phoenix.  She caught her assfur on fire walking by a candle once.  She likes to eat roses.  Just one of the coolest little cats i've ever seen.  My checkerboard boogarian, we called her.  She's a calico and there's a checkerboard pattern on the top of her head.  Her name is '66 Malibu Chevelle SS 396, but we just call her Chevelle. She once had a meeting with a spotted frog in Arizona, and it was funny.  The frog made this weird "cheeeeeee" noise, and she just sat and looked at it, looked at me, back at the frog, like she wasn't sure what to do with it or whether i was going to let her do anything with it.  She's gotten to play in snow and kept me warm by cuddling with me.  I'll sure miss her if i have to have her put down.  I have lots of pictures of her, at least.  *sigh*.

      I talked to my dad the other day.  Groundbreaking experience, to me, because he did a lot of talking about things i don't hear about from him usually.  He went on about my little brother and his trouble, and my little sister's cognitive disorder and the trouble they have with school (ongoing).  Now, i was a rotten teenager at times, but he says i had nothing on my brother, whos problems have become expensive in the legal sense.  I waited to get tossed in jail until after high school.  Don't get me wrong,  i love my little bro (going to be 18) and my little sis (going on 16, i think), but it felt GOOD to hear i wasn't so rotten after all.  Of course, my stepmom would never admit that, but we never got along anyway and i don't talk to her anymore because she just pisses me off so much.    Oh... dad & father are used in this blog to describe two different people.  So let me splain my family real quick, with names so no one gets lost.    Fred- biodad, my father.         Suzanne - Fred's wife       Alex - Fred's daughter (my half sister- she's 9)          Suzanne also has two other daughters by another marriage, and i can't remember their names, because i rarely hear about them.  Brian - my stepdad.  My Dad.         Liz- Brian's wife.  Sort of a stepmom, but i was never able to even get that close to her.  She's just kinda my Dad's now ex-wife.       Robert - my "little" brother.  Adopted into the family at about a year old, i think.  He's 18. He looks like a linebacker      Ashley - my little sister.  Also adopted, probably at about a year old, too. maybe younger.  She's about 16.   Dorothy - my Mommy.    But anyway, i guess my mom had called my Dad to ask for a referral for  a certain kind of lawyer, and he laughed (to me) and said, "I know a criminal lawyer, an education lawyer and a divorce lawyer, and i've seen them all in the past week, but i don't know any of the kind she needs".  So, that's where my Dad is at right now.  Much upheaval constantly happening amongst my family members.  But what family doesn't have that? If yours doesn't, you really don't know how lucky you are.

      it's 2001, and the peace activists apply 60s logic, slogans and methods.  Anti-war activists use '40s era terms to call the other side names ("nazis").  I'm not going to quibble about language usage, but i just think calling Israel a Nazi state is the dumbest thing a person can do.  Dumb. As in lacking smarts.    Perhaps, in 50 more years, when we have another big war, we'll call the people Ba'athists.  "You rotten Ba'athist!".  Yeah.  All makes sense, now.    The name-calling is reactionary, and that's why i hate it, i think.  I can manage to have a conversation with someone who believes other than i do without calling them nazis.  Its lazy and shoddy to do so.    Politically, i feel i'm in a weird place.  I'm not lock-step in with the current administration.  I'm not out shouting "Peace Now!".  I fear we have an enemy in our midst, the west as a whole does, and not only did we welcome them in, we let them abuse us for it.  We capitulate to their demands for special treatment, and they abuse us for it.  We offer them something better than crapping in a ditch and living in a hut, and they abuse us.  I think that's what i'm really angry about.    At one point, in AZ, a friend of my room mate moved into our house. She never contributed, always complained, and cried when we called her on her BS.  John was unable to unshackle himself from this guilt-flinging piece of shit for 3 years.  It was always our fault if something bad happened to her, but she was totally okay with staying there, where all this bad stuff happened, and leeching from us.  I never understood what this chick's deal was.  It was her purpose on this earth to drive the rest of us insane, of course. When you deal with someone like that on a daily basis, you really start to question your own sanity.  "Am i nuts, or for the last week has she saved us from having our house broken into 12 times?! That never happened, before.. the breaking in.. for a year before she was here, it didn't happen.."  Her reality was so fabricated we never actually were a part of it, i guess.  We were just these other people who slept in the house and bought food and came in and out on our way to and from somewhere called "work".

It was good.. i swear.. really.  here's the back part of my day:   Went to the paper to give Sara a ride home cos her car is pooped out right now.  While there, we find out that Joan's truck has also done something weird (i think its a bad coil wire).  So i'm standin there, tryin to prove my point about the coil wire to a guy who thinks i'm talking about the spark plug wires (um, no, dya think i'm a fuckin moron, dude?) and i hear a Screeeeee! Crashbang! from around the corner.  I figured, hey, add some excitement.. out in front of the paper, a car wreck.. woowoo i'm gonna go look.  So i go, and a crummy has hit a little blue car, just tagged its front corner.  And .... i see a small person with a big mass of black hair... and... i realize its Mary... and Mary has been sort of a basketcase lately, so i run over to see if she needs any help.  She does.  She's okay, but she's never been in an accident and isn't sure what to do.  So i help her out.  Poor thing.  My poor Mary! Gawd, i wish i could get through to that woman.  Love her to death, though.  Need to get her a Teddy Bear, i think.  She's been doing real well with the runes i made her though. She's one of those people who, when first shown the runes, takes an immediate liking to them, so i made her some with river stones and india ink and gave her my old Blum book on them.  (i need a new one now, but havent gotten around to it yet).    well, there was something else.  i just can't remember it.  So there's that.

Lucky for my body, though, i only get like that about once a year anymore. I'm not sure how i survived doing it every freakin day.  I nearly tore the top three layers of skin off my left arm once using a stucco wall to support myself with while staggering down some stairs.  Come to think of it, it seems my left side has taken far more of a beating over the years than my right.  Total hip arthroplasty at 42, here i come!

      i picked up Tool's Lateralus yesterday.  I can't believe i got it before audioslave, but there was a monkey on my back demanding the tool album.    Not something to listen to in the car.  It needs your full attention, for at least the first three listens.  Get it, go home, put it in the stereo, move the speakers onto the floor, facing each other, with enough space to get your head in there between them.  Turn off the lights and be alone with it for an hour or so.    If Tool had been around when i was a teenager, they would have been my favorite band.  Favorite now? Not really.  Good stuff, but the acid has worn off by now.  Most excellent production on it, too, i gotta say. And Justin Chancellor does this fast triplet thing i would like to learn on one of the songs.    Wonder if i can convince the band to cover "ticks & fleas".

      Here's a little bit about my drawing style, and how it came to be what it is.  Always, i've been more comfortable drawing with a pen of some kind.  When i use pencils, i tend to erase every single thing that looks like a "mistake".  With a pen, it keeps me honest.  I have to fix or incorporate any mistakes as i make them.  It's like working with black and white film.    Human figures and scenes from reality are beyond me.  I can do cartoony things pretty well.  My mom says i'm an "abstract impressionist".  Someone else told me i should be drawing corporate logos and things, (my drawings tend to be small.  The largest ones are on 8.5 x 11.5 paper) and that i had a good sense of negative space.    Until i was about 16, people rarely saw anything i drew.  Then one night some friends and i ate some acid and ended up at Bogdonovich Park in San Pedro (now military housing, i think).  Right next to the vons in the shopping center was a big ol can return machine.  There was a guy decorating it with black marker.  All he did was draw lines in various directions.  From a distance, and while frying, it was a really dynamic bit of grafitti, and i was impressed with it, and started messing with using something similar.  Hashing and shading and dots.  I explored that for a long time.  I think it was a combination of the acid and seeing what scribbling can look like when viewed from a distance.  Up close, its scribbles, lines.. from a distance, there's a lot of tension and motion and borders are well-defined.    Then i met Scott Aicher and absorbed some more about pen and ink.  I used to hang out with him and we'd draw, and sometimes i drew things that were obviously copies of his work,  but for me it was more of a way of working out how he did something so i could do it.  I think he understood that, because it was painfully obvious that my copies were so totally inferior to his originals.    I've always enjoyed lettering and calligraphy and writing in different alphabets, too.  Weirdly, i see a lot of Hebrew in some of the stuff i draw.  Not actual letters, but pen strokes and the flow, if that makes any sense.    At some point, i met Shane.  He would roll down to PV from Santa Cruz once in a while and show me all this ink stuff he was doing. He used a rapidograph pen and i became obsessed with these pens and pens that acted like them.  until then, i thought the Uniball was the shit pen to draw with.  But i went through an entire bottle of ink in the first two months of having a rapidograph pen.  That's the early 90s, getting the pen, and i'm going to post some of those pictures here pretty soon.  The most fantastic part of the rapidograph pen is that the ink lays down on the paper.  There is no ball or tip to interrupt the ink flow.  There's tons of control in how the ink comes out.  I love it.  I love filling in a spot so completely that no white shows through.  And rapidograph ink acts like paint in a lot of ways.  Each layer of ink is darker.  three solid layers of rapido ink is the definition of "inky black".    Learning to use the pen was fun.  It was a new way to draw for me.  So, when i was in rehab, and just after getting out, for about three years, probably, i was a drawing maniac.  Always black and white, always pen or ink.  I did do one really big piece (four foot by 2 foot canvas) with gesso and xylene art pens.  I got really high doing that one... with my face right next to the canvas inhaling those pen fumes.  I have a picture of that somewhere, and my dickhead ex-uncle has the original.  The more i drew on it, the more fucked up i got.  hehe.    Just recently i rediscovered ink.  I started drawing a lot of trees.  Trees lend themselves well to ink and my scribbly style.  I like the starkness of ink.  The things that can be implied with shading and stuff.

      Happy New Year  Not much went on over here.  Was pretty boring actually. Dale had to work. :( I was hoping we'd get to jam or something, but that didn't happen.  So i got a buzz on some redhook (MmM) and a bit o the green, and one of Tams lortab.  Then i started drawing.  Here, then, are:    The last thing i drew in 2002         The first thing i drew in 2003      Both are drawn with a Pilot Precise pen.  The top one is 5 x 5 and the bottom is 2 x 2.    They looked real cool with my eyes kind of crossed.

      the high school i was kicked out of closed about 3 years after i graduated.  I hated the people in the school, and had an abundance of problems.  Any, its been reopened as a high school, and i get the online alumni newsletter.  This one came on 2/6.    "February 6, 2003  PVHS Alumni,  We want to get you updated on whats happening at PVHS. Robin Mittleman, from our PTSA, has prepared some information to give you a feel for where we are at mid-year. You can stay updated each week by checking out our school website at www.palosverdeshigh.net Click on PVHS News. If you want to spread the word to other alumni, they can go to this same site to register to receive information. Heres whats happening:  With the end of the Fall sports programs, the Winter sports programs kicked into gear. Our Fall teams did very well for their first time out. The Boys Varsity Water Polo team was our first team to make it to C.I.F. The Winter teams included Boys Freshmen & Sophomore Basketball, Girls Frosh/Soph Basketball, Girls Varsity Water Polo, Boys & Girls JV & Frosh/Soph Soccer, Boys & Girls Surf Team, & Equestrian team. The end of these seasons is nearing at which time the Spring sports will begin. The Fall and Winter athletic teams have been very successful, particularly for a school of 475 students. We see a bright future in athletics as the school grows.  PVHS hosted our first College Night recently. The idea behind this was to introduce the Freshman & Sophomore parents & kids to some basics such as financial aid, the University of California System, and the private school system. We had representatives from UCLA, USC, and UCSB. Expecting about 60 people, we were overwhelmed when 200 plus showed upit was literally standing room only.  We also hosted an Open House for prospective and incoming students. Approximately 1200 people attended that night. We still have open enrollment in this district. The intent of the open house was to show off our new school and encourage enrollment. The feedback was very positive. Our visitors loved the faculty and the general excitement and enthusiasm with the reopening of PVHS.   Our Campus Beautification Club needs community support! The Green Club at PVHS has as its primary goal to upgrade and maintain the grounds of the campus. They can use donations of plants, gardening tools, heavy duty waste bags, & cash donations to purchase these items. Do you own a nursery where they could purchase plants at wholesale or you could donate plants? If you can help, please contact Dugan Miller, 310-378-8471, x.710.  NOTE: This Sunday, Feb. 9th, from 12-4pm, the music dept. is presenting the Sea King Swing. Money raised at this event will support the instrumental music department at the school. Come see our very own Jazz Ensemble open the event, followed by the professional sounds of the Sharp Sounds Big Band. All for only $25/couple, or $15/single. Come dance the afternoon away to your favorite swing songs from the 20s to the 60s. Desserts & beverages included. Tickets available at the door on campus.  Our PVHS merchandise is on SALE at or below cost on sweatshirts and planners. Contact Candy Afsa at 310-541-5420 if you would like to place an order. Limited sizes available. We also have a few PVHS Afghan Blankets ($55) and Stadium Fleece Blankets ($35) available. These make great gifts!   On Friday, March 14th, 2003, PVHS will present our spring Booster Club fundraiser at the Norris Pavillion. We have only one Booster Club for the entire school. We would love to have our alumni present at this function! It will be a fun evening filled with food, music, and gaming tables. More info. to come on this, but in the interim you can contact Laura Gregorio at 310-514-9122 or LTKG2000@yahoo.com if you want more details, would like to volunteer to help, or if you would like to inquire about gaming table sponsorship opportunities.  Improvements continue to be made on campus. We replaced the old benches in front of the school offices with new, red, PVC-style benches which read Palos Verdes. There was a Scout community service day where the troops painted all the old lunch tables & benches. Also in the planning stages is a College & Career Center to be housed in the old cooking rooms. This should be up and running sometime next year.  May 3rd, 2003, will be the MAIN EVENT fundraiser from which the Peninsula Education Foundation funds many necessary programs at all the Palos Verdes Schools. If you would like to make a donation of services, merchandise, or money, please call Britt Huff (PVHS rep.) at 310-326-5052.  We want to get our alumni back connected with our school. There will be a very special alumni-only participation opportunity available soon. In the works is an Alumni Walk, rimming Senior Park with bricks bearing our alumni names. More information will be sent in the near future.   Palos Verdes High School is truly back. We are very pleased with the progress in every area: academics, athletics, find & performing arts, activities, and facilities. We are very proud of our first 24 teachers, as well as our coaches and other school staff members. Our students are doing great. The campus is still one of the most beautiful in the nation. The parents are excited and supportive. PVHS will once again be one of the finest high schools in the Nation. Feel free to contact me anytime if you want more information.  Chris Bowles, Principal"  _________ I love it man.  A surf team.  We didn't have that when i was there, or an equestrian team.  If there had been a surf team, hell yeah i would have joined it so i could learn how to do it.     Mr. Bowles was the assistant principle when i was there, i think.  He's a pretty nice guy.  And he's right, it really is one of the prettier schools.  It's a block from the ocean.  Red tiled roofs.  Huge fields.  I've driven by it when i visited, but i'd like to go take a walk through it one time.  I could point out, still, all twelve of the lockers i went through. I spent a lot of time there even before i was a student, in my dad's Industrial Arts class rooms.  We'd ride our bikes over on Sundays and he'd get set up for the week, and i would draw stuff on the chalkboard (his students loved that), pester him about the machinery, read the tech manuals and textbooks, look at what people had made, or go sneak around the campus riding my bike.  During the summers, the pools were open to the public.  Even the high dive board! I learned to swim at a swim school, but ended up terrified of the water for some reason later on and went back to lessons at the high school.

Hardly, thats a little mosquito taking a stab at you once in awhile with natures own botulinium.  This is a great black elephant sitting on my head. Fear is the unknown, and i have an unknown, but hopefully not for long.    I wonder if i can drop a gray whale on the elephant and chase it away.   I listened to "Pretty Noose" today.

      Have i already posted/blogged this? I dunno.  I first saw this in about '89, when someone faxed it to the tech school i was at.  It was taped to the bathroom door for a while.  It was a terrible thing to put on a bathroom door.  You'd be waiting for a shot to pee on the break and have to stand there reading the poopie list, and you'd be laughing and it made you have to pee worse.   All recently made poopie lists are missing the most important one, which i have included, in bold, at the bottom.   The  (Compleat)  Poopie List   GHOST POOPIE: The kind where you feel the poopie come out, but there is no poopie in the toilet.  CLEAN POOPIE: The kind where you poopie it out, see it in the toilet, but there is nothing on the toilet paper.  SECOND WAVE POOPIE: This happens when you're done pooping, have pulled your underwear up to your knees and you realize you have to poopie some more.  POP-A-VEIN-IN-YOUR-FOREHEAD POOPIE: The kind where you strain so hard you practically have a stroke.  LINCOLN LOG POOPIE: This kind of poopie is so huge, you are afraid to flush without breaking it up with your pencil.  GASSEY POOPIE: It is so noisy that everyone within earshot is giggling.  DRINKER POOPIE: The kind of poopie you have after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait is the skid marks at the bottom of the toilet bowl.  CORN POOPIE: (self explanatory)  GEE-I-WISH-I-COULD-POOPIE POOPIE: The kind where you want to poopie but all you could do is sit on the toilet and fart a few times.  SPINAL TAP POOPIE: This kind hurts so bad coming out, you swear it is leaving sideways.  WET CHEEKS POOPIE (aka POWER DUMP): The kind that comes out so fast, your behind is splashed with toilet water.  LIQUID POOPIE: The kind where yellowish-brown liquid shoots out and splashes all over the toilet bowl and you.  UPPER CLASS POOPIE: The kind of poopie that does not smell.  SUPRISE POOPIE: You are not even at the toilet because you are positive you will only fart, but...(oops!) a poopie.  DANGLING POOPIE: This poopie refuses to drop even though you know you are done pooping. You just hope that a shake or two will cut it loose.  ATOMIC POOPIE: The kind that burns on the way out and it still burns hours after you poopie.  (I recall this one being the MEXICAN FOOD POOPIE)   THE FISHERMAN'S BOBBER POOPIE: The one little poopie that fools you and hides when you flush, and then when you come back the little poopie is floating around still. This poopie is closely related to the GHOST POOPIE.    I still laugh my fucking ass off at the poopie list.

       Bad Old World   Dear Justin, I know it's been a long time Remember all those nights we spent sitting up talking in your front room About leaving this worn out world and starting again far away in a better place Well that's where I am now - but still thinking about you   Chorus: I'm never going back there I'm never going back to the bad old world  I was travelling with Laurel way up on the north coast She's got family living up here in a nearby town We found a piece of land that looks out towards  the north sea islands across the bay And the sun is shining on the water today as I look out of our front door   Chorus: I'm never going back there I'm never going back to the bad old world  Are you still scared of the future? Well, that doesn't surprise me You could come up and stay here a while, back off from the killing wheel I used to think it was me who'd somehow sold out  or given in on some almighty cause, But what difference would it make? It feels good to be out here.   Chorus: I'm never going back there I'm never going back to the bad old world  (by New Model Army.  From the  Love of Hopeless Causes  album)  I dont know why i put it here.  Its one of my favorite NMA songs.  My life may be shitty, but i still wanna shake my fist at all the assholes down south who turned into corporate slugs.  See.  I  told  you i was never gonna give in to that.     Which, of course, is why we're broke half the time.  I do believe there is a happy medium.  I haven't come across it, yet.  But i will.

       urlLink BBC NEWS | Americas | Wonderful world of Wal-Mart  Whenever Wal-mart pops into the paper somewhere, i read it.  Dale works at the one in town.  It's the "best" job in town.  Right now, it's the  only  job in town.    They just expanded and are opening an LOF center, McDonalds, grocery section and something else.  My friend Mike works for the one of the soda bottlers in town, and said people were lined up all through the store on Wednesday to get applications because it's grand opening is in March and they're actively hiring right now.  Dale gets an IRA.  He gets stock. He gets health insurance, and it was decent insurance until this year.  They raised the monthly payment, and cut services to emergent services only. No preventative or anything.  That's retarded, and in the long run i, personally, only see it costing them more money, and they will cut services again and raise the price, and then you might as well just get OHP cos you're already a third class citizen so being treated like one isn't so bad. (please note sarcasm)    As far as i know, none of the local workers are involved in the suit against walmart about overtime and less than minimum wage.  They had a pretty ethical store manager in there for the last two or three years.  And the one before him seemed to be doing a decent job of it.  I don't know, i don't work there, and i don't really no any of the other "associates".     ____________  other stuff.    "Automatic female envy"   This is the cold shoulder tam and i get by maybe 1 of 20 women when we play somewhere.  I don't know what else to call it.  Its only present, really, in women who are there with their boyfriends or husbands or whatever.  It doesn't matter how we look, what we wear, how we act.  Somehow, they're immediately threatened by us.  It doesn't happen enough that it really gets my goat or anything (and, heh, girlie if i really wanted your prime example of a total fuckin loser, i'd have him) but enough that a pattern is emerging.

But he's one of the guys that made me perk up my ears to the bass.  That bassline for "Rio" ain't nothin nice.  yeesh.    and.. ehehe... he's aged really well.  *stimpyface*  i want to listen to some Duran Duran on the stereo in that vette.  That system is rad.  I heard stuff in songs  i didn't even know was there  in the first place.  So i wonder what all i've been missing on that album for the past 19 years. I MUST have a stereo that sounds that good.

And you can't kick them when they don't start.  And if something breaks, you can't just use a shoelace as an emergency repair.    i wish that zazzle button wasn't so huge.

       urlLink TCS: Tech - Freedom Rock!  A short list of libertarian tuneage.  Good choices.  I like libertarians.  Maybe i should register as one.  I've pondered it for a while.  Must do some more reading about them.  The Greens have always sort of irritated me, as a whole, and i never really went with the Dems or the Repubs on anything. (even more so now.. one is the chicken brigade, one is the army of god).  The Constitutionalists are whacko too, at least the ones i've had direct dealings with.  The Peace & Freedom party looked promishing for a while, but seems to have disappeared.  The Independent Party.. dunno much about them. That's Perot's thing, though, and i'll NEVER, EVER, for the rest of my (hopefully long and prosperous) life will forget the VP debate with his running mate (His name escapes me) and ... was it Gore?   I'll never, ever forget Mr. Newtie G, either, the prick.  So much for THAT revolution!

       urlLink Apeasing Hitler and Saddam   Got the link from Instapundit.  Saw that it was an Alistair Cooke article and felt i had to link to it, too.    When i was a kid, we had an Alistair Cooke book on US history.  Extremely good book, and i probably learned more about American history by the age of 7 from that book than four years of high school American history.    The man must be in his 90s now. When he wrote the US history book, i think he was in his 50s or 60s. I had thought he passed away for some reason.  I'm glad to see him still opining, still writing, still with something to say.  And its cool to have the words of someone who is old enough to actually remember the world in the 1930s.  Those people are being lost pretty quickly now.   { I removed some sentences here.  It's not self-censoring because i said something moronic, but because of privacy issues.  I'm unsure where it stands in legality considering my particular line of work.} I have no problem with saying moronic stuff.   I think its very important that the generations talk to each other.    He draws some interesting parallels in the piece, definitely.    Note to peace activists: the slogan  peace in our time  is not something to use on a placard if you want to be taken seriously.    In fact, most of the placards I see at peace rallies are so tired, so freaking moronic, that i'm embarassed  for  the people carrying them.  Last night i had a thought that struck me as weird.  It seems like the peace movement of the 60s has stuck its head into the 00s, and i really have no problem with that.  Protest for peace all you want.  But it seems so many of the 60s people are just trying to re-establish their cred and relevance in the world.  Its like having a 50-year-old mom who wears leather miniskirts and tube tops to drop you off at school in the morning when you're 15.

      Friday's gig, while fantastic, was an acute excercise in self-inflicted pain.    (notes to self):  1. The sweater dress is probably the second worse thing to wear on stage i've ever worn on stage.  Wool/cotton blend irish fisherman style cable knit.  Fucker must weigh 10 pounds wet.  I know cos i soaked it sweatin my  ass  off in it.  (Here's your sign, april) 2. The Krissy Snow boots... really, they're simply too small for me.  Nothing like cramming your feet into sardine cans with 4 inch heels for 5 hours.  (Here's another sign, April) 3.  Even in a smoke-free bar, the glasses may be the way to go.  I felt like my corneas were going to peel right off my eyeballs by the time i got home. 4: Bring glasses and contact stuff whenever you decide to wear the little plastic torture devices.   A lot of the people who came out were actually from out of town.  they're all going home stunned.  No one believed we were local.  Well, even the locals have interesting musical tastes, so nyaaah.  We didn't all grow up in this cultural vaccuum.    No really i haven't had so many compliments in one night, for a mere hour of playing, EVER.    I don't understand why its a big deal to see a woman in a band doing something besides singing.  I don't look at the gender of it anymore.  we're all just playing stuff and doing what we do and some of us have boobs and some of us don't.  It's a big deal, here, though i guess.  I only know one other woman who plays the bass.    speaking of women who play the bass.. Paz..Zwan.. ok i saw the Zwan video last night.  Did someone start Billy Corgan on Prozac or something? That "honestly" song borders on "sappy love song".  it had no balls.  But neither did that 1979 song. Man, that's one boring fucking song.    anyway, got some pictures and will put them on the band page sometime later this weekend.  We didn't get any of us playing.. grrr  anyway got too much to do tomorrow with getting set up for the Free Souls thing to deal with the webpage right away.  I gotta go to sleeeeeep.

      From an article in today's Register Guard about George Carlin (he's coming to town):    "I view the whole thing as sort of entertaining," Carlin said. "My theory is that when you're born, you're given a ticket to a freak show, and some of us know that, and many people don't seem to know that; they participate in the freak show.  "My fun is in observing the disintegration of this potentially wonderful species."

      i've written a fantastic song.  In my head, at least.  I can actually sing the chorus of it, and i solidly hear the bass line that goes through the chorus.  The rest is a little more difficult.  The hardest part, for me, about writing a song, is getting it from my brain onto paper.  Should brush up on the notation reading and writing, probably.    Songs just appear in my head.  I'll be standing around, and *woomp* a bass line appears out of nowhere... When i realize whats happening i find a pen, and scribble some stuff out.  Maybe the proper chords, may just be a series of chords that just move with the effect i need, and then figure the real ones out later (this is retarded of me.  I write music by interval i think).  Sometimes the whole song just appears in my head, words, music and all.  Sometimes it the bass first, then the words, then the rest of it.

      oh i wanted to share some goofy shit:  I'm a member on a bass player's site.  About a year ago i drew a line drawing scribble of one of the  urlLink other  members.

Then  urlLink  Lesa   and her Mark Hoppus signature P-bass in shell pink.   Then,  urlLink  the tender young swedish morsel with delicious pants   (um.  That'd be something of an inside joke, about the pants and all)  So my control with drawing with a mouse has gotten better, and my pictures slightly more detailed, but they won't ever be lifelike, probably.  It's fun doing these.  I've got one in the works for a Nova Scotian guy with an Ibanez Roadstar.

      i just added a link to Jesse Colin Young's site.  While i was scrabbling around the kitchen for something to eat, and something to kill my chocolate craving (made fried eggs and a batch of mexican scratch for coffee instead), i was wandering around singing "four in the morning".  I tend to sing that song a lot.  I can make all the notes in it.  Everything else is phrasing and timing.  Cool as shit song, too.  Not the Youngbloods version, thought that one's pretty good.  JCY's is straight acoustic and screams "oregon coast" sometimes.  It's the blues if i ever heard it.   So i added his site.  He has some new stuff on it for downloads. He also sells Kona. KONA.  gotta repeat that. KONA! he owns a kona farm.  I haven't tried his beans yet.  But i'm going to.  I  adore  kona coffee.  Especially organically grown and processed kona.  And there is a HUGE difference between it and store bought.  Once you try it, nothing will be good enough.  And you will happily plunk down $10+ a pound for this elixir of the gods.    Jesse will also write back if you email him.  Neat.  Some other people that will if they have the time: Mike Watt.  Jack Bruce. Jules Alexander. I've had small, ongoing conversations with some of my favorite artists, and one was resurrected after over a decade (was very happy to find Jules. After i heard about Dave, i was rather worried about the man).

      Well, i was going to try to draw comparisons to some different groups.  I started looking around.  What i found confirms something i figured out sometime last year.  on 9/11/01, every single political line that had been in place was blown to hell.  There are republicans who are anti-war, democrats who are pro-war, aspects of the left espousing white supremacy and straight up nazi-ism, and aspects of the right defending the enemies. There are christians who say both cheeks have been slapped and its time to bring out the muskets, and there are christians who say "give them another chance".  There are a few (very few, from what i see) pagans who believe its not about oil, and an ENTIRE COUNTRY who wants the oil (and its not the US...), but is standing around with its finger in its ass saying we're the empirical tyrants.  Come to think of it, the green, earth-loving pagans seem to think its forgiveable for a certain man to set oil fields on fire, drain marshes and dump raw crude into the sea,  because we will kill innocent civilians .  Some days i simply have to tie a rope around my head to keep my jaw attached to my face.

      There's something really rad about cruising around in a new red vette with a fine blonde woman.  That'd be the owner of the car.  Men stare.  Boys stare. Women stare.  Everyone smiles.  She bought it herself, for exactly the reason i would: horsepower.  Excellent handling (on dry pavement, at least).  It's all the car any car needs to be.  Unbelievable stereo system.    Not sure how to explain it.  I meet women with hi-performance cars, and usually their husbands have bought it for them as some kind of status thing.  They drive them like crap.  They fill them up with trash, whatever.  I'm always stoked to meet another woman who appreciates horsepower.  I would love to have another car with a V8 in it.    My friend has a lot of faults.  I hear about the faults from other friends.  Thing is, she's much more like me than some of my other friends.  The misunderstandings they have about her are ones they'd have about me, if i wasn't as good as being a social chameleon as i am (that probably comes from wanting good friends really bad, but never actually trusting other people enough to let them be those good friends).  She's relatively new to the area, and hasn't quite found her niche among the locals.  That's fine.  I don't have one either.  I stick out like a sore thumb, too.  I use it to my advantage though, i guess.  And she's aware of her faults, and actively works on fixing them, which is quite a bit more than i can say for some of the people who criticize her.    Plus, it's really hard, i think, to find yourself in a very tightknight community as a new person.  You find yourself with no one and no where to run to when you need to.  All the ties are already made and you have to ingratiate yourself to those people.  Fuck that.  (that's where we both stand on that).  Not gonna kiss some ass so someone will like us.  We are who we are and we do what we do and those that don't like it, well, they know where to shove it.  If they don't, we can tell them.    When we meet people who are similar to us, or have had similar life experiences, there are certain nuances of speech and mannerisms and words that we pick up on that say "Here's another kindred soul".  I can find those in my friend with the vette, she's a mirror of what i would like to be at 49 and she's said i'm a slightly different version of her at 33.  There's a connection i have with her that i just don't have with a lot (ok probably most) of my other friends.   She doesn't pine for her youth, or wear clothes for a 16-year-old.  She has a certain class that's lacking around here.   People are intimidated by her, and express it as dislike or whatever.  Ok, been there.  Felt it through high school and most of my 20s.. people are intimidated by me for some reason.  But, if they only knew...   I got called stingy with my emotions a couple of days ago.  Yeah.  If they only knew.    So some friends i do certain things with, and some i keep at an arm's length away, and some i can hang out with all day long, never say more than 20 words, and still have a fantastic time.  Each friendship has a boundary for me, based on certain odd qualities i've never been able to articulate.  No one is closer to me than Dale. There's a descending order of closeness after him.    all this... from riding in a vette all day yesterday.  She had it running a few times, but she never actually put the pedal to the floor.  I was hoping she would :P

      Passed by the old "three-shoeboxes-in-a-row" triplex that Dale and i used to live in (Building codes?! What building codes?!).  Looks like it caught fire.  Not the one we lived in, but the one at the other end (A shoebox with two bedrooms...).    A neighbor once punched a hole in her wall.  We found the insulation was old newspapers.  When we first moved in, the power wasn't grounded right.  You touch a light switch, you got shocked.

      with every passing day without cloud cover, it gets colder and colder here.  Tonight, its supposed to be in the low 30s.  We have practice tonight, so that just means Jeff's drums will go out of tune about 40 minutes into practice, and then again another 40 minutes after he tunes.  it means my bass will not hold its D string at the D, no matter how many times i dick around with it.  It means for the first half hour or so, unless i keep my hands in my pockets all night long, my fingers will be too cold to  get warmed up for nasty stuff like "I will survive" and "One Way or Another".  It means i will have to take a handful of Aleve before practice, because the various minor crush injuries and breaks to my fingers are going to act up and hurt like hell tonight.  Ah, well, what we do for our art, right? Hrmph.  heheeh.  Guess today i'll just kind of do stretching and warming up stuff on my hands and fingers throughout the day, or i will be so stiff by the time practice rolls around i'll only be able to play some stupid thing on open strings only.

       Eating as a sport    urlLink ESPN.com - Page2 - Accusations hurled at hot dog contest   Right.  Ok, the other day i was at Lori's house and we were checkin out that FoodTV or the Travel Channel or something, and they had a show about "Vegas' Great Buffets" (Even cable has reached the bottom of the programming barrel). They had an eating contest on.    I'm not sure how to explain how i felt.  Incredulous might work.  Disbelief might be another.  Incomprehension.  No comprende.  It does not compute.  Like snow on the beach, this one will not fit into the great garbage disposal of my mind.    Eating as a sport:   "Footage captured by ESPN confirms that some hot dog slush did spill through Kobayashi's fingers and pieces of liquid bun spouted out of his nose, but footage shows time had already expired."

      i just wonder, all the people who say Bush is an idiot, is he an idiot when he says Islam is a religion of peace, too? No, i don't really like him either, but if he is, as some people say, completely a moron, then perhaps it is time to stop defending Islam because, as the Pres says, it's a religion of peace.   Sorry. I don't buy it.  If Bush is an idiot, he's a complete idiot, and everything that comes out his mouth is utter idiocy, including his weak defense of our enemies.  The hug-it-and-make-it-better camp seems to believe him on this one important point.  okay! if he's just placating certain groups of people, then i think its just that much worse.  Forfend, for we may offend the smallest blade of grass, so tread lightly.    I'm going to make a comparison later today that i've been meaning to for a while. But first, must snuggle with my smart half.

       urlLink Astronaut Profiles   Excerpts from each one:   Lt. Col. Michael Anderson-  "I take the risk because I think what we're doing is really important."    David Brown -  Brown, 46, soared into orbit on Jan. 16 with a flag from Yorktown High in Arlington, Va., his alma mater, that another graduate took up Mount Everest. "I'm going to get it a little bit higher up, but I won't have to walk as far to get it there," he said before his first spaceflight.   Kalpana Chawla -  She was a hero in her native country, which has launched satellites for years and is preparing for a moon orbit this decade. One Indian news agency even tracked Columbia's flight so it could tell readers the exact minute they could wave to the skies to hail their countrywoman.   Laurel Clark -  "She loved it," he said. "I'm just so glad she got to get up to space and got to see it because that had been a dream for a long time."  (said by her brother)  Col. Rick Husband-  "They made the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives and service to the country and for all mankind," Husband radioed from Columbia before the airwaves went silent. "Their dedication and devotion to the exploration of space was an inspiration to each of us and still motivates people around the world to achieve great things and service to others."  (about the Challenger)  William McCool-  "There is so much more than what I ever expected," McCool told National Public Radio on Jan. 30 from the space shuttle Columbia. "It's beyond imagination, until you actually get up and see it and experience it and feel it".   Ilan Ramon-   "He wrote about the divine happiness of looking at Earth," she told Israel's Channel 10 television. "He wrote that he would like to keep floating for the rest of his life. That was the last sentence he wrote to us."   And with this, I will leave it alone, and let others who write far better than i could hope to, say what they need to say.  It's dark here now.  The day is over.    The Phoenix  In a tower of flame in Capsule Twelve,  I was there. I know not where they laid my bones,  it could be anywhere,  but when fire and smoke had faded,  the darkness left my sight,  I found my soul in a spaceship's soul riding home on a trail of light.  For my wings are made of tungsten,  and my flesh is glass and steel,  I am the joy of Terra for the power that I wield. Once upon a lifetime, I died a pioneer,  Now I sing within a spaceship's heart,  Does anybody hear?  My thunder rends the morning sky,  yes, I am here. The loss to flame when I was man,  now I ride her without fear,  for I am more than man now,  and man built me with pride,  I led the way and I lead the way to man's future in the sky.  For my wings are made of tungsten,  my flesh of glass and steel,  I am the joy of Terra for the power that I wield. Once upon a lifetime, I died a pioneer,  Now I sing within a spaceship's heart,  Does anybody hear?  Julia Ecklar, c. 1983

       urlLink The catalogue of UK Entrances to Hell   I love  urlLink  The Pagan Prattle    Going through this side reminds me of a part of a book, i think its Thomas Pynchon's  Vineland . A bizarre book, all around.  i've read it two or three times and have yet to make heads or tails of it.    But anyway, one passage comes to mind.  He's explaining about how, once upon a time, hell and earth weren't separated.  there were entrances and gates all over (this inspired my story about the fishing trip of the gods that is on my regular page) hell and earth.  And the inhabitants used to go on vacation in hell or earth and take pictures and hang out and things were maybe a bit warmer in hell but they were essentially the same.  For some reason, after a while, people forgot about the gates, and they were covered by parking lots and overgrown with weeds and no one came to visit anymore.    So.  That's what i was thinking about as i read this.    It may not have even been Pynchon... it may have been skinny legs and all, or some other book by ...who is it, Robbins? More i think about it, the more i think it must have been a Robbins book.

Blankets and pet stuff for the animal shelter, the CMN campaign, raising money for local charities and its own associates in financial straits because of medical problems,etc.    So, i just got to thinking, i wonder if they'd be hip to putting up a box somewhere to donate goodies to the troops.  Books, goofy time-wasting toys, snacks, etc.  I will ask when i go grab the man from work later.  I will look into where to go with it, too.  We have an NG Armory here, and they could probably tell me what to do, as well as the local recruiting offices.

I know a few people who joined the military for the financial benefits, but i know far more people who joined because they felt it was something important and worthy.    When i was younger i wanted to join the Air Force and fly fighter jets.  I *really* wanted to.  I had a conversation about with my uncle, who at the time had some 30+ years with the USAF under his belt and was a Master Seargent.  He said my eyes were too bad and there was no way they'd let me anywhere near a plane, but there were other things i could do.  Yeah, but i didn't want to DO those other things.  I wanted to fly the freakin jets. I was probably 14.    My father's side is pretty military.  My grandpa was USAF, and i believe he served in WW2 in Asia, and my father's first guitar is somewhere at the bottom of a bay off the Vietnam coast.   _____   The negative thoughts are like hobgoblins in the closet lately.

She made an assumption based purely on a comment or two.    Figures.  She has no grasp of written english anyway, shouldn't be surprising that she'd just IP ban people based on one subject she disagrees with.  And, i'd like to point out, i hand pick the blogs i link to.  We do not all share the same views on current world events.  I don't have any problem with that.

I'm no hypochondriac, and have not yet had a serious case of  transcriptionitis  (except for that compressed ulnar nerve a couple of years ago, and that was quite real), but alarmed might be an understatement.   Yeah yeah, i know, i can't just look at the worst case scenario, here.  Because there's a good chance there's nothing to be worried about... but i drop into those weird little "oh shit" attacks occasionally, and usually for no reason, and here i have a reason and i can't get freaked about it because i'd, like, fall apart, because of everything else.

      wow.  not a whole lot to say today.

She'd never done it and had the thing for five years.  Defrag your goddamn computers once in awhile! jeebus..   _____  this is one icky cold.  Never had one like it before that i can remember.  i wake up with my eyeballs three times their normal size with greenish eye boogers.  Its like having a hangover for 9 days. I'm wiped out after being up for four hours.  there seems to be no relief.  cold medicine works for about 20 minutes.  I hope it's gone, soonly, cos that surgery thing is next Wednesday. I really don;t want to put that off. Its made me exceedingly grumpy, too.

      yknow, there are some days where this sounds really good: Going to a bar and getting tanked.  A bar because drinking alone in an empty house sucks.  Getting tanked cos, well, why the hell not.  And then i come up with 50 good reasons why the hell not to, and a couple of kinda lame ones (like, i feel like it) why the hell  to .  But i end up not doing it, cos either way, i'd be by myself, and i hate drinking alone.  Nothing says loser like a solo drunk. Drinking is actually less and less appealing anymore.     I'm glad i don't have a TV.  SO very glad.  I'd be glued to it.  Guh.  i dunno if its the weather or being sick or what, but today just sucks for some reason.

      oh yeah (again?)  I'm looking for two things:   a page or directory of ACTUAL information on first-time home buyer loans, no down or low down, preferably rehab.  I keep finding reams and reams (digital ones, i guess) of alleged help, that end up being ads.    something that says what units have shipped out.  (still looking for that one)  So if you've come across either in your wanderings, or have one in your mookbarks (yeah i did that on purpose) share the info, please, cos i'm about to tear my hair out looking for it.   Found HUD... i'm not sure if they do rehab loans for first timers.  The house we're looking at needs some work, but less work than any of the other houses we'd looked at... well, less serious, structural work.    unfortunately, in our price range, any house we look at that isn't a mobile home will be a "fixer-upper".

      So, everyone,  IS  it weird enough yet?  I just don't have any other way to express how surreal it all feels to me right now.  And how my head (which is seemingly full of pudding right now, due to a head cold) gets slammed back and forth between "Life in this twisted, yet quiet, little coastal town" and "My gods, how can people even stand to watch the news any more".   Talk about yer mental seesaw, brain yo-yo, etc.   You know, you're standing outside the Star Trek club, talking with someone, about something trivial, and a thought enters your head, perhaps, "Jeez, that was one of our own guys that tossed that grenade", and it swims around for a while, as you nod and smile at the person you're talking to, and then you get deposited back into the previous reality. Sunshine.  Fluffy clouds. Some traffic.  A boat skittering across the bay.

      and RE: protesters blocking streets, etc:   When i lived in LA, Nashville and Phoenix, nothing, and i mean  nothing  stood between the 5 o'clock dash for the car and home, except a stop for a beer somewhere.  Had there been people impeding my homeward progress, they would have found themselves with fashionable tire tracks across their clothing.    I can only say how happy i am that i don't live in an area that was essentially shut down by these people yesterday.  I've been known to gun the engine at pedestrians who take their sweet-ass time crossing against a light, play chicken with people who jaywalk and yell "get the fuck off the phone, assmonkey" at people in front of me.  I can't even imagine my reaction to what happened yesterday.  Dale might be able to tell you, since he's been the passenger most of the time, and tends to make me drive when we have to go to SF for some reason or spend time in LA.  People think NY drivers are selfish assholes... i learned to drive in LA, and we're probably the most selfish asshole drivers on the planet.

I mean last night when i went to bed, i laid there awake, yawning, for what seemed like hours.  I know yawning is a function of getting more oxygen to the brain somehow... but, you'd think after five in a row, big hearty ones at that, that oxygen depletion would be countered.    anyone?

      Lori cut my hair for me last night.  It was TIME.  I had just bleached it in expectation of redying it this week.  Its been growing since i shaved it all off on 9/11/01.  I had it trimmed once, and hacked at it myself once, but i've let it go on its own for awhile.  but it was time to get the ends off because i hadn't, and i've bleached it like 6 times.    So when i cut my hair, it gets all excited or something.  it puffs out and i really can't do a THING with it for about a week.  I look perma-blow-dried.    Anyway, gonna probably dye it tonight.  When we play on Saturday night, i will have scarlet hair again, with blue streaks in it, and we;'re going to dedicate Metallica's "Seek and Destroy" to the folks overseas.

      ooh, joy of joys.. finally, a restaurant in town that isn't chinese food, mexican food or italian food.  Yes, we have a mediterranean & middle eastern food restaurant now, and its fab.  i went there for lunch today and had   Turkish coffee (aquired taste, i'll have to get used to it again- made the mistake of sipping at it.  Should have cooled it a bit, then shot it) Dolmas Felafel  and babaganoj  and i was momentarily in utter heaven.  I didn't know what to do with myself. my taste buds were overjoyed.  oooh, the tahini, the hummus, the odd texture of the grape leaves and the nearly perfect yogurt sauce (needed a bit of dill, but i'm not complaining!).  I scarfed almost all of it and brought a bit home for Dale.  then i put the rest of the babaganoj in with the yogurt, dumped it on a bagel and scarfed again.    I'm gonna make sure Lori, Mike, Dale & I go out there for lunch sometime.  I may just go there for lunch whenever the question arises. i'd HATE for it to disappear!  _____  And lori and i had a sort of longish discussion tonight about the war, which we've never sat down together and talked about. She feels differently than i do, and that's fine.  I told her i wasn't sure what happened, but there was a time when i would have been out with the anti-war protesters.  I think 9/11 and having family killed on flight 77 may have been the starting point for what kicked me over.  Then several other small things, like hearing the israelis are nazis, and the affiliations of ANSWER, and some of the (to me)  other absurdities that they go on about.    and what it comes down to, i think, is that at some point, the move to war reached its critical mass, and there simply was no backing down. And i, personally, was never able to figure out any way out of it, once they started, and hey, that prick deserves it anyway.  Bullet to the head, hussein, you've lost your priveledge of counting yourself as a human being.   I think "wolfie" is the true 'war monger' in the present administration.  I think Bush is no more a Hitler than Clinton (but hey if you're going to base an opinon of Bush on what his  grandfather  did, might as well add Arafat to the list for what his  uncle  did), and its bizarre to call him Hitler when the man he's trying to pry from power openly idolizes Josef Stalin.   no i still don't like bush much.  I also think he's in an incredibly tough position, and i surely don't envy him, nor do i think i could do a better job.    I do like Powell.  I've liked him since the first gulf war.  I'm not sure about Condoleeza.  I haven't read enough about her, but i understand her as sort of a steady hand in the mania.   I believe we (the US, as in government) have a responsibility to get the mofo out, since we put him there and yeah, it is our fault.  Not sure if Iraq needs to be first, or be made an example of.    Yknow, i do think about this stuff a lot, and try to figure out exactly where i stand on it.  I don't have a flag.  I didn't rush out and buy one.  I know to question my government, and i know to question the "opposition". Opposition? Did i say that? With the numbers they claim, they are surely no longer the "opposition", so they ought to just drop that semi-victimy word for themselves and call a spade a spade, they are the slightly fringy establishment.  They do what their parents and GRANDparents probably did.  how rebellious! (*insert smirk*)  And we are animals.  And what is the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results.  What do we keep doing over and over, and why do things never change? when is the WTF am i doing moment going to kick in for human beings? Why are disgusting people like Idi Amin living the high life in foreign countries in exile? Can we just grab an island somewhere and put these creatures on it and just drop a few knives and crates of food for them and then forget about them?    I would watch survivior if it featured Amin, Noriega, Hussein, Qadafi, on an island, and instead of voting each other off, they'd just have to... off each other.  Last one standing gets to live on the island alone with no communication with the outside world until they croak. We'll check back in 20 years.  Nothing more than a Swiss army knife and a couple pair of levis.  Throw Malvo and his adult buddy on the island, too.  And that freakin weirdo who grabbed Elizabeth Smart.   Hell, i'd pay MONEY to watch that series.   I'm a little tense.  I'm a little edgy.  I'm a little in the mood for the Deftones "Adrenaline" album, followed by ... hmm.. the Everything Went Black set by Black Flag.  i'm a little in the mood for a long drive in the country at 70 mph, screaming along to the Master of Puppets album.    damn.

      Anyone know if the 182nd Airborne from SC has deployed and where they went? Got a friend amongst them and we heard they were heading out, but nothing more. Ah, well, i'll keep looking.  _____  Boobie update: MD found a second lump on the other side.  So, off for another ultrasound, and excisional biopsy surgery is scheduled for 4/2.   ____  Other update: So far, still doing really well on the quitting smoking thing.  I haven't gotten down to NO CIGS yet, but i have not bought any packs of cigs and i do alright with 1 to 3 throughout the day.  I've now caught a cold, so this may be when i just drop them entirely. Its difficult to go to a bar (which i often do to schmooze for gigs and have a beer or whatever), because i want a beer... and if i have a beer, i will want a cig, and then another cig, and another beer.  Last night i took Jeff over to see Ea$y Money, a friends band, at a local bar, and i drank soda most of the night.  Had one cig and  a couple of drags off his.  And thats how i think i caught this cold.    But i got to see progress at the last appointment with the doc, with the caffeine and nicotine cutback.  Since i first went, my blood pressure dropped by about 30 points or so- from 120/73 (which is kind of average, actually) to 95/60.  Heart rate also dropped from the high 70s- low 80s to 68.  I  LOST  3 pounds, too.  :)  I imagine i'm burning a lot of calories just by the figeting i'm doing without a smoke.

      a lot of people have those little javascript referrer lists.  There's something really fuckin wrong with that thing.  It  grossly inflates  the figures.  I look at  urlLink  Salam's   referrer list, and see that Nth (right here, y'all) has referred 10 people in the last 24 hours.  I haven't even  had  10 visitors in the last 24 hours.  I surely haven't hit Salam's site 10 times in the last 24 hours.    I find it hard to believe i'm the only person who noticed this.  I noticed it a month or so ago over at  urlLink  One hand clapping  .  I mentioned it to him, and he took his down, and i don't know if he's put up another one.  if you use this thing, pay attention to it if hits are important, because is not accurate, that i've been able to tell.

      well,  urlLink  Greg   is tired of blogthoughts about war.  Frankly, i'm tired of  sorting out  my thoughts on it all. Every day, someone somewhere says something more absurd than the day before. On all sides.  Glad i have no TV  Jeff and i spent some time last night laughing at karaokers and a few words about this.    We both think, why bother with a band, with all this crap in the world.  We both answer ourselves with, there has to be something good, something entertaining, even in the most interesting or bizarre times, a few hours where the whole world is one room with cheap beer and happy people, and no aspect of reality dare intrudes for fear of being crushed by a red patent-leather six-inch platform boot with beer and puke on it.   (this is also why i think entertainers should butt out of politics.  Entertain us, and shut the hell up.  its your JOB).     We both think, why do we keep doing what we do, living our lives as if nothing is going on.  We both think, what the hell is there to do? Do we drop everything and take a bike trip across the country? No.  We plug away at what we do, let the little attacks of anxiety pop in, subside, and go away again, because when we were teenagers, we woke up often thinking "today, someone could be the one to push the button".  That kind of fear is not alien to anyone born before 1975.  Its just not something we've collectively felt since about 1992.

      Boobie update;  (aside-well, everyone else flings boobie around with aplomb, so i may as well jump on THAT bandwagon, if for no other reason than to maintain a little of my own sanity by injecting some humor into something that is extremely UNhumorous)   Have to go back to Florence to meet with an MD on Monday.   (aside- terrible time to have to make this weekly- so far- drive up and down the coast.  Its only 46 miles, but the nature of the road sucks up just over a quarter tank on the toyota every time.  With gas being what it is, grrr... put $20 in the tank yesterday and got.. GET THIS ten and a half gallons)   They want to do a biopsy.   (aside- please, just, yknow, apply some liposuction while you're at it, ok? I won't tell the insurance company if you don't.)   So far, i really dig Peace Health  (aside- i grew up in the Kaiser system, before it became Kaiser-Permanente, i think.  It's a very special nightmare. Probably why i hate dealing with doctors and stuff so much NOW)   At least I'm not one of the poor suckers staggering into Harbor General in Harbor City, CA.  (aside- i once waited six hours in the ER there for an ex to have a broken nose set.  To be honest, i'd never been so happy to hear a man scream in pain, because it meant we could leave, finally)   ________  For two weeks, my truck was unable to start on its own power.  The contacts in the starter were toast, and toasted themselves the day after we ran through the money we got for getting paid, which also happened to be about two days after we got paid.  I had to bump start it, so anywhere i went, i had to park on a hill.  if there was no hill nearby, i didn't go.  But truck is all fixed, now.    I joked with George at Coos Bay Toyota that i'm running a so-far unsuccessful experiment with the truck.  I'm trying to kill it.    Coos Bay Toyota is the best dealership i've ever dealt with, anywhere, bar none.  I'm not even talking from a customer's point of view, but as a service station lackey who used to have to squabble with the parts departments to get parts, or the special goddamn tools to fix certain cars only available through the factory.

      a large, soopa-windy storm is bearing down on us.  Hopefully, i can get my work all finished before harborside has problems in Brookings, or we lose power here.    The thing with these storms is that its usually dead calm in the hours leading up to them.   dead  calm.  Like it is outside right now.  It will be dead calm, then, out of nowhere, the wind will appear, blasting in at 50 mph.  I give it until 11 or so.  We're on a wind advisory, and anyone out at sea right now in anything that draws less than several hundred tons would have to be completely insane.

      three hits today for Rappin Ron Reagan.  Maybe i should find info on it and throw a link up.   Who'da thunk it?? What's this  mean , anyway?  _____  Oh yeah.  day 3  and  day 4  went pretty well.  The physical  neeeeeeeeeeeed!!!!aaaargh!!!!!  for a smoke isn't near as bad.   I was bad.  Had coffee today.    I've named Sunday as the dead stop day.  mmhmmm.  And Monday, no interesting news.  FNP's gonna call me back for a follow up... whenever... i guess.    *making a stimpyface* had my first mammogram (like, Hey! I wost my fust toof!? i guess?) Monday.  While hardly as horrific as the email jokes about them and stories from aunties and other people who like to exagerate (blah i hate that word, too.) make them out to be, if they weren't so deadly serious, they'd be comical.  They're comical anyway.  Cmon, this is the only way modern science can  see  this kind of thing? Is this some kind of joke?   ______  I want to put some more pictures up, but i know i'm getting low on server space.  I don't know if i should just clean out what's there and then comb through all the html stuff to put up what i want there or just say screw it.  Should i revamp the  urlLink  "regular homepage"   or what?   suggestions? This is a major undertaking.  What's on here and the page is just the tip of the iceberg as to what's  really  there.

       urlLink Herald Sun: Stunt stripped bare [06mar03]   Found this by way of Tim Blair,  i think.    the nekkid words disturb me, not for what they say, but hmm..  it seems cheap.  It seems lame.  Its not shocking.  Its boring. Its laughable.  Its some other symptom of 80s yuppiness, maybe.  I read about the nekkid words, and i wonder how many of them are lucky enough that a job is an  option .  A housekeeper is a must.  Tennis lessons and croissants on Saturdays with the girls.  They never see the bills, because they go straight to the accountant. They drive cars worth more than dale and i can get a home loan for.   hmm.  i dunno. maybe its just me? :P

        DAY 1   No cigs No coffee  No pot No beer   Why, oh, why the self-torture? I figure if i'm gonna quit one, i might as well quit em all.  Jeff and i will be putting our utensils in a coffin-shaped box tomorrow and kissing them goodbye.  For as long as we can, at least.    Plus, its just too damn expensive to have ALL those bad habits.    So, i'm drinking tea instead.  I went from around (+/- on any given day) 2 packs of cigs a day to a coupla drags off the ones of friends yesterday... and i may continue that for a while, cos the cold turkey thing made me want to bash my head against a wall and made me quite unpleasant.  Eh and i was told to switch to decaf.  Yuck.  I think i'll forgo the  near pot a day  i was drinking and do the tea, and once in awhile enjoy a nice cup of real coffee somewhere.  I will miss the beer.  However, O'Douls Amber is pretty good, and i like the taste, and don't always want a buzz.  But... i will be pining for Red Hook and a Dove bar.    I gained 30 pounds since i moved here (well, that was in 96, so that's not TOOOO bad.).  Gonna do something about that, too.

      yesterday in florence, as i was waiting to make the left onto 9th st, i noticed a small clutch of people hoisting a sign and walking south on 101.  could barely read the sign, but i think it said "no war blah blah blah".  I looked at my clock- it was 1:30.  I wondered, shouldn't these people, like, be at work? Maybe not, its oregon, after all. Then, i realized most of them had that hunching stance common to high schoolers doing something they probably shouldn't... ok they probably should have been in school.  But they were walking, and most of them looked like they needed the excercise anyway, uh, in a big fat way, i guess you could say.  There were probably 8 of them.    nah.  i didn't take a picture.  got other stuff on the brain, even though i had the camera with me.

       urlLink Compelling without the Yelling  Wren usually writes good articles.  I wish i could say the same for a large portion of the the rest of the pagan community.  For a group of people who take great pride (to the point of  constantly  pointing it out) in their individuality, they can be very sheeplike.  A peek at the comments in any article on current politics in the Pagan News section is a good larf. Tons of indignation and umbrage.  It's pretty hysterical sometimes.  And the conspiracy theories, why.. you haven't seen such silliness since the last far right "anti-liberal" convention.    What  joke some of these people are.

      When i get an annoying song stuck in my head, i want to smash said appendage into any hard, vertical surface until the song is battered out.    When i get a song i like stuck in my head, its usually because i'm feeling akin to what it says, or i  should  feel that way.  Sometimes, it's hard to tell, because lyrics are always hard to decode and interpret, because  you didn't write them yourself , and your interpretation may be completely off from the writer's intention.  Or the lyrics only make a little sense, and its the music itself that drives the sticking.  So,  Pretty Noose  has been stuck in my head.  For almost a week.  Its so bad, i have to listen to it every time i drive somewhere.  *click click*  vrum, vrum  chuggeta chuggeta   hit the on button, ffwd to track 13, through the intro, haul down the driveway   and if you happen to be next to me at the light at Newmark and Broadway, you'll be treated to the sight of a scarlet-haired woman trying her hardest to obtain Chris Cornell's vocals, as loud as she can, surrounding people be damned,   I don't care what you neeeee-d .  What a larf. Well, we gotta entertain ourselves somehow.  I entertain myself singing in my truck, and probably entertain everyone around me with it.. "oh man look at that chick, she's totally jammin out, and BADLY". (car full of eurojappofoofoomobile racerboys laughing)  Yeah well "I'm a big rock star so FUCK YOOOOOOO!" (from a live version i have of Soundgarden doing "earache my eye")  But, anyway, with the various degrees of bullshit lately, i wonder what my brain is trying to say by clinging to that song.  If you happened to read the band blog about a week ago, you may have seen a large portion of the bullshit i'm talking about.  Her name is T.  And she's the singer in my band.  And i just scratched her off the friend list and added her to the  persona non gratis (grata?)  list.  One can only take so much... When you're 26, its no longer excusable to act like a vindictive little high school idiot in regard to  business .  As a musician, its common courtesy not to scream at your band members at a gig, and not to talk shit about them on the band's webpage.  No one has walked off stage yet, and no one has screamed at anyone else at a gig (oooh but i've come -->this  Anyway, i left that up for a week or so.  It ain't my personal credibility that suffered for it, oooh nooo, and that's good enough revenge for now, cos i made sure boatload of local people saw it. I took it down after a few days because it was time for the sideshow to come to an end.  She removed herself from the "team" list, (at least i didn't have to), and i don't expect anyone will be seeing anything posted by her there again.    She's just a person i know, that happens to sing for the band i play bass in.  I hate doing that, but it's self-preservation, if you catch my drift.  I'm not going to be subject to her emotional blackmail or moody whims anymore.  Fuck that.  No friend i have ever had has EVER, i mean EVER, treated me so goddamn badly that i decided it was time to just kiss them goodbye.  Since i have to deal with her in the band, i'm going to be an adult about it.    If it was the first time it happened with her, i wouldn't be so upset about it, but its not.  I like to learn my lessons the first time. the second time... well, after the second time there ain't no third time.  One is lucky to get a second chance from me.  One gets no third chance.

      its a wird thing to think about, probably.  The google ads on the freebie blogspots.  I've been trying to figure out how it is decided what ad to show you.  I'm going to try to keep a list of the ones i see.  Sometimes, the ads seem based on the content of the blog, and sometimes by.. something else, and sometimes nothing at all.   So here's today's google ad roundup: (i cleared my cache and all the cookies before i did this) Nth- Personalized Cups & Mugs (i'm so sick of seeing that one) Intricate Plot - SF Bay Dinner Cruises  Yer Treeler er Mine - Bass guitar amps through zzounds.com Iraniangirl- Iranian Personals Barbtries a Blog- Habitat for Humanity.    --I see no real rhyme or reason for the way they are.  some secret new marketing technique or something.. hehe...

Not normally a prob, except he didn't tune it back to E, and he had tuned his guitar down, too. And then he was too drunk to play, or even tune, so i bought a tuner today, cos mine broke and i suck at tuning by ear.  But i had my revenge... joe was too drunk, and went and crashed out really early.  While he was crashed, i detuned his shit so far down his strings were slack.  muahaha.

Like, his lines are cruel.)   I got to try the yammy-haw amp out finally- like, really play through it.  it has no balls! its 120 watts and HAS NO BALLS! something's wrong with it.  So now its my 100-pound effects unit.   I got the (Cream-era) Jack Bruce tone without the Jack Bruce mod . I almost crapped myself when we played "badge".  I run a guitar cord from the rec out on the yamaha into the, uhm, power in and plug into the yamaha.  it freakin  rawks .  It almost makes The Brown Sound.

Da Goddess is a nurse at a children's hospital (or is it a ward, DG?) Vernon at Ei Baa Hashne' is a doctor in New Orleans. Gabby at Yertreelerermine is a nurse in Canada.  I'll be honest, i surely don't have what it takes to work in the hands-on aspect of healthcare.  I'd do better in billing, coding, transcribing... anything but the actual helping of people. I'm just not a people person.  Not for lack of trying, mind you.. i'm just not.  Some of us are, some of us aren't.  I don't even have it in me to work as a Home Health worker or caregiver.  I did try for that once.    (took out some dumb stuff)

I'd driven down the same street every day for five years, sometimes four or five times a day. I know what kind of area her killer lives in, because its where i grew up.  I know you don't navigate that route lightly. It's too bad Rambo made it home that night, I think.  It's too bad she did and Bekah did not.  It always works out that way, though, doesn't it.

      gah.  I got all worked up today to go play through the new amp.  I was all set.. i moved stuff around finally and got things sort of neatened up and plugged the thing in, then plugged the bass in, and flipped the switch   nothin.  I poked around for a bit and found the fuse-screw-things and investigated.  aha.  no fuses.  must go buy fuses for this so as to play and make noisey-noise. I am gonna learn "take the skinheads bowling" by Camper Van Beethoven.  playing it shouldn't be too hard, but i want to sing it, too.     Some people say that bowling alleys got big lanes

      and here's an expansion of something i though of earlier after reading  urlLink Intricate Plot  today.    Almost all of the middle- and late 20th century's greatest photographers had one thing in common: their first cameras.  Just about all of them started with a Kodak Brownie when they were in their early teens.  Until the Brownie, photography had been mostly an upper-class person's hobby, with expensive, bulky equipment and the money to throw away on the trappings of developing.  Suddenly, the everyjoe had something they probably had only dreamed of while looking at their relatives' daguerrotypes and cyanotypes.  And so when you go through antique stores and thrift shops and find old family albums with the black pages and the model A's, almost all of the pictures were taken with a Brownie or Brownie knock-off.  I have a couple of these, myself, and have not yet been able to find film for them.    The next leap in image-grabbing was color, in the 40s, but the basic concept of taking a picture was still the same, and becoming more mundane.    Now we have the combination of the internet and digital cameras, and it seems almost like a Brownie explosion.  There are sites where you can store photoalbums, sell your pictures, online galleries, blogs, etc.  You can see what its like where someone else lives or what some person in maybe India does in their spare time or what kind of cars are out there.  Stuff you wouldn't probably  even really "see" if you went there yourself.  You can see things you never wanted to see, too, of course... yeah you can see a  whole lot of  that  .    But i was just thinking about how far photography has come in just over 150 or so years.  And how long it took to get to the discovery of its principles.  And what we do with it now.

      Re:  urlLink  Gabby's    deceitfullness  (yer links arent working right. its blogger.. what do i expect..):  heh.  The best paper i ever wrote for any class was one i wrote in my 7th grade creative writing class.    the final for the class was to write something like 10 pages about something that changed our life.  I couldn't think of anything.  I'm, like, 12, ok? What changes your life when your 12, if your a bored white kid living in middle-upper class suburbia? Nothin, that i could think of.  So i wrote up this 10 page bullshit story.  The sort of thing Robert Fisk would be proud to read... I hadn't had the anti-triteness beaten into me yet, and i remember this final was the epitome of 12-year-old girl writing.   The ONLY paper i ever got a freakin "A+ Excellent" written across the top in that red felt pen, was 10 pages of bullshit.  My teacher was amazed.  My writing was "poignant, and exposed the raw edge of man vs. himself conflict and blah blah blah, something or other".  You'd a thunk i'd written a bestseller.  Then.. dammit... see you always get bit in the end.. she called  my mom  to tell her what a fantastic kid she thought i was, for this life-changing thing.  And MY MOM was like, "WTF?!"  about it... and i had to tell her i was full of shit and stuff.  And my mom made me tell the teacher, and i got to keep the "A", but the teacher never talked to me afterwards.  it was like i had betrayed her, or something... but.. geez, i knew what she was looking for, it was a "Creative Writing" class, and i gave her what i knew she'd grade high for.    So, what i'm getting around to saying is i don't have any prob with Gabby making a buck off the teeming millions.  Its what anyone who has some kind of talent wants, isn't it? Artists get the shaft: You starve if you stay "true" to your work, and if you dare try to make a buck, you're a sellout.    Well, okay, some stuff is just schlocky (like... that painter of light guy) but daaaamn... wouldn't it be good to be schlocky and rich.  You do the Chicken Soup thing, or the romance novel thing, or you write terrrible sci-fi for geek magazines or silly pop songs and you do your heavy stuff on the side.. OR you just get a big ol' charge out of writing crazy shit like that and then cashing a check for doing it... hahaahaha i think its rad.

Women rarely score that high in the systemization quotient, and someone who scored a 21 is just a bit better off than someone who scored a 20, which is what this thing says the average "high functioning autistic" scores.   How comforting.  :P   But what's it all  mean  ?

      Oh.. i have a new amp coming.  Last year, a friend of mine picked up  2 x 15 Yamaha 250 watt guitar amp for free.  I've been trying to buy it off her since she got it.  she doesn't play guitar. Finally, last week she asked if i had a monitor she could trade for it... no luck, but i was working on getting one for her.  Today she called and asked what the monitor status was and i mentioned i wouldn't know until tomorrow.  She said that was fine because she saw one in the paper she was gonna look at, but i could have the amp anyway.   So, i'll have to like, wash her car a few times for her or something in appreciation for the amp.  It's a pretty nice one, too.  I can run it serial with my 1 x 15 Peavey 75 watt and be heard a bit better now.  You aren't supposed to use guitar amps for basses, but screw it.  I'm gonna.  I could just replace the speakers if i needed to anyway.

You'd MAKE the 2-hour drive to Eugene just to have Indian food.  You'd go batshit too if the best place in town to eat was a Sizzler (not no more though... ooooh no, now we have the fabulous "Yesterday's Cafe" in downtown North Bend, behind the library, where you can order such culinary delights as  babaganoush ).  I'd like to hear some of the locals say that word...i wonder if it would be anything like a Jersey tourist in LA, asking where "Seppleveeda" Boulevard is.  (Sepulveda)  But onward, you'd pick up an instrument just to entertain yourself.  You'd take an interest in things you never thought you would... (For me its been trains, my friends kids, Magic the Gathering, 80s metal... how bad could it be?!)   And you'd be up at the strangest hours, babbling ceaselessly to whoever is out there...

      mm, yeah, so once of the incisions is infected, and i got a mild chewing out for using peroxide and betadine on it in an effort to help clean it.  Yesterday AM the doc calls in an order for Keftabs to the WM pharmacy.  I go in around noon to see if they're in.  Not yet.  Out of stock.  Should be some in tomorrow. (today).  Today i go in around noon.  Out of stock.  I talk to the pharmacist, because it seems there are bunch of DMV employees working at the pharmacy now.  She says they will call and see if someone else can be dispensed, because no one in town seems to have the Keftabs.  So i go back to get Dale from work, and go stand around the pharmacy/pseudoDMV again.  No word back from the doc yet.  I explain the prob... and that suddenly kicks one of them into gear.  So i came home with cephalexin, which is the generic for Keflex.  I wonder why i couldn't get them in the first place? Its some burly antibiotic.. i mean i gotta take 1500 mg a day for seven days.  I can't imagine Keftabs being that much burlier.

There will always be a "yeah, but..." attached to it, with the standard argument from anti-war people.    And once  definitive  proof is found, because apparently the things found so far are not definitive enough, even taken as a whole, there will be yet more "yeah, but..."  .

      The wild columbines have not yet bloomed, but today on the way back from Florence i had to stop on the side of the road because i saw these.  Trilium.  Three leaves, three petals.  They are my second-favorite local wildflower.  I've never seen a group of them like this together, only one here and there.

       urlLink Transportation   This week's  urlLink PhotoFriday  entry.   To get this, I got hassled by The Fuzz.  It's one AM in a small town, someone is walking around a business in a sort of ambling manner.  Does anyone lean out a window and yell "Hey, what the hell are you doing?" No.  They call the cops, who come just as I'm leaving.  Bastards.  Woowoo i'm all legal.  *sticks out tongue and goes thbbbbt* neener neener.  Not only am i all legal, i'm  dead  sober, with nothing illegal in my car (unless some supa-strong air freshener stolen from a bar bathroom counts)  and have no urge to harass OR choke the officer, which is weird.  Must be the little purple pills.

       urlLink The Smoking Gun: Archive- Sultanna Freeman   Charles at LGF had this link up.  I had to also.  Sultanna has been photographed without her ... uh i think this is a chador... before, when she was arrested (and convicted) for felony aggravated battery of a foster child.    My thoughts on this: As many who know me (who may or may not read this thing) my  driving priveledges  were suspended for nearly eight years for ... well... being an asshole.  Suspended in three states.  It was never my  right , as her lawyers are contending that driving legally, that is,  with a valid driver's license  is a right and not a priviledge to drive.  I think this is "Important Thing Number One" in any Driver's Ed class, neh?  That if we're dumbasses on the road, our  driving priviledges  can be suspended or even revoked.    So what's the point of a picture ID if you can't see a face to ID? I don't see this as any kind of slam on Islam, personally, and its annoying that its even in court.  The answer seems very simple- have your picture taken without the chador and drive legally, or leave it on and don't drive.  I've been upbraided for having  different color hair  than what's on my license, and told to have a new picture taken.  Why drive with something like that on? You have no peripheral vision!   Hmm anyway, Sultanna should shut the hell up and quit playing the victim.  Its not a religious thing.  It's an anti-stupid thing.

      When i went looking for "overlooked" i got a picture finally of my favorite part of the path.  You're walking through bushes that are up to your shoulders for a while, and then it opens up to the woods of tall, straight trees.  In the fog, it's completely different.  A little to the left, out of the picture, is a pretty neat house i wouldn't mind living in :P   But anyway, here's that spot.       Yes i added contrast.  Too much. On purpose.

And i'm not even annoyed for any particular reason except for shitty behavior on the part of someone who really  ought  to know better.  I'm annoyed because i'm sick of having to pick up someone else's slack because they "don't see why they should do any of this extra stuff". The whipping post is being set up in  their yard  now, so i hope they dig it.  Some people never shut up when its painfully obvious they should.

       urlLink Oregon's top tourist attraction? A casino - The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, USA   We have a casino in NB, The Mill.  It sucks.  Nice concept. Executed badly.  Its right on the bay front.  On 101.  It looks like the old lumber mill it used to be.  One can wander through the slots and watch a certain specie of speed freak- the one who can't decide if they want to blow this $20 they won on trying for more or play it safe and buy a bag from the guy in the bathroom.  When i first moved here, my thoughts on the place were generally along the lines of "nice place to lose your unemployment/welfare check".  They have a hotel there, now.  I haven't had the chance to check that out, yet.  I guess they have spa rooms over looking the bay? woowoo i want one. I want to  launch the canoe  from the balcony.    hey, though, we have the opportunity to turn into a forest-and-beach Vegas.  yay.

      and hmm.. i think i like normalcy that comes from pills.  I haven't felt like crawling under a rock when i wake up, and i've actually wanted to go out and do things with other people.  i've been able to sleep and stay asleep and my dreams have not been disturbing.   i had thought of asking for a 2 mg valium scrip not too long ago to help with the sleep thing (i just want to go to sleep and stay asleep and i don't care if i sleep like the dead). Then a friend gave me a couple 10s.  And i remembered why i hadn't asked yet.   I thoroughly enjoy valium far too much  to be given a scrip for them.  I'd suck down a bottle of 2s in about a week.  So, um... i'm not gonna go asking for them.  Bad idea, pril.  Bad, bad idea.  Dale will be so happy you recognized that as a bad idea, too.  Getting so much better at that lately *pat pat pat onna head*.    Doctor please, some more of these... outside the door, she took four more, what a drag it is getting old

      I've been listening to doctors dictate for too long.  Just ignore any "At some point" or similar stuff.  You think teenagers are bad with "like" and "um"...  I once counted... in a 50 page document detailing the history of about 20 patients, one doc said "At this point" 130 times.  it seemed to average out to 3 times per page.  (and i wish some of these guys would speak much more clearly when they mention medications and certain conditions. I'd be much less prone to freaking out if it were so.  I got accused of mistyping one thing that sounded nothing like what the doc said.  How does "chondromalacia" [kon-dro-muh-lay-shuh] sound anything like "osteochondritis" [ahs-tee-yo-kon-dry-tis]? Am i so stupid?! )

      i started taking wellbutrin for the smoking thing.  one side effect is dry mouth, and i figured ok i can handle that.   I had  no idea .  I woke up at 3:15 this morning and had to pull my tongue off the roof of my mouth.  There was nothing to drink in the house but the nasty tap water.  I went to the store.  gaaaah.   Got the "dry mouth" under control only to be overcome by ravening thirst.    If i wanted to feel like  that , right, i'd smoke a big fat bowl.    but the wellbutrin seems to be doing its job.  As well as its original intended job as an antidepressant thing.  (i can only sort of tell about that, i'm going on day 3).

       urlLink The Falcon and the Fallout   (LA Times mag article.  Use cyberpunk/cyberpunk if it asks for username)  A very old friend's elder brother gets out of prison.    The story of Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee is usually sitting in the depths of my head.  I was too young when he was arrested to understand much about it.  Chris was in some of my dad's classes.  Chris' younger brothers were, too.  I heard about  them  as i got older, from my dad.  I was friends with one of them, when i was in, i think 10th grade.  Brian.  Brian's probably 5 or 6 years older than i am and i lost touch with him at some point.    Between my dad and Brian, i got to hear interesting things about "The Falcon".  I don't remember much of what they said, except that my dad said most of the siblings got a lot of the unwanted type of attention at school.  Brian wasn't one to babble on and on about it, but occasionally you could get him to answer a question. But I've never read the book or seen the whole movie, "The Falcon and the Snowman".  I think the reason is that it's weird to think of someone from Palos Verdes, who went to the same high school i did, had my dad as a teacher, etc, did something like what he did.   I didn't know Chris was at Sheridan.  If i had, i might have sent him a hello note.  I'm twisted that way.  A note that said HI. Say hi to Brian from someone he probably won't remember for me.    So anyway, the story of Christopher is one i'm picking up really only now.  As he is released.  If he writes a book, i will eagerly buy it and read it.  Local boy does bad. Way bad.

And, because i'm a jerk, you think i would have asked about Eric Clapton?  Heeeellllll no , I would have pestered him about  Jack Bruce . "Hey man i hear you guys hate each others guts! Har har har! Jack's aged better than you have, but you've got Ginger beat... Why is Jack making such rad music still and yours sucks so bad anymore?"   Biodad works at Arturo Valdez' guitar shop in Hollywood.  Art's a cool guy, and he has a lot of neat stuff in his shop.  All mariachi, flamenco, etc. instruments.  There was a MONSTER acoustic bass guitar there when i was, and most of the guitars have cool multicolored nylon strings on them.    If there was a website, i'd point you there.  But i think Art's one of those guys who  doesn't need a webpage .  I mean, if dudes like Clapton roll into your shop to look at your handmade instruments, i think you're already where you need to be...

      these are the words to the "two different views" song by the Fixx i'm learning:    Big ideals I can't suppress Little lies I do detect Through pleasure, pain, delight and wonder But there's the rub of irony Where  indecision slices me From high of highs it pulls me under (chorus) There will always be. Two different views of the same thing baby Two many views from either side There will always be (oh) two different views Too many views that can collide  Emotions sway from side to side Devotion preys upon my pride Will I respect the winner in the battle for my mind these Jealousies and dumb regrets Wasting time just beckons death Here today and gone tomorrow  (repeat chorus)  As I stray from either side Too confused to fantasize Like a judge who needs forgiving  Is there peace for two as one What divides, can be undone Regain the pulse of what was priceless  (solo 3 bars)   There will always be two different views (x 3) from either side  (repeat)  (first verse)

      Pah.  the guitar sounds like shit.  Time for new strings. So happy these are 1/6th the price of bass strings.  aaah.  (though i think i have a set of $12 Martins on them right now..)  Its *weird* to play a guitar, being used to the bass. I like the classical necks because they have the room i'm used to on them, between the strings.  A lot of people say the necks are too wide. it is much wider than either of my basses, but it doesn't seem to be a problem.  The radius is thinner, of course.   I started bass before guitar, so i'm all screwed up, i guess.  Been called "untainted by guitar" about my playing.  When i've practiced for a few days, i'm an excellent rhythm player.  But i couldn't squeeze out a lead of any sort if my life depended on it.  I can pick with a pick on guitar, but not bass, and i play my bass with my fingers, but can't switch that technique to the guitar.  Take me to the zoo, i'm a retard.

      One of those things i think about but maybe never act on: The Loretta Project.  This is the tape of acoustic cover songs/thank you for a friend.    Well, i'm acting on it.  I'm about to head back into the back room and grab Estrella, tune her up and learn "Two Different Views".    Estrella is my father's second guitar.  He sent it to me a couple of years ago and it needed new pegs and gears.  I fixed it and cleaned it and had it adjusted up and now i have this great mid-60s spanish-classical student guitar with an Estrella sticker in it.  Hence, the name.  I name my guitars.  I have Axe-zilla (aka greenie- guitar of uknown make or year), Bela (the ibanez bass), buster (the harmony bass), Luna (the Harmony archtone), Estrella (spanish acoustic), Floyd the Peavey amp and Big Floyd or Floyd Four-Eyes the Yamaha amp.  There is also the Purple Cord, the Black Cord, and the Monster Cord.  There's The Stupid Flanger, The Cursed Tuner, The Green Metronome and The Black Metronome.  There's also another tuner, Beenie the Bastard.    ____  Hey Venemous one i just had a genious idea and i'll comment it to ya, but here, so's i don't forget.   I noticed over on the SHQ list to the right the links to the slutertarians go to their home blogs.  Why not have the links drop you into their department page? Our home blogs are pretty much listed in your blogroll anyway?  As the set up is now, the front page doesn't appear to list entries in any particular order.  Then its a two-step process if you want to look any deeper (oh i'm so lazy!), (department listings- i think this should be larger, the text, anyway) and then the list itself... which i would probably arrange differently.   hrm anyway i'm looking at it from a dorky reader perspective more than anyone who might actually know anything about layout and stuff.   so.   IGNORE ME AT YOUR PERIL.   soooie i'm off to grab estrella now

Its a standard issue black plastic thing.  they scare the crap out of me because i think i owned one (or tried to use one) in Nashville that had a crack in it and it 'SPLODED while i wasn't looking and blew into a billion steaming pieces.    so, off i will go later tonight, using a garbage pail lid as a shield and sort of poking at it to see how it works.  I feel a kitchen adventure approaching...

       urlLink Eject! Eject! Eject!: MAGIC   Ok i'm finally getting around to reading this.  And i haven't seen bowling for columbine yet, either.  (I can't bring myself to pay $7.50 for it).  OK anyway...   i've seen this mentioned in other critiques of the movie: " Littleton, Colorado is a nice, safe, upper-middle class neighborhood. Its the kind of place youd want to raise your kids. It is also home to a Lockheed plant, and Moore goes on the make the assertion that this climate of death from these weapons of mass destruction is responsible for the Columbine killing spree. Presumably the school shooters in other communities had to settle for magazines and websites of missiles to work up their Death Culture madness "  I'm turning this over in my head.  I have been.    When i was a tyke (probably 4 or 5), i lived  directly  across the street from an active NIKE launch site, Fort MacArthur in San Pedro.  I would sit on my porch in the afternoon, picking my nose or whatever, and watch the "army guys" play basketball.  Sometimes, i'd wander across the street to the chain link fence and wave and yell "Hi army guys!".  Once a month or so, there would be a grumbling in the earth and the missiles were raised from their underground silos and cleaned or inspected, i guess.      (and i didn't go shooting anyone, after growing up in this "culture of death")  In Southern California in the 70s and 80s,  everyone  worked in aerospace, somehow.  At Northrup or Rexnard-Tridair or whatever.  My friends had dads who worked "in the defense industry" and thats all any of us knew.  They built battleships in Long Beach and airplanes in Carson and El Segundo and Torrance. Or they commuted to El Toro.  San Pedro was probably, at any one time, 40% military personnel.   (and i didn't go shooting anyone, after growing up in this "culture of death")  After high school i worked "in the defense industry".  I made skin fasteners for missiles.  I worked with people making parts for the Stealth bomber.  My boyfriend, at the time, made airplane doors for Boeing.   I haven't shot anyone yet! and i actually  was  surrounded by the freaking culture of death! So were thousands, probably millions,  of other kids!   So anyway i read this crap about the movie, and that one bit always sticks in my craw.  And i wanted to say this: Moore, if one Lockheed factory is a culture of death, you're a  fucking pansy-ass .    I freely explored Ft. Mac after it was decommissioned.  I looked down its silos and walked through the pitchblack tunnels and investigated the old motor pool, and stood in the big gun pits- all of them, and climbed around on decommed howitzers, peered out coastal pillboxes, wandered through the barracks, lived in its prior (40s era) base housing, and i'm pretty freaking okay.  (Well, relatively so.  Others may beg to differ.)  But thats all i got to say about that.  nyaah.  p-a-n-s-y  a-s-s

      Was just listening to some of the metallica i have.  I had their stuff on vinyl once upon a time.. all Metalblade releases.    Master of Puppets is probably my favorite Metallica album.  It seemed on the verge of doing something fantastic.  I've always thought this was Metallica at their best.  ... And Justice for All was good, but it was missing something that MoP had. (Cliff Burton, perhaps...)   The two albums prior to MoP were also great, but the production on them was weird.  They sounded like they were recorded in a big, tiled bathroom.    ( aside : When i worked at the car wash in town detailing cars, i'd usually have my bass or an acoustic with me.  On my breaks i'd sit and jam in the bathroom, which had superb acoustics for an acoustic guitar).    Among bass players, especially the ones who primarily focus on metal, the debate rages: Burton vs. Newstead: Who's Better?  Well, Cliff is dead, so obviously we can only imagine how much further he might have come with his playing.  Some people regard "Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)" as   The Best Bass Solo Ever, In The Universe. Period.   I think at the time it came out it was pretty special.  It's fun, and kind of hard to play.  I know if we're playing somewhere and i goof off with some of the lines in that, there will be a small knot of 30-something dudes gathered around to watch.   always .  If i stop, they're devastated.  Newstead is a different player.  Not better or worse.  His lines, usually buried deep in the mix, are not especially complicated, but the simplicity is what gives them their power.  It's a phrasing thing, making the music breathe.  Y'know, instead of doing notes to fill between kicks, you lay down a note on each kick, or in between them, or something.  That's Newstead's style, where Burton's was to fill up the spaces.  Newstead used "the spaces in between".  (Tam asked what was important in bass playing once, and all i could think of was "the spaces in between")  So, really, you can't compare to the two guys.  One's dead and the other guy plays differently.    Newstead's stuff with Echobrain was pretty cool.  He sounded comfortable.  He sounded like he was really digging what he was doing, and i'm really interested to hear what he brings to Ozzy's band.  As well, i'm interested to hear Rob Castillo in Metallica.  From the Funk of ST to the grind of Metallica... neat.    .

      oki i've decided on 2 songs so far for the thank you project:   Two Different Views- the Fixx   Retarded - Mind over 4  the only version i've heard of the fixx song is acoustic.  Retarded is an acoustic song to begin with.  Then i was thinking of Eurotrash Girl by Cracker (maybe not.  its a bit ambitious for me.) and "if only you were lonely" by the replacements.  That ones fairly easy and i can kind of play it already.   Those two are definite, though.  I was going to go with the Fixx's Secret Separation, but then rediscovered Two Different Views.

      Today, to say goodbye to June Carter Cash in my own way, I'm playing all the Carter Family stuff i have (including the fabulous "motherless children") as well as Big Sugar's whacked out version of "Motherless Children".    Once i've gone through the list a couple of times, i intend to listen to my  urlLink  "Unchained"    album by Johnny.  My dad turned me on to this stuff when i was a tyke.  I learned to appreciate it when i lived in Nashville.  I  got  when i started playing.    What a time to be recording though, when radio was all live.  Going from station to station to have your song played until it got cut to a thick-ass piece of black shellac, or maybe red shellac.    I think a lot of the old-style country guitar playing is underappreciated, in a big way.  Maybe that's why learned "Cowboy chords" before i got to bar chords.  (hah, i still can't play a bar chord.. how lame am I?)

On a certain level, that strikes me as hysterical.   imagine , the countries that hate us, first saying "We are all Americans", and now having to expand on that with "we are all Israelis".  I guess it was easier, if no less distasteful, to be American for a day than Israeli.    Hmm.  I don't even give a crap anymore why "they" hate us.  "They" should get the hell over it.

      Liberty Meadows is once again a yard.    It took one weedwacker, and two passes with the lawnmower to make it look like a yard again.  We own neither of these necessary implements, so we borrow them.  Borrowing sucks, so sometimes the yard never gets mowed, and we spend a whole summer with a meadow.  This year i think it will be different.  The blackberries are beginning to take hold in places they should not, so i have to be vigilant in poisoning the crap out of the ones that aren't where they're allowed to be.  One season of letting these mofos go is asking for pain and suffering later.  Leather gloves, you may ask? Pah.  In the words of the blackberries, "Fie on thy puny leather.. mine thorns are many and sharp. Get thee to a falconer shoppe, and thou mayest survive your battle."  The cats are unhappy, since their nice hidey-jungle is mostly gone, now.  But they have great piles of grass to lay on, so i guess that makes up for it somehow.

      This is one of the things that makes me like it here.  It's probably one of 5 things.    Last night i took Djeef up to the urlLink Lakeshore Lodge  in Lakeside to see my old band play.  That band never really had a name.  Sometimes they were Bud Shake and the Babe Magnets (funny name for a band full of dudes nearing 60), sometimes they were Spank Spike and the Nubtones.  Sometimes they were just the Tavern Band.    Anyway, they're the Millicoma River Band now and they play regularly at the lodge.  So we went up and i had forgotten my ID.  We went in anyway (cos its a 12-mile drive BACK) and i didn't need it.  At the front door, we were accosted by four people i knew.  A little further in, five people.  All in all, i knew 21 people at the Lodge last night.  Out of 35 or so.    That's what i like.  The big fish in a small town feeling.  There were some people there who saw ML way back when we only knew 10 songs and played at The Homestead last year.  They recognized me only because of my hair. (probably one reason i keep it scarlet... people don't forget me). But then they went on and told all the people THEY were with how great our band was.    Thats something else thats funny.  When i go see other bands, there is usually at least one or two people who have seen my band, and then suddenly the other band is ignored for the night and these people want to know about me and ML.    And i'm always really surprised when people tell me what a great bass player i am.  Part of me thinks, "Sucker. I'm mediocre at best". and part of me just feels great for being a mediocre player that people think is a really GOOD player.    My playing ability drifts around.  If i feel inspired to do a lot of playing, i get very good for a while and make leaps and bounds of progress.  If i don't, like i have felt for the last two or so years, than i don't practice much at home, i don't pick up many of my instruments, and i don't care if i make mistakes because like everything else, it doesn't matter.    I dread the winters here.

      i'm actually a little surprised (in a good way) that no one has jumped on the Richard Petty post and pointed and laughed at me.    Yesterday on my way back from Bandon i was pondering the sideburns issue.  I saw a dude just a little younger than me with sideburns.  I've always wondered this about fashion- it seems that the designers and movers take the stuff that was popular when the present late-20s or 30-somethings were kids and make it new again.  Its some sort of sick nostalgia or something.    Now i see that bits of the 80s are forcing themselves into  fashion again.  Prairie skirts.  Ruffly prairie shirts. I see it and i think "yike! 1982!".  Capri pants are a rehashing of a rehashing.. except now they're low-riding  capri pants.  I'm watching for espadrilles... Hell, even late-70s ealy-80s punk rock stuff is getting fashionable.  Bondage pants and jackets, plaid pants, etc.  (recently saw a bondage jacket paired with bell-bottoms... gag me with a spoon)  One of our friends has a girlfriend who i secretly call "Little MIss Hot Topic", because it looks like that's where she spends all her money.    I can't really talk, of course.  the only time i was ever "in fashion" with my clothes was when "grunge" was the look.  So i can say for about nine months of my life i was actually wearing fashionable clothes.  The fad came and went, and still i had flannels, jeans, boots and tshirts, because thats what i always have and always wear.    Built for comfort, not for speed.  It was hard to run from the cops while being MIP with stiletto heels on.

      There seems to be, floating around in the B'sphere, questions pertaining to Salam Pax, again.  Some have said he's a Ba'athist.  How does he post to his blog if there's no power? etc etc..  I just spent a good hour going through the archives for the present Where is Raed blog.  (not the first one, yet).  There are some things he has said that make me question the questioners.  Some things make me wonder just how fucking short the memory of some people is.  In the entry from when he returned, he mentions little places offering internet and email access for outrageous prices. So, indeed he may not have power where he is, but he may be using these places to post from.    Somewhere in the blog, and i could have sworn it was in the new part, he mentioned someone in his family (his mother, i think) celebrating a heretofore banned Shi'a holiday.     How many Ba'athists were Shi'a?    In another entry, he takes a relative (of his parents generation) to task for supporting the Ba'athist revolution in the 60s, forcing them to acknowledge its folly.    Yah, some hardcore party member, there, eh?   Salam consistently makes snide remarks about Saddam Hussein, and in one entry specifically says the man has no ablutions to wash the black water from him, (the "skham wijih" entry), meaning Hussein's shame at what he did to Baghdad during GW1.    He bags mercilessly on the misguided human shields.  Seems that any good Ba'athist would be adoring them.     Conclusion? Ain't got one.  I really don't know enough about Iraq or the Ba'athist party to say one way or the other.  But its hard to believe a party member would just blatantly make fun of the party like he has. Even taking into consideration the concept of taqiyeh...   I havent delved into the archives of the old blog yet.  But the accusations have me curious, especially because i don't read into the blog like others have.  There are small things.. small things you notice that don't necessarily add up to the accusation.  Small things in the writing and his English.    Is he stringing Americans along? I don't know.  Should people who have links to his site take them down? If he is a party member? If he is, then all the more reason to leave the links up, and here's why:   To sweep a party member under the carpet is to burn books by Nazis.  We all know the idealogy is disgusting.  But its not something we should ever forget.  So even though the information is distasteful, offends our sensibilities or makes us cringe at what people are capable of, the information needs to be out and available so we can cringe at it, so we can see the folly of it and the danger in totalitarianism.  So we never forget.  Its why the Jews have holocaust museums and Rememberance Day.    If Salam is a Ba'athist, then here, with his blog, we have a glimpse into the mind of a Ba'athist. That on its face is what makes it worth keeping a link to it.  RE: the blog.  It seems that some posts have been taken off... there are some that i remember that dont seem to be there anymore (his description of an anti-american march is one).  This might be a product of my drug-addled brain, and these might actually be in the previous blog, so i can't say yet that they have been removed.  Later, after i read the first one, i'll post more.

Perhaps it has something to do with having a distinctly  wrong  part sent out as a replacement.  Perhaps it has something to do with being on the phone for nearly three hours, being bounced from one unhelpful department after another, trying to get a replacement part.

That's (the site) up the Coos River, some 8 miles past the tavern.  I've camped at the site before.    __-  On Sunday, two local teenagers were killed in a crash east of Coquille.  There were 5 people packed into a Daihatsu Rocky with a 3-inch lift that drifted off the pavement and down a ravine.  The front passenger and the driver were killed.  The paper showed a picture of the Rocky after they pulled it out of the ravine.  I find it  very difficult  to believe anyone made it out alive.  It's an unrecognizable mass of twisted purple metal, now.    The passenger killed was the best friend of L's youngest daughter.   No moral of the story.  It's just sad.

"Nice" homes here are chock full of shoddy construction that looks good from a distance but not up close.  But even houses designed by architecture students (one of my friends lived in a house that was) were really well designed and finished.    Part of me desperately wants to go back to PV and be able to afford one of these places (I'm frankly sick to death of being surrounded by poverty and slapdash shacks).  Part of me recoils at the very thought.  And the part of me that never shuts up starts working overtime scheming of some way to get there.  (The "rational" me repeats, over and over, "college, babe. Go back".)  The thing about being a 7-year-old with an overactive imagination in a place like this was you lived in a world of castles.  I  lived in an apartment, but most of my friends lived in these fantastic monstrosities full of cool stuff.    For some reason, this reminds me to call my friend Sue.

      Dale and i went to see X2 yesterday.  It was pretty cool.  I know nothing about the X-men.  I didn't see the first one.  But it was pretty cool anyway.  One complaint, and i suppose this can be made of any movie taken from a comic... it was kind of predictable.  You knew as soon as you saw a dam, the dam was going to give out at some point.  And regarding the dam, (wont give away the movie here), i don't understand why the ice-guy didn't just stick his hand out and use HIS power, rather than that telepath/telekinete chick doing what she did.    Dale gave me a rundown of a sort on the X-men comics after the movie.  Good to have a guy like that around.  :)  I mentioned it must be a really cool time for diehard comic fans, because film technology has finally gotten to where it can render these comic-worlds in a way thats realistic. Looking at the Flash Gordon series of the 50s and then the movie from the 70s, and then X-men 2, is to watch visual technology make huge leaps and bounds, with perhaps the defining point of a big jump being the original Star Wars.  That movie enthralled because of its effects, which were completely new at the time.    I still think Glenn Danzig would have made the quintessential Wolverine.  But Glenn doesn't act, so, oh well.

      This post is specifically for  egypt , but any of y'all can read it :P   On playing music in front of people :  Seems terrifying, doesn't it? I mean.. you get up with your guitar in front of a crowd with a lot of booze in it, and you pour your heart and soul out for 2 to 4 hours.    The first time, hell yeah, it was terrifying.  But every time, it got easier, and it got easier in new ways.  Fact is, though, you don't pick up an instrument and stick with it, even learning to play other instruments, for six years without, at some point, thinking, "I really want to share how excited i am about this chunk of wood and wires with other people".  It becomes something you  have  to do.  Not because people tell you to, but because it feeds you and you thrive on it.    After a show, everyone loves us.  Everyone hugs us.  Everyone says "you guys sound great".  People want you back.  They want to PAY US to come back.  How cool is THAT? To get paid for whacking away at some strings and bebopping around and maybe yelling into a mike a few times... wearing odd clothes and having funny hair...   My dad (a very staid, rather conservative type person, quite different than my father) and i had a conversation about it one day, and that's what i told him.  That its fantastic to go act like an idiot for a few hours, and then have someone hand you a wad of dough for it.  And he thought about it a few minutes, and then he agreed.    Some people are completely different on stage than off stage.  IRL, i'm fairly shy, rather introverted, don't say much.  (I just have a penchant for funky clothes, is all).  But you get to put this "costume" on when you play.  You can be anything, anyone, you want to be.  That kills the fear of getting onstage, you put on this costume of someone who loves to be the center of attention.  The other thing that kills it is that, hey, if i make a mistake, no one is really gonna care, as long as i'm playing music and providing them with the beat to move their feet to.

       urlLink Gabby  has finished his six-part "The Day The Music Died".    I said it in your comments Gabs, and i'm saying it again.   Don't stop writing the blog .   And i want to add, read up on this guy:  urlLink  Mike Watt  .  (the link i promised)  Here's some background for you about him: The Minutemen were three childhood friends from glorious San Pedro CA.  As teens, they started a band.  They knew  nothing  about playing.  It became one of the very best punk bands that ever came out of Los Angeles (which, depending on your outlook about that type of music, could mean various things).  in 1986, D. Boon, Watts best friend and the singer of the Minutemen was killed in a car accident.  Watt was adrift after that.  Then some crazy guy named Ed, in Ohio, started calling him and talking about a band, thinking about the band, and then Ed flew out to Pedro, and they formed fIREHOSE while Ed was living in Watt's living room with George Hurley, the Minutemen's drummer.  The music was different.  A lot different.  But it was still there.   Maybe i'm wrong, but i don't think the muse just flees us.  I think she hides a lot, i think she puts on different costumes or forces us to pick up a paintbrush or a pencil instead of a guitar, and i think she changes from her bright shimmering to darkness, making her harder to find.  I think she puts on that darkness when we need her to, when we need to explore some part of ourselves that we haven't paid attention to or is new somehow and unpleasant.    When you've been in the sunlight, the dark is even darker.    I dunno why i'm writing this.  I can only say that to a certain point i can commiserate with Gabby.  Different stuff, for sure, but i've felt that kind of sickening emptiness of being unable to do what i do.. write or draw or whatever.  I mean, its  what i do , and the times that i haven't been able to have been worse than anything else thrown at me.

       urlLink bigsugar.com :: the official Big Sugar website   Because i love THESE guys soooo much, and they almost NEVER come to the US (as much as the small collection of a dozen or so diehard, drooling US fans like me plead and cajole), i just have to expose you to them.  Again, probably.    Since i was born, much has been written about the death and rebirth of rock n roll.  Well folks, here it is.  What you've been waiting for.  The Rebirth.   I distinctly remember my first dose of Gordie and the band.  I was in Nashville. Early 1992.  One night, after working at Sears putting tires on 4 x 4 s all day and replacing batteries, i walked home, cracked a cheap beer, nuked up a box of corndoglets and fell onto the couch in my apartment.  Which just happened to actually be someone else's basement.  Anyway.  I flip on MTV, because MTV was still  relatively  cool... they were showing Ren & Stimpy at the time, and 120 minutes.  It was during one of the shows they were doing, the kind that focused on new or interesting music, that i heard the first sweet chords to  Ride Like Hell  and  Dear M. F.   (yes.  that's a cover of the Status Quo song Dear Mr. Fantasy).  I was hooked.  Line and sinker, that was the end of that.  My jaw was dropped.  my beer tipped in my slack hand, dripping onto the concrete floor.  THERE WAS NO REWIND! I could not live that moment over and over again... no... i was crushed.   Move ahead about two years, to Arizona.  Perhaps 3.  I can't be sure anymore.  I had recently met my sweetie and he was working at KASU in Tempe.  He invited me to come out to the station with him sometime and help him pick music.  Ohhellyeah, i'm all over THAT.    I was rummaging through the CDs, pulling out cool ones and sort of tossing them at him.  One was Maggie Estep's "Fuck Me".  (He got in some trouble for playing that.  We laughed.)  Then my hands fell upon the "Dear M.F." EP.  "DALEJESUSCHRIST Do you realize what a freakin rad band this is? I've only heard two songs from them but you gotta think if THOSE two songs were as fantastic as they were, what's the rest of it like?"  We played Dear M.F.  on the air.  I told him it should be his theme song.    Moving onward another four years or so, Dale and I are here, in Oregon.  I'm listening to a tape with "Dear M.F." on it.  I'm  pining  for more.  I'm thinking, gawd, ain't about time i went out and FOUND some BS stuff?! And so i did, and once again, that was the end of me.  I now have everything by them i could find, including a few bootlegs and live performances.     No other band matters.  I like a lot of music, a lot of bands, but nothing, i mean NOTHING, has whatever it is that Gordie and Big Sugar have. I feel there is hope for modern rock still, as long as bands like Big Sugar are making music.    Moment of smugness: This is one band that i have introduced a ton of people to, of all walks of life, all ages, all tastes in music.   Not one of them  has not like Big Sugar.   Not one of them  has not asked if they ever play in the US.    Not one of them  has NOT asked me for more, or gone out and bought a CD after listening to them.    Its one of  those  bands.  And, if you find yourself disgusted by what you hear on the radio, if the songs all melt together in one big downtuned orgy of shoegazing, raphappy monotony, or give you seizures with a funky trance beat that makes your eyeballs pound with your heartbeat, this is a band you should listen to.    Pardon my pomposity! I feel very strongly about this issue.    Oh yeah.  I don't give a  rat's ass  that they released albums in French.  I think its cool as hell. Gordie makes French sound good.  Je suis cool! (although the production for the french version is a lot different than the production for the english one)

       urlLink Dogtown Journal   I'm not sure what brings me back to this particular blog.  Sometimes i read it and think, "Dude, what if your wife had a blog?" Not sure why i think that.  I just do.  Sometimes i want to grab him by the collar and tell him to get his wife to a freaking  doctor , whether she wants to go or not.  Therapy, meds, groups, something, anything.    How many of us might identify with this guys wife? Even from the short descriptions of her?  Personally, i understand what it means to say "I'm sad and i don't know why".  Sad is perhaps not the right word, though.  Maybe "I'm drowning" is more apt. Something like this:    i think i'm suffering from chronic, acute apathy.  The numbness is generalized in no specific mental distribution.  It wakes me up at night.   It keeps me from getting a good night's sleep.  Getting up  seems to aggravate it.  Alcohol, playing music and cuddling and sunshine help to alleviate it. It is a dull, mindnumbing apathy, sometimes sharp and ugly.  It  interferes in my activities of daily living.  On a scale of 1  to 10, it is usually a 6, though it can be as high as a 9 and as low as a 3.  It feels like i'm wandering around with a wet burka on my head, and occasionally i feel like i've high-centered myself with both axles.   Self-medicating is no longer fun or interesting, but still i cling to it.     Addendum:  I just wanna add that i'm not condemning the writer of Dogtown Journal.  I think he's doing about the best he can in his situation.  But i think there comes a point where helping someone you love means actively doing something to get them help, even outside the confines of family and church. I don't know if he has or not, i don't recall him mentioning it.  Feeling the way his wife does is as frustrating as dealing with someone who feels like that.  It's like, you know something is not right, and you can't put your finger on it, and it's infuriating to not be able to pinpoint what's getting at you. And then you feel even worse about it because you can't escape it.   I read his journal anymore and i can't help but think of  urlLink  gabby   and HIS experience with something similar.

       urlLink Solemn Ceremony: Deadly Duty    Just a recap on the ceremony they had yesterday honoring Lt. Decooperman for his part in the rescue last December of four tugboat guys.    Also, yesterday, they had the party for Benny. He looked swell in his whites :) I got a picture or two of him.  It certainly wasn't anything he expected! Bill asked if he wanted to go out to dinner or something, and then brought him down to the Elks where there was roomful of people waiting to yell "welcome home" at him. It'll probably be in the paper this weekend.  He's gonna be on TeeVee and all, too.    _____  This weekend is Mother's Day weekend.  Must call mum :) Also, like i said, there's a carnival in town.  Same one that always comes through here, Davis.  AAAND there's a bike show at the mall.  The Free Souls wanted us to play tomorrow after the bike show for a party, so, we will! Because they adore us...

      every single day, i'm stunned to see people plastering a label on themselves and then tromping around calling themselves independent thinkers. Especially, y'know, when everything that falls out of their mouths is the gospel of their chosen politics.  You folks are all insane.  All y'all. Insane, hypocrites, blind monkeys on leashes.  I know i know i harp on this all the time, but all the time i have to read and hear and watch the blathering and ranting of all these cookie cutters- it all sounds the same. Got that?  On one side its THE JEWS, on the other side its the FAGS, on another its... the enemy du jour. Cripes, people, get a fucking grip already. They have pills for this kind of shit you know.  You won't get what you want! Ever! No one owes you anything!  Oh hmm yeah i keep hearing about this lack of employment thing... true nuff, i'm sure. So start your own business and shut up.   Why the hell you want some funky boss looking over your shoulder all day, be at work at some crapass time, wimper at your paychecks.  three years ago i saw this guy cruisin around town in a battered orange van with a lawnmower strapped to the back.  Now he's got a nursery and three new trucks, a fine landscaping business.  So, i don't buy it.  Create a job for yourself.   Create the need and fill it.  Take a risk.  Obviously the corporate buffoons don't give a crap about you anyway, why work for any of them?

      wow what a cool thing to wake up to on a saturday morning! Antique airplanes landing at the Lakeside muni strip. They were at an air show in cottage grove and dropped by.  When planes land at the strip, they aren't much more than 500 feet above. Got some neat pictures of them landing from the porch. Some of them flew in formation before they landed, too. Wow was it ever a gearhead's dream here this morning. Most of them had 10 cylinders.   Some quiet, please, as i imagine cramming 10 cyliners under the hood of my toyota.

      well.  You see, i was trying to make some adjustments to the old template.. y'know, take out a dead link here, change a color there, and suddenly everything was totally fucked up and i couldn't fix it.  Faced with bashing my monitor to shit or just throwing a standard template up, i chose the standard template.  Of course, everything that was there on the old template is gone.   I should probably learn how to use the codes on these templates, but i don't feel like it.  That make me lazy of course.  But there's plenty enough for me to learn out in the world without peering at a blogger template for hours on end.   I know as soon as i spend craploads of time screaming obscenities at the blogger thing and managing to get a paltry amount of things back up,  some kind soul will offer to take me in somewhere supported by MT.  Now that i've said that though, no one will, and i'll be forever doomed to booger.   why dont i run MT on my own server space? Cos i've asked them if i could use the stuff MT has, if they support it, a bunch of times and never once got an answer.  So i just store my piccies there and sit here and cry in my fucking beer.  WOE IS ME!

      Something you should be warned about....  The discontinuity thing here.  For a year i posted elsewhere, and that elsewhere is gone.  Many thoughts on various things were pounded out here, and many changes in how i think were, also.  Some of them changed again at the now-gone place, where they were again pounded out.  If you read through these archives,  you might be a bit confused as to who i really am, especially if you only came across me before at the other place.   Well, this is me.  That was me.  The archives are me.   Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.   I am inconsistent,  but i have some core ethics that seem to veer extremely widely from what's generally accepted as okay.  You gotta know that right now or everything here and there will just piss you off and you won't be able to think up enough names to call me.  And even if you did, i'd just smile and nod and laugh at you.  Don't be taking my inventory when yours is in disarray, either.   Now then... it will also take me a good while to get this thing looking halfway decent, get the right links back up and running, get the colors nonblinding.  I run the band blog, and contribute on another one, and they all need babysitting as well.   The House of Nth is about to undergo an extensive, very slow, renovation.  Watch for nails, put on a mask, and be prepared to swing a hammer.
