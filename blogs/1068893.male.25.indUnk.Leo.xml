      as i was relating to my seattle friend via msn messenger: i need to go and install my new shocks tonight, do all my laundry, pack incl. the computer i'm giving my fam, pick up gifts for my sister from my aunt's house, go out for beers, and get enough sleep to drive 14 hours straight tomorrow.  possible? sure is, i'm superman.

      my new friend seems to be having a problem with bf or is it ex-bf? i im'd her and she said, "hold on - i'm being yelled at". now that's a bit sucky. looks like she's going over the his house now to pick up her stuff. i don't think he's home though, in denver maybe? i'm trying not to pry.  i did some xmas gift delivery tonight. only meant to stop real quick and drop off the gifts but ended up talking for awhile. it was very nice, don't seem them very often anymore. was falling asleep in the car on the way home. how can i still be tired?

      i am so stuffed right now.  my seattle friend ended up getting christmas eve and christmas day off and is now able to fly back home for xmas. good for her! i didn't get to spend xmas with my family one year due to work and it sucked. i'll miss out on seeing her but i don't think she's changed since halloween.  i've compiled my list of things to buy this afternoon. should be in and out the the stores quite quickly. then i have to wrap them.  my new friend made it to the lunch gtg (previously not able due to being surgeries all day), her boss brought her (in his lotus, he's the doctor). chicks in scrubs. ooo baby.

      ok, so i'm going to whine about work for a second. i just had a short meeting with my boss, who hails from iowa, about perceived start and end times of my work day. i'm a computer engineer and spend my day doing development and testing. as such, my work schedule is, how'd you say, variable. meaning i get into and leave work whenever i damn well please. when i was initally hired i asked about such things and what was expected of me. i was told that as long as the work gets done, the deadlines are met and the result is pleasent then he doesn't care. well my office is situated near one of the operations groups i engineer for. they see when i get in and when i leave, day in day out. apparently a couple of their managers have complained to my boss about my attendance and have asked what my schedule is. this 'couple' of people are cronic complainers and my manager knows it. i'm just sick and tired of having to defend myself to others that have no reason to be concerned with my buisness. boss says that its mainly his fault for not communicating enough to them and agrees that i am doing what needs to be done.  now that i read through that again, it doesn't sound much like a complaint. poo.  almost time for the noon lunch thing gtg us vw guys do on thursday. today its manuel's since people have gotten tired of pizza. i'm looking forward to it.

      ok, this goes against my adamantly stated music taste,  no country , but yet another dixie chicks song has won me over. first it was  urlLink goodbye earl , how can you not like that song? now its their remake of  urlLink landslide . i've been a  urlLink fleetwood mac  fan since i was little (thanks mom) now hearing it sung by natalie maines how can i not like it?

      i'm up. actually, i've been up since 11:30-ish but have been trying to convience myself otherwise. ended up sleeping when i got home from work, guess i'll be doing shopping after work today.  went and washed my car just a few minutes ago (that's just what some people do this early in the morning!). went to a spray off type place so I had to jump on the deserted freeway for a '120 mph blow dry' :)  used my heated mirrors for the first time to keep them from fogging. they're going to kick ass when i drive to boise. oh yea, i'm driving to boise for christmas to spend it with the fam. definately looking forward to it. my best friend in seattle is stuck there for the holiday's this year so i've invited her to spend xmas day with my family. mapquest says its 505 miles between the two cities. i think i've done the drive in 5 hours. makes me wonder if my friend will need to stay overnight so she doesn't end up on the road for 10 hours in one day. i offered to come get her, still thinking about how that will work. i'd really like to see her and am looking forward to it.  i parked my car in an empty covered spot tonight. i haven't seen anyone park in it since i moved in here, though i wasn't really paying much attention since i have my own garage. but now that my 65 mustang is parked in it (its not running and management will tow any disabled vehicles park outside) my poor  urlLink baby  has to park outside. i'm hungry.

      bypassed water. orange gatorade is where its at. called the boss, told him i was sick and was only going to be in the office until lunch after which i was going home. i'm forcing myself to stay until then, but not because i'm dedicated to my job or anything like that. the helpdesk that exists outside my office is ordering in olive garden and they extended an invite to me. can't pass up on that! now, should i use the afternoon to sleep as intended or should i use it to finish my xmas shopping?

      here i am at work, suffering.  this better be then end of my partying for the week.  my body is shutting down.  i hit 72 hours of not sleeping and i'm losing the ability to stay vertical.  my contacts wouldn't stay in this morning. swollen puffy red eyes.  on a good note, the party was a blast.  seemed like people had a good time and my place is totally cleanable.  was not thrashed like i expected.  of course i have to give credit to my jello shot making friend as she seemed to keep the kitchen clean most of the night.  that brings me to another thought, my new friend. the last 2 weeks have been the biggest partying weeks for me this year.  i met her during this time.  i'm thinking that i may be creating the wrong image of me in her mind, though she has partied just as hard over the same length of time so i don't know if its an issue after all.  except when i calm down again for a bit and then maybe she'll see me as boring.  i need water.

      just checked the forums, looks like i have quite the mix of rsvps for tonight...things are looking up.  one of the new ppl i've been hanging out with is bring a 'batch' of jello shots. here is the im i got from her:  Official count - 62 shots, 7 flavors, 1.75L of Vodka . can you say ouch? between my guiness and these i should be legally dead by 8p. i'm hoping to get some good pictures tonight, dunno if they will make it into this blog. i'm still a bit wary of posting identifing info up here.  laundry is done drying.

      i didn't think i'd post again until tomorrow, but i have this wierd urge to write.  i left work about an hour ago so i could come home and do some quick cleaning. i'm feeling my 3rd wind coming so that's good. everytime i put something together i always get a bit nervous - will people show? will my neighbors get me evicted? am I going to make it into work tomorrow?  that foo fighters song is on the radio right now,  urlLink all my life .  man, something about this song, it rules.

      ok, so here it is. my first blog, the result of peer pressure and the need to belong to the in crowd. i have tons to say, especially after the week i've had, but since its only half way over i think i'm going to wait a bit. i'm throwing a party tonight so i should have some juicy bits tomorrow. oh, btw, i'm going on 48 hours without sleep. gotta love insomnia. cheers.

      had another party at my place tonight.  pretty mellow, though my friend is pretty drunk.  but that's the point, right?  more so it means i get to spend more time with her since she can't drive home.  my neighbor upstairs came over too, so that's good that we've finally met.  i should get back out there, have a good evening!

      i'm home again.  i smell like gasoline, grease, and cigarette smoke.  i guess that happens when you spend a few hours in a car shop.  but we were just talking!  looks like i will be taking my car in monday night for the install and should have it back by wednesday night.  one of my buddies has offered to loan me his car for those couple days.  that's damn nice of him.  i'm getting all excited!

      my heat broke last night.  i had to go out and get firewood to keep from getting frost bite. ;)  maintence guy let himself in at 8:30 this morning much to my surprise as i was sleeping.  nothing like the rush of hearing a stranger's voice in your own house when you know there shouldn't be anyone there with you.  heats back on now.  i went and did a quick consulting job today.  easy money for 3 hours work.  i also met up with my vw friends for lunch at tgi friday's.  now i'm waiting to drive out to that shop i was talking about the other day cuz my turbo kit is in!! yay!

      it was a sexy day...   sorry, had to post that.  was watching sex in the city last night (earlier morning) with my friend and that line was used as the opener to a journal.  who does that?  so new years came and went without much excitement.  i volunteered to be the dd so i kept it at 2 guinesses for the night.  the other 5 ppl in my car got pretty drunk and had a very good time.  everyone got home safe and that's what really matters.  of course i would have had liked a kiss at midnight from someone, oh well.  found out that my upstairs neighbor is friends with my friend via school.  maybe she'll come down and party with me now?

      confessions via email of feelings and thoughts...are they really that moving?  easy to put together and send, yes...but do they get the point across like saying them in person or even writing a actual, physical letter?  probably not, but its too hard to tell how or if someone can take emotional honesty in the face and creating physical evidence that your soul exists only tends to come back and haunt you.  fuck ppl, just read my goddamn mind!

      i have a problem.  this is a car related problem so for those not interested, look away for a bit.  i bought a turbo upgrade kit for my car and it should be here any day now.  my problem is finding someone or a shop to help with the install and not charge me an arm and a leg.  i had some friends offer in the begining, but now they are backing out.  i have a line on a shop but they are just a bit pricey though they'd get the job done right and probably fairly quickly.  now i also have a couple ppl that would help, for a price yet to be known, and they are knowledgable about my car.  i just have never seen them work nor do i know how long it would take them.  i'm thinking that it is probably worth the money compared to time and stress to go with the shop, after all the shop builds race cars!  i'm just having a hard time spending that kind of cash on something that could be done in a garage, especially when i have other things i need to buy like a new bed and new tires.  what a mindless rant.

      the spending has begun. first i bought have a year's worth of 'by hand' car washes from the place i go to. then i bought the 10 speakers (componets and subs) that i need to finish building my car audio system. and now i bought a 128mb compact flash card for my digi.  tomorrow i'm going to either shop for a new bed or do new tires & a 4 wheel alignment.  which ever's left after that i'll do thursday/friday.  can you see the fire from this hole in my pocket where you are? ;)

      here's a quote i find amusing at the moment:   "Scenario 1: Tom meets Jane. She's pretty and seems interesting to talk to. Tom and Jane start haging out and talking more and more. Tom develops an attraction to Jane, and one day tries to kiss her. Jane tell Tom she doesn't think of him that way and she wants to remain friends. The next few weeks contact between the two falls off. Jane starts fucking an outlaw biker.  Ladder Theory Explanation: Tom met Jane. Tom was immediately placed on the friends ladder. Tom didn't know this. Tom tried to jump ladders. Jane kicked Tom in the head rather than let him on and sent him hurtling to the Abyss below. The oulaw biker was not on her friends ladder (they never are) but rather on her good ladder."  you can read more of the same  urlLink here .

      well i made it home yesterday.  14 hours straight, only to get into town and have a party thrown at my place!  i was so ill this morning.  serves me right for drinking so much when the only thing i had to eat was a breakfast sandwich at burger king at 6am that day. that and the exhaustion of driving all day.  uugh.  on a different note, i know that my new friend is probably just wanting to be friends.  had a dinner date tonight planned and i got an email from her this afternoon asking if it was just a friend dinner kind of thing.  bummer.  optimism says that maybe its just avoidance because she did just end her other relationship, the mirror tells me is just me.  oh well.   i have lots of shopping to do this week. i need to buy new tires and get a 4 wheel alignment, the rest of the speakers for my sound system in the car, a new bed, a dining room table of some sort or a new computer desk. that and i need my car washed and detailed inside and out deserately.  good thing i have this whole week off.  hopefully i won't procrastinate too much.

      so i didn't get any sleep again last night. but that is my fault. i stayed up late (2:30am) chatting with a car buddy of mine and publicly venting my disdane for another person on our local vw forum. i was in rare form. but i really don't like the kid and he was posting comments that irritated me. oh well.  i'm not really that tired today, but once the festivities have been going for a few hours tonight, i'm sure i'll start to crash. oh, didn't i say? yet another party at my place. i'm surprised my house doesn't smell like alcohol all the time.

      i'm dying.  ok, well maybe not actually dying, but i don't feel so good. my allergies have been acting for the past week or so and today they are at an all time high. if my sinuses don't knock this shit off soon i'm having them surgically removed.  oh, and the shop is having problems getting my turbo kit installed. yay.

      i did something kind of silly tonight. i put a deposit down for the vw r32 (arrival date in september). if you're interested in knowing more about this car, click  urlLink here . this car is beautiful and would make a perfect daily driver. my deposit is refundable but i don't think that will be a problem once september comes around.

      today is a bit more sane than yesterday.  found out that some code i wrote yesterday doesn't work even though i already overnighted it to minneapolis. oh well.  my friend whom i talk about all time has this 98 tdi new beetle that has been in the shop 7 times in the past 6 months. well today she took it in again for another check engine light. i went down to the dealership to give her a ride out to her parents house so she wouldn't be stranded at the dealership (actually i just needed an excuse to go somewhere for lunch and seeing her sounded like a good deal). we had a nice lunch at chuy's and then i got to see her 59 ghia that she is restoring. it was so cool.  granted it needed sanding, paint and other little bits but that in no way reduced its coolness. i've been looking at a lot of older aircooled vw's lately (with her help) and i think i'm going to pick one up as a second car (a running, no work necessary type). would be useful to have when my car is getting stuff done to it and cool to boot!

       urlLink classmates.com , a for-profit who's who/where website, is about to get my money.  my  urlLink friend and fellow blogger  posted today about this site and about receiving an email from an old boyfriend. sensing that i may too have old flames/friends wishing to contact me, i logged into the site and checked. low and behold i have messages waiting!  a couple ppl i had almost forgotten about, 3 ppl i tried to forget about and 1 person who i haven't talked to in about a year.  on top of that, listed in one of my previous schools, is my best bud who my friends at the time and myself thought had gone missing over these past years. excited to see his name on the list i click the 'email me' link to send him a 'hi how are ya/where ya been' and i'm confronted with a pay or die page! i understand they need to make money somehow, but i remember when this site was free!  and at $36, its a little steep just to get the email address of an old friend. but as i sit here and think about it i'm starting to cave in. would be nice to hear how the old guy is doing...

      i have so much crap to do!  today is my first day back after my holiday vacation.  i have 5 critical issues to attend to on top of the 2 big projects that have been on hold while i was gone.  the worst part is that these issues are caused by things outside my control and i have to figure out some kind of work around.  i am so ready for lunch!

      so i'm home.  had a pretty good night.  got to spend some time with my friend and other friends.  took in a couple flix at a buddies house, drank some beers, and looked at some aircooled vw pics.  my friend took my car to go get some beer for herself while the rest of us chatted.  she was gone for a bit, but when she got back she had not only got herself beer, but guinness for me and put some gas in my tank (i was on empty)!  i was so surprised.  but get this, when we go to leave i get in my car and there is a little riced out hot wheels in my console.  she said it was so terrible looking (and funny) she just had to get it for me.  too cute.  all this while i'm listening to the new cd's in my collection courtesy of her (i have like ten burned cd's to listen to that she thought i would like)!  this girl is awesome.  like i said, it was a pretty good night.

      my friend's car got broken into last night! :( doesn't look like anything of value was taken, just a broken passenger window and lots of glass everywhere. i feel so bad. she always parks her car outside my place overnight and nothing has ever happened. she didn't even have anything visable inside the car to entice the robbers. it sucks, i feel like its my fault or something. and now i'm very concerned about my car being out there! looks like i need to push the mustang out of the garage and swap places with the jetta's covered spot.  i feel so bad.

      so i got invited to a suns game tonight. box seats. basketball isn't really my favorite sport, but it isn't the most hated either. actually, i don't really enjoy watching sports that much, except for the occasional hockey game, though i know nothing about it. its been a long time since i've seen the suns play. i stopped watching back when they blew the playoffs during thier 25th anniversery year. do i even know who is on the team?

      i'm going to disneyland!  or the california experience park...or both. my friend called me today and asked if i had monday off and if so, did i want to do something. i said of course and left her to figure out what. well after i secured monday off from the boss, i checked back with her and she decided disneyland was the place to be. isn't that cool? my weekend is all but planned out already! i have a happy hour friday to go to for my buddy's graduation, the pavillions gtg saturday night, a vintage vw car show sunday and disneyland through monday night. wow, that sounds like a lot of stuff, and a lot of fun. i'm all giddy!

      i got my car today! i have to take it easy for about 500 miles to let everything break-in properly. it has a small oil leak at one of the custom flanges that i'm getting fixed tomorrow morning before i go to work.  other than that, the car runs real nice and smooth. i can't wait to be able to smash the pedal down and see what she really can do!

      do you do aircooled? i'm driving my buddies aircooled vw bus today while i wait for my car to be ready. this thing is a blast to drive! even though its a chore to get it started when the engine is cold, a chore to get it moving from a complete stop, a chore to shift into any gear (especially reverse!), and a chore to brake in time, it is totally fun to drive! its very weird to sit in front of the front wheels. i recommend you giving it a try if you get the chance!

      guess what?! my friend came over again tonight and made me dinner! it was homemade spagetti. she made the sauce from scratch and everything. does she rock or what?!  i'm also on disc two of the sopranos, about halfway done with the season. i get the feeling from my friend that i need to watch them quickly so i can watch the second season with her. she has only watched one episode of the second season and is holding off until i get caught up. i'm really enjoying these shows. they rock!  i got the tracking number for my car's ecu (its the last piece left to sort out) and it is scheduled to arrive tomorrow. barring any issues when they start the car up for the first time i could be back behind the wheel by tomorrow night. that would rock!

      well, i'm here posting in my blog which means i'm not at disneyland.  the trip got cancelled because my friend whom with which i was to go was also the same friend who's car got broken into the other night. since she starts school tomorrow, today was the only day she could get her window replaced. oh well, i didn't really have the money for the trip anyway. but we did go for a drive last night to rack up the last 200 miles of the break-in on my new turbo thingie. that was a good time. took us awhile to do it too, from about 1:30a to 6:45a. its surprising how long it actually takes to cover a certain distance when you are trying for x number of miles. must be the old 'a watched pot never boils' deal. anywho, since i have the day off i suppose i should make something of it.  oh and that old highschool friend has suggested olive garden for wednesday night...i'll have to check the ol' pocket book and make sure i can cover that.

      ok, so i have this 'fun' drive happening tomorrow where a bunch of us vw ppl take our cars up into the north twisty roads and have a good time driving fast. well as you know, i recently had some goodies installed on my car to make it faster so i have been very much looking forward to this trip tomorrow.  guess what! the car is in the damn dealership getting a factory piece replaced that just failed under warrenty! and if it wasn't a coolant leak, i'd still take the car, but since it is i now have a loaner car from the dealership and won't get my car back until monday. it sucks. but i'm going to make the best of it. as it stands i may be taking my co-pilot's tdi new beetle though i am trying to con one of my other friends into letting me use one of his 'spare' turbo cars.  anywho, enough about cars...i know my only vistor is bored by talk of such things.  i'm not tired today. :)

      went over to a friends house last night...same friend i helped move in the other weekend. we all ended up going out to a skate park and i watched them 'thrash', as they call it. pretty amusing none the less. did some high speed driving on the way home with my neighbors...my speedo saw 140 a couple times ;)  today has been pretty good. chocolate cake was passed around for the february birthday ppl. i actually had some and enjoyed it, i'm not usually a cake type person.  my disinterested friend is talking to me again and she seems to be in a better mood. must have been to much stress with work and homework for her to have to deal with me too...hmm...that situation sounds familar...  Not all that tired today...might be because i didn't bother getting up until after 8. :P

      i'm tired today. i didn't sleep well last night. i couldn't stop thinking about my disinterested friend and what i might have done wrong. you see she hasn't really been talking to me the past few days. now i know that she has like a ton of homework and that she could use a fair amount of sleep, but i keep seeing her active on the vw forum at all hours of the night yet she's not responding to any of my instant messages sent through the forum. she does respond to im's sent via msn and aim, or rather she responded to them last night. the night before i was talking to myself. i'm sure she is a bit stressed right now but i can't help but feel that there is more to our lack of communication recently. it makes me sad.

      i got my car back! yay!  i also showed up an entire tech support group at work by solving an issue they have been having since friday in about 10 minutes today. i rock, management knows it.  i'm having one of my female vw friends over tonight. same one i went to the no doubt concert with back in november. i've been kind of putting her off lately due to my newer friend that i really like but since she isn't diggin' on me then there is no reason to avoid this other girl. why shouldn't i spend time with someone that likes me?  and last, but not least, my super bestest friend says i'm still number one in her book!!!  you have no idea how great that makes me feel.  here's to a great day! cheers.

      so i found out that my friend who i am interested in thinks i am trying too hard and that she might be getting a bit agitated. not exactly what i was looking to hear, especially after i had already ordered a valentine's day delivery to her work a few weeks ago. thankfully i was able to change it from something that shouts 'i fucking like you, damn it' to something a lit more mellow. i'm sure getting a dozen roses delivered to her work in front of all her co-workers would have put her in an uncomfortable position and probably made her mad at me. damn women. why are all the good ones taken, not interested, or living in other states?  other than all that, i had pretty good weekend. i helped a friend move into a new house, did that cruise through northern az with my vw friends, and i went to a party.  today, i am suppose to get my car back.  i'm very tired today.

      just got back from seeing the movie  urlLink daredevil . a friend took me to see it with his girlfriend. it was ok...some good action, but a bit too much affleck. parts seemed to drag on. oh well, it was free and i appreciated the trip outside. did i mention its been raining here all day. its been wonderful! i absolutely love it. speaking of which, i chitt chatted with my disinterested friend tonight too. seems she noticed that i haven't been around all week and wondered if i've been hiding. did you catch that?  she noticed i haven't been around!  needless to say i was a bit giddy.  oh and for those keeping track at home, the prime rib leftovers from lunch today reheated nicely - plus my movie friends brought me a burger from carl's jr, out of the blue! tasty as well. starving while utterly broke, not this week! :) now its time for sleep.

      night number two in poverty has passed. i didn't go anywhere.  there was an osbornes marathon or something on mtv that sucked me in for a good three hours.  how wonderful would my life be if i could wander about throughout the day including the word fuck in almost every sentance. i tell ya i'd be a lot less stressed, that's for sure. as for food, reheated krispy kreme glazed donuts were quite good as a dinner entree. and from what i hear this morning, work will be ordering olive garden for lunch. take that you budget minded fools! i still survive, without money! i rule!

      well i made it through the night. summer sausage reserves have been reduced to 1/2 and the peanut butter stands at 1/16 of a jar.  had some friends get together last night but i had to decline joining them. the gas it would have consumed along with the beer i couldn't buy would have been too much to deal with. of course they offered to pick me up, and of course they offered to buy me a beer, but damn it! i will not mooch. i'm poor because of me and i can deal with it. having this blog helps, i'm able to whine and complain here and still have the tough outer shell when talking with my friends.  maybe i should change the title from i make mistakes to i whine like a little bitch. seems recent comments are leaning toward that...

      so i am offically broke.  that's right, my account balance is 0. as in zero, zilch, nada.  how could this be? what hard times have befallen me to bring about such poverty? nothing.  i just didn't budget very well and with some non-frugal spending i've found myself penniless with 4 days to go until a paycheck or tax refund graces my bank account. to add to the fun, i have less than half a tank of gas.  and on top of that, i have dwindling food supplies - half a package of tortillas, 1/8 a jar of peanut butter, 3 or 4 handfuls of potato chips, and 3/4 of a mini summer sausage. i'm thinking about registering as a third world country...

      so i cleaned up my office yesterday. got rid of all the boxes and misc crap that had been collecting over the past couple months. sitting in here today, it feels like this place is huge! i left work right after i finished yesterday so i didn't really get the chance to realize the change but having been here all day today it feels like i have enough room to play football or something in here. i even have stuff up on have the walls, which is 100% more than i have up on my walls at home. in fact, my home looks as sterile as the untouched have of my office. i need a decorator, for both places.  i wonder what's going on tonight.

      hola to the comment trolls!  on a different note - drinking on a work night is a good thing, no? stocking up the fridge with liquid goodies for the rest of the week (read weekend fun) is ok, right? cutting a cop off and telling him he was in the wrong (he was, he had the yield) on your way home from the second happy hour of the night is cool, correct?  what an uneventful evening.

      have you ever had one of those thoughts where you know exactly what you want, what will make you happy for the rest of your life but you can't see how to make it happen or if its even possible and you get so frustrated from the whole idea you just want to scream?!  yeah, i got one of those.

      i decided to for go work today. just didn't seem like a worth while venture. here's my day:  -i meandered out of bed around 10:30 -showered and got dressed -swung by the office to pick up buddy for lunch -lost a bolt in the carrier of the front driverside brake caliper on the way to fry's electronics -fix problem in parking lot of amerisuites (buddy found bolt down the street, other buddy showed up with socket to reattach bolt) -bought wireless pc card for my laptop and pen tablets -had some chicken strips at carl's jr. -dropped buddy back off at office -swung by apartment to pick up tires that arrived today -went to discount tire to get them mounted and balanced -visited buddy out in bfe to pass the time around rush hour -came home  now lets see what kind of fun i can get into tonight!

      did my brake install last night. well actually, went over to a buddy's house and he did most of the brake install last night. the front 2 rotors where seized onto the hubs. took us an hour and a half to break them loose. total time: 6 hours. maybe beer shouldn't be a valid form of payment - it tends to interupt the service you're paying for.  its still raining here. i love it. i absolutely love it!

      stupid bank! who knows when i'll get my tires now! let me back up a little bit.  so i use my debit card to make purchases online and irl since its a gold card and has like a $6000 pos limit (which is considerably higher than the standard $600 pos limit on regular debit cards). well my current card is expiring this month and i have been wondering when my replacement card was going to arrive. the other day it did. i called the 800 number on the sticker stuck to the card to activated it and then cut up the old card thinking everything was hunky dory. so i make a purchase online for new tires yesterday. about an hour later i get a call from the tirerack (.com, where i purchased them from) wanting to confirm the tire sizes i ordered as they didn't match their database of oem wheels for my car. i confirmed with them that the sizes were correct and i new which sizes i needed. after i hung up i thought great sales service, checking on ppl's orders to make sure they don't accidentally order the wrong tires and delay the correct ones. well an hour after that i get an email stating that they cannot confirm my billing address and i need to call them. i'm thinking why didn't they call me about this, or more over, why did the sales guy mention this when he called about the tire sizes? so i call them and the lady tells me that the automated system rejected my address. so i tell her that it is correct and i would know seeing in that i work for the same bank and can view my own account at work. she jots down 'customer knows address is correct since he works for the same bank'. i think cool and don't give it a second thought. today i get a call on my cell phone, which i miss, from another lady at the tirerack stating that they still couldn't verify my address and i need to call her back. now i'm irked. i go to dial up the tirerack but then i think to myself, maybe i should double check the card address here. so i pull up my account only to see that i can't view the card address, only my checking account address. i call the back line into the premier phone bank support desk (its good to be 'inside' the bank  ) and ask that they check the address on my new card. and what is the answer? uh duh, it is different than my other accounts! why? they don't know! does the address match anything under my name? nope. so i ask them to change it to match the other accounts. great. now i get to call the tirerack back and tell them that my overly self confident answer of 'i know its correct since i work for them' is wrong and now its been updated and i am sorry and would they please run it through again. super. and i was hoping i would get my tires by friday. good luck.

      i had a new friend invite me over to her place last night. it was a good way to spend a few hours of a week night.  you know, i'm getting tired/confused using the phrases 'friend', 'new friend', 'disinterested friend', 'old friend', and such. i think i need to switch to the whole first letter of their first name bit. maybe i should do a write up of all of them like i've seen in other blogs just to set the record straight and make it easier on myself in future posts. i'll ponder that for a bit.  oh, and my new brakes arrived today! about time too, i really need to get rid of this mushy pedal feeling.

      so we had a dyno day yesterday for us local vw guys. my car put down 223 wheel hp and 230 wheel ft/lbs.  that equates to 270 crank hp and 278 crank ft/lbs!! not bad for a car that comes stock at 180 crank hp and 175 crank ft/lbs.    after the dyno the day just seemed boring. i couldn't shake the feeling. went out to the usual car show hang out last night and was too bored to stand it. went to a party at a friends house and just wasn't entertained enough. i actually just wanted to go home and go to bed. so i did. isn't that weird?  bbq today at another friends house - i should go get ready and get over there.

      fuck!    so i decided to work the rest of the day from home. well i get here and as I go to pull into my parking spot i see one of the stupid golf carts that belong to the maintence ppl have parked in my spot. now by the time i realize that i am not going to be able to fit in the spot with that golf cart there i have already started to pull in. being frustrated that i cannot park in my spot i put the car in reverse intending to back into one of the uncovered spots behind me. i start to move backwards and bam! i hit some guy who was whipping around my half turned car using the empty uncovered spots as the road. the guy is pissed. we're talking tall angry (don't flame me for this) black guy, pissed at me. I move my car forward a bit and get out to see the damage. all i can see on my rear bumper are some scuffs the color of the guys maroon car. his damage is worse. the sheet metal on the forward section of his rear passenger side quarter panel is dented in. its possible that the edge of the rear door is also dented. he's shouting. he yells that i didn't even look, but it doesn't come out with the same authority that the 'damns' and 'shits' and 'fucks' have been. i say i didn't see him. i explain that i couldn't get into my spot since the golf cart was there and I had to back out. at this time the maintence guy comes around the corner. angry guy starts yelling at him for parking his fucking cart in my spot. then angry guy gets back into his car and drives down to his destination a little further down the complex. maintence guy moves his cart. i pull in and get out. angry man comes walking back to look at my damage. he realizes that i was barely affected and gets more mad. then he says something that makes everything better, for me at least. he says he doesn't have insurance and i can't do shit for him. he stomps off. i go inside. without being an insured driver he can't make a claim and since it was on private property he can't call the police to make a report with the idea in mind to file a claim against my insurance. i'm relieved, upset that it all happened, but relieved. now i'm only worried about some kind of 'retaliation' against my poor parked car. fuck.

      hmm...i missed posting yesterday. weird, i don't remember being too busy. in fact, not a whole lot happened yesterday. i did finally get to talk to my disinterested friend. she says don't worry about it, 'ppl do stupid things when they are drunk, its ok'. she says that she is not mad anymore, she is over it. i asked if she forgave me, she said yes, but not to do it again. guess what? i still don't know what happened. she wouldn't say, nobody else knows and since its done and in the past now, i don't think i'll ever get to know. damn. oh well, i am happy that she is not mad anymore. i even left a little token of my appreciation on her car this morning before i made it into the office: a funny card and a $10 gift card to starbucks. wednesday is her hell day with work and school accounting for 16+ hours of the day so i'm hoping that my little gift will help start her day off good. of course being up early enough to leave something on her car meant i was in the office by 5:30. yuck. i don't see me making it past lunch today. but in the mean time i have plenty to entertain myself with. i got tons of  urlLink south park  episodes, a few  urlLink clone high  episodes, and all of seasons 2-4 with half of season 1 of  urlLink the sopranos  copied onto my laptop last night. i just may get caught up on the sopranos before season 5 starts!

      well it sounds like i fucked up big time.  apparently i was a real big asshole to my disinterested friend at the party. i don't remember any of it though. all i know is that at least a couple know i was a jerk and that my friend isn't talking to me right now. here is a copy of the last conversation i had with her:  (12:08 pm 3-3-2003) me: was i really stupid saturday night? i don't remember getting home or anything. do you really have pictures?   (2:08 pm 3-3-2003) her: you were really stupid. do you remember me threatening to hit you? (2:29 pm 3-3-2003) me: omg!  you're kidding right? what did i do? i'm so sorry. (5:59 pm 3-3-2003) me: well, I'm going over to t's to help him swap out his ecu so he can take his car into the dealership. you should let me take you out to dinner tonight after you get off work so i can appologize for saturday night. i feel real bad. give me a ring, i'll be 'right down the street'   as you can see, she didn't respond after to either of my two replies. i've talked to a few people who know that she is mad at me but they don't know why. i just heard from a good friend of both of ours that when he called to 'get the scoop' the first thing she ask was along the lines "are you calling for him?" i'm fucked. i don't know what i did and she isn't talking to me so i can't make amends. i feel so bad right now. i don't know what i'm going to do.

      what a weekend.  friday night i ended up having some people over. not for too long as we found out there was another party up in scottsdale that had more people at it so we all left and headed there. i didn't stay long there. a house full of just out of high school kids, alcohol, and weed. not my scene.  saturday i went over to my buddy's house to finish my brake job. i got my calipers painted (low gloss black), my brake fluid flushed and replaced with ate super blue, and i detailed my wheels, since they were off the car. my disinterested friend also came by with new wheels and tires, so i put those on her car for her.  urlLink they look really good .  saturday night was a huge party hosted by mutual friends of us veedubbers, a mini trucker group. i brought along my new friend. needless to say, i overindulged. now i had been enjoying beer all day while working on the cars and at the party i didn't slow down. 30 something beers and at least 2 double shots of tequila were consumed. i don't recall getting home or getting into bed. my date apparently drove me back (her car was at my place anyway) and made sure i got in ok. she still talked to me the next day so i could not have been too stupid.    sunday was retribution for saturday night's escapades. i felt horrible. i was queasy all day, never once left the house. i did manage to get all my laundry done. missed a bbq too. the movie working girl was on like 5 fucking times, seemed every time i changed the channel it was showing. i had the misfortune of catching the scene where melanie griffith and harrison ford are sharing tequila shots at a bar. my stomach was very upset after watching that. twice.  that brings us to today! feeling good, no pressing issues, relaxed. lets see how long it lasts.

      my friend made it into town ok last night. she was a bit tired. today her and the fam are off to rocky point for a week. damn i miss rocky point trips. been almost 6 months since my last trip and i don't see a trip in sight this year.    did some work today, at work no less. it was just a laptop reimage, something i don't usually do but my guy who does them took the week off so i figured what the heck i can get my hands dirty every once and awhile. it was a very rewarding 30 minute experience.

      ok, ok. so i totally meant to come into work today at a normal time, but i didn't. i wandered in just before noon. ugh. now that i'm here, i just want to leave. my car needs to be washed and waxed since having it buffed on saturday. i have almost 3 full seasons of the sopranos left to watch. a buddy of mine just gave me a whole slew of south park episodes that i need to go through and sort. and my new friend isn't working today so i thought we'd go catch a movie. as you can see i have more important things to be doing than to be here at work. i'm leaving in the next hour.

      my patience are wearing thin here. i'm not finding much joy in anything around me at the moment. my job is getting irritating, my car is getting boring, girls are aggrevating, and there just doesn't seem to be anything to do here anymore. of course that's all just my perspective on things which could be skewed. who knows - it just seems i'm unhappy again. why am i so moody?

      i think i'm getting fed up with the girls here. its like they are feining interest - but why? if they aren't really interested in me then why do they continue to call and want to hang out? god its aggrevating. more over, why can't the girls that are more mature be more interested in me instead of the less mature girls wanting more of my time. one can only have too many mindless conversations with a person before they want to strangle them.

      ok, so i slept last night. and for a rather long time too (6p-10a). but man did i have a crazy dream. i'll try and write down as much of it as i can remember:   i'm using some kind of im program trying to get ahold of my friend but instead i'm getting back this wierd auto-response message in a language that i don't recognize. somehow i figure it out as to mean that she is away on a skiing trip in new zeland with some guy. next thing i know i'm being invited by friends (though i don't recognize them as anyone i know) to go skiing up in the mountains. i agree and we're off. i realize that we are jumping out of helicopters down onto the snowy mountains which are almost vertical down hill runs. i'm thinking to myself that i'm going to die or break something but i don't say anything, i just jump. i'm trying really hard to make it down the mountain alive. i can see every bit of the descent and i'm trying to do moves like i've seen in the movies where you cross back and forth. i somehow make it to the bottom which is a stream with a very small sandy beach. i wake up.   wtf?!

      bug-o-rama was today. man i feel spent. up at 5:15a after going to bed at 1:30a makes 8 hours in the sun seem like forever. i managed not to get sunburned this year, so that's a positive. time for a shower and maybe a nap before people start arriving here for tonight's party.

      i'm afraid that the guy who made the offer on the mustang is going to back out. he couldn't 'get it together' today and asked to make the deal tomorrow. i'm a bit aggravated with him after the myriad of phone calls i received from him today. i even drove to the other side of town to get the title out of my safebox (which i would have to do anyway, but i did it in the middle of the work day because he was going to be giving me the cash this afternoon). ugh. i hope this goes through - i need to get this sold.

      hmm...with all the pissing and moaning i've been doing i've failed to mention the movie binge i've been on. here's a quick list of what i've watched recently: a clockwork orange, fear and loathing in las vegas, the fifth element (again), monsters ball, american pie 2, 100 girls, phone booth, brazil (new purchase), and college fuckfest vol. 5 (via the internet [hey, i'm still male!])  all have provided me the necessary 1-3 hour escapes i've needed lately.

      its just after 4 in the morning. i've been lying awake in bed unable to sleep. i left the computer on with my playlist left playing. i thought the music would be soothing, and it was, but not in a way to put me to sleep.  4:20 now. stepped away into one of the bathrooms, caught a glimse of myself in the mirror. man i look like shit. haven't shaved in almost a week, still in the same clothes i was wearing at the beginning of the weekend.  i think i'm going to browse some miscellaneous blogs via google to pass the time. i have a couple hours until i can call vw roadside assistance to come tow my car to the dealership. then i need to find a way into the office. though i don't think there is anything there for me either.

      small update here. the dealership felt my pain and i ended up only paying $25 for all the service i had done and it looks like they may cover the charge for the rental truck. the tow company charged my card the impound fee anyway even though i didn't sign the slip or authorize the charge so i called it in to dispute it with my bank which means they cancelled my card and issued another one. now i have to wait 5-7 business days before i get a new card in the mail. i started shopping for a new digital camera since its all but hopeless that the police with recover my stolen one. i placed an order for one last night but since the store is closed for passover through today, they won't get to processing my order until tomorrow and since my card has been cancelled and closed that order is going to reject. so now i have to wait until my new card arrives before i can even buy a new camera not to mention the fact that i live off my card and will be s.o.l. for the next week without it. my new department at work has me swamped with shit to do and without my work laptop, i'm scrambling around trying to keep up. everything fucking sucks.

      i haven't posted in awhile - i've been dealing with a lot of shit. besides the heartbreak i've been afflicted with, this is what's happened this past week.  -car needed its 25000 mile service (~$250) -car's transmission is bad, needs replaced (under warrenty) -given dodge ram gas guzzler as rental car while car is in the shop ($10/day + gas @ 15mpg) -car repair taking long time (still not finished, est. completion: tuesday, 22nd) -stupid vw friend recked his car in front of the resort where i live while drunk friday afternoon. i got into argument with the point property manager and got banned from being on point property for life as well as getting the cops called on drunk wrecked vw friend. of course being private property the cops said they would be over an hour until they arrived so stupid drunk vw guy got off without a ticket or jail since the property manager needed the car moved asap; it was blocking access to the resort -someone at my apt complex had the rental truck towed early saturday morning (3:20am) for being 'illegally parked' (it wasn't, it was in my spot) -tow company doesn't release vehicles on weekends so i am forced to wait until monday to get the truck, in the mean time i miss the first half of the lan party saturday morning along with not having the 2 folding tables which were in the back of the truck nor my digital camera or work laptop (also in the truck). -get a ride down to the tow place this morning to pay the $110 fee to get the truck back only to find out that someone has stolen my digital camera and work laptop from inside the truck while at the tow yard (tables were still in the back of the truck)  so, i haven't had my car for a week now, i've been driving a gas guzzling truck which is going to cost me $60 + gas + impound fee + replacement cost of camera + boss being pissed at me for getting the work shit stolen + having to deal with police reports and investigation bullshit. all that on top of me finding out that the person i thought i would live the rest of my life with has found someone else.  i'm going to need a shovel to be any lower.

      i talked to my seattle friend tonight. she's having some problems with funding the schooling she wants - or more directly where she wants. i offered my assistance but she won't have it. she doesn't want anyone to help her, but i so would take care of her. which brings me to the other topic of conversation we had - why i've been depressed in my blog and more importantly, why i haven't talked to her for what she says has been almost a month. i told her. well, i mostly told her what was up. but that was only after she pried it out of me and what i started to tell her was me really beating around the bush but the more i talked the more i wanted to say and the more...her cell phone battery died. so i didn't get it all out and i didn't get another chance to talk to her tonight. so now all these thoughts that many nights of partying and drinking had repressed are now at the surface again. and i can't sleep. and i'm not going to get a chance to talk to her for a couple days as i am going out of town. this all sucks. i want to let her know what i am thinking. i want to let her know how i'm feeling. i do not want anything i say to upset her though. so i hold back. so i choke it down. so i try to push these thoughts, these feelings out of my head. and i'm awake. i leave in less than 3 hours for northern california in a friend's 4 seat turbo prop plane with nothing but inclement weather forcasted in our flight path. i miss her. i miss talking to her every day. i miss seeing her every day. i miss the sound of her voice, the smell of her hair, her shaky hands. i'm in trouble. i need a solution. i thought i had one. i put it in time's hands. someone else has thwarted that, possibly for good. possibly forever. stressed. upset. i screwed up many moons ago and i pay for it every day. distressed. what do i do now? what have i been doing? i always felt so sure, so confident. worried. confused. logic is failing me. can't seem to make sense of anything. can't seem to reason myself out of this. want things to go my way. selfish. want to be with her, want to make everything right. do i need her? probably says the head, yes says the heart. sigh. i would devote myself to her completely which is the exact opposite of how she would have it, if she would have it, if she would even want it. but we work differently, while she wants balance, i want devotion. even just the knowledge of would suffice. now i wait.

      i was right - last night was another good night.  i got my suspension on, though its a bit too low. i will be raising it a little next week. didn't get to tracking down my boost leak because there were other cars to be worked on and my suspension took awhile. all in all it was a bunch of guys being rowdy and loud, drinking a few beers and working on cars. my disinterested friend ended up coming by and hanging out too even though i missed her call along with the call from my seattle friend and 2 other people (phone was in the car and with the stereo on in the garage along with 6 semi-drunk guys hollering at each other i somehow missed the phone ringing).  early tomorrow morning i leave for northern california for the 11th annual new dimensions vw charity car show, returning sunday night. i'm flying up there in a buddy's plane along with 2 other guys. i can't wait - i can almost guarentee that we're going to get into trouble. should be sweet.  in a couple hours i'm heading out to see the x2 movie that opened today with my buds. after that i have a ton of laundry to do along with some packing for the weekend. should provide me enough time during loads to return the phone calls i missed last night.

      interesting last couple of days. spent some time with girl that came down from oregon back in december on sunday. had a pretty good time took her over to some friend's place and had dinner with them. she expressed to me how much she hates her roommate and hinted at whether or not i would be interested in her moving in. not to turn away a friend in need i made mention that it wouldn't be a problem though i was thinking about how would it all work out, having a roommate that i was interested in that is. well, yesterday she got into a car accident and wrecked her car. she called me for help. took me by surprise as she was crying on the phone and i've always seen her a kind of a thick skinned girl - kind of tom boy-ish. well we got everything squared away that needed to be dealt with yesterday, tow truck, getting her back to work and then home, etc, and then she says to me that she doesn't really want to be at her place because if her roommate comes home and says something to her she felt she was going to flip out and pound him or kick him in the nuts or something. anyway, she didn't want to deal with it so i told her she could come back to my place and we could hang out for awhile. i also offered to give her a ride to work in the morning if she needed it. she did, and she also decided that it didn't make much sense for us to come back to my place and then to have me take her home only to come back over to pick her up in the morning for work. so she ended up staying the night. i offered her my bed and told her i would take the couch but she just wouldn't have it. well the both of us were pretty stubborn about it and we both stayed up until 3am waiting for the other to go to sleep or something. eventually i cracked and went to lay down telling her that when she got tired to let me know and i would move out to the living room (she was on her computer [which we brought over] which was in the living room). she didn't wake me. punk. anywho, i took her to work and then went into work myself. we've talked a few times today already and now i'm just waiting for her to get done with work to figure out what's happening tonight. i get the feeling from her that she is going to want to stay over again, but she says she wants a shower and such after work, but hasn't decided on where she will be taking it. so what am i to think? i've got like fifty scenarios running through my head and can't figure out which one will play out. this is the same girl that i saw for a little bit after i stopped seeing the disinterested girl, but she wasn't really all that interested then, or she was playing some kind of girl mind game. who knows. i don't. that's for sure.

      i talked to my seattle friend again last night, but about what i don't know. i don't know what happened, i just choked. nothing i wanted to say would come out and i ended up just sounding like an idiot. oh well. i'm retarded.  on a different note, i don't think i'm ever going to get a replacement camera! i've tried 3 times now to buy the camera i want and i can't seem to get the purchases to go through. its either been $70 over priced, card rejected because i had to have it reported stolen, or the store has it on back order. wtf?! if you see a good deal on the canon powershot s400 digi, drop me a line - i'm not having any luck.

      so i did some drinking last night - kind of a post mortem celebration. my two buds from across the way and a lady friend of theirs came over and we finished off the tequila and vodka that was left in the freezer and half of a new bottle of vodka. then we wandered over to the denny's and were rowdy. the drinking came about after we discovered that the thieves also stole all the beer in the fridge! what kind of lowlife steals beer from someone's house?!  tonight i have to get ready for my trip to los angeles early tomorrow morning, returning late thrusday night. after that i leave for grand junction from early friday afternoon til late saturday night.  i don't really want to leave my house but at the same time i don't feel safe there seeing that someone could just kick it in again.

      last night was a mixed night.  an old highschool friend emailed me and after a long phone call i ended up heading over to his house and hanging out for four and a half hours catching up. had a really good time, was very nice hanging out with him again. that was the good part of the evening.  this is the bad part of the evening.     i returned home to find my place broken into. they stole all my cds and dvds along with my 200 disc cd changer, vcr, and cable box. they also dumped the trash out all over the floor in my office and ransacked my bedroom. fucking sucks. a lot. just over $3k in value stolen, a felony here. the cop was able to get some prints but that doesn't help me out now. i haven't been to bed yet, my door doesn't lock or latch at the moment so i have to stay here until the maintance guys can replace the door jam. i guess its time to call the boss and let him know i won't be in the office until the afternoon. goddamnthisfuckingsucks!

      so i spent the day devoid of contact from anyone i know. granted the day started at 5pm when i woke up, but still. no one called me. no one emailed me. no one commented here. i suppose this only supports my feelings last night. i'm getting ready to spew forth all the of thoughts i've been having. why haven't i done so already? i didn't want to say anything that i wasn't sure about, that i hadn't thought through thoroughly.  holy shit! did you catch those last three words? i totally wrote that without knowing that was going to end up being so, umm, ironic?  anyway, i'm collecting these thoughts and its going to end up being a very large post though i may break it up into a few 'sections' to make it easier to read.

      road trip is done. it was a long one - 24 hours on the road, 36 hours awake currently. did some thinking while had the time to myself and realized a few things. i will be cutting out this and that from my life over the next few weeks. somethings will be difficult as they are almost daily topics/things/people but i think i've had enough of all of it. it sucks when you look down beneath what you think is reality and discover a bunch of coverups or misleading information. feel a bit used by it all, though i'm not sure how i was used. especially since its all varied and different when it comes to the subject matter of which i have become intolerable to. i am almost inclined to just 'clean the slate' and start fresh in every aspect of my life but that is proving very difficult for me decide on. i'm going to get some rest and see what tomorrow brings.

      i went out to dinner tonight (last night?) with Am. afterwards we stopped by our friends' house and ended up staying there visiting and drinking til past 3 am. was a pretty good time. i am dead beat though. i didn't sleep at all the night before last and as you can see i didn't make it to bed last night. Am offered to help cut my drive short this morning by staying over at my place (i had picked her up earlier this evening) until around lunch time when i would then come pick her up and take her back to her place. while normally i would have jumped at the chance at getting to spend more time with her, we were both exhausted and i figured it would be easiest and best for both of us if i just took her home now so she could get some sleep and i could get ready for work. i don't think i'm going to make it through the day. this isn't good as i am suppose to be going out with an old highschool friend and his girlfriend tonight to watch his brother's band play. so far my plan includes staying up for the next couple hours, going into work and then bailing fairly early with hopes of being able to nap until the 6 or so start time of my friday evening. sleep is my number one appointment for during the day saturday right now.

Am i'm starting with her because she currently is the one that i can most likely see myself with in the near future. i've written quite a few posts about Am in the past. she is who i was referring to as the disintersted girl. well if you remember, Am and i spent a ton of time together when we first met at the end of november in 2002 and this continued on into january 2003 when i made the mistake of being open with how i felt and was promptly shot down due to 'school & work'. result was that our time together diminished and still hasn't fully recovered. well now the school year is over and she is at the beginning of summer break and i have found us spending an ever increasing amount of time together as well an increase in the amount of conversations we have when apart. no hints at a possiblity of being in a relationship have been made, but i am ever hopeful. now she is a bit older than i, almost 6 years. a difference that doesn't bother me nor do i think that it would really bother her. she is going to school to be a crime scene investigator and with that has quite a bit of college education behind her. she's smart, level headed, i'm attracted to her and she's a redhead to boot. all things i look for. the only downside is she hasn't expressed a more than friends interest in me.  An to fully write about An would take about 6 pages in this blog. i'm not going to do that to you. so i'll try summerize and i appologize before hand if i leave anything important out An (she is one of my blog readers). i met An my senior year of highschool. we became best of friends. i confided in her everything about my life, including girls i was dating, issues i was having, etc. well after a long (2.5 years), ill fated relationship with the girl i was dating at the end of highschool, An made her move. that relationship lasted for about 1.5 years. and to be honest, my own stupidity and immaturity helped bring it to an end though the offical ruling is that she was leaving for seattle for school and the long distance thing was something better handled by best friends than lovers. our friendship has been up and down since then. probably because of me and my desire to be in a relationship with her again. i've taken the trip up there to visit her and had the best time. i've seen her when she's come home for this and that. we've talked on the phone and via instant messenger, though not as often as either of us would like. i'd have to say that i struggle the most with my interactions with An over any of the other girls i list here. sometimes i find it unbearably hard to be and act as just a friend when i have such strong feelings toward her. i have tried many times, unsuccessfully, to shut out those feelings for her even though i know she has been able to do so for me. i continue to leave that 'chapter' unfinished.  Al now i known two Als. one is an ex, the other is the wife of a friend of mine. this is about Al the ex. i lived with Al for about a year. Al was the girl that fill the void after An left me. i resisted getting involved with Al for a long time as i could never see anything good come of it. but eventually she won me over (guys are too damn horny) and we dated and i moved in, though against my better judgement. arguement after arguement ensued. a year after living with her i called it off and moved out. though that wasn't the end. for whatever reason, we continued to have contact with each other for quite a few months afterwards, up to the introduction of Am at which point i severed the lines 'hard' with Al. meaning i point blankly stated the situation. turns out she was already expecting this and had already started going out on dates. good for her. now our interaction consists of helping each other out with the recording of 'must see tv' when the other has forgotten to set their vcr before going out or somehow completely forgotten about the shows being on. in fact, i haven't really heard from her in a few weeks (the nbc season ended for the summer).  Al this is the wife of a friend of mine and really shouldn't be on this list but since she has an effect on me, i'm including her. Al was the estranged wife of a vw friend of mine. he lived here, she lived in pa. well they somehow patched things up between them and Al moved out here. Al and i get along great. i love her personality and she's very easy on the eyes. i also really like her husband. he's a good guy, teaches, and generally a well to do person. that makes my attraction to Al all the more troubling. i could never bring myself between them. and even if they were to seperate again i could never step in, its one of those lines friends just don't cross. but its ok to have the fantasy, right?  Ni that takes us to Ni. i met her through the vw group i hang out with. Ni is young. like 18 years old young. way too young for me. and no, not because of the number of years between us (that would make me a hypocrite in Am situation) but because she has the maturity level of an 18 year old, fresh out of highschool. Ni also has quite the past involving most of the vw guys i know, being that she grew up with all of them. that, for me, makes things very awkward with her and as such has kept anything from happening between us, even though she has brought about the opportunity many times. Ni is one of those drunken mistakes you don't want to make but can totally see yourself making. which is why i make sure i'm not alone with her when drunk.  Em and since were talking about vw people, let me talk about Em. Em is from oregon. she moved here around christmas time. Em is pretty outgoing and has the mouth of a sailor. she also has the body of a porn star. a very hot porn star. on top of that Em is apt to working on cars and enjoys all things automotive. these things combined i believe are my attraction to her. Em is also young. 19 years to be exact. and while she can be just as immature as Ni at times, she is for the most part not. what's the problem? i have the hardest time having a conversation with her. i just get bored. if she wasn't so a.d.d. and maybe read book now and then i'm sure we'd have lots more to talk about. but as it is, we don't and i get tired of hanging out with her quickly.  Sa Sa is an ex. she the ex i was dating at the end of highschool and the one who by becoming my ex prompted the move by An. Sa likes to interject herself into my life often. mostly with going out to lunch requests or miscelaneous get togethers after work. Sa lived very hard for a period of time, dating many and being very free with herself. i guess she felt is was necessary to catch up on all the 'life' she missed out on being in serious relationships through the end of highschool and throughout college. to look at her, you'd see it in her face that the past couple years have not been kind. she is still fun to be around, but not someone i would want to date again. even still, we joke around and she keeps me company when everyone else bails.  so there it is. its seems like i had more to say than that, but whatever. wait, are you still there? *poke*

      i had a good time last night! Am and i went out to dinner (rock bottom) and had a good time chatting. after which we met up with our vw friends and headed over to the drive-in (but not before picking up some beer to enjoy with our movie). the movie was good, wasn't too cheesy, and we had a good time hanging out there together and with our friends. after the first movie was over it was decided that we all head back to wife-Al's house and hang out there for the rest of the night and enjoy some more beer and conversation. that also was a good time. So now I'm just waking up and am already looking forward to tonight and hanging out with Am again. spirits are still pretty high.

      the weekend is here. going to a drive-in tonight with my vw buddies to see, now don't laugh, 2 fast 2 furious. we are all car people and its a car movie so we are going. tomorrow there is a party and i have a 'date' tentatively set with Am to attented though we are keeping our options open incase something better comes up (the host of the party is not quite a friend of ours). i also have a possible dinner date with Am tonight if she gets some stuff done before the drive-in movie. i'm in pretty good spirits right now, its nice. see you tomorrow.

      ok, i am officially pissed at Em. the damn girl needs her head examined. so she was down and out earlier this week and last night she tells me why via aim. stupid silly crap. i mean sure, if enough piles up on you it stinks, but really she's acting like its the end of the world. on top of that, the girl lives almost entirely online in forums where she gets to act all elite and snobby and shun people for things they say and otherwise act stupid. a lot of the time she takes it too far, gets too wrapped up in it. some people even call her an 'attention whore' online. please, grow up a little. so anyway, last night she was being stupid on a forum and kept im'ing me about it. i ask her what's the point and her response is its fun. so i go and look at what she is talking about and i'm unimpressed. and then i see a comment she made which i think is tacky and of low taste (i won't post it here) at which point i tell her she needs help and then i sign off aim. today i'm visiting this new car forum and i see a post was made to a thread i created about posting ugly pictures (cars, ppl, etc) by her. i check it out and she has added a picture of myself to the list! i respond with wtf! and she just laughs it off. maybe i wasn't in a good mood at the time or something but i got pissed and used a common 'tell-off' phase people use online (end yourself.). she goes off and in so many words calls me gay. unfucking believable - how childish can you get? so i promptly send her a private message through the board telling her she seriously needs some help and then sign off and block her aim and yahoo ids from my trillian. i don't know. maybe i'm overreacting, but i've been having such a hard time tollerating her to being with and this just pushed me over. ugh.

      i slept last night. thanks to the help of some sleeping pills. i hate taking something to sleep but i really needed to get some shut-eye. i dreamed about Am too. odd dream, it was. i was trying to save the relationship, apparently we where already dating. she was upset and i was trying to comfort her, appologizing for whatever i did, telling her that it was going to be ok, that i would take care of her. it was really weird, especially since Am hardly ever comes accross as a girly girl. i have know idea what it all means.  so i'm up, i'm showered and dressed. time to go into the office.

      ok, so i haven't slept yet. dunno why. i thought that i had nipped this bout of insomnia this weekend, but apparently not. things seem to be going well at the moment so i don't know what i could be stressing about. i hope this passes soon, i'd like to be on a regular schedule again.

      party was insane last night. so many drunk people, myself included. wow. and i didn't really have any problems with all the ladies being there. in fact i spent a lot of time interacting with Am. she wasn't having such a hot time there for a bit, but we got through that and continued on partying. now i'm just waiting for reports from others on how they are fairing this morning. haha

      last night went well. sometime during yesterday afternoon i invited Am over for dinner and a movie and she agreed. i made us chicken over rice which is cut up boneless skinless chicken breast in condensed cream of chicken poured over top of steamed rice. it came out well and she liked it. we watched old school, which she hadn't seen yet and she thought it was pretty funny. afterwards we drove over to where my new townhouse is and played with her new remote controlled red mini cooper that i picked up for her while i was at the store and my old remote controlled truck in the basketball courts. she really liked the mini. once the batteries started to die we decided to head on over to wife-Al and company's house as the rest of our friends were over there after getting back from mini-golfing (neither of us were interested in doing that). we hung out there until about 2 am or so and then headed back to my place where we watched the first couple episodes of clone high (she had yet to see any of them). after that it was almost 4 am so we went to sleep. we got up a little after noon and she wanted to watch a couple more clone high episodes before she had to get home to feed her birds. so now she's gone and i don't think i'll be seeing her tonight as her and wife-Al and their other girlfriends are doing a girl's night out which i think is cool. tonight is a gtg/cruise of vw's starting at 7:30 which will probably end up being a party at someone's house in the end (not mine!). Tomorrow, besides being father's day, is a bbq at some friends' house which should be a good time. i'm hoping that this weekend continues to be a good one. it always makes monday more bearable.

      i don't know why i haven't posted lately, must have just been slacking. so i didn't get a reply back from Am about my e-card but she did come and hang out with me that night. there is this other guy that has been vying for her attention this past semester who is also a vw guy. he annoys the crap out of her and he as been fighting with her recently, mostly about the fact that she has been spending so much time with me. she's at the last straw with this guy. she complained to me how much he acts like girl, says its like having a sister. personally, i've never been able to stand the guy. he's one of those types that just keeps talking and talking, and usually its about the same stuff. well, i guess they've settle this last arguement by her telling him that this is the  last  arguement. anymore and she's done talking to him. for me, if someone is annoying the crap out of me time and time again i just stop talking to them. but Am says that she feels sorry for him since he doesn't have a real friends in the vw group but her sympathy is just about spent. so now this guy, and i heard this from my friend who lives nearby, is saying that he is done with the whole thing. he doesn't like Am anymore and he doesn't want me to not like him so he's been trying really hard these past couple days to be non-annoying to both of us. we'll see how that works out.  i realized something the other day while talking to wife-Al about Am. the things i was describing to her about what i like about Am seemed very familar. the feelings i was talking about and the eagerness/nervousness i felt about the situation reminded of a past relationship. so i got worried. i started thinking that maybe the only reason i like this girl is because she may remind me of a girl i use to date. and that didn't work out, she doesn't want to date me anymore. so i thought about it for a long while and i've decided that while Am maybe similar to An (if you hadn't already guessed) they are two completely different people with very different outlooks on life. i may be getting ahead of myself here, but i could see myself very happy with Am and in the very near future.

      so i got a thank you e-card from Am tonight for this past weekend. it let me know that she appreciates me and enjoys the time we've spent together. only one thing i questioned about it. she calls me 'homie' in the e-card. i'm not too sure on how to take that. my first thought, and this is because i'm being pesimistic about this whole situation, is that she may have said that to re-affirm that we are just friends. i asked my friend what he thought and he believes that she was just joking around, being funny because her and i make good use of slang words like 'yo' and 'werd' and 'dawg' all the time. i like his thinking but i'm not totally convinced. so i replied. i told her it was my pleasure spending time with her and hint as to the fact that my feelings toward her haven't changed since we last talked (begining of the year). i also well-wished her on her day off tomorrow and blah blah blah. i'm crossing my fingers that there will be a response, and a happy one at that.

      well Am didn't make it out last night which was ok. wife-Al and i ended up talking about her and i was able to do a little confessing about my feelings toward Am. wife-Al thinks that Am and i would do very well together and can't figure out why we aren't already. i agree. oh well, patients i guess. we did go rollerblading though and i didn't fall down once. my lower back was quite sore though. i am told that its probably because i'm carrying myself to stiffly and i need to loosen up. i suppose that will come with time as i get less nervous about falling down.

      last night was fun! Am came over and we met up with a friend of ours for some food before heading out to that party. we tried vanilla vodka in sonic cherry limeaid and it ended up being pretty good. i of course had quite a bit and Am took over driving duties for the evening. just after midnight we left the party and headed over to our friend's house (wife-Al) and hung out there until 4-ish in the morning after which Am took me back to my place and we stayed up chatting until 8am. i had an absolute blast hanging out with her. it was almost like it was when we first started hanging out last year. around 8 we were both starting to nod off in mid sentance so we decided to sleep. around 1:30p or so Am left and i have been tooling around the house here in very good spirits. tonight there will be some rollerblading (not that i know how) over at wife-Al's house so there is a possiblity that Am will come out and join us, or at least hangout for a bit. this has been one of my better weekends, and pretty close to the best weekend i've had in a long time. i'm amazed at how much more enjoyable everything seems just because Am is there. i've honestly fallen quite hard for her, again. maybe this time things will work out?

      i'm going out to dinner with Am tonight. i don't know if i talked about this before and i'm too lazy to look, but her digital camera broke at a party awhile back and she was quite upset, mostly because she didn't have the money to replace it. i told her i would see what i could do to fix it. well i couldn't do a damn thing so i boxed it up and sent it off to olympus for repair. well, it arrived back today so i called Am up at work and told her that she should let me take her out to lunch. she wasn't able to make it out for lunch today so we decided on dinner. i hope she'll be pleasently pleased when she sees that her camera is back and working.

      the weekend was nice. went to a bbq sunday, had a good time even though Am couldn't make it (spent the day/evening with folks for father's day). nothing new to talk about right this second 'cept for recieving an instant message from Am last night telling me she's not going to be friends with that annoying guy that i was talking about the other day anymore.  still waiting to here what that's all about.   ok so i found out. i guess he was just being more bitchy and she's tired of it and over it. bummer for him. one less annoying person to deal with though its too bad he couldn't get control of himself. it sucks when no one wants to hang out with you and you piss off the last person that could stand you.

Am is on her way over now to watch some tv with me and help me pack. seems she grabbed some boxes from work for me. oh and she sent me a picture of the flowers i sent her. she still really likes them!  click  urlLink here  for picture.

      hmm, what have you missed? what to post? well, i have been taking this thyroid hormone suppliment to counter act my own lazy thyroid called cynoplus. dropped five pounds in the first week. sexy skinny man here i come. umm, spent most of the weekend with Am, she was house sitting for some friends and i kept her company during the night. the house was pretty weird and she felt a little creeped out while there alone. plus, both friday night and saturday night we didn't end up wrapping the evening up until almost 3am and i didn't want her to drive all the way out to this house tired so i went with. bbq'ed at wife-Al's house on sunday, i'm da grill masta! we also went and saw the hulk movie. it was pretty good. Am didn't make it out sunday night though. turns out bitchy whiny boy started another fight with her sometime in the afternoon sunday after i dropped her off at her house and it totally put her in a bad mood. she didn't feel much like going out. so when i got home sunday night at around 1am, i ordered her some flowers and had them sent to her work today. my seattle girl An was up so i asked for her assistance on signing the card. then we ended up talking until 4am on the phone about this and that, my attempt at trying to catchup. it was nice talking to her like that again. anyhow, so Am got the flowers today, this morning actually, and called and left a voicemail (i was asleep, left work at 7am after only being there for an hour) thanking me for the flowers. she sounded very happy to receive them. i haven't called her back yet since i have no idea what to say, or if i need to say anything or if there is anything to say. ugh i'm a confused boy at the moment. i'm just going to focus on the idea that she really like the flowers and see what happens.

      had a 4th of july bbq at my new place last night. was a good time, got pretty drunk playing asshole. things aren't looking good for Am and i. she is starting to seem more and more distant, not all that interested in whether i am around or not. maybe that is just my perception of it, don't know. got a flat tire the other night. took it into discount tire for a repair today, was told that they couldn't fix it because the little hole is to close to the sidewall. i'm pretty pissed about that since these are brand new tires, not more than 4000 miles on them. going to see if i can find a place that will patch it and if not, see if i can patch it myself with a plug kit. i don't want to have to buy a new tire, they are just over a 100 dollars a piece. not something i want to be spending money on when i have all these trips coming up. there is a double birthday party tonight, maybe that will cheer me up, though i'm not crossing my fingers since Am will be there and i'll most likely be paying attention to her and try to figure out if this is going anywhere. i'm not feeling very happy or confident right now.

      still have sinking feeling about the whole Am thing. maybe that will change over the three day weekend. i came home for lunch today and ended up falling asleep until almost 4 in the afternoon. so much for returning to work. now i'm starving (didn't actually eat lunch) and wide awake looking for something to do tonight. i so want to talk to Am and try and make plans with her but i have this feeling that maybe i should take a step back and see what happens. you know, leave her alone and see if she seeks me out herself, see if she really has any interest in seeing me or being around me. i don't know, i'm all mixed up inside on this one. part of me wants to keep trying to make something happen, another part thinks i should step back and see if something happens, and another part thinks i should just walk away and cut my losses now. i don't know what to do.

      went to dinner with Am tonight. ate at a place called nello's. pretty good stuff. we had a good time talking and then retreated to my place to watch the new episode of  america's next top model  on upn. that was a good time too. but i was bothered by something. its starting to feel like i'm not woo'ing her anymore, almost as if this is as far as it will go. i mean, she is still calling me and still wanting to go out and do stuff with me, but i'm not getting that vibe anymore that she might want something more between us. its very depressing. i'm trying to keep a happy face on, especially around her. i don't want to possibly screw anything up by acting stupid because i'm frustrated with how things are going. i totally want to tell her, again, how i feel and that i want us to be more than friends but i'm so very worried that doing so this time might damage our current relationship like it did the last time i told her how i felt. we recovered, nicely i might add, but i can't help but think that this time i may not be so lucky. i don't know what to do! i almost said something tonight, after she had left via aim, but stopped myself mid sentance. she must have noticed where i was going with what i was typing but she didn't say anything about. ugh. i need help, i want this to work so bad and its starting to fall apart in my head and it may be falling apart in real life.

      somehow i forgot to post the past few days. well i got my tire fixed. took it to big o tires and they fixed it without issue. the party was pretty good saturday night too. Am showed me some mild attention while there so that helped out my self-esteem. this weekend is a big trip to cali for a huge party on saturday and a car show on sunday. i reserved us a hotel room awhile back for saturday night at the host of the car show's hotel. its a 4 person room for Am and i along with wife-Al and her hubby, which are also riding out with us. i talked to Am last night on the phone which i only inteaded to be a minute and we ended up being on the phone for a few hours. she told me that she is getting pretty excited about the upcoming weekend which made me feel pretty good. until i started wondering if she was excited because it was going to be a fun weekend with me and our friends or because it was going to be fun weekend with friends. ugh, i hate not knowing. i guess i'll just have to see how the weekend goes. i'm looking forward to it.

      Am called today. totally surprised me. i did not expect her to call. she was calling because she was just getting out of work and knew i was having ppl over today to roll fenders and offered to stop by and hangout. well somehow i missed that call, i got all that from her voicemail. without a thought as to what i was doing i instantly called her back. we talk for 2 seconds and she has to call me back due to traffic. she calls back and we chat for a bit. not once did i mention anything about what i've been writing about here nor did i express to her that i was upset. i just acted like everything was normal and we had a regular conversation. i suck. now i can't bring anything up because it will look like i'm psycho for acting normal one minute and upset the next. we wrapped up the call and i told her i was just hanging around the house during the day and that she could call me later. i don't think she will, but i'm not going to call her. i need to go take a shower now, i'm all dirty from working on cars all morning.

      so i've been doing a lot of thinking this week, when i've had the time, about Am. last night i think i had a revelation while i was trying to go to sleep as to why i'm so hung up over her. you see, the last girl, ex-Al, was only ever a bandaid. i never let myself get thoroughly involved because i had just ended things with An and was still pretty messed up by it. ex-Al was just a temporary crutch to help me move on. now with Am, she is the first girl that i was really open to being with since i had finally moved on from An. and since its not working out i think i'm getting extra hurt because i dove in too quickly, invested myself too much. but that's ok. i'm not afraid of hurting. i feel that it only makes you stronger. i'll still do the same with the next girl as i have no fear of opening myself up and getting thrown in my face. i haven't heard from Am all week and i'm not too sure that she'll contact me this weekend either. which maybe is a good thing because if i truly am going to stop pursuing her than i'll need as little contact with her as possible. i have no will power around her and if she showed me even the slightest bit of attention right now i'm sure all these thoughts of defeat and moving on would go right out the window. what can i say, i'm a sucker. if i'm lucky, i'll find someone new who fancies me as much as i fancy them soon and i can shower them with my affection. pfft, like that'll happen.

      where do i start? we left as planned saturday morning for cali. took our time getting there. we stopped for pictures at the dinosaurs just east of the huge windmill farms, spent an annoyingly long time in l.a. traffic and arrived at our destination of buttonwillon, ca around 6pm. the trip was pretty good, we all had a good time. i was the target for everyone's teasing though which isn't that bad, but 6 hours of it can make it hard to keep smiling. we got checked in to the hotel and made a run for the liquor store. once we returned the consumption began. we went all out. corona and shots of tequila were the staples. socializing with other dubbers, watching burnout contests and general drunken mischief were the activities. at one point in the night we thought that wife-Al was locked in our hotel room with another guy and in my drunken stooper i tried to open then window which ended up cracking after which we found that she was not in there when i got a spare key from the front office. Am apparently told wife-Al what we were thinking she was doing and wife-Al got very pissed at me which i assume is because Am left out the part where she was agreeing with me. wife-Al disappears. more drinking and trying to hang out with Am. she would run off with this group or that group and i would meet up with her a little later. multiple trips to the local denny's were made as many dubbers were walking to and from it and the hotel for food consumption so the party moved back and forth. during a return from denny's, i asked Am if she is ever bothered by all the attention i give her. she answers sometimes. my buzz disappears. i asked when does it bother her and she doesn't really answer. she changes the subject to missing wife-Al. at this point we've arrived back at the hotel and wife-Al's hubby is asking us where she is. he is very drunk. i find out that another local az dubber has broken the rest of the window in our room. we go check it out. now that the whole bottom half of the window is missing i know i cannot hide it from the hotel management. i decide to worry about it later. wife-Al hubby brings up his missing wife again. i offer to go around to all the hotels and look for her if he wants. Am declines to go and wanders off. wife-Al hubby and i drive around from hotel to hotel (all within less than a mile) looking for her. we hit every place twice, no luck. we swing by the denny's as Am is standing outside with the tucson people. we update her. they all are about to head in for the night so i give them rides to their hotel and take the three of us back to ours. we stand around for a bit wondering what to do. Am changes for bed which i see as that she is staying in. wife-Al hubby says he's going to sit outside until wife-Al comes home. Am goes outside for a minute then comes back in for her pillow to sit on outside for a bit. i get ready for bed and lay down for a minute. i doze off for what only seemed like a second so i get up and poke my head outside. both of them are gone. only the pillow and my hat that wife-Al's hubby was wearing are outside. i get a little pissed that, not so much wife-Al hubby is gone, but that Am left too. i bring the stuff inside and lay back down with the door closed knowing that i have the only key to the room. i fall asleep. awhile later, not really knowing the time, someone knocks on the door. i ignore it. a little later, the knocks come again, but louder. i get up and open the door. its all three of them, wife-Al is back. i go lay back down. i hear wife-Al getting ready for bed and Am in the bathroom. i await for Am to lay down so i can reposition myself more comfortably once i know how much room she takes. time passes. i finally look over and she and laid down next to wife-Al with hubby on the opposite side. i get really pissed. and even though i'm still feeling the effects of the nights drinking, i lay there fuming over getting blown off or dissed or whatever you call it. i add this to the 'sometimes' answer and the fact that she never once seemed interested in hanging out with me that night together as her not interested in me at all. you may be thinking that not wanting to sleep in the same bed as someone you're not dating is an ok thing, which it normally is, but we've slept near each other many times, sometimes in the same bed, sometimes on the couch, etc. having her choose to squish on the other bed making it 3 people full over sleeping in our original bed with room to spare hit me as a personal blow, a message. she doesn't like me. i decide before finally falling asleep that i'm moving on, i'm over it. in the morning i wake up to the noise of Am and wife-Al being awake. i rise quickly and jump in the shower. afterwards i make myself busy with this or that, avoiding eye contact with either of them, thinking wife-Al is still pissed at me and not knowing how to handle myself around Am after deciding that i'm not going to pursue her anymore. i think about what to say to the hotel management and go to the front office. i tell them that we went to denny's at one point of the night only to return to our window being broken. state that i don't know who did it. they apologize for us having to sleep through the night with a broken window. i'm leave relieved that i'm not going to get stuck with the bill. i return to the hotel and we all pack up. i'm not really excited anymore about going to the carshow (which is why we are here) today. some az dubbers swing by looking for me and wanting to get some breakfast. we all agree and go to denny's, again. i find out that Am and wife-Al hubby are feeling sick, very hungover. they aren't interested in the carshow either. we decide to head back to az. at this point i've already buckled and started talking to Am again. especially after finding out that she's not feeling good. i'm a fucking sucker. i go out of my way to make her comfortable, in the car and at stops. at about 2pm she's feeling better and joking around with me providing my driving company as the couple in the back sleeps. we make many stops and take our time getting back into town. by the time we arrive back at my place, its already almost 9pm. i help switch over all their gear to their car and say goodbye. i give Am a hug though she looks like she tries to avoid it. they leave. i renew my decision about Am and go inside to take a shower and go to bed. i haven't talked to her yet and don't plan on it even though she is constantly in my thoughts. its driving me crazy. i want to sit her down and talk to her and tell her all these things and how i felt in reaction to everything but i don't want to make contact. i know that if i tell her all these things i'll be setting myself up for getting hurt because as i'm saying them i will be thinking that maybe she'll see what i'm saying and apologize and then thoughts of dating will come up and lead somewhere and... but i know that won't happen. i know how it will end. i know that i will get hurt. i'm not going to put myself through that. i've done that before. i pined endlessly for a girl that never changed her mind about us. many times i thought there was a light at the end of the tunnel only to find out it was flicker of imaginary hope. i didn't have a chance with her and i need to get it through my thick head that i don't have a chance with Am. my heart just sank when i wrote that.

      there was a party last night. i only stayed for about an hour.  urlLink Ni  and i headed back to my place to watch some movies. i should have known that was a mistake. we endulged in vanilla stoli and coke. i should have known that was also a mistake. one thing lead to another and lets say things got a little frisky. i'm not totally sure how i feel about it. i mean, i still have Am on my mind but i haven't heard from her in over a week even though i sent her an email relating how we haven't hung out in awhile and that we should. she never replied. she's been online multiple times this week yet not once has she im'd me. my hope is all but lost which is why i think i let myself 'interact' with Ni. ugh. there is another party tonight which i know all parties discussed herein will be at and i do have plans to go but i do not know what is going to happen. also, tomorrow is a bbq in tucson that i am planning on attending which i believe Am will be at and Ni may go also. i think i have gotten myself in a bad situation. i'm almost feeling like moving again. maybe to seattle where i can sweep An off her feet once and for all.

      so i'm laying on the couch not sleeping, eating salsa flavored chips, drink a can of mountain dew, flipping through the channels and i come across vh1. they're doing one of their so and so of such and such lists. this one happens to be the 200 greatest pop culture icons. i catch it right at number 142 - gwen stefani. she is a goddess. i'm watching the pics of her and clips from concerts and i think to myself man what i wouldn't do to be with her. then i realize that i just want someone to love that loves me back.

      so Am did call me again later yesterday. but it was because her window broke in her car and she was asking i knew how late the service department was open at the car dealership on saturdays. i offered to try and fix it temporarily for the weekend until she could get it to the dealership, but she ended up not calling me back. i find out later via an instant message that she fixed it temporarily herself. a friend of mine that lives near me threw a party last night. Am declined going due to feeling tired. the party ended up being quite rowdy. a trip down near campus also took place with more rowdiness there. i didn't end up waking up until about an hour ago. i feel like i've wasted almost the whole day.

      i got a speeding ticket tonight, err, last night. i couldn't sleep so a friend of mine that works the night shift invited me to come hang out with her. well during the car ride over i must have been a little too free with the gas because halfway there i saw the red and blue lights flashing behind me. shit. the motorcycle cop walks up and asks for my license, registration, and proof of insurance. i give these to him, he glances at them and then asks me to step out of the car. i'm thinking that maybe he suspects me of drinking seeing as my hair is a bit messed up and i have a bottle of water in my cup holder. i walk around to the back of the car as he requests. he asks if i have any guns, knives, or needles on me, i answer no. he tells me to turn around and place my hands on the trunk. he handcuffs me! i begin to start freaking out. he tells me that an off duty dps officer saw me speeding at what was estimated as 120 mph and that i was weaving in and out of traffic. he calls it in and two motorcycle cops, this one and another that is just now pulling up, are given my cars description and set out looking for me. apparently the just now arriving cop clocked me at 98 going the other way and the cop that pulled me over clocked me at 106. he then tells me that anything 20 mph over the speed limit is a criminal offense and that my car would be impounded and i would be going to jail. the first cop walks away to call in my information while the second cop starts talking to me about how if it was him that pulled me over i would definately be going to jail and my car towed but he doesn't know what the other cop will do. he also asks me why i was going so fast to which i have no reason and at which point i tell him that i don't have any tickets on my license and i never have really sped. at this point another cop shows up in a cruiser at which the second cop comments that this may be my taxi for the night. he walks me over to the cop car and puts me in the back seat. at this point i'm starting to think that i am going to jail. i over hear on the radio that my license came back clear with no wants, no warrants and no tickets. i sit in the back of this car for what seems like ages. the handcuffs are digging into my wrists as my hands are squished between my back and the seat. everytime a truck drives by i think that its a tow truck coming to take my car but then the first cop comes back to me and takes me out of the car. he tells me that there are some reasons why he's going to let me go. one is that my license is clean. the second is that i seem like a good kid that just made a mistake and that everyone makes a mistake every now and then and that i don't deserve to spend a night in jail. he walks me back to my car and removes the handcuffs. he then gives me a speeding ticket, and not just a speeding ticket but a criminal traffic speeding ticket which means i can't go to traffic school for it and that i have to go to court. he wrote it for 100 mph which he explained is better for me since if he put down the 106 the judge would be pretty pissed. i guess that 6 mph makes a difference. i spent the rest of the night trying to find out what the maximum fine is for my class 3 misdemeanor but cannot locate any information. i've started thinking about consulting a lawyer. i've never had to go to court to defend myself before and i am really going to need some advice.  its almost time for work so i should get going.

      not a word. not a single word. no email. no phone call. no im, even though trillian says she was signed on 6:30p. now the shipping status of the flowers on the website still shows pending, even though they were suppose to be delivered today. i sent them an email to verify that they shipped. if they did, then its safe to say that Am did not like them and i finally have my final answer.

      i'm weak. i decided to give it one last try with Am. to see what is up, i ordered her flowers yesterday to be delivered tomorrow. tomorrow is of course the end of the month and is always a really crazy day for her at work. i figured the flowers would help cheer her up on a stressful day and allow me to contact her in a way that hopefully doesn't seem too whiny or bitchy. here is what i wrote in the card:  "it seems so long since i last saw you. i don't know if maybe you've grown tired of me but i just wanted to let you know that i still think about you lots. i hope these brighten up your day.  -d"  the flowers are a large basket of white daisies. i figured that would be a 'safe' enough flower yet still have some meaning.  god i sound like a fucking pussy. i hate this. this needs to start going somewhere or be finalized. none of this guessing bullshit anymore. hopefully this gift willl either start something or bring whatever was left to an end.

      didn't do much of anything today. miss the bbq because i fell asleep again around 8am and didn't wake up until noon. after that i help a couple dubbers out that need their cars computers check for error codes. and after that i retired to the couch with a massive headache where i've been for the remainder of the day. no contact from any of my friends. no one interested in what i've been doing or where i've been.

      i fell asleep around 4:30p. the party was set for 8. i just woke up about 30 minutes ago. not a single one of my friends even bothered to call to see where i was even though i said i was going to go. no emails, no im's, no missed phone calls.  i've been having this feeling like i've been being left out of somethings lately  I'm starting to think that my friends are tired of me.

      last night, my old highschool buddy came over and hung out for a bit. we had a good time. back in highschool, one day after school, we stopped by a dunkin donuts and bought an 18 pack since they were on sale for 5 bucks. the goal was to see if we could both eat 9 donuts in one sitting. we did, felt sick and have laughed about it since. well since we were both hungry last night we decided on pizza and another gorge fest.  urlLink here  is the before pic of our meal. and  urlLink here  is the after pic. as you can see we did make a good dent, but did not finish. oh well, there is always next time.

      i was out in coolidge last night helping wife-Al's hubby get his '84 diesel jetta running. we didn't get it to start but it turned over pretty good. it had been a few weeks since i last saw him, nothing seemed to be the matter though.  i had to buy a new alarm clock last night too. found out that my alarm clock was broken! apparently the switch to turn the alarm on and off was worn out and there for wasn't enabling the speaker. i bought one that has a cd player in it and what not but i think i'm going to return it. i cannot play a cd using the sleep function and have the alarm set for buzz. that and i slept through both alarms it has this morning.

      bah. i'm moving on, getting past all that drama from yesterday. i sent my apology and my explaination, if she doesn't except it then she can go fuck off. i've talked to a lot of my friends since then and it would seem that most of them have just been uber busy and apologized to me for not having hung out lately.  things are on the up and to keep the momentum going took myself shopping after work today and bought myself new clothes. some stuff that goes along with what i usually wear, but also some that are a complete departure from how i normally dress. let me just say this, banana republic.

      ok, so Am emailed me what was up. i'm going to post that email and my reply unedited (except for names) since i don't think i could rehash them and make sense at the same time. i'm a little nervous about posting these since they're more personal then anything i've ever posted here.  here's her email to me:  D   First off, Im not outwardly trying to be mean here, but basically, I am not dealing with you right now.  I am tired of you asking our mutual friends what is up with me or why I havent responded to your IMs when you know Im online because you have seen me post on the Tex. Im tired of you getting upset when I tell you that I am having an evening with the girls. Dont get mad at me when I hang out with other friends or do my own thing. Its just immature. Im tired of you pouting when you dont get your way (like stomping your feet and slamming the bathroom door when I slept in bed with wife-Al at DubWars or in the restaurant in Quartsite). Im very tired of the rumors that I have been hearing about you telling people that we arent dating only because Im too busy with work and school.or that you hoped I would be too drunk to care if you put the moves on me at DubWars. You need to back off. Quit acting like a jealous boyfriend. We are not a couple, so please stop acting like we are.  I do appreciate all of the things that you have done for me, but sometimes I feel like you are only doing them in hopes that I will like you or that I will come over.  Its just getting old and you are going to lose me as a friend if this doesnt stop.  Am  this shocked the hell out of me. i had know idea this was what she was thinking. i responded with this (An you may notice a line from you in there):  I'm sorry I have upset you. Only just tonight have I spoken to anyone about not hearing from you. And that was only because I couldn't talk to you about since you were not in the mood. I have never gotten upset when you've done girl's night out. I'm sorry if its ever come across as that. I always thought that girl's night out was a good thing. And I've never gotten mad when you've hung out with your friends or done your own thing. Maybe back in January I was jealous of others getting your time, but we talked about it then and I haven't brought it up since nor expressed to you that it was an issue. Now the Dubwars stuff, yes I was upset. I was also still inebriated and not thinking clearly. At the time, I couldn't understand why you would choose to cram into a bed for 2 making it 3 instead of sharing the other bed with me. I never had the intention of making a move on you at Dubwars nor did I ever say anything to anyone that I hoped you'd be too drunk to care if I did or even have that thought at all. I respect you and would never pull that kind of shit. I'm seriously upset that anyone would say that to you as something I said. I'm not that kind of person. And as for telling people that we're not dating only because you're too busy with work and school, I've only said that to our close friends and only when they've asked me what is going on between us and if we are dating. To which I've always responded no. At which most of them asked why and I would respond that I asked you about dating and your reply at the time was that you have too much going on in your life with work and school. That is all we've ever talked about and that is all you've ever said to me. If it was something different, I didn't know about it and I'm sorry if I misrepresented the situation. But I've never gone around telling people about that, and I've never told anyone anything other than no we're not dating if they weren't a close friend of yours. In the beginning I wanted to date you and yes I did seem to act like your boyfriend, but after we talked about it I put an end to that. Not once have I tried to imply to anyone that I was your boyfriend, nor act like it. If it has seemed otherwise to you I apologize, it was not my intention. I won't lie and say that I stopped wanting to date you but I can say, honestly, that I put aside all those actions and what not after I found out from you that you were not interested at the time. I cannot excuse my actions at Dubwars completely. And if memory serves me right I did not act any differently than a friend up until I asked you if you were bothered at all by all the attention I give you. In hind sight, this was not something I should have asked then moreover something I should have asked while drinking. Your answer to my question was unexpected and I responded poorly. For that I am very sorry. I do not want to make you uncomfortable nor did I ever want you to be upset with me. You know I like you and maybe its contrary to others you have know, but I do not play those immature games, I wouldn't try to guilt you into a relationship nor would I facilitate the lie to others that we are already dating. I know those things don't work and this, what I hope is just a misunderstanding, is an example of what happens when boys play those games. The things I've done for you are not to win your favor. They were done because I care about you and wanted to make you happy. Helping you out when you are in tough situations makes me happy. Even as a friend, you mean a lot to me and this whole ordeal has left me very sad and regretful of things I did not see happening, or notice, and was not able to make an effort to correct them before they had offended you. I hope you will read this and believe what I have written and forgive me my mistakes, both known and unknown. I do not want to add anymore stress to your life and only wish to help make things easier as I'm sure you would for me or any other friend if you could. Please accept my apology. I would love nothing more right now for us to still be friends. If you would like to talk about this or if I have not explained something right I am more than willing to chat with you. I do not yell nor do I play the blame game, I am more than capable of talking to you about this in a mature, adult manner if you'd like to. I want us to be ok, I don't want something like this to happen again. I miss my friend. D.  so there they are. did i explain well enough? does any of it make sense? do you think she'll talk to me again or should i pack up camp and move on?  and one additional thought, do you think, or could you even imagine, that there could be a chance for an 'us'? i think i already have that answer.

      oh my fucking god!  after not seeing Am online all weekend i decided to see if she had blocked my screenname. i created a new screenname for aim and loaded up aim and added her screenname to it. both it and my trillian showed her offline so i set aim to sound off if she signed on. not more than 2 mins later aim went off. sure enough she was online and showing on my new screenname but not on my normal one. she had me blocked. so i picked up my house phone and called her cell knowing that she would be available to answer and remembering that she didn't have my house phone listed in her cell. she answered.  me: Am? Am: hello me: what's going on? Am: right now is not a good time. i've got something i'm having to dealing with. can i talk to you later me: sure. when should i call you back? or when do you want to call me back? Am: its just not a good time right now. someone hit my mom's truck while i was helping Bi and Bo move and now i have to pay for it. me: i'm sorry to hear that. we can talk later. just give me a call back, ok? Am: ok.  wtf?! so i im Bo and ask him what the hell is going on with Am. he doesn't know anything. and he's either distracted by school work like he says or he's conferring with someone else on his responses because it takes him a long time to reply. either way we have this long chat about what i've been seeing and how it seems like everyone is ignoring me. he says he's not, just busy with school and that if Am is why don't i just walk away from it. i tell him that i gave up already on her. i just want to know why she's pissed at me and possibly resolve it. i tell him that if Am is mad at me then wife-Al is most likely also. and since when wife-Al doesn't want someone to come by or hang around they usually don't get invited out then that would mean i would be outstead from future gatherings. he tells me that him and others wouldn't do that, they don't care, but that the wife-Al and household might and that would suck. now i don't know what's going on. i put in a call to my friend Mi that lives with wife-Al and crew and left a message for him to call me back. i haven't heard from him in awhile either but i figure if anyone who lives there would talk to me, it would be him. now i get to just sit around and wait for both Am (probably won't) and Mi to call me back.  god this sucks even worse than i thought!

      Em came over tonight. she cooked up some corndogs i had in the freezer that we had with some caprisun's. we watched a little tv, played a shoot 'em up game on the computer and she went home. she said that we should hang out again later this week. which is ok by me. it was nice to have someone to hang out with tonight, even though it kept me up later than i wanted to be. time for bed now.

      so i got ditched this weekend on the san diego trip. well, i'm calling it ditched because they switched the departure time to earlier in the day, around 1p friday from 3-4ish. well i couldn't make that. they switched to beat the traffic leaving town. so i got spend the weekend pretty much alone. hence the reason for catching the movie with Sa friday night. another lady friend was suppose to stop by around 5p saturday but slept through it and didn't wake up until she had to be at work at 9p. she did come over afterwards, around 7a for breakfast but i wasn't really in the mood to hang out with her. she ended up falling asleep. so i watched tv, some movies, and played on the computer until she woke up and left for work again. i didn't want to be rude and just kick her out. sometimes i get annoyed with her and can't stand to hang around her but when there is no one else around to spend time with, she became the default. ugh. what a wasted day, or even what a wasted weekend. still haven't heard from Am either. even sent her an email friday asking her straight up what's going on after many failed instant message attempts while at work. didn't see her online all weekend either which means she was either out all weekend or she now has me blocked on her instant messenger. if i don't get a reply this week or if i see her online and not talking to me i'm going to call her and get this resolved. i'm still giving her the benefit of the doubt that something has come up and she's way busy. its not like she's required to talk to me all the time so i can't expect her to and moreover i can't for the life of me think of any reason she could have not to want to talk to me anymore. and believe me, i've been thinking about it lots. its times like these that get me thinking about moving out of this state finally. it would seem that it takes some kind of emotional push to get me to move. ugh.

      well yesterday wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. even though most of the people i care about forgot my birthday, i still made the most of it. i got birthday wishes from two of my ex's, Sa and ex-Al, and an old friend from grade school. i took myself to a movie since you get a free movie at harkins theaters on your birthday. first time i've ever been to a movie by myself. saw bad boys 2. i like it. afterwards, a couple of my vw friends took me out to dinner after they found out it was my birthday. and that was about it. not too bad. no party or anything like i've thrown for my friends' birthdays all this year, but oh well.

      so today is my birthday. the big two five. yea, whatever. i have this feeling that none of my friends will remember. parents remembered of course, old online friend from a game i use to play remembered, and my insurance agent remembered. now i know its only an hour or so into my birthday but i have this feeling that no one will remember since no one has mentioned it and i never get the whole surprise thing. this birthday may suck.

      here's something that bothered me tonight but shouldn't have. i was out with some friends and we ran into Gl, wife-Al, and Am. Am didn't even look at me and wife-Al only half smiled. wtf is with that?! come on people, we're suppose to be adults!  on another note, i'm to be recieving all the documents for the purchase of the notchback tomorrow by noon. the signed title, bill of sale and receipt/work order from the tune-up i asked him to have done. woohoo! i'm the proud owner of a european 1964 volkwagen notchback! now i just have to wait for it to get here via the shipping company, which i was told will be picking up the notch in oregon on the 26th. i'm excited!

      i paid for the notchback today. i'm having it shipped down to me instead of driving up to get it. its going to cost me another $500 but i figured gas costs around $380-$400. so for an extra hundred i don't have to worry about having any problems driving the car cross-country. down side is that i have to wait up to two more weeks before i get to see it instead of getting to see it on saturday. i'm excited that its on its way now but sad that i have to wait so long!

      i had an alright time last night. went to a vw gtg and then to applebee's for happy hour with some friends. i haven't been drunk in what seems like awhile, it was fun. the only downers of the night were that Ni didn't really talk to me, which has been that way since that  urlLink one friday night . i also heard from my friend Mi who lives with his fiance Ju and wife-Al and hubby Gl on why Am wasn't going to show up to the vw gtg. 'there wasn't anyone there she cares to see'. thats real mature and only solidified my thoughts on why i don't need to waste anymore time on her. i didn't let it ruin my night.  don't know if anything is going on tonight. there is a comedy show tonight but i haven't heard the details yet. i can always just stay home and relax.

      oh my god! who would have thought that only eating fatty burgers with cheese, bacon and eggs, fried and hard-boiled, would be so depressing! this morning i was so craving lemonaid, but no, can't have it, too much sugar. for lunch i had the triple stack from wendy's sans bun and toppings (excluding cheese). i was so unsatisfied with that meal i was in shock. who would have thought that its the carbs that fill you up, not the fatty juicy burger patties. eh, only 2 more weeks to go.

      so here i am awake and restless at 3 in the morning. i'm lying in my bed listening to the 'rain' cd in my alarm clock trying to fall asleep. my hands are resting on my stomach as i lie on my back. i give my stomach a squeeze with my right hand and i come up with more than a hand full of fat. ugh. i get up and wander into my office and hop online. i browse to google and type in 'restlessness' and 'not sleeping' since i've searched for insomnia before and know all about that. one of the links is for sleeping pills that are touted as harmless and non-habit forming. i click the link. on the same page are ads for diet supplements. i click one of those. i am now looking at a page of supplements for the atkins diet. i jump back to google and search 'atkins diet'. very first link is to  urlLink atkins.com . i go there and start reading.  i am now officially on the atkins diet and while i have a journal to fill out daily on the atkins site, i will also be talking about it here. my goal is to get back to my year after high school weight of 185. that's 40 pounds that have to go. i want it to go. self-confidence, here i come!

      i had an boring as hell seminar today for work. so for the second half of it, after lunch, i started browsing the internet while listening since one, i was there purely for basic information on the product, I wasn't going to be supporting it directly, and two i tend to be one of the few people that can actually listen, learn, and still have a clue about what's going while doing something else non-related. about a half hour to forty-five minutes into it, the guy behind me who happens to be the manager for the group that has bought this product for the enterprise comes up to me and asks that i either pay attention and stop browsing the web or go somewhere else. i think what a jackass! i don't say anything and do comply by closing my browser windows, but only because i know he is a high up on his side of the corporate world and i'm not one to make waves for such a small thing, at least not right away. but honestly i thought, wtf harm am i causing? i'm not bothering anyone around me with sound or lots of movement. i'm not pointing things out to people around me on what i am surfing. and as far as anyone else can tell i am paying attention, this jerkoff only knew because he had the priviledge of sitting behind me. the problem was even greater in that if i don't have something to do i will fidget, and more often than not, i get headaches from the droning on and on of a speaker. my boss knows that i divide my time to other things while i'm on conference calls with him and others. he doesn't see it as a problem as long as i'm up to speed with what is being talked about and can answer questions asked when called upon without delay. all things i am capable of. i'm contiplating whether or not i will tell my boss about this, not that i would get in trouble if this fucktard informs him through business channels, just that i would choose not deal with him in the future. for right now, i think i'm going to just let it slide, but damnit! just back off!

      woohoo!!! i got out of the criminal ticket! no fine and i only have to pay for traffic school. man i was nervous! first thing the judge asked me was what kind of tires i had. i told him sumitomo htr z2 and he goes 'those are rated for 150-160mph'. he asks me if i'm able to go to traffic school and i tell him i've never had an incident before. he then asked me how do i plea and i say i'm not sure due to the circumstances. he says it doesn't really matter at that speed (100). i tell him that i really don't think i was going anywhere near that speed. he says that i should take my car to the racetrack not the freeway. tells me that i'm about 10 mph over his limit but he's going to go ahead and let me go to traffic school. i thank him and he says that not for one minute does he believe that i wasn't going that fast, especially with a car like mine. whew! points = 0 (would be 6), fine = 0 (would be $600), record = clean. $120 for traffic school on the 21st and it'll be like it never happend.  and now i have to go to the mvd to get my notch titled and registered.

      woohoo! the adjuster just came out to look at the damage to the notch. and i only just gave my statement to hertz this morning! he's going to write it up as labor to repair the panel instead of cost to replace since he would think that i would want to keep the original panel. that just means more money for me if i can find a straight replacement panel and get it painted. he also said that he could have an estimate ready as early as today! i'm feeling better about it already.  i need to start packing for my trip, i have to be up awfully early tomorrow morning.

Em in flying back from oregon today. she called me this morning needing a ride from the airport. that's at 12:40 so i said it wouldn't be a problem. oh crap! i just now remembered that i haven't found a ride for myself from the airport on monday! d'oh! i'll figure something out. i get in around 11:40a so i can probably have someone from work come get me. now i need to go tell wife-Al that i was wrong about my departure time in baltimore. its 7a, not 3p. she's going to kill me.

      ok, so i've moved servers. i'm pretty sure i only had one reader and if they want to get here i've left an email address at my old server so they can ask for the new url.  reasons for moving? well, i've had this host for a couple months now and it allows me to do whatever i want with my blog so taking it off blogspot seemed like a smart thing to do. why did i do it now? if you were keeping up with some recent posts you'd have seen some drama brewing with someone i saw as an old friend. i grew quickly tired of the drama (what was that, mere seconds?) and decided that a quick and complete move of my blog would immediately remove it from said drama. and as of right now, i have no plans on explaining, talking, or conversing about said drama, so lets move on!  getting ready for my york, pa trip on thursday for my buddies wedding. i'll be there thursday through monday. parties i know personally are Mi and fiance Ju, wife-Al and hubby Gl, and buddy To. four out of those five (not To) are from pa, as well as their families. i'm really looking forward to the trip.

      this damn biatch ran right into my rear driverside fender last night in the parking lot of bobby mcgee's. i watched the horror happen right before my eyes from inside my car. i saw headlights approaching, looked over my should and saw a chevy malibu moving towards me. i motion with my head to stop. they don't, or they don't see me. contact. i start yelling as they bump into my bumper corner. they don't stop. i start screaming for them to stop and they continue to 'resculpt' my rear fender.      urlLink here  and  urlLink here    cops were already on sight due to the bar closing and could only make sure information was exchanged since it was on private property. i have all her info and her progressive insurance policy number along with pictures of her texas drivers license and pictures of the hertz rental car malibu and plate.  i don't know what i'm going to do yet. either have a replacement fender found and painted or pop this dent and paint it.  i've never been so upset over damage to one of my cars as i am over this. at least my baby faught back a  urlLink little .

      phew...finally got the gym together. its a sizable task when you don't have any instructions. so here it is:       the bench actually goes in the middle of the gym but leaving it there when i'm not using it puts it in the way to my closet. the olympic sized bar is on the floor next to it as it is also in the way when not in use. damn bar weighs 45 pounds itself. the gym has 250 pounds of free weight with it, and i've loaded 95 pounds of it on the pull down/curl bar part of the gym for starters. the plan is to start an early morning routine monday assisted by the high protien atkins diet i am already on. which, by the way, i upset by gaining 10 pounds during my pa trip, though i have already dropped 4 of those since tuesday. with these goals in mind, this weekend is my last semi-carb heavy weekend since i finished induction. on monday, its back to 20 grams or less of carbs per day.

      lets see, what did I do tuesday after my last blog entry. hmm, well i left work to go see  underworld  (great movie) and then went home about an hour after returning to the office. wednesday i woke up early for some odd reason so i went into work had some pizza around 11a and then took off for the rest of the day.  and now today. today i am working from home. well, i was this morning, up until 11 when i decided i had errands to run and then was a good time to do so. so i hit the bank to order some foreign currency (euros to be exact as i need them to buy some info on my notchback from the museum in wolfsberg, germany), stopped at the gas station for a fill up, and then cruised on over to the fry's electronics store in search of a couple specific model hard drives for my server here at home. that was unsuccessful, but since i had arrived to spend some money i stayed and browsed the store. at first i was shopping in the phone isle for a sleek, silver or dark gray speaker phone for my home office. i didn't see anything i liked. next i wandered over to the home theater department where i came so very close (as i always do) to buying a sony 60" grand wega and a new sony dream machine home theater speaker package. then i found myself in the dvd isles (which makes sense since i already had home theater on my mind) were i proceeded to browse and purchase the following dvds, in no particular order: the fifth element, ferris bueller's day off, fast times at ridgemont high, love stinks, the princess bride, weird science, dead man on campus, and animal house. with my spending urge now taken care of i realized i was hungry so i swung through the carl's jr driveup and ordered a western bacon cheeseburger, crisscut fries, a coke and a small chocolate milkshake. now i'm home, finished with lunch and preparing to 'de-plasticwrap' my new dvds.  working from home is tiring.

      had  urlLink traffic school  today. it actually was a very good class. now i went in there with a good attitude seeing in that i was getting out of a  urlLink criminal speeding ticket  because of it but i'm sure i would have liked it just the same had i not wanted to be there. the instructor was very good and drew on a lot of personal experiences. he covered the basic law requirements but at the same time, through stories of his own brushes with loss he showed the class that nothing is too important and to just 'let it go' when things don't go your way. i'm glad i went.

      wow, i missed a few days. hmm, tucson...i got trashed, met a girl i've been talking to for awhile and drove fast on the way back into town. since then i've made plans to go to vegas for the weekend (with Em and 8 other ppl) and have opened up my forum to the local public which has turned it into a vulgar shit hole (i like it!). i'll try to drop on by soon, but i cannot guarentee as things have been pretty busy.

      got the jetta back this morning. now we're just waiting on some flanges to arrive mid-week so they can put together the first prototype and then my car goes back in to have it fitted. i skipped the globe gtg today, mostly because i would have had to hurry to make it there on account of not getting my car back until an hour before i needed to be in globe and partly because i wanted to put the jetta up on jack stands and work on trimming out the plastic underguards that my front wheels rub on in the turns. got that taken care of, and all but solved the problem. then i gave my blue baby a bath, and one for myself. now its time to start the evening by meeting up with the pa people that flew in this afternoon, hit up the pavillions car show and then off to tonight's party (for the pa peeps). i'm going solo i think tonight, no chicken heads to occupy my attention, at least not until i'm sober enough not to drive.

      where the hell have i been?!  well i was in vegas, an alright time. went to work a couple times. put the jetta in the shop to get the custom exhaust work done. i've been shopping for more dvds ( the italian job, super troopers, how high, & undercover brother ). and driving the notch around. this weekend there are a couple parties and a vw gtg in globe. this new forum is really taking up a lot of my time which i am attributing to my lack of posting here. i will try to reevaluate my priorities.

      i went to blog last night and blogger was down and now, for the life of me, i can't remember what i was going to post about.  i picked out my halloween costume for tomorrow night's party. i'm going as wt. that's white trash for those not in the know. i have a auto mechanics jump suit, wife beater tee, mullet wig, false beer belly, and i'm wearing a trucker style hat. i also haven't shaved in a couple days so i'll be nice and scruffy. it'll be classic.

      god. i suck at blogging lately. i've been so busy with traveling for work, getting things finished on my jetta, getting the insurance money for the damage to the notch and entertaining family that's been in town i just haven't had the chance to stop in here and record any thoughts. i apologize.  so. the jetta is back in the shop getting what i am told is the final fitment of the new exhaust this week. i'm really hoping it'll be finished finally. i have a lot of new parts waiting to get installed and i can't do any of them until the exhaust work is done. i've spent a ton of money on these parts and they are just sitting here in my office weeping like homeless orphans. pictures will be a plenty once the parts are all on as i'm sure i will be quite proud of its completion.  i finally got the repair costs paid to me by hertz rent-a-car for the damage done to the notch. just under $1700. i should be able to get a full respray and a few coats of clear for the whole car with that. i'm very excited, especially since i will be able to choose the final color. choices on the list are birch green, velvet green, ruby red, or vw blue with velvet green and ruby red in the lead. pictures of the final results will also be posted.  i stopped my atkins diet a few weeks ago and the weight is still off, or at least the fat is. i have been gain about a pound or two of muscle every week as i have been using the hell out of my free weight gym. as california's governor would say, 'i crush your head like grape!'  the holidays are almost here. i'm taking off the week of thanksgiving and the weeks of christmas and new years again. i'll be in boise with my immediate family for both thanksgiving and christmas and will be back here in the valley partying it up for new years. halloween is this friday and i have yet to decide on a costume for the party that evening. feel free to leave a suggestion in my comments, if you have one.  i'm sure i've missed a few bits here and there but this is all i could think of right now. and i know i've said this before, but i will honestly try to blog more often. cheers!

      so i'm off to play poker. i just found out that my ex's new boyfriend (actually fiance!) is going to be one of the 30 people there. that has made me a little leary. not for that fact that he's dating who i use to date, but that it may introduce unnecessary drama into the day, especially if he's not cool with me. eh, we'll see.

      i got in some new parts to install along with the parts i already had this weekend on the car. its amazing on how quickly the money gets spent when you don't cap yourself. i shudder to think about how much i've spent in the last month. on another note one of the parts i've ordered is still delayed. the 7 to 10 business days i was told for arrival came and went last monday. current eta is next friday, the 14th. fucking company never once tried to contact me about the delay, i called them tuesday and they didn't get back to me until the next day to give me the bad news. bastards. also, my custom exhaust is going to end up being a one of a kind. the company that built it has decided that its going to be too expensive to produce and sell, consumers won't buy it. at least they offered to sell me the prototype and matching hardware for cost for my troubles. that's scheduled to go on next wednesday. it'll finally be over. whew.  one of my companies that i contract for called me today. they want me to come in and give their systems a checkup. i'll probably schedule it for monday or tuesday. should only take me an hour or two. that's an easy $100 to $200 right there. that'll help offset my spending spree, though not by much.  i'm hoping for an eventful and productive weekend. i have a lot to do with a poker tournament starting at 11a on saturday and multiple car mods to install starting extra early on sunday. wish me luck. on both days!

      halloween was a blast! the costume came out nicely and i got thoroughly trashed. there was progress made on my exhaust and the prototype is now being made into a production piece. i should have it on my car within a week or so. i also got my hid headlights installed. gauges and some extra do-dads are going on this coming weekend. once its all buttoned up i'll post pics.

      poker was a good time. i didn't win anything, but i sure as hell drank my $50 buy in's worth! in fact, i had to be picked up by Em who shaparoned me for the rest of the night.  sunday i installed a ton of parts onto the car, its getting close to being finished. the exhaust went on today. looks, sounds, and performs awesome! fixing a few fluid leaks tomorrow and awaiting a few more parts to arrive and the car will be done, engine wise.  my office is moving this upcoming week, i got to see it for the first time on tuesday. i finally have a window! on the second floor no less. i can see the mountain that surrounf the valley from it. i'm so excited!  i'm going to be extremely busy this week with work, the move, preparing for my thanksgiving trip up to the folks, and car stuff, but i'll try to drop in and give an update.

      so i'm all moved in to my new office. i lost about half the space i had in tempe, but the new office in mesa is nicer and i have that glorious window!! haha! tomorrow i fly out to boise to spend the week with the fam. i'm looking forward to it, though its possible that by wednesday i'll wish i was home. i get bored up there.  i'm going to go look for something to do tonight, maybe i'll touch base later in the week.

      the day after turkey day and i'm still full! it was a good meal, mom whipped up some very tasty food and the pumpkin pie was wonderful. now the night before, my dad and i stayed up playing video poker on the computer at  urlLink partypoker.com  and drinking about 4 corona's and 3.5 shots of tequila each until about 4am. it was a very good time, bonding and such. today, mom and i went shopping at the boise outlet mall where i dropped $300 on clothes and a couple new pairs of shoes. i swear, i only find clothes i like when i'm on vacation, never when i'm home.  my sister's birthday is sunday and i haven't bought her anything yet. and i know it sounds bad since i just said i spent a gob of money on myself. but its not my fault really. she hasn't said what she really wants yet. she's mentioned a few things from an online ballet site along with some shoes and what not locally, but hasn't really committed to anything. i suppose tomorrow i'll have her sign on to her ballet shop and pick out what she wants and i'll just buy it for her, but that kind of takes away from the whole unwrapping presents on your birthday, doesn't it? bah, kids...

      ah ha! i'm posting from boise again! i think i posted from up here last year when i was visiting for christmas so i figured i'd post again this year. i also decided to take down the block and link to this here new blog site from the old  urlLink imakemistakes.blogspot.com  site. i figure anyone who was checking that old site has long since stopped so now i can go ahead and link from it for the extra hits of strangers.  i've been having a good time here so far. have been hanging out and relaxing with the fam. my sister is all but grown up now, turns 17 at the end of this month, a junior in high school. i've been reminiscing a lot about my high school days because of her, remembering how much fun i had. other than that, its business as normal here though i've received quite a few calls from az people since i've arrived. and a few unexpected calls from some of my lady friends. while most of the calls i received the first day i was here were from work, Em did call and then also text'd me quite a few times following days. i also received a couple calls from Ju at work though i missed them both (they weren't work related so i'm interested in talking to her to see what's up). i also had a few many words with wife-Al and Ni. almost makes me want to be back in town, but i'm still enjoying it here so i'm not ready to leave, besides, i haven't had thanksgiving dinner yet! :P  on a serious note, my condolences go out to my reader  urlLink Ed . his father passed the other day, my thoughts are with him and his family.  i'll try to stop back in before i 'ship out' this weekend as i'll probably be very busy again once i get back home.

      here's a really trivial post. interesting though. following a link from  urlLink ed's  site, i took the 13 minute iq test at  urlLink www.iqtest.com . my score of  urlLink 141  was intriguing as i've taken full bore tests at other sites and actual in-person tests for the likes of mensa and what not (i'm a sucker for these silly little tests) and the score was rather close, like within 10 points of the written one i took, and only took me 9 minutes instead of the 30-60 minutes most tests run. what's also interesting is how they catagorize the different iq levels. what makes those that are in the 130's an entry level "genius" while those in the 140's a definite genius? what can be said about two people were one is a 139 and the other a 140? does one point really make a difference? give it a try, its a good baseline for those that don't know but may want to.

      ah...so i made it back home safe and sound. my flight was actually in early on sunday which was surprising since the weekend after thanksgiving is suppose to be one of the busiest for travel. the airport here was packed with people flying out, but almost empty of people arriving. that made getting my checked baggage pretty easy, especially nice since i was heavy one extra bag from when i first left. why did i have a whole other bag for my return trip? well, i didn't stop shopping is why. i dropped another $200 on clothes and $100 on dvds and cds. i don't know what came over me. if you add it all up and include the $100+ i spent on my sister for her birthday, i went through $700! my mom asked that i stop buying things or there won't be anything left for her to get me for christmas. i'm sure i could think of some last minute things!  first day back at work today too. had to drive the notch there since the people who built my exhaust needed to 'borrow' it while i was out of town and then they weren't able to get it back to me until tonight. the car held up to the now longer drive to and from the new office fine, but she's not the happiest of cars. i really need to rap up the jetta and get to wrenching on the notch.  and here's a bit of bitching. the people who live in the townhome above me have been fucking loud as hell non-stop since i got home. tonight they've been stomping around and i've heard yelling and crying. its really starting to piss me off. i have to go into the leasing office tomorrow and i will be mentioning it to them. it'll be the third time i've had to complain about it. is it so fucking hard to walk softly? have some goddamn courtesy for your neighbors, sheesh.

      hello! i've been busy! i met a new friend! she's wonderful. sweet, nice, adorably cute, funny, smart, and into vw's! and as you've already guessed, i met her at a vw gtg. only one small, tiny, little problem. supposedly she has a man in tucson that she is head over heels for. or that's what i've been told by someone else who also just met her. i haven't actually brought it up, nor has she mentioned anything about him but that can be for multiple reasons that i don't even want to speculate about. so far we've talked about a ton of stuff, and almost everything we agree on, like, or even thoroughly love, like the rain storm we're having tonight! its great. but i'm biting my tongue. she could totally be a great girlfriend, but also a great friend so i'm playing this one distant and safe. until i feel otherwise, of course. i'm so giddy!

      tomorrow i leave for boise for the holiday. i've noticed that i've been a bit depressed this week and maybe the weeks before. i think i have determined that its partly due to it not feeling like christmas here (temps in the mid 70's) and therefore not excited about it, and also that this will be the first christmas that i am truly alone. last year i had Am to keep me company in what was just the beginnings of that relationship, the prior two years i had ex-Al, the 2 years before that i had An, and the 3 years prior to that i was with Sa. this year i have no one. no one to miss while i'm away at the folks. no one to shop for and attempt to make it a romantic christmas. no one to sit with me at home and watch the cheesy christmas shows. no one to go with me to see the christmas lights in the posh neighborhoods. no one.

      so i had a huge party saturday night. bunch of vw people showed to drink from my keg of killian's and have slice or two from the 2 huge 21" pizzas. good time had by all. about 20 to 25 people at one time were here. a guest and i drank from the yard of beer and a bunch of us took turns with the 3 beer funnel. i got completely toasted to the point were it took me a good 5 minutes to walk across my house as i was having to concentrate very hard on each and every step. and apparently i also had fun that i do not remember. i've been told that i was hold up in my bathroom with two bisexual girls for the better part of an hour, but i have no memory of it. i hope it was memorable for them. the remaining party goers still around by 2am ventured with me to the local denny's were we demolished silverware, shot toothpicks into the ceiling and i apparently picked up the $100 including tip tab. not that i mind. woke up today without, surprisingly, a hangover nor headache. and for the amount of beer i consumed that's really amazing. i spent the day watching tv after a half assed attempt to clean my home. the belt on my vacuum is broke so i have to wait until tomorrow to do the vacuuming. i really should get to bed now, i've work in the morning and probably should be mostly coherent as my co-workers will want to hear about the party.

      ah, christmas day is all but past. it was a pretty good day. even though it didn't snow. christmas present highlight, lithium-ion cordless dremel. this thing is badass. i can't wait to get it back home and use it.  i also had an interesting barrage of 'merry christmas' contacts today. some highlights were text messages from an old friend from high school that use to live down the street from me who i now have a date with later next week, many text messages from new friend Ae including a request for one on one time next week, a call from Sa, a text message from An, and an im convo with previous new friend,  urlLink Su , including a request to chat when i get back. Em, who is picking me up from the airport on sunday, will be joining me for breakfast that day as well as hanging for a bit, or so she says. prospects at home are definitely looking up. and just when i start pouting about not having anyone too. i should do that more often i guess.  don't know what's up for tomorrow. i may use the time to return a dvd that i was given that i already have as it was bought at a hastings and we don't have those in the valley back home. saturday though we are going up to bogus basin for some fun in the snow. apparently they have a new tube run that the fam has been dying to try out. i am looking forward to it.  i am also looking forward to returning home.

      christmas is tomorrow! and while i'm still not totally in the holiday spirit, i guess i'm sort of looking forward to it. we just got back from christmas eve church, a tradition that i really do not care for. and while the rain had stopped when we got out, it still is not cold enough for snow. unless the temps drop some 10 degrees tonight, there will be no white christmas for me this year. that's a little sad. oh and on a side note, i have had someone chat with me this holiday vacation away. one of the girls that came to my party last weekend has been text messaging me all this week. that's been kind of nice. i haven't really hung out with her much, even though i've known her for quite awhile. maybe there's something there, maybe there isn't, dunno. but having another prospect is cool, especially since the new girl that i talked about last week is all but a lost cause. i really haven't heard anything from her since i made that  urlLink post  so i'm going to assume that she's spending it with her beau. good for her. interestingly though, as soon as i noticed she wasn't chatting with me anymore, this 'new' friend 'came along'. happy christmas eve.

      i think my last post was a little tmi. sorry.  btw, i haven't gone to sleep yet. dunno why. i have to be at the dyno in 2 hours and i still haven't washed my car for the bbq afterwards. i'm such a slacker/insomniac. you'd think not sleeping much would allow me to get a lot done. nope. i did take the time to shave my head again. and after spending an hour or so with a shaved head and beard, i decided to shave the face too. its comfortable.  here's something i just noticed. as i ran out of things to look at on the internet, i started looking through my blog and noticed i had a  urlLink comment  that i over looked. apparently An has noticed the link to this site on the old site. i thought that might happen when i put that up, but i took the chance in hopes of getting more readers/hits. i don't know how i feel about her reading this again. i don't know if i would have reworded some of my posts had i known she was reading. but i do know that i'm not going back and changing anything. not my posts nor the link or location of this site. i'm just going to deal with it and see what happens.

      no midnight kiss again. but i did get thoroughly trashed with my friends and had a pretty good time. new year's day was the day to remember though.  the girl that was suppose to give me my midnight kiss and whom i missed meeting up with, Ae, came over today around 2p. i got two kisses right as she walked through the door. kind of took me by surprise. she had her girl friend, He, with her. they wanted a drink so i let them help themselves to the alcohol that was in the fridge. then Ae was hungry, as was i, so we went to the mall for food. upon returning to my place the girls decided that they needed to drink more, and it started. first He started flashing me. this turned in to quite a lot of prancing around and dirty talk with Ae and me while we had dvds playing. we all continued to drink. eventually both girls are buzzing pretty good and close to being actually drunk and the clothes start coming off. they kept challenging each other to remove clothing with He doing most of the challenges. so after a few hours i find myself with no pants on the couch next to two girls in just their thongs and bras. He wanted to go see her boy. she puts her clothes on and takes off and leaves bra and thong wearing Ae with me. now i don't need to go any further but i will say that i had no idea that this day would end up like this nor that Ae and i would, ahem, 'move so fast'. Ae just left a little bit ago and i'm sitting here with a nice grin on my face. crazy kids.

      short entry here, but i wanted to post a little. i only had to  urlLink return one christmas present this year  but i didn't replace it with a similar item. what caught my eye was actually a book. a book i haven't read in a long time but i think i've mentioned it here before. i've been reading it since i got back. douglas adams  the complete collection, the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy . it has all 6 of the stories in the series and is in fact just like the book i read quite a few years ago. back then the book belonged to An. now i have my own.  and here i said this was going to be a short post. i had to stop into the office today to drop off the on-call pager so i checked my work voicemails. there was one left by An. i don't know if you recall, but i  urlLink moved my blog  because of her and some things and haven't talked to her since. basically the message said that this was the only number she had for me and wanted to call and wish me a merry christmas. she said she assumed i was up in idaho and that she hoped i was having a good time. now i don't know how to react to this. a part of me, and it may be a large part, is still mad, upset. another part was glad to hear from her. one part doesn't want to respond, to keep on ignoring her. the other part thinks that's childish. i don't know. i was pretty pissed off back then, the source for all this, and i'm not sure if i'm over it yet. just thinking about it makes me mad. damnit! why?! ugh. i really hate losing a friend, especially one i considered my best. maybe that's why i got so mad. feeling like you've been wronged by a friend is one thing, but when its your best friend its a whole other feeling. i'd like to think that i was an adult. i'd like to think that i get past, get over things rather quickly. i'd like to think that i still had a best friend. i wish i knew what was holding me up.

      i made it home, dispute the country being on orange alert. snow finally hit, sunday. saturday we spent the day up in the mountains in the snow on the new tube run. it was a blast. i picked up some hotfingers brand winter gloves with gore-tex liners since my folks were short a pair of snow gloves. cost me $30. it was a damn good $30. while the outside of the gloves were damp and had ice freezing to them, the inside were warm and dry. they fucking rocked.  speaking of rocked. my new friend Ae came over tonight. we watched a couple movies, ate some food, and had rather pleasant evening hanging out. a nice bit of sexual tension hung in the air all night. i felt like such a little kid. and i rather acted like one too as i didn't go in for the kiss good night. don't know why i was nervous about it. especially since she is another youngin' at 19 years of age. oh well, she really wants to hang out some more very soon and i'm all for it.  tomorrow i'm heading into the office for a few minutes even though i'm still on vacation this week. first reason is so i can drop off the on-call pager that i took with me to idaho. second is that i'm buying a keg-o-rator from a co-worker. $100 for a self contained keg-o-rator with co2 and an empty full size keg, can't beat that. some fun weekends ahead.

      hmm...what's happened? well, i bought a trek 4500 mountain bike, a thule roof rack, a directv dish and 2 receivers all on sunday. took the bike in to get tuned up (it was used) on monday as well as sent my friend home with my 2 directv cards to be 'adjusted'. tuesday i got the cards back and set up the dish and a receiver. stayed up until 5:30a the next morning watching satellite. yesterday i got the bike back and took it for a ride. damn i'm out of shape. afterwards i removed the turbo from the jetta in an attempt to drill and tap some busted studs. that was unsuccessful so today i'm driving the notch and taking the turbo to a machine shop to get drilled and tapped. tonight my keg-o-rator gets delivered. saturday is a mountain bike race/party during the day that i think i'm going to go to. and sunday, and this is the good part, i'm going to go snow boarding! Su asked me to go with her and some friends so i agreed, found gear to borrow, and we'll be leaving sunday morning around 7:30a for the slopes at sunrise park. i'm so excited.

      omg yesterday was a long day. fun, but long. and i haven't had nearly enough sleep but a call from the folks to tell me about all the snow they're having woke me up. dyno was ok, everyone was about 25 horsepower down from what they should be. the humidity was quite high. the bbq was cool. maybe even cold. it was rainy and windy and about 50 degrees out. but i still had a good time. the party was crazy. people got stupid drunk. around midnight i kicked everyone out to denny's. i got to sleep around 3. i don't think starting the party at 7p was a smart move on my part. that's just too much time to be drinking and these kids get crazy by 11p instead of the safer 1 or 2a. oh well.

      working from home today. nice to be able to lounge around. though i do have stuff to do. at noon i have a conference call i have to be on and after that i need to work on the jetta. but when you wake up late, how motivated can you be?  here's something that has been rolling around in my mind recently. i received an email from An this past weekend stating that she's going to be in town from tuesday of this week through tuesday of next week. now i kind of just read it and closed it and didn't think about it. but now its dawned on me that she is in town and out there wandering around. i haven't seen her in well over a year. of course i haven't wanted to see her during the last 7 or so months. but now that she's here i'm having mixed feelings about whether or not i don't want to see her. how friggin' retarded.

      what a weekend! i spent all of friday night and all of saturday working on the jetta. i have only one last bolt to chase and tap before its back on the road.  sunday i went snowboarding. i suck. i suck badly. i suck so badly that i had to be brought down the mountain, not once, but twice!! haha. the first time was because i just couldn't stand up on my board anymore. i was exhausted so ski patrol gave me a courtesy ride down in the toboggan. the second time i was too trashed to balance.  after the first trip i met up with a friend in the lodge and we started hammering down pitchers of beer. by the time Su took a break for lunch i was 2 pitchers deep myself. she wanted me to hit the slopes with her one last time so i told her i would but not before i finished the 3rd pitcher. so she eggs me on to go finish it quickly but i suggest that she go and run the hill one more time and by then i'll be finished and ready to do the easier bunny hill. she agrees, but not without protest. i return inside the lodge finish my pitcher with my friend and walk back outside. she hasn't taken the lift yet. she yells for me to hurry up with my board. not being coherent, i react and rush over with it. my friend has to help me get my forward foot bound into the board. Su suggests that i take the half hill lift and she will take the full hill left and we'll meet in the middle. i agree. as i'm riding the lift i'm thinking to myself that this is a very bad idea. i get to the drop off point and attempt to exit the lift. i cannot balance. i fall directly on my face. upon getting up i see that Su has already made it to the half way point and is waiting for me. i attempt to bind my back foot into the board. i cannot. she unclips and helps me in. she then helps me up and pulls me over to the start of the run. we are both laughing hysterically. we start going down. i all of the sudden get this feeling of great confidence as i go down. i start crouching, picking up speed. she passes me and goes over the next drop. i lose my confidence and somehow manage to stick the  front  of the board into the snow. i launch into the air and pinwheel down about 10 feet, and slide another 5. i am still laughing hysterically. as i sit up i see that all of ski patrol has seen my flight including the patrolman who had me brought down the first time. he asks, "at it again, huh?" i respond, "well i thought the beer would have helped." to which he retorts, "usually doesn't." they ask if i'd like another lift, this time on the snowmobile. i say sure but keep attempting to board down. i get about 3 more tries in, with falls, before the snowmobile arrives. my friend captures my decent on the snowmobile on my camera so that i can always remember my first time snowboarding. Su and i agree that going back up on the big hill probably wasn't the best idea but admit that it was still fun.  the cruise back to town was fun, with Su and I doing movie quotes back and forth over the radios with everyone else. the next day, yesterday, i'm sore. very sore. but regardless, i had a blast and have every intention of doing it again, even if it means a repeat of the first time's performance.   today is a vw lunch gtg at someburros. i am looking forward to seeing Su there.

      today was a great day! had a txt message chat with Su this morning in which she wanted me to know something about her before i invested too much time in her. seems that she is still a virgin and plans on remaining one until marriage. she wanted me to know since she knows that some guys don't want to deal with that. my reaction made her happy. knowing that i don't have a problem with that (and i honestly don't) and it doesn't change a single thing with how i feel towards her put a smile on her face. so this afternoon we met up at f1 race factory and watched our fellow dubbers do the indoor cart thing. she was very cuddly towards me, it rocked. we then left and tried to hit up the end of the barrett-jackson auction but by the time we got there there was only an hour or so left and they were still charging full price ($50 for 2). we skipped it and drove to the pavilions carshow but not before having some dinner at the 5 & diner. we held hands a lot. lots of friendly petting. we just recently called it a night since we're up at 5 tomorrow for a 6am departure to the mountains. and as silly as this sounds, i think we are going to kiss soon. i'm way looking forward to it and way nervous about it. first time in a long time where i've found myself waiting for that first kiss. they always just seemed to happen, and happen soon, but this is different. this is like 'textbook' dating, if there is such a thing. and i'm not saying that to diminish whats happening. i mean that this is all playing out like in a romance story. its uber cheesy to think like this, but i'm really liking it. i have no desire to rush things, only to be with her. i love it. ahh...time for bed, looking forward to tomorrow.

      omg what a good night. i can totally see myself with Su. we were very close tonight during the party. the kind of close two people get when they like each other but are playing it safe because that's what they think the other one wants. holding hands, whispering to each other, etc...its so silly, but that's what makes is so cool. i haven't felt/acted/been like this in a long time. too long as a matter of fact. ahh...time for bed, tomorrow is another day, another day with Su.

      it was a good date. food was good, conversation rocked, lots of eye contact. we called it a night around 10 or so, she had work and school the next day. as far as first dates go, i thought it was perfect. nothing physical, lots of getting to know you talk, and everyone was still smiling at the end of the night. i'm so looking forward to the next, which i plan on asking about next week as we have lots going on this weekend. tonight is a going away party for a buddy of mine who's heading off to london to teach for 10 weeks. Su is coming, after her dad's b'day dinner. i'm going to get to introduce her to a lot more of my vw friends. she's excited, as am i. tomorrow is a vw gtg thing at the f1 race factory indoor cart track. there is also another day of the barrett-jackson classic car auction which Su has just expressed interest in going to. so we may do one or both tomorrow. then after a somewhat early evening, we're going snowboarding again on sunday! i'm really excited now because i'll get to hit the full mountain more confident this time. it also means that i'll be able to board with Su. its looking to be a very good weekend, again. yay me!

      omg! what an awesome weekend!! friday night i went out with Ju, his fiance Li and his dad to the la parilla suiza that just opened near my house. great time, great food. saturday i lounged around waiting for the last part i needed to finish the jetta to fly in. the guy selling it to me got in town around 7 and i needed to meet him at the ace hardware so i could buy the correct sized studs before they closed. got the part (for a great deal no less), got the studs, and went back home to start putting things together. Ju came over to assist. we had the turbo back on the car and it running in about an hour. with everything sealed up and working and double checked after a quick ride around town i went to bed since i needed to be at Su's house by 6:30a sunday to go snowboarding again.  sunday's snowboarding trip rocked! i decided to take a lesson this time and it really helped. i feel confident enough to go back up the mountain next time knowing that i'll be able to make it down myself. Su ended up taking the class with me and we had a great time going through the basics together. the day was cut short though as one of the people that was with us broke his collar bone. so at 3p we headed back to town stopping to eat on the way. Su road back with me and my work friend in the jetta and we had a really great time during the drive. during the trip down Su asked about doing something that night and it was suggested beverages and hot tub'ing was in order at my place. after everyone split up and went home she came over. we picked up some drinks while one of the people who went snowboarding with us made their way to my place. the three of us spent about an hour in the hot tub returning back to my living room for a few south park episodes after which the friend left leaving Su and I to finally get acquainted. we had a wonderful talk and by then end of the night she was cuddled up next to me and we were holding hands (hehe, that sounds so cheesy but i was on cloud nine). once she was sober enough to drive she headed home. Ju was still up and he swung by for a early morning bite at denny's. i got to bed about 4a. today i'm in the best mood, not even sore (except for the bit of a sunburn i got on my face) and eager for the next time Su and i can spend time together. we already have tentative plans for boarding this weekend, but i'm hoping to see her sooner. ahhh, i'm so giddy.

      ok, so my worries were unfounded. Su came over today after work at 3 and we went to the mall and wallyworld so she could do some shopping. we had a good time, she was affectionate, and we clicked more. she just left for her last class of the day(night). tomorrow we leave for the cabin, i can't wait. this is going to be a really great weekend, i can feel it.  and now for some non-Su related posts since i haven't seemed to have had one in awhile. my buddy Gl is bringing by a futon frame tonight. going to use it here in my office for guests and more sitting room during parties. i just need to buy a new mattress for it.  i've talked to An a couple times recently. she im'd me, asked if we could try to be friends again and i said ok. nothing really has been said or talked about, not that there really is anything to say or talk about. so far only a bit of small talk, its been nice. i browsed to  urlLink her blog  for the first time in a long while. left a comment, of course it was last night and i was still a bit tipsy so the comment is just me trying to be funny, but i did post something. maybe we could be friends after all.  Sa also just contacted me the other night, wondering why I don't talk to her anymore. she was being sarcastic since we didn't see eye to eye on her then new boyfriend so we stopped talking to each other for a bit. turns out i was right, the situation wasn't good and they are split up. i brought her up to date on Su which might not have been the nicest thing to do seeing in that she had just split up from her man a few weeks ago, but i like telling the story and talking about Su so i was a little selfish. she wants to hang out tonight which'll work since Su is in class now and most likely going salsa dancing with her friend afterwards. probably just get a bite to eat since i'm starving. if i have anything to post tomorrow before i go i will, otherwise i'll see you back here monday or tuesday, whenever i've the free time.

      went to the george & dragon pub on central and indian school tonight. drank guinness on an empty stomach. lots of guinness. Su was there, as well as Ch and Gr. i brought Ju with me. i think i might have made an ass out of myself at the end of the night. why do i say that? well it was the first time Su has ever pushed me back, or away, or whatever you want to call it. she was inquiring as to what my current look ment and i decided to tell her, but i think i scared her with my advance and she stopped me. i felt really bad about it. moped over it the entire drive home. Ju tried to explain that she was definitely in for me over anyone else that was there, but i don't know if it was a friend's 'defense' to my moppy-ness or if he actually saw it that way. regardless i txt'd her my apologies if i acted inappropriate or made her feel uncomfortable at all tonight. she responded don't worry about it and that everything was fine. she hoped that i had a good time tonight and said sleep well. i responded with thanking her for being so understanding, reminded her that i was home all day tomorrow (today), and said goodnight. she said goodnight back. now i'm sitting her, still buzzing, still bummed, yet not as much as i was, and not wanting to go to sleep.  but i am going to sleep. tomorrow is another day, and the following day is the first day of my weekend with Su. wish me luck that i don't fuck it up.

      talk about your days that just totally turn around on you.  before going to bed last night i txt'd Su about going to dinner sometime this week. it wasn't until this morning that she txt'd me back. she said that dinner sounded great but she wouldn't be able to this week. i replied that that was a bummer and then did a bit a flirting via a couple txt messages. maybe it was the allergy medicine i took before i left for work or maybe the not really, yet kind of, rejection to my dinner invite, or maybe a combination of both, but i felt pretty down and i wasn't getting the vibe that she was flirting back with me in the two txt messages that she sent back. today was a lunch gtg that we were going to so i was going to get to see her there, but i was feeling bummed, or something was nagging at me and spoiling my mood. there also was going to be another guy there at lunch that likes her so maybe i felt a bit threatened and i was worrying about the possibility that she might like them over me. whatever it was, i was on edge and not very cheerful come lunch. i took my work buddy Ri with me and we met everyone at chili's near asu campus. Su was going to be a half hour later than everyone else was so when i got there the seating arrangements had been made by this other guy that likes her. Ch, the guy who's gone boarding with us the last three times, and who also likes Su, was there as well. i made a few comments of not having enough seats for people that were arriving late and got everybody to shuffle, except for Gr who managed to keep the seat open that i could tell he was saving for Su. luckily, Ju arrived and caught my nod for him to sit there leaving the only open seat for Su next to me. after a few moments Ju had to go back outside and asked me to follow him out. i relayed my brief morning to him and we walked about the building. all of a sudden Gr is outside and gets into his car and leaves. doesn't say why. we go back inside and the people there say he just got up, said he had to bail and left. odd. a few minutes later i see Su driving around outside looking to park so i get up and go meet her at her car. she gives me a deep hug and we go back inside. i pull out her chair, we sit, everyone orders and we eat. during lunch i get a little bit of attention from her, enough to somewhat cheer me up yet at the end we go our separate ways without much ado. i over hear some plans with Ch for tomorrow night but decide that its not going to bother me. Ch looks over and actually invites Ju and myself along, Su says that she doesn't know if she's going to go to me and we part. back at the office i get wrapped up in some work and put a few fires out while chatting with Ju via aim about cabins for the weekend. he's not having any luck so i dump all my current phone convos and make a call to greer cabin keepers myself. i find a place, in the snow, in the woods, with two bedrooms for $300 total, two nights. i confirm with Ju and book it. just as i finish with that Su txt's me wondering if i'm home yet. i reply no, but i can be, what's up. she replies oh nothing exciting, she was just going to use me for a cool place to study since she has three and a half hours until her next class. i call her and say meet me at my house, she says oh don't worry about but i convince her that i was just leaving anyways. i am elated! i rush home at extralegal speed. she arrives. we have a deep hug and a bit of a chat along with showing her the cabin that i booked. she asks about my head and if it still hurts from boarding, i say no but my neck has been really sore. she says she'll rub it. with lotion. i protest, sighting her need to study and she responds she only do it for 15 minutes. an hour later i'm still on my stomach, on the floor, shirt off, in heaven. i feel absolutely wonderful. we lay on the floor together for a bit before putting in a  urlLink happy tree friends  dvd since she has never watched one and noticed that i had them while going through my dvds for movies to take to the cabin. we have a blast watching it. we move to the couch and watch law & order on usa. at 6:20 she realizes that she's going to be late to her 6:30 research class. she ditches it to stay with me. we watch more law & order. we talk. we laugh. we nuzzle, cuddle, and hold each other. we have a wonderful time. at 7 she says that she should go since she needs to be home by 7:30. at 7:45 she finally gets to leaving. i close the door behind her with the biggest grin ever on my face. i have no doubt in my mind now that she wants to be with me. we discussed so much that we are almost halfway to knowing everything there is to know about each other, at least the important ground level stuff. i'm on such a high that i meet up with Ju and Li at Ju's little brother's hockey game just so i can tell someone what a wonderful mood i am in. my face is starting to hurt from this grin i cannot get rid of. time for bed and dreams of Su.  edit: holy crap that was a long post of me just rambling, acting stupid, and being corny. i'm not going to change it now, but i'll try to get a handle on it for future postings.  edit again: who am i kidding, i can be as long winded as they get!

      i bet you can't guess what kind of day i had yesterday. oh you could? you're right, it was a great day!  Su, Ch, and i hit the road at 6:30a for the slopes at sunrise ski resort. had a good drive up. lots of snow, some fog, and ice made Su nervous about driving so i comforted her while she drove and gave her advise on what to and not to do. she did very well for her first time in that kind of weather. no mistakes. when it cleared for a bit she had me drive the rest in case we hit more foggy, icy weather, which we did. she told me later that she really appreciated me comforting her and that it ment a lot to her. at the mountain, Su took a intermediate boarding class, Ch took an advanced class, and i stuck to doing midway runs, practicing what i learned last week. i had two really good runs with me falling pretty hard twice on the third run. i called it quits after that, but it was almost 2:30 anyway meaning i had been at it for 3 or so hours. i also lost my favorite sunglasses up there. put them down at one point and couldn't find them again. i was a little depressed about it, but spending time with Su fixed that. we touch or held hands or each other all day long and almost the entire drive home. i'm really quite smitten with her and i think she with me. Ju and i are planning a weekend getaway for this weekend for the four of us, Li and him, and Su and me. Su is excited. we're trying to pick a nice enough cabin in the snow were we can all just lay around and relax. Li and Su haven't seen a ton of great movies so we all decided that we would get together and watch them and this weekend would be the perfect time to do it. i'm so looking forward to it, i just hope we don't have any complications in getting a place. cross your fingers for me.

      i bought a new car tonight. 2004 volkswagen 2 door awd golf r32, or r32 for short. its basically an all-wheel drive gti with a 3.2l vr6 in it. 241hp, 236ft/lbs in a 6-speed hatchback. i love it. i drove the snot out of it tonight too. had a friend take pictures of it so i'll post one here once they are online. its good bye jetta though, i have until the 20th to return it to near stock and hand it over to the dealership.  i really love my r32.

      my Su world came crashing down around me tonight. i will go into it here, but not now. i'm too spent. Sa came over and talked to me about it, on her birthday no less, so that helped. though her advice is not the kind i want to hear, but she's really the only one i can talk to about it for a completely unbiased opinion. Su and i are getting together to talk about what came about tonight tomorrow, sometime before 6. i wish it was sooner, don't know how i'm going to sleep and if i don't it'll make it 3 nights in a row. i'm going to go lay down, my head hurts.

      *sigh*  Su came over monday afternoon. i made us some tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches. we hung out, she study just a little bit. it was great. she came over last night too. only stayed a couple hours, study most of it, but it was my asking that brought her here to study instead of spending it in the asu library. even just being around her was great. i read some more of my douglas adams book, she read trial cases. we sat perfectly content in each other's presence. i was sad to see her go, especially knowing that i would not be getting the chance to see her today being that she is attending a trial in the morning with the lawyers she works with (her first, she is very excited, as am i for her) followed by getting ready for and helping out with her sisters bridal shower tonight. this will be the first day since last wednesday that i will not have the chance to see her. i already have this longing inside me, i actually miss her, the thought of it is a bit sad. and while we have no set plans to meet up thursday, i know i will see her on friday as i'm taking her to the bus pick up point for her asu snowboarding trip to colorado this weekend. which is another sad point as she'll be gone through sunday. but it could all be for the best. a little break in the time spent around each other to reaffirm our attraction for one another, our need to see each other. a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, if you will. i'm loving every minute of this burgeoning relationship. text alone cannot convey the smile that i've had on my face for the last week.

      so now that i have a moment, let me tell you about this past weekend.  as i said before, it was wonderful. Su and i spent all of the time up there together, holding each other, cuddling, and, after our first kiss friday night, kissing. and let me tell you, that first kiss was worth the wait. it was great. the cabin was great and we even got a few inches of snow fall saturday night, waking up to this:    urlLink      that's her gti. we talked a ton, worked out a lot of the specifics as to what we are as relationships go. seems that we are moving a lot faster than she has ever done before with a guy and that she gets anxious about commitment and labels and how friends and people in public view her in new relationships. she confessed that it takes her a long time to be comfortable in public with a new guy and to finally start using the 'boyfriend'/'girlfriend' labels but that she is a one guy type of gal which made me feel better about us not having a label yet. for perspective, she told me that of the guys she's dated, she didn't kiss them for the first time until almost a year or more had passed and with me things are falling into place a lot quicker than she's use to. she did say that once she does feel comfortable and the initial anxiety goes away that she's a very affectionate person in public and lavishes her beau with tons of attention. it just takes her time to get to that point. but when we're alone, she's more free to do what her heart wants without her brain getting in the way. i told her that its ok with me and that while i might possibly would want it another way, i'm can be more than content to do it her way because she means that much to me. she's was very happy that i was so understanding and went out of her way to show me. this weekend was blissful, waking up next to her both mornings was a wonderful feeling. falling asleep next to her at night, so comfortable. she told me she felt the same way. i really really like where this whole thing is going and can't wait for the next step. she's been on my mind all morning, i'm looking forward to the next time i get to see her. its not nearly soon enough.

      i got to hang out with Su tonight. she invited me over to her place to watch a movie after i left my buddy's house from working on the jetta. we watched league of extraordinary gentlemen, which i had already seen but i didn't mind watching it again with her. we had such a nice time cuddled up on her couch while the movie played. i even got to meet her mom while i was there. it was a good evening and Su really liked me being there. we have plans for friday afternoon and then a drive on sunday together. i can't wait to see her again. i really am happiest when i'm around her and she is confessing more and more to me about how she feels towards me and us, something that is very scary for her, the whole commitment thing. all is going so well!

Su and i had a blast at the cruise night friday. saturday she came out and watched a bit while i was working on the jetta. she got the flowers i sent her for valentine's day; she absolutely loved them. after working on the jetta she met me at my place where i made her dinner for v-day. after which we went and saw big fish (which i liked but Su thinks she needs to see it again to decide). it was a great day/night! today we went to the copperstate show, looked at all the aircooled vw's. afterwards we went to a fine arts and chocolate festival in scottsdale with Ju and Li. Su and i returned to my place and watched a little south park before she had to leave to meet up with one of her girlfriends. she told me that she really likes me. she also thanked me for such a wonderful weekend. oh god, this is going to well. i'm so very very happy!!!

      its been a good week so far. i've spent time with Su every single day, whether in the afternoon or late at night. its been great. she just left now, has been here since she got off school. so great. i'll be seeing her tomorrow to drop her car off at the dealership in the early evening and then again later that evening since she's staying the night. we have the walk up south mountain for cancer charity thing saturday morning so it just makes since for her to stay here friday night, being that i live on south mountain. afterwards its kinda up in the open she has a tax class from 4-6 and after which we have a double dinner date with my friends Mi and Ju. sunday we were going to go to the renaissance festival and then a vw dinner gtg but she hasn't stayed home and studied in awhile so she thinks she may do that instead of the festival. and since she has plans to go salsa dancing later sunday night and a possible family thing prior to that she may not be able to make the vw dinner gtg at hooters. which is all a bummer for me, but in reality i have been bogarting her time lately so i really can't complain. everything is still going so well.

      so i had a pretty good weekend. spent a great day with Su on friday, running errands, working on our cars and just generally hanging out. she stuck around until about 10p then went out with her best friend for a drink. she had a few more then that and i was happy to pick her since she couldn't drive. she stayed with me that night and i took her to her car saturday morning around 6a then headed over to where the jetta was housed so i could get it finished and back to the dealership by noon. afterwards i relaxed, hung out with Sa a bit and then headed over the west side of town to visit my grade school friends To and We. i only stayed out there until 11 or so then came back home to spend time with Su before she went to home and to bed around 1. sunday morning she came back over and we intended to go on a drive to tucson with a s2000 group but since the person we knew didn't show we decided a drive up north would be better. and what a wonderful drive it was. we headed up to prescott by way of wickenburg to have lunch. after eating and a walk around the square there we drove up to goldwater lake and spent about a half hour sitting on a bench underneath a blanket at the edge of the lake in the rain/snow enjoying the weather/view and each other. we then headed back into prescott and i suggested pizza for dinner at this great place called roma's in flagstaff. and since she had never been to jerome, we drove to flagstaff by way of cottonwood/jerome/sedona. it was gorgeous out. light snow, fog on the pine tops, beautiful. once in flagstaff we ate then drove around the town a bit before grabbing some coffee and heading back down to the valley. once back she hung out until about 11 at my place and we talked a great deal more about us and this and that. all in all we spent a glorious 16 hours together, of which almost 9 hours was in the car and not once did either of us tire of the other. it was just about the perfect day. right now she is napping here between classes. i love knowing that she's just in the other room. i've been so happy and it doesn't look like that's changing.

       me: Subject of a recent junk email: Grow a New Pussy Ripping Whale DlCK  Bobby: haahahha me: wtf! me: doesn't sound like the type of thing you get a return date with   and in other news, Su invited me to her sister's wedding reception tonight. i had to go out and buy new dress clothes as all the clothes i own that are dressy i've outgrown (read: too damn fat). i'm getting ready now, leaving in a little bit. going to be lots of her family there, obviously, so i'm a bit nervous. tomorrow night we're going to the improv though i don't know who we are seeing. sunday she is studying with me helping. its going to be a good weekend. any weekend with her is a good weekend.

      wow, i've missed a few days. i'll summarize briefly then. friday night, Su invited me out to dinner with her family. great time, they all seem to be good, and fun, people. i think i made a good impression. saturday morning her and i did the climb for a cure walk up south mountain. about 6 miles total. i made it, didn't die. very proud of myself. plus Su and i had a really good time doing it. afterwards we went to the tempe town lake and bought hand made bowls for hunger charities. i got this really niffty looking bowl, kind of earthy looking and deep. perfect for soup. we then returned to my place for a quick lunch and a much needed four hour long nap. after which we got ready and met up with our friends for dinner at the village tavern in scottsdale. food was very good. as was the conversation. Mi and Ju really liked Su, told me we go good together. yesterday Su and i went for a bike ride around south mountain. i got to load up my thule rack on my r32, it was pretty cool. we returned to my place after the ride to watch a couple movies and supposedly study, though she didn't get much studying done, which i feel bad for. and now today after which i didn't really have best of at work, Su stopped by my place to cheer me up for all oft 25 minutes before she had to return to campus for her last class. she drove all the way to my place knowing she'd have to turn around and go back in less than a half hour just to make me feel better. that's sooo awesome!   ok, now something not Su related...a game! stolen from my buddy in nj:   Winamp Playlist Game Thing...   The Rules are: Step 1: Open your Winamp or other MP3 player. Step 2: Put all of your music on random. Step 3: Write down the first 23 songs it plays, no matter how embarrassing Step 4: Wait for complaints about the esoteric nature of your mp3s    01. Apollo 440 - The Machine in the Ghost 02. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones - Where'd You Go? 03. DJ Assault - Nut in Your Eye 04. Train - Drops of Jupiter 05. Metallica - Die, Die My Darling 06. Metallica - So What 07. O Brother, Where Art Thou - Didn't Leave Nobody But The Baby 08. Faith Hill - Breathe 09. Pete Yorn - On Your Side 10. Beck - Ranshackle 11. Pete Yorn - Murray 12. Judas Priest - Judas Priest - Metal Meltdown 13. Cranberries - Electric Blue 14. OutKast - B.O.B 15. Static-X - A Dios Alma Perdida 16. Beck - Derelict 17. Westwood Red Alert - Bigfoot 18.

      the wedding reception went well. i think her family likes me. they all kept giving me advice on how to keep her. major point being that i should take dance lessons as dancing (salsa, swing, etc.) is her life. i'm all for it. in fact i kick myself for passing it up when An was still living in town. so i've been looking into classes, hopefully i can find one that allows me to learn incognito, without her knowing that i've been taking them so that i can all of a sudden whisk her away and really impress her. wish me luck on that.  saturday we hung out all day. in fact she surprised me by showing up at my place in her pjs when i though she was at home in bed txting me back and forth after we both just woke up. such a nice surprise. we went on a bike ride and a dip in the ice cold pool followed by a quick dip in the too hot jaccuzzi. afterwards we just hung out at my place even though we were suppose to go to the improv. saving it for another night. we played texas hold'em and made dinner instead. she wanted to learn how before the poker tournament we are going to next weekend.  our sunday plans fell through. she ended up having to go mattress shopping with her mom during the day and then her night out dancing started earlier than i thought so we didn't end up getting to see each other. i was a little bummed, besides knowing that she was out salsa dancing with a male friend, but jealousy isn't becoming of me. they ended up getting sick of dancing early and as i understand it he talked her into going to see a movie. starsky and hutch actually, a movie i really wanted to see, but i tried not to let that show when she told me that's what they were going to go see. instead i found her car at the theater and left a single white rose on her windshield to let her know i was thinking about her. then i headed off to visit with Mi, Ju, wife-Al, and Gl, though Gl was asleep when i got there.  tonight she is coming over and we are studying. she has a lot of reading to do and i am determined to help her with these cases. i am also cooking us dinner. chopped pan fried boneless skinless chicken breast sauteed in butter then cooked with angle hair pasta and herbs along with some fresh baked rolls and a light salad. crap! i forgot to get the lettuce. back to the store with me.

      so i've been running around like a chicken with its head cut off all week preparing for the fam's arrival on monday. at the same time i've been missing Su terribly regardless that we've been txting each other constantly since she's been gone. the good news? she's on her way back right now, only a few hours away i would guess. they decided to come back a day early so i'm just the happiest boy in town right now. on top of that, my new bed arrived today, which i purchased monday. tonight's one of those rare occasions that i'm excited to get to bed. should be pretty easy to sleep too as i've been doing nothing but cleaning since i got home and i'm a bit tired already.  and some news from earlier this week, i hung out with An for the first time in what seems like forever. met her and a couple of her friends at the st. patrick's day barenaked ladies concert in tempe wednesday night as she is in town for her brother's wedding tomorrow. honestly, i was a bit nervous seeing her again due to the length of time past and the outing we had mid last year. but that all faded away after the first hellos. ended up being a good night and we seemed able to just hang out and be at ease with each other. i'm happy about that. of course, now that i'm all for hanging out with her again she announces that she's moving to hawaii after she graduates in a few weeks. but she has a solution for that. Su and i are invited to come stay and visit whenever we'd like. free room on the island? i'm there!

      great day today. Su and i headed up to flagstaff and snowbowl to board. it was warm and the snow didn't look good on the runs, on top of the fact that we got there after noon, so we skipped it and headed up to the grand canyon instead. its was very fun. we took a bunch of pics and had a generally wonderful time being with each other. tuesday Su leaves for san diego with her best friend for a girl's spring break road trip. it'll suck having her gone for almost a week but i'll make due until she returns on saturday and we take hit up the  something corporate, yellowcard, and the format  concert that night. i'm looking forward to it. my fam will be in town next monday, staying with me for a week. it'll be nice to see them again. i've taken the week off to do the family thing. Su will get to meet them, i hope she like them. i know they'll like her.

      what a long week. fam left this morning and i just finished cleaning up. Su spent a lot of time with me and my family which made me very happy. she said she was very happy that i wanted her to meet them. fam loved her. i've been told a few times not to screw it up because they like her. yay me! now i'm waiting for some laundry to finish and then i'm off to Su's to hang out with her for the rest of the day. tomorrow is a drive down south to patagonia. i'm looking forward to it.

      i haven't posted in awhile. nothing really extraordinary to post about. things with Su are still super great and i'm sure the day to day babble was getting old so i haven't posted any of it. we are planning a trip to disneyland for the near end of the month but the budget is tight so we may forgo it. i'm spending easter sunday with her family this year. oh, and i almost forgot! her best friend's birthday is friday so i'm going with her to the party/club thing. will be my first time meeting all of her law school friends. honestly, i'm a bit nervous. i'm hoping they like/approve of me. and i'll try and check back here more often.

      you know, she really is the greatest woman ever. Su never ceases to amaze me. we've found that time apart makes us both unhappy and we both do whatever we can to be together. my girlfriend is wonderful! oh, and there is a car show on saturday that i'm throwing a party for tomorrow.

      woohoo! just got back from the offspring concert with Su. some friends of ours were there along with her brother, and Sa ended up coming out too. it was a pretty good time. i had a few beers, ate some food, jumped up and down. it was a good time. Speaking of Su, her and i are doing great! she's here now, in the other room, working on law school stuff, getting ready for finals. i absolutely love how we can just hang out and do our own thing yet still be completely attentive to one another. i strongly believe this one is going to go all the way.

      its been week. Su and i are still super happy together. she's in the middle of hell week right now so we're not going to get to see much of each other. we're making due.  i've sold a lot of my jetta parts recently. have a couple big sales pending for thursday which it they go through i'll finally be picking up my oem hids for the r32.  i've a traffic hearing tomorrow afternoon. not looking forward to it but the cop was an ass as well as citing me using the radar gun reading of an officer that was not at the traffic stop. he didn't let me view the radar gun used to cite me when i asked so off to court i go. i just hope the judge sees it my way.  nothing big planned this weekend for me. was thinking about getting my wisdom teeth out but i haven't even made the appointment yet so it doesn't look like that will be happening. maybe the following weekend.

      so its been awhile. oddly, i just haven't had any desire to post. not because i'm tired of blogging, but maybe because i talk about everything with Su now. i end up not having anything to post here. so how about an update?  Su and i are great. things couldn't be going better and i'd have to say that i'm just about the happiest i've ever been. tomorrow morning we leave for a road trip to san francisco and a car show in santa clara. four days of just the two of us; 1500 miles, 26 hours in the car total. honestly i'm really looking forward to it. so much so that while i should be sleeping quietly next to Su now i'm awake and too excited to sleep. looks like i'll be sleeping some during the drive. i'll try and post up how the trip was when we get back.  i see that blogger has changed (i have been away for awhile!) and i've updated my template to support their new comment system. i left my old comment system in place for previous posts but as soon as i end up republishing the entire blog they will be gone. oh well, i really haven't received that many anyway.  that's about all i have right now. bummer that its so short. we'll see if i can't get myself together here and save some bits for the blog. or at the very least duplicate my efforts.

      sf was great! Su and i had a wonderful time. we even stay in an ocean view hotel at pismo beach sunday on the way back. snapped a few pics along the pch. about 28 hours of driving total, 1680 miles round trip. i loved spending so much time together with her, this was the longest yet. today we leave for new mexico, just east of greer, az, to stay in a big cabin with her fam for the holiday weekend. campfires, dirt bikes, paintball. should be pretty fun.

      the cabin with Su and her fam was fun. it wasn't in nm like i said in my last post, but just northeast of showlow in az. regardless it was a blast and i got to do a few things for the first time. played paintball for the first time. i rock at it and now i'm looking into getting my own equipment. road a dirt bike for the first time, not bad, never fell, but i like quads better. and i played actual games of horseshoes. was tossing ringers like a pro. and on top of all that i was with Su 24/7. it was a great weekend.  i don't have any trips planned for awhile now, back to work and 'normal' life for a bit. i do get to go to the vw proving grounds tomorrow afternoon to test drive the yet to be seen 2006 vw passat and give my opinions and thoughts on it. i was able to get Su into the deal as well. she's very excited. and to make the deal sweeter, they are paying us $100 each for our time. can't beat that!  my old friend  urlLink An  is in town this week before she moves out to hawaii. i'm hoping i get the chance to see her before she goes.  and speaking of old friends, an old neighbor of mine from high school called me up out of the blue. she apparently is out of the coast guard now and living in prescott. she asked if i was married yet and when i said not yet she asked if i was engaged. answering not yet to that she then informs me that she's living the single life up there and that she'll be in town on the 18th to visit some friends. i was getting ready to go out for the evening when she called and at this moment Su arrived. i told her that Su was there and i had to get going but that i'd call her back sometime to chat. told Su about the call and she immediately guessed that this old friend was 'fishing', trying to see if i was single. bummer for her i'm not. though i did think it odd to hear from her out of the blue. we're talking at least 5 years since i last spoke to her.  anywho, that's enough for now. i think i might head up to the grocery store. all this traveling has left my fridge quite bare.
